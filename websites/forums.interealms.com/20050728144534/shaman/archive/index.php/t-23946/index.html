<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Congrats to Soram, Aruman and Quarantine to have finished their epics first (I do only think that it's fair to recognize at least these three who all had the globe and were awaiting the fix for the final turn in).  Special thanks to Aruman who discovered most of quest by himself with some outside help from a few members.  Last, a thanks to Kinadorm who was the first one to figure out what the missing part of the epic was that led to us finally finishing it.<br />

Epic 2.0 Start - Text continues from when you receive your Crafted Talisman of Fates <br />
<br />
Part I <br />
<br />
North Freeport     <br />
<br />
Elder Spirit of Enlightenment says 'We, the spirits, have chosen to grant you a gift for all that you've done for us and what you still have left to do. It is just a sampling of the power you may obtain one day as you move forward as one of the heyokah. Guard it and use it well. Should you choose to continue your journey, tell me that you are [prepared to carry on] and save the spirits.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'I am prepared to carry on'<br />
<br />
Elder Spirit of Enlightenment says 'I knew we could count on you, Haldail. The time for Ruchu is drawing ever nearer, but we still must gather some essential elements. Soon, you will have to cross the barrier into that realm of Discord. Lupot Nukla can help you.'<br />
<br />
Fungus Grove     <br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Lupot Nukla'<br />
<br />
Lupot Nukla says 'Welcome back. I received word that you were ready to continue the journey. Word travels fast when we have brave spirits like you on our side. As we proceed, our tasks become more difficult. We feel you are ready to take on the charge of aiding the spirits we've lost. We must recover some items that were [taken by force].'<br />
<br />
You say, 'taken by force'<br />
<br />
Lupot Nukla says 'Over in Taelosia, the peaceful folk there found themselves overcome by the Muramites. They had stolen much of what had meaning to them. If you can track down Undari Perunea she can tell you how to find a sacred necklace of perseverance that was created by her own people, though Norrath's spirits did charm it. You will find Undari near the temples, hiding, and waiting for you. Return the talisman to me.'<br />
<br />
Kod'taz     <br />
<br />
Undari is in Kodtaz on the way to Yxtta before the FD monk who gives first one group Ikkinz trial, Gazzak on the map.<br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Undari Perunea'<br />
<br />
Undari Perunea says 'Are you here to help me? Yes, I feel the intent of your spirit. You must be careful, the evil beast that stole my necklace is ever near.'<br />
<br />
Ikaav Spiritstealer spawns south of Undari Perunea, within sight; cons yellow to L69, snake female model, doesn't see invis. Potentially slowable, but hard to land; max hit under 1k; AE DoT is poison curable.<br />
<br />
Loot:  Necklace of Perserverence<br />
<br />
Fungus Grove     <br />
<br />
Turn in Talisman to Lupot Nukla<br />
<br />
Lupot Nukla says 'You have traveled far, my friend. This necklace is more powerful than those foolish Muramites knew. Undari has been holding a key to the spirit world around her neck for many years. How do you think she remained [protected] near those temples and beasts?'<br />
<br />
You say, 'protected?'<br />
<br />
Lupot Nukla says 'When Undari was a young, peaceful Taelosian, she chose to defy the trusik -- the religious fanatics -- who called for the hurt and torture of her people. You see, once, all Taelosians lived in Nihilia, but something changed. One sly and corrupt Taelosian found a path to power and preached about a false god. He convinced many to follow him and they became the [trusik] who worshipped Trushar, an ocean god. They would torture those who didn't believe as they did.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'trusik?'<br />
<br />
Lupot Nukla says 'The trusik were eventually forced into exile in the temples of the highest mountains. The Taelosians who resisted the beliefs and rhetoric of the trusik became known as the nihil -- and Undari was one of them. She believed in nature, the ebb and flow of a greater consciousness, and that if she kept her hopes high, she would overcome the horror of the zealots. And she [prevailed].'<br />
<br />
You say, 'prevailed?'<br />
<br />
Lupot Nukla says 'Undari's unwavering regard and respect for nature gained the attention of the spirit world, particularly that of the Spirit of Perseverance. The spirit would watch over her and time after time would [see] her bring more of her kind into spiritual awareness.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'see?'<br />
<br />
Lupot Nukla says 'The spirit saw that Undari always wore a beautiful necklace made of polished stone that her mother gave her. Her mother was taken by the trusik long ago because she refused to accept Trushar into her heart. She was taken down to the shores of Natimbi and shackled, sentenced to hang over the sea until she died. It was then that the spirit chose to bestow a [great gift] on Undari, as thanks and reward for her steadfast faith in the spirit world.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'what great gift?'<br />
<br />
Lupot Nukla says 'The spirit appeared before Undari, who was overcome with humility. The spirit cast a mighty spell and it rained upon Undari and was imbued into her necklace. The necklace would henceforth protect the young Undari from those who held dark beliefs and would try to corrupt her mind. Now you see why we had need of this necklace. But we are not done yet. We still need to make a [talisman]. '<br />
<br />
You say, 'what talisman?'<br />
<br />
Lupot Nukla says 'Yes, we need to complete a talisman to perform the Ruchu and it is up to us to finish this part of the task. We need a particular type of wood and it is rather unusual. You shall only find this material in an ethereal plane where the woods are imbued with spirits. I am counting on you to hunt down a sample of this wood and show it to me when you've acquired it.'<br />
<br />
Plane of Storms <br />
<br />
Go to loc 2057, -1301.  You are looking for a tree near the zoneline that you can target but doesn't have a name.  If he is up and you are at this point of the quest, a Darkened Chanting Woodspirit will spawn.  The unnamed tree spawns at random times throughout the day, but when he's up, he'll be up for approx. 10 game hours.  There doesn't appear to be any set spawn timer on him, he can be go early and/or leave extremely late.  Take this time for granted and just be there and he will eventually spawn).<br />
<br />
If you are at this point of the epic, you will be attacked by the named tree and the adds.  I suggest if you are and see the tree up in the distance, be ready for him first before coming closer.  You can trigger him while still invis, although he will not agro.  If he is triggered and is not agroed, he will despawn in approx 2 min (yes, it happened to me).  When he despawns, the adds will stay up but the named won't.  The named can be seperated from the adds with a bard or monk.<br />
<br />
Darkened Chanting Woodspirit hits for up to 1500 and casts Branch Whirl. Six adds, &quot;A woodspirit vineguard&quot; will spawn; they hit for up to 600, and cast Decaying Foliage.<br />
<br />
Loot:  Piece of Moaning Timber (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=57403) <br />
<br />
Fungus Grove <br />
<br />
Give: Piece of Moaning Timber to Lupot Nukla<br />
<br />
Lupot Nukla says 'Welcome back. I received word that you were ready to continue the journey. Word travels fast when we have brave spirits like you on our side. As we proceed, our tasks become more difficult. We feel you are ready to take on the charge of aiding the spirits we've lost. We must recover some items that were [taken by force].'<br />
<br />
Lupot Nukla says 'You have done well, Valsuvious.  We are drawing nearer to being fully prepared for the Ruchu. I've put the bark and the necklace into this satchel that is protected by a spell. The only one who may open it is the Spirit of Enlightenment. Go and give that to it.'<br />
<br />
Receive: Impervious Medicine Bag (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=57551) <br />
<br />
<br />
Part II <br />
<br />
North Freeport <br />
<br />
Give:  Impervious Medicine Bag to Elder Spirit<br />
<br />
Elder Spirit of Enlightenment says 'You never cease to surprise me. I felt in my heart that you would get this far, but I did not expect you to be so bold and steady with your advance. Can you feel the spirits smiling on you?' The spirit lifts its weary head and closes its eyes . . . Yes, yes, they are pleased, but they are weak just as I am. And now the path grows dark and dreary. We must ask you to once again to risk your life, but not in this world, but the world of [Discord]. '<br />
<br />
You say, 'Discord?'<br />
<br />
Elder Spirit of Enlightenment says 'We know the Spirit of Might is beginning to disperse not just in Norrath, but that place shadowed by Discord as well. The spirit has passed through many beasts and is corrupting them, each one commanded by a trace of the spirit. You must find several beasts and find those traces of the wasichu. One is an airy, fluid creature. Yet another is a fierce beast that has grown beyond all normal proportions because of the spirit of Might. You must find them. And there are still others you must [seek].'<br />
<br />
You say, 'Seek?'<br />
<br />
Elder Spirit of Enlightenment says 'The other creature you must find is a soldier of evil. Another is an scurrying creature that is not bound to our realm. You have much ahead of you. Take this pouch and carefully piece together everything you find and return it to me. You will know how to do it. The spirits will guide you.'<br />
<br />
Receive: Pouch of Spirit Dust (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=57710) <br />
<br />
Noble's Causeway <br />
<br />
Find Kupiop Iku (1808, -469) and hail him.  Say &quot;ready&quot; and he will spawn Murkglider School Leader (note: can respawn him whenever the frog is up).<br />
<br />
Kill triggered version of Murkglider School Leader (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=16081) <br />

Loot:  Slight Trace of a Spirit (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=57800) <br />
<br />
Ruined City of Dranik <br />
<br />
Kill Bloated Girplan (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=16226).  He's located in the east caves before the Zun'Muram Volkana at loc 126, -1767.  He has his own room, and if he's not up, then kill the mobs in the room and he'll respawn eventually in there (after many many respawns of the mobs, just keep killing them all until eventually he spawns).  Chest should spawn afterwords and have Quarm quality loot in it.  He has a pretty tough mana drain AE, but it's easily cured by Blood of Nadox.  Requires about two qvic geared groups with bard..<br />
<br />
Loot:  Reviving Potion of Might (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=57315) <br />
<br />
Muramite Proving Grounds <br />
<br />
Walk up to Distilled Lightning Warrior (he is in between RS and the Projection of Realms.  He's a big unhittable Lightning guy against a wall in a corner.  It will not matter if you are invis or not, it will still trigger it when you get close enough (btw.. I don't know yet if you have to be a certain distance away.  I'm pretty positive that you can sneak by him without him triggering, as long as you don't get close to him.  When I was invis the second time I went past this area, he still agroed to me, but I was standing on top of him to see if it would trigger him:<br />

Biggest hit on me from the named was about 980.  Biggest hit from the adds was about 569, although they rampage a lot.  They were all fairly resistant, but the two adds are mezzable.<br />

Receive: Glowing Spirit Charm of Might (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=57987) <br />
<br />
<br />
Part III <br />
<br />
North Freeport <br />
<br />
Give: Glowing Spirit Charm of Might (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=57987) to the Elder Spirit of Enlightenment.<br />
<br />
Elder Spirit of Enlightenment says 'The time is nearly here! We have only a few remaining pieces that we must collect in order to restore our spirits. We did miss something, however, and it must be stopped. You must gather your allies and return to Discord. A wasichu has learned to summon the fiercest beasts and has grown out of control. It is now a [spiritcaller] who is drawing the strength of our most precious elders to do it.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'what spiritcaller'<br />
<br />
Elder Spirit of Enlightenment says 'The fiend that is consuming our spirits is in Discord and is siphoning what little energy and strength we have remaining. We are losing ourselves in the passage of Discord. Without the spirits of Might, Patience, and Wisdom, we may not [survive]. We are not whole without them. '<br />
<br />
You say, 'how can you survive'<br />
<br />
Elder Spirit of Enlightenment says 'Make your way to a place of great suffering and death in Kuua. You will need to investigate to help us learn more about our waning spirits. We have no influence there and it is a wholly unpredictable place.'<br />
<br />
Walls of Slaughter   <br />
<br />
Find Hudar Tritton.  He's located in the ruins between the Wall and the entrance to NC, at loc -889, 150.  To talk to him safely, you will have to pull and kill the mob behind him.<br />
<br />
You say, Hudar Tritton<br />
<br />
Hudar Tritton looks from side to side before speaking. 'Tell me, what is your business? You here about the [caller]?'<br />
<br />
You say, 'what caller'<br />
<br />
Hudar Tritton says 'The dark spiritcaller. The one that is upsetting the balance of things here. I should not be speaking to your kind. It will put me in great danger. In that fortress, you will find a creature that is able to call spirits to its aid. It may look harmless at first, but do not be [fooled].'<br />
<br />
You say, 'fooled'<br />
<br />
Hudar Tritton says 'You will need to be very patient and brave to overcome this beast. You will find it this very moment if you make haste. I must leave soon so you must best this creature alone.'<br />
<br />
This spawns &quot;Discordling Spiritcaller&quot; who drops Spiritcaller Beads  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=57404).  He spawns on top of the wall, in the NW section of it, just past the area with Pyrique and East of the Girplan.  He spawns with two guard Ferans, all of who do not see invis.  Requires at least 5-6 Qvic geared groups<br />
<br />
North Freeport      <br />
<br />
Give: The spiritcaller beads to the Elder Spirit:<br />
<br />
Elder Spirit of Enlightenment says 'There is one last thing you must do. Your defeat of the spiritcaller has proven your strength and I believe you are ready. Do not fail us now. You must go into the lair of Mata Muram himself. There is a strange orb that only exists there. We believe some of our spirits, beyond those we shall restore with Ruchu, are becoming absorbed or attracted to these orbs. You must find one and bring it to me and then we shall have all we need.'<br />
<br />
Citidel of Anguish <br />
<br />
Loot: Globe of Discordant Energy (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47100) from the Warden Hanvar, Jelvan or Arch Magus events.<br />
<br />
North Freeport <br />
<br />
Give: Globe of Discordant Energy to Elder Spirit<br />
<br />
Elder Spirit of Enlightenment lowers its head and you believe you see a shade of a tear drop from its eyes and disappear into nothingness. 'You have done it. You cannot imagine our gratitude. The time for Ruchu is at hand and we offer you the privilege of taking part. If you are able to do the ceremony now, tell me you are [prepared for the ceremony].'<br />
<br />
You say, 'prepared for the ceremony'<br />
<br />
Elder Spirit of Enlightenment says 'Follow me closely. We must gather the spirits and try to call our ethereal kin of Might, Patience, and Wisdom. The other spirits will join us for Ruchu, namely the Spirit of Perseverance, Spirit of Understanding, Spirit of Fortitude, Spirit of Will, and the Spirit of Sense.'<br />
<br />
Elder Spirit of Enlightenment says 'It is time to begin the Ruchu. Collect your strength and let us begin.'<br />
<br />
You recognize that the spirits hold items you've retrieved -- crafted totems, the necklace, beads.<br />
<br />
The spirits all howl, creating a resonance that shakes the ground around you.<br />
<br />
Elder Spirit of Perseverance says 'The spirits and heyokah call upon the greatness of Might. Turn your back on the way of the wasichu and return your steadfast spirit to us all.'<br />
<br />
Elder Spirit of Enlightenment says 'We bring the sum of our strength to you, our Spirit of Wisdom. Hear our call and draw from our offerings of strength. We need you if we are to ever overcome the evil presence that seeps into our consciousness.'<br />
<br />
Elder Spirit of Understanding says 'Let our collective voice reach the failing strength of the Spirit of Patience who has lost its way among the dismal influences of Discord. Do not give in and bring the strength of your spirit back to us who live on minds and winds.'<br />
<br />
The spirits begin to chant in unison in a language no Norrathian understands, but you only hear it in your mind. 'Ruchu immana kiratu. Ruchu immana kiratu.'<br />
<br />
As the magic fades, the Spirit of Wisdom lies inside the circle, dazed and confused.<br />
<br />
The spirits continue to chant.<br />
<br />
This time, the Spirit of Patience appears from the ether, looking tired, but bright-eyed.<br />
<br />
Elder Spirit of Wisdom says 'I am truly here. I have truly made it back to my home and those I respect most. I understand I have you to thank, dear heyokah. A thousand blessings upon you.'<br />
<br />
The chanting of the spirits grow louder, their furry brows furrowed as they focus, trying to call the Spirit of Might out of the shadows of Discord.<br />
<br />
Magic sparks out of the air, revealing nothing. The chanting still echoes in your mind.<br />
<br />
The Spirit of Might appears and disappears, enable to keep a hold in this realm. You hear: 'It has its grip on me. You must let me go.&quot;<br />
<br />
The spirits respond by chanting louder. The rattling of talisman beads fills the air.<br />
<br />
Finally, the Spirit of Might appears, its essence is faded and it is so weak it barely keeps a hold on its own existence.<br />
<br />
The spirits slow their chanting and then there is silence.<br />
<br />
Elder Spirit of Might says 'How can you forgive me? I turned on you and I do remember trying to harm the very one you asked to save me. That shaman risked all to take part in saving me.'<br />
<br />
Elder Spirit of Enlightenment says 'You are not to blame. The voice of Discord is becoming deafening in Norrath. This heyokah has done right by all of us and should be suitably rewarded.' The spirits all nod in thanks as they prepare to quickly take the returned spirits back to their ethereal existence to strengthen them.'<br />
<br />
Elder Spirit of Enlightenment says 'Come to me shaman and state to me that you are, indeed, a [faithful heyokah].'<br />
<br />
You say, 'i am a faithful heyokah'<br />
<br />
Elder Spirit of Enlightenment says 'Well, then, the time has come. Give me your Crafted Talisman of Fates, heyokah. Should you not have it now, give it to me when you do. If you have lost it, tell me so. I may be able to help you.'<br />
<br />
Give: Crafted Talisman of Fates (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=57400) <br />
<br />
Elder Spirit of Enlightenment says 'You have heard the stories of the blessings bestowed on some of Norrath's most faithful to the ways of the heyokah. To reward you for all that you've done, the spirits have chosen to bless this talisman and offer it to you as our thanks, for without you, all shaman would have suffered without our presence in this realm. Walk proud, heyokah, and never forget what you are.' All around you, you feel the strength of the spirit world begin to strengthen as the spirit leaves to tend to his wounded companions.'<br />

After talking to Aruman, I'm guessing there are 8 vineguards and 1 named.  Assume that it will need at least two people for CC (assuming they can be mezzed) and possibly up 2 - 3 groups depending on how many hps the named have and if you can mezz them.<br />

The unnamed tree has a respawn/despawn timer.  I'm figuring it out right now, but he respawned at exactly 3am just now.</div></div><hr />

All of the other text looked the same though.<br />
<br />
Info about the KT mob, has an AE Ikaav Venom, same as that Ikaav in Tacvi which is a melee slow.  Has pretty low HP 100k I would guess.  Partial slowable.  Don't remmeber max hit but it wasn't that bad.  Pretty easy for 2 well geared groups.</div></div><hr />

There is a Named Bazu in Nobles Causeway, friend told me about him while he was there soloing one day, it Summoned and hit he said on average of 2-3k, Bazu's are certainly giant by any standard and hitting as hard as he does makes me think he might possibly be for an epic and not just random mob__532 that drops Rune/loot yatta yatta.. just a guess at  the moment since i dont have 1.5 done yet but something to think about for those of you that do have it done  :D</div></div><hr />

Sounds like a murkglider to me, not sure which one off hand, I'm going through illia atm trying to find possible mobs.  But my reasoning is, it's &quot;airy&quot; ie it flys/floats and it's a fluid creature in that it's a jellyfish in essence.<br />
<br />
*Edit* My best guess so far is Withering Murkglider (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=16356)  the named murk in WoS would have been except it doesn't have a no drop quest type item on it's loot table from what I'm reading, just normal loot.

Also, what mob did you kill in Nobles?<br />

Are you at that point of the epic... cause it won't spawn if you aren't.  I'm pretty positive that the Stilled Lightning Warrior when you go near it (just like the PoStorms part) will despawn and respawn as the spiritseeker when you get near it</div></div><hr />

If these are creatures in discord, I can only think of three: ukuns, ferans and the rats.  Stonemites would be a good guess, but I haven't seen any in OoW zones.  There's an Alpha Feran in Causeway.  Maybe he transforms also.<br />

Ah your right, I went back and tried it again and he spawned this time.  Not sure why he didn't spawn last time.  I had all the steps up to him done.  Maybe he is timed or someone had done it before I arrived.  Anyway it worked this time and Stilled Lightning Warrior is the correct trigger.<br />

<br />
1) You absolutely need a bard. The AE is a 3500 or 4k DD with an attached dot. Even with Talisman of the Tribunal we didnt resist one hit. Cannot resist with 345 PR.<br />
<br />
2) It does not slow easy (as stated, I know) but I figured I would be the one chain mezzed/stunned whatever. This was not the case: I died shortly after pulling with malos.<br />
<br />
3) You need more than a group. I dont know if you can resist the AE with a bard but even if you can you probably need an extra tank just in case your main tank gets mezzed.<br />
<br />
4) She doesnt hit that hard in actual damage output, the focus on this is to be prepared for the AE.<br />

We cleared those 2 caves of everything (I wasn't puller so not sure what is in there) and then spawned the druid mob.  Killed the Ruined Earthshaker then set up for Beastlord mob.  Killed Discordling Dark Animist and his pets.<br />

While we were recovering, looting the chest and generally getting ready to port out the Bloated Girplan popped in the room and proceeded to squish us.  Think of Sauron at the very beginning of LotR where bodies are flying everywhere.<br />

Hits max 1240 or so, can be slowed but tough, necros can use mind wrack and other similar line buffs as long as they actually have mana (the AE drains mana @ 400 mana/tic).<br />

I have done the BL Epic twice and each time we were to the RCoD Portion in the Cave Bloated Girplan spawned when we cleared (so I assume we killed a Trigger or PH).  The 1st Time we had a raid force of about 25 (Time Geared) and were completely caught off guard.  We did Kill him, but he was definitely not a one group able or even two group able MoB.  The Mana Drain is the worst part of the fight (although I did not try Nadox to cure it) if you can avoid it he is trivial..

No, the other three that he specifically talks about are in NC, PG and RCoD.  That kinda lead me to believe it's in a) Riftseekers Sanctum, b) WoS, c) Citadel of Anguish, or even possibly DS, HS or BF.  I'm guessing though that every class will have something in Anguish to get, and that leads me to believe that it's still in Anguish.  Personally, if you consider how many fights and things you have to do for 1.5 epics, I think that it puts us in line maybe to find the final fight in Anguish, do the combine and then prob have one more fight after that somewhere.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">Okay, let's take another look at this...<br />
<br />
One is an airy, fluid creature. <br />
- Murkglider School Leader, NC<br />
<br />
Yet another is a fierce beast that has grown beyond all normal proportions because of the spirit of Might. <br />
- Bloated Girplan, RCoD<br />
<br />
The other creature you must find is a soldier of evil. <br />
- Stilled Lightning Warrior, MPG<br />
<br />
Another is an scurrying creature that is not bound to our realm.<br />
- this would seem to imply either a Planar mob or some sort of a wraith<br />
- but the mob also scurries...<br />
<br />
What Planes have we been to so far? Fear (1.0), Valor, Disease (1.5 without 1.0), Justice, Decay (1.5), and Storms (2.0).<br />
<br />
That's well and good, but what zones have we had to fight in for 2.0 so far? Kod'Taz, Storms, Noble's Causeway, Ruined City of Dranik, and Muramite Proving Grounds. <br />
<br />
So I'm guessing that they aren't going to send us back to Innovation or Nightmare after that. And I don't recall the other Altered Planes having anything scurrying, although I never did Mischief very much. And I don't recall anything like this in BoT, HoH, or Tactics; are there scurrying mobs in the Tower of Solusek Ro? This would leave us Torment (very likely IMO) or possibly SolRo (or above).</div></div><hr />

No, part of the paladin 1.5 requires a raid in Vxed.  It is definatly a raid encounter, and we did with 15 people in the same instanced zone.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u113"><b>Gnorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p113">I will definitely agree, the scurrying creature is going to be in an OoW zone, most likely triggered.  Since the other 3 are in RCoD, NC, and MPG, that leaves a few non-instanced OoW zones: Dranikscar, WoS, Riftseekers, Harbringer's, and Bloodfields (and CoA, but that's keyed..).  Since the other 3 aren't in instanced zones and are instead *triggered*, I would assume the mob would be in one of these 5 zones.<br />
<br />
Another idea to consider is that the other 3 mobs for this part are all new OoW models: Girplan, Murkglider, and Lightning dude.  So it's scurrying... what is a new OoW model that &quot;scurries?&quot;  Not chimeras, not bazu, not dragorns, not pyrilens, not bats... that leaves possibly ferans, but most likely the new rat models.  Ukuns aren't new models because they are from GoD (still a possibility tho).  Ferans are found in WoS, and rats are in Dranik Hollows.  However, Hollows brings us back to instanced mobs...<br />
<br />
There's not much info on Sewers of Dranik in Allakhazam's, so there's another place it could possibly be.  But so far I'm betting it will be in WoS, or DH or SD!</div></div><hr />

I will spend some time in SD over next couple days and will see if I can find anything. So far 2 instances (I am 68) with very different layouts. One is principally stone/nok mobs. Other (which I only had for an hour) was far more diverse with snakes, noks, ukun, etc. so its likely a better bet for a scurrying mob. Its also far harder cause you have more see invis and placate often doesnt help cause the mobs are so stacked that unless u are FD pulling you cant single pull (in many a triple is the result of what otherwise in OoW might be a decent single/double pull). It also has stairs, etc. that can limit LoS for arrow type pulling (I pull with a ranger or warrior usually as the mobs hitting somewhat hard and fast, at least for a 6box).<br />
<br />
For those who want to test this themselves the diverse (and likely)scenario has water on the floor (doesnt hinder movement) and has roamers and far more see invis. The other (easier) opens to a huge room with stone models all around ya. Mostly blue/white con at 68.<br />

Wall of Slaughter doesn't seem likely either unless the mob is in one of the tunnels.  Harbringers has a bunch of small rooms and winding steps in it so it is possible I overlooked the mob but I didn't see any trigger mob in there either.  So that leaves Riftseekers or an instanced zone as the location of the mob in my opinion.<br />

You are referring to the pile of rocks, which if you hit U while looking/clicking at it while transport you to the cave in Bloodfields.  Near that is a named Girplan.  Now, I have no clue what he's for.  When I killed him nothing happened, but I think it was Aruman that killed him he emoted something about being somewhere else in the zone.  Honestly, i really have no clue what he's for, unless someone has figured it out in the last few weeks.</div></div><hr />

I figure the last step will be the piece from anguish, maybe even off mata muram himself, so unless we are already at the last step I don't think it is an anguish mob.<br />

If the mob is in game then it has to have an obscure PH somewhere that nobody is killing or is in an instanced zone that nobody is exploring.  With the mob density in the instance zones nobody really wants to do them except for signets so its possible it is some rat sitting in a corner never to be found.

There is a different girplan called &quot;A Reclusive Girplan&quot; that when you kill it gives an emote about a mob coming out of his cave.

First, in Storms, you can 1 group that encounter if you have a good monk with you.  Set up way past the tree in the corner by the mage epic mob.  Have your shaman just SoW up and run right through the tree and back to camp.  Takes the trees a second or so to target and aggro and you are long gone by that.  The named runs faster than the adds and a good monk can split him out solo and bring him to camp.  Hits 1500ish and has a 6 second stun that kind of blows, but we did it with one group of Tacvi geared folks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u160"><b>Bendami</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p160">Came across this in Allakhazam's and was curious if anyone has any experience with this &quot;second&quot; spawned mob?<br />
<br />
Taskmaster Yarln (Discordling type mob) in Harbinger's Spire<br />
<br />
&quot;Killed him with a 67 monk and 66 shaman.  Fight itself was easy. Fully magic slowable, though he did resist the first cast, second one landed. After slowed, he occasionally hit in the 600's but mostly around 400 and not often. <br />
<br />
Tough part about the fight is the curse he casts on you. Make sure you kill him before the curse drains your healer/casters' mana, and to have a remove curse spell ready after the fight. My shaman was in a canni/quiescence frenzy the whole time trying to keep enough mana to heal, but in the end it worked. Dropped a nice little caster range item with Minor Improved Damage 4, 10 wis/int, 55 HP/Mana, and some other stats I can't think of at the moment. I heard a rumor that after he is dead, another named spawns in the hallway before his room (where you kill him) and will wipe you. I don't know if this is true, since I gated right away to go find a cure for my curse.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Like I said, this quest is indeed working and the npcs are in and functioning.  However, I can only watch you agonize over this for so long. :)  I want you to have fun with this, not get stuck.<br />
 <br />
Because the clue is a bit nebulous and may have required too much interpretation on your part (though most have interpreted far more than I would have imaginedjust not in the right way), I'm going to give you a minor hint in advance of a more obvious text update.<br />
 <br />
Here it is...<br />
<br />
The creature is the same and it has always been scurrying about. However, when it is found, the insightful shaman will notice something that sets this creature apart from others affected by the spirit and how these differences may affect this part of the quest.<br />
<br />
The text will updated in the next patch and provide a bit more detail so it is fair for those who may not read the boards.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u164"><b>Kinadorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p164">The creature is the same and it has always been scurrying about.

<br />
<br />
Ok so it is a creature that has always been scurrying about so that probably means no trigger or PH but a normal mob that is wandering around.  It has some characteristic that is the opposite of the other 3 mobs so maybe he is really small since the other 3 were really big mobs.  I am thinking maybe it is a rare drop off the normal rats in Dranik Scar.  I'm not sure what the last part means when it says how these differences will effect the quest but since we have a 6-slot bag maybe it will take 3 of the drops from the 4th mob to do the combine.<br />
<br />
Anyway thats my take on the new info.  I'm probably wrong since the other 3 mobs were a lot harder than a rat in Dranik Scar but that is the first thing that came to mind.  They also don't really fit the &quot;not bound to our realm&quot; part of the first clue.</div></div><hr />

3. Fun Event in Dranik's Scar <br />
Rashere told a bunch of us about a super cool event in Dranik's Scar. There is a named murkglider that spawns as a tiny little guy and he wanders around the zone. If he isn't killed, he gets hungry and eats things and gets bigger. The bigger he gets, his level and loot table changes until he ends up a raid group (3 groups, suitable for DS). Rashere says he turns GINORMOUS which I think is totally hilarious.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u169"><b>Ryam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p169">I hope that this is not the mob needed for the epic (unless the drop comes from the earlier stages of it). Imagine having to wait for the mob to grow big enough to have the epic drop, while hoping it will not be killed off prematurely by someone for a semi-nice drop from the earlier version of the mob, or by a curious player passing through the zone. Waiting for a mob to pop is one thing, but waiting for an existing mob to get bigger is even more nasty, you can't really do anything if someone else wants to kill it before changes form.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Problem is that the PoS mob has no exact set spawn/respawn timer.  I am still not past him yet, although one time I did have a full three groups there ready to kill him, but we waited until 7am and he still hadn't spawned yet so we had to leave for raids.<br />
<br />
So, his timer varies.  The timer that I mentioned was something that I found the very first day when Aruman and I were talking looking around PoS and discovered him by accident.</div></div><hr />

There is an instanced zone entry in one of the wings of the Scar castle with the bloodfields zone.

I am pretty sure when the other classes had to go to instance zones the name of the zone was identified or at least hinted at.  It would have been a lot more helpful to give a clue that helps identify the zone rather than the mob characteristics.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u189"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p189">Had a look at it this evening with my warrior and shaman. At the cave instances, both toons got the &quot;The way is blocked. Perhaps you would be able to enter if you had a reason to come here&quot; message. When I went over to the instanced zone in near the bloodfields zone line, and clicked on it, Mok got that message again, but my warrior (Yella) got a different message. Something along the lines of &quot;your skills and bravery are not required in this area, but they are needed somewhere else&quot;. <br />
<br />
Edit: just realized that the second message is the one you get if you have an instance running (you get it in IK trials if you go down the wrong tunnel). Since Yella was just comming back from Uqua, that is probably the reason. Odd that the caves didnt give that message though. It still suggests that the one near the bloodfields zone line is different though.</div></div><hr />

What if the DN Phase spider drop is the mob refered to - Certainly fits the description. I know it did not combine as that was tried and isnt from Discord. However the Bag is 6 slot and The Elder Spirit does seem to hint at there being more to the combine and that the Spirits will assist - or something like that.<br />

I took her post to mean that the text will be updated with an obvious hint in the next patch.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u210"><b>Kinadorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p210">In quotes is the relevant information we have about the 4th mob followed by my notes.<br />
<br />
We must ask you to once again to risk your life, but not in this world, but the world of Discord. <br />
 <br />
This part means all 4 mobs are in OoW.  It could mean GoD too but GoD is part of Norrath so wouldn't fit the &quot;but not in this world&quot; part.<br />
<br />
Another is an scurrying creature that is not bound to our realm.<br />
<br />
This part is the main clue.  A scurrying creature in OoW is probably going to be either a Discordling, Feran, or Rat model.  I'm not sure what the &quot;not bound to our realm&quot; part means.  It could mean an instanced zone but in-game those are just a normal part of the world and not separate realms.  All of the OoW zones are in the &quot;Realm of Discord&quot; so this phrase probably describes a characteristic of the mob and not the zone (i.e. it warps around or something).  I can't think of any OoW mob that does this.  At first I thought of a phase spider but those aren't in OoW and the new potion item (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=57562) they drop doesn't work for the combine.  <br />
<br />
The creature is the same and it has always been scurrying about. However, when it is found, the insightful shaman will notice something that sets this creature apart from others affected by the spirit and how these differences may affect this part of the quest.<br />
<br />
This is the new teaser clue.  This makes it sound like a normal spawn mob that doesn't require a trigger or PH so you would think someone would have run across it by now.  I don't really know what to say about this since I have searched and killed just about everything in OoW that I can think of and haven't found the mob/drop.  The rest of the clue means the 4th mob is different from the other 3 mobs in some way.  Most likely in size since that is about the only thing I can think the other 3 mobs had in common.  How that affects the quest is pretty open ended till we find the mob but most likely if it is an easy mob it will require multiple drops or be a rare drop.<br />
 <br />
You will know how to do it. The spirits will guide you.<br />
 <br />
The last part could just be flavor text or it could have some meaning.  If it has meaning then we will have some sort of sub-combine to make that a spirit will probably tell us about.  I think it is just flavor text though so nothing to worry about.</div></div><hr />

I have tried using 1, 2, and 3 of the Spirit-Touched Phased Spider Thorax for the combine and no luck.  I also tried various combines with the other 3 potions and 1-3 of the Spirit-Touched Phased Spider Thorax in case it is a sub-combine and nothing worked.  None of the NPC's in the quest will accept the Thorax if you hand it to them either.  <br />
<br />
Wunshi in Shadeweaver Thicket doesn't provide any new information when hailed and asked about the &quot;Spirit of Might&quot; but she isn't really a spirit.  None of the mobs we have used so far are spirits except the Elder Spirit of Enlightenment and the Eternal Spirit in PoSky.  Neither of those seem likely for giving details of a sub-combine.<br />
<br />
The first bag in Epic 1.5 was also 6-slots but we never had to combine 6 items in it so the number of slots might not matter.  Most likely it will be just 4 items to combine once we find the final mob.</div></div><hr />

Came across this in Allakhazam's and was curious if anyone has any experience with this &quot;second&quot; spawned mob?<br />
<br />
Taskmaster Yarln (Discordling type mob) in Harbinger's Spire<br />
<br />
&quot;Killed him with a 67 monk and 66 shaman. Fight itself was easy. Fully magic slowable, though he did resist the first cast, second one landed. After slowed, he occasionally hit in the 600's but mostly around 400 and not often. <br />
<br />
Tough part about the fight is the curse he casts on you. Make sure you kill him before the curse drains your healer/casters' mana, and to have a remove curse spell ready after the fight. My shaman was in a canni/quiescence frenzy the whole time trying to keep enough mana to heal, but in the end it worked. Dropped a nice little caster range item with Minor Improved Damage 4, 10 wis/int, 55 HP/Mana, and some other stats I can't think of at the moment. I heard a rumor that after he is dead, another named spawns in the hallway before his room (where you kill him) and will wipe you. I don't know if this is true, since I gated right away to go find a cure for my curse.&quot;</div></div><hr />

i think implies our realm of being as in  'the living' or our plane of reality which would be 'another plane'.... just a shot in the dark but i'm gonna go and look around in plane of hate.. that fits in the the non-living pretty well with a lot of undead and it's also not in our realm of being.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u223"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p223">The first thing that came to mind upon reading the text for the &quot;scurry&quot; mob... &quot;Rats Of Unusual Size&quot;.<br />
<br />
Oh well.<br />
What do we know now?<br />
The text can be boiled down to:<br />
<br />
The Elder Spirit of Enlightenment in North Freeport tells us, &quot;We must ask you to once again to risk your life, but not in this world, but the world of [Discord].&quot;<br />
<br />
And then it lists the corrupted beasts.  <br />
We are left with the final beast to find, &quot;an (sic.) scurrying creature that is not bound to our realm.&quot;<br />
<br />
I think it's safe to say that the beast is in a Omens zone, but the hint &quot;not bound to our realm&quot; could mean many things:<br />
<br />
1.  Flying creature (opinons say unlikely),<br />
2.  Instanced zone,<br />
3.  Behind the gates of agony,<br />
4.  That Durn Portal (in WoS),<br />
5.  Rats, Etherial Killer Rats.  (would say bunnies but that's an old joke now)<br />
<br />
We've also been given the following hint by Vahlar, &quot;The creature is the same and it has always been scurrying about. However, when it is found, the insightful shaman will notice something that sets this creature apart from others affected by the spirit and how these differences may affect this part of the quest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pretty vague but it seems that the key is that is different from the others we've already fought and somehow that difference is critical to the quest.  Perhaps this one isn't a fight at all.  Or maybe, this one isn't grown to humungous size like flying pig, the flying umbrella, and the battery powered ginsu knives?<br />
<br />
Next up, we get the new text with the patch and maybe it will narrow down our field of play a bit.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I did go kill them for a few rounds of spawns once, about 3 weeks to a month ago. No faction hits at all, or at least there weren't before. Nothing I can recall ever dropped.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;SCURRIES&quot;<br />
<br />
Of note: on these rats, most don't see invis, all con dubious to me, there were 2 or 3 that did see invis, which isn't terribly uncommon with undead mobs, I remember murkgliders that were this way in draniks hollows, some saw normal invis, others didn't.  None see IVU.  They are social which makes it slightly more difficult to play around in here solo.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I dunno if we just need to kill them for a rare drop item, if a named will rarely spawn or what but with everything I've gotten from these rats, as compared with the quest info, to me at least this seems like a strong place to concentrate efforts.  I personally still am not to this stage of 2.0 and that might make a difference on drops, mobs spawning etc as we've seen previously.  Gonna keep playing around in here though while I'm bored tonight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As kind of hinted at before by Zazra, it is very possible this isn't something that needs to be killed.  The druid epic required several items obtained by doing something completely different, like giving skeleton miners a break for awhile so they could go play on the beach.  I think it is possible that some npc somewhere might be affected by the spirit but has not succumbed to it, and seeks assistance with &quot;curing&quot; itself.  Once you help it, maybe it will give you the item you need.<br />
<br />
I know it won't be fun, but druids literally hailed every mob in every zone they could find.  I am still amazed they completed their 1.5 to be honest.  Who would hail the stupid skeletons outside Paineel that have been there forever anyway??  It could be something like that, or the indifferent madman, or the coven that only spawns at night, etc.  <br />
<br />
Just trying to throw out some ideas, since most seem to be focused on simply killing something, or hailing then killing it.  Not very helpful I realize now that I read it over, but I'll say it anyway in the hopes someone maybe gets some inspiration out of it.</div></div><hr />

Personally I'm doubtful I'll use the epic 2.0 since I still find clicky slow on TA to handy to bag but I would start working on it for the possibility of spawning chests with some nice loot in them. Since we're a guild farming time and currently working on getting threw qvic the stuff coming from the 2.0 chest is good quality stuff for us.<br />
<br />
Looking back threw the thread I found one mention of a chest spawning from the mirkglider in nobles and from the description of not being able to loot the girplan I suspect it will too but was hoping for confirmation of these facts before I start dragging people around to work on this. So which, if any, steps spawn chests for us?</div></div><hr />

Junk loot off the guy in PoS...tradeable, ep quality garbage.  Been too long since i did KT dude, but think it was the same.<br />

On a side note, I don't think we should obsess on the fact that we have a 6 slot bag to combine stuff in.  For cleric epic 2.0 they get a 10 slot bag to combine 2 pages in, so that's very likely a distraction.</div></div><hr />

Greetings all, Like I said, this quest is indeed working and the npcs are in and functioning. However, I can only watch you agonize over this for so long. I want you to have fun with this, not get stuck. <br />
<br />
Because the clue is a bit nebulous and may have required too much interpretation on your part (though most have interpreted far more than I would have imaginedjust not in the right way), I'm going to give you a minor hint in advance of a more obvious text update. <br />
<br />
Here it is... <br />
The creature is the same and it has always been scurrying about. However, when it is found, the insightful shaman will notice something that sets this creature apart from others affected by the spirit and how these differences may affect this part of the quest. <br />
