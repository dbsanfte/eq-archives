<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Akhasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I thought I'd start a thread talking about some of the less-obvious solo/duo spots for shamans 60+.   I actually enjoy grouping in PoP, but sometimes I just don't have the time, or I just feel like some peaceful, mindless, solo slaughtering.  What I'm looking for are the non-contested, decent, fairly easy solo spots, mostly in the old(er) world.<br />
<br />
I took some time off around the beginning of Luclin, so I really don't know that expansion too well.  Here's what I've found so far:<br />
<br />
Swamp of No Hope - Black Ravengers.  These things are dark blue at 62, and they are soloable..but very tough. They summon, and are at least somewhat MR.  I duoed a couple with my monk, and the exp wasn't great for the risk (took all my mana, but that was mostly keeping the monk healed - should have root/rot more).   I hoped this spot would work out, since they are so plentiful and non-contested.<br />
<br />
Fungus Grove - bugs.  I found these accidentally, and there were alot dark blue at 63.  The problem is, they're social, and its pretty close quarters in there..though I'm sure there are pull spots.  How hard are these things to pull, and once pulled, how hard are they to solo? I think I was seeing mostly nobles and such, a good ways back in the zone.<br />
<br />
These are the only &quot;less obvious&quot; ones I've come up with so far. Here are some more obvious ones:<br />
<br />
Sirens, DN, WW - mostly light blues.  Both easily soloable.  No exp to speak of.  I have done constructs and spiders, but I'd like to try the rats (spiders are LB).  Again, plentiful and fairly safe, just not sure on the exp.<br />
<br />
Chardok - haven't been in since the revamp past the tunnel, and everything there was green or LB. <br />
<br />
Sebilis - haven't been back in a while.  The problem here is that the only stuff that gives exp may be too much of a pain to get to.<br />
<br />
Plane of Growth - went up, everything was dead...might be a decent spot for my goals. <br />
<br />
Kael - haven't tried soloing yet.  <br />
<br />
Cazic Thule - haven't been since revamp.  Might be ok, but I've heard the exp was nerfed.<br />
<br />
Old world City Guards:  Last time I tried them, they were too MR.  I doubt thats changed.<br />
<br />
Anybody have any ideas?  I'm not looking for the next great HHK, just curious as to some fun little quiet spots to make some exp, even if it isn't great.<br />

<br />
EXPs sucks BUT the cash item drop rate more than makes it worth while.<br />
<br />
For me to consider a spot &quot;Solo exp spot&quot; I consider mana consumption/time vs exp gain. With that considered I prefer HoHa for soloing. I can make 6% per kill and I dont use all my mana and the mob is dead before slow wears off.<br />
<br />
I am with you though, sometimes I just want a little &quot;me time&quot;. The annoying group chat of &quot;Haste faded&quot;, &quot;Do you have acumen?&quot;, &quot;Can i get an Agl buff?&quot;, &quot;haste faded again&quot;, &quot;Can i get regen?&quot; and the one I hate the most &quot;Haste faded&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just recently after my gulid fail'd at Vindi (we are young, and not big time raiders). We had moved to Right Arena for CR. Once completed, and every one but me evac'd out, I decided to try and solo a Trooper. Had Alpha'd 61 pet out for help, then malo/slow'd. Took about 5-8 min to kill him, and about 75-80% mana. Mainly used epic dot/pox, and a couple of Spear of Torment DD's. Had full raid buffs (BoA, KEI, BMB, FoSoul, Endurance of Boar). Sadly I don't have Torpor or Canni 5 yet, so only used Tnarg's for healing, and canni IV to keep mana up more. They summon too, so you need to tank them. But otherwise for the mana used, and the time it took, along with only getting 1% exp at 100% AA... it isn't worth it to do Arena IMO. Unless something like Manor or Bank where it could take less mana, and easier kills, not sure what else in Kael could be considered worthy of a shaman solo.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Akhasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The great thing about Kael arena being doable is that my Rl brother has a paladin that could really use that armor...I realize the drops are pretty rare, and even then I'd be hoping for plate, but I guess I could sell MQ for the rest.  I know the arena pretty well, so that might be a cool spot.<br />
<br />
I was actually looking forward to trying growth, but there was a tunare raid or something going down, and I couldn't find any mobs...I'll definately be going back.  If nothing else, I could always use the plat.<br />
<br />
I'm not flagged for HOH yet, but I'm working on it..if nothing else, at least that would be another option.  The group thing was dead on too; I love getting asked for speed when getting beat on by a mob by the tank who can't taunt off of me....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Armor also drops at the bank, although only off the lieutenants.  The problem with this spot is that unless you're there in the dead of the night, you WILL get trained and lose time, mana, Fido, and the 2 weaps you gave him.  Off-peak this is a great spot for CoV faction and the occasional armor drop.  Not much dorf faction here, if that's what you're after.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Here's some of my favorite spots from 60-61<br />
<br />
60: Chardok upper tunnel near gatehouse, first few mobs can be light blue but as you make your way down everything is dark blue and very good xp. Don't waste time at ZO/ZI, mobs there are crap xp. Mobs are nicely spaced out in pairs and all single pullable at 60 in the tunnel. Tunnel goes on forever so no shortage of mobs :)<br />
<br />
61: PooooooooooooooGGG! For money that is, xp is very bad. The problem though is that A LOT of people know about it. If there's not a raid then there's a handful of shaman and necros soloing there and mobs can take several minutes to find due to the 8 hour respawn.<br />
<br />
61: Sebilis, gang or necro camp. Jins and zols are light blue but boks, krups, varying bugs are still dark blue and of course all illis are dark blue. The gangerous camp is not bad, the 4 iksar necromancers and leperous scarab are dark blue and decent xp and occasional gems.<br />
<br />
60/61: Felwithe. If PoG is empty then for easy money do Felwithe guards. The drawback here is the high MR even on green guards so getting malosini/slow to stick can be very streaky. But overall it's pretty easy and all guards drop a sword that sells for 20pp.<br />
<br />
61: PoD. Rats and goos for XP. They hit for 250 but are easily slowed. Takes 4 BoNs if you don't have epic and 1-3 KMs on pet, so kind of long fights but very nice XP especially AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Did PoG early this morning .... one thing you cannot forget... KEEP GATE MEMMED! at all times. I just was swinging in there to check it out, saw a few white horses(light blue to 65) one was a cleric , the other a druid, neither of those gated ... im sitting on some ledge up high and i get jumped by a treant ... Dark blue to me... easily landed Malosinia, and slow, so i let dog dog eat, adding dots... sitting on my horse adding more dots ... getting summoned ... ONLY bad thing about the trees ... i cant stop there gating yet... working on my Virulent Paralysis ... just wandering if that would interrupt there cast of gate long enough for me to land another nuke or two to get the kill?<br />
<br />
Needless to say when it gated ... i called no joy and gated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shizbiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">About 70% or more of the rats in DN are light blue at 63.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">PoG is not an 8 hour spawn, its 24 hours.  One week on the named I believe.  Frikkin ghostown on my server, never enough mobs up to bother setting up camp anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">In plane of justice way back in the creature or prisoner cells there are stairs that go down to a smal block of cells (the very back end of the circle if you know what I mean).  Here spawns a Guardian of Justice, on about a 10 minute spawn timer, enrages, hits for over 200+ but is soloable.  Can sometimes drop a parchment or gem but usually drops nothing.  Get about 2% aa per kill on him.  Oh yeah he summons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Actualy i think your wrong , i think its 12 hour spawn on PoG , possibly 8 , i know its not 24 cause ive killed in the morning early and come home late at night and killed again. THe named i think your incorrect on too , i positive ive done named more then 1 time a week , been so long since i been there i cant remember clearly its patterns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Pog is not a 24 hour respawn nor are named a week long respawn. I've seen Sarik the Fang and the two named horsies twice in a day several times.<br />
<br />
I'm almost positive that PoG is an 8 hour spawn rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The places i go to when i feel like soloing is:<br />
<br />
ps: all of these are root/rot-able<br />
<br />
1) PoS - frogs at forest section <br />
2) Pos - fishes in water behind zi (use sense animal to find them)<br />
3) PoV - small larvae around gy (the large ones arent rootable)<br />
4) PoV - cristalline golems at desert (only problem is watching out for spider adds)<br />
5) PoG - whenever i need money</div></div><hr />
