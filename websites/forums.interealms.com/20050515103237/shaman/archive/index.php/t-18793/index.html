<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Edarb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all,<br />
<br />
I did a search and did not find what I was looking for so I started a new thread.  I am currently halfway through 63 and am currently using our lvl 56 three minute root (Paralyzing Earth).  This seems to break quite a bit.  I was using our 62 one min root (Greater Immobilize) but it seemed to break even quicker so I swithced back.<br />
<br />
I am trying to see what root most of you use and how to use it.  I think I do fine at slowing and debuffing mobs.<br />
<br />
My main play areas ATM are PoV inner camp and BoT any camp right off 4 way.  I usually first cast Malosinia on most mobs and then cast Turgur's.  If we have a multi pull I try to root one mob on inc but it usually breaks or does not hold for very long.  If both have made it into camp I assist MT and cast Malosinia and then Turgers.  I then try to pull other mob with Turgur's.  It usually comes but it seems the MT has taken a bad beating by that time.  Also I then have trouble getting add to root or to hold root.  I find it usually works best if we have a ranger or other puller who tries to kite it then I can get it to root but it still does not seem to hold for long.<br />
<br />
I want to be a great shaman but atm I feel average at best.  I can slow most mobs well but my crowd control abilities just plain stink.  If we have a chanter in the group they mez adds then i go around and slow em.  <br />
<br />
I am not sure if I'm using the right root spell or what the right approach should be.  Should I let all mobs get to camp before Malo line then Slow?  Should I try to root one before it get to camp just to have it break quick?<br />
<br />
I need help with crowd control ways and exact spells to use.  Please remember I am lvl 63.  I do have Canni V and I love it.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I used regular old Root (level 14 spell) until I got ornate pants which have a free one.  Root is a random duration, and you're going to have bad streaks where it won't stay on long, you just have to grin and bear it.  Work on getting the virulent paralysis AA skill, it generally lasts a pretty good length, as well as having a knockback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you're root/nuking, use level 14 Root.<br />
<br />
For root parking, use Greater Immobilise, consider just using level 14 Root if it's breaking too soon. Root is cheap mana and casts faster.<br />
<br />
Buying VP1 is a good idea, it'll give you a root with knockback (basically root park it for you, face the direction you want it to knockback) every 2 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I use the level 14 root almost all the time too.  I've busted out my highest level root one time (and it worked great for that occasions but doesn't seem to be worth it any other time).<br />

*shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ahhh i have been meaning to ask this myself<br />
<br />
what about the 64 root?<br />
<br />
to me the casting time seems to long<br />
<br />
does anyone ever use it?<br />
<br />
am i missing something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We have two major root lines, one that's low resist/fast cast and one that's regular resist/long lasting.  I sometimes use the long lasting root if I'm parking, but more often than not I'll just use the level 14 Root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I ussually keep Greater Immobilize up - fast cast -20 resist mob for the initial park. Once things are under control and mana is good, I'll add a malos and put a Petrifying Earth on the parked mobs depending on how fast stuff is dying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yedak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Root is so underrated for crowd control.<br />
<br />
Sure you wouldn't call a rooter, a &quot;crowd control&quot; character, but it is very useful and can save lives and make things more efficient.<br />
<br />
If I had a dollar for every time I was playing on my melee chars and the group wiped with 4 classes that could root in it that didn't even TRY To get things undercontrol.<br />
<br />
&quot;on me, on me, on me&quot;... but they dont even think to even try to park the thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If I'm root/rotting then I use Petrifying Earth (lvl 64?)  and VP.  <br />
<br />
For any sort of crowd control in a grp I just use lvl 14 root.  Fast casting is much more important than long lasting, IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just a side note: Greater Immobilize lasts a LOT longer on the minis during the Coirnav event than Root or any of the later variants do. I have no idea why, but those break in less than 5 seconds, typically, wereas I've had GI last long enough for the mob to despawn.<br />
<br />
This is the only situation I've ever run in to where GI works that well. I'm wondering if it has something to do with being underwater :lol<br />
<br />
Of course, nobody is damaging those mobs, so don't expect it to work if you melee them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I used to use my level 14 root until I get GI. Then switched to that one due to it hardly ever getting resisted. When I got PE at 64 I tried it once and got killed due to the longer cast time. I later went back to using it realizing how amazing it is for soloing. I'm just too lazy to switch back and forth all the time. lol<br />
<br />
GI would be better than level 14 root IMO for crowd control since you won't get resisted a lot. Mana shouldn't be a problem but if it is for some reason then the Lvl 14 root may be better for ya.<br />
<br />
Best CC root of all is VP3 though. Re-use time sucks though but it'll improve your CC skills incredibly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">In theory, the lvl 62 greater immobilize *is* the best. It has a -30 resist modifier &amp; a fast cast time. Costs a lot of mana compared to normal root though. So it doesn't work out in practice?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">PE is best for root rotting, like GI it has a -30MR resist check but instead of a max 1min duration it lasts up to 3 mins, costs 30 more mana and is about 1 sec longer cast time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I am often puller in LDoN adventures ( normal ones )<br />
and so I often root pull to get singles. So I always use greater immobilize for the resist adjust instead of the root 14. I don't care to spend more mana if I am sure my root will hardly be resisted :D<br />
Never used ( or almost ) Petrifying Earth ( 64 one ) so can't say if it is a good one compared to GI but is just 30 more mana for 2 more minutes. GI works perfect for me anyway since I don't solo and that I don't want mobs to be parked a really long time on LDoN, better for chain pulls :D<br />
Just bought VP on a hard mission, used it twice but already love it ;)<br />
<br />
In your case, I would say cast Greater Immobilize on inc ( when 2 are coming ) so you have better chances to park the mob than using Paralyzing Earth, slow quickly the mob at camp, and then malosinia/slow the parked mob ( even if I would recommend Malosini, 100 less mana, 0.25sec less casting time and almost no slow resist after )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Even before my Ornate legs, I was mostly using GI...  Fast cast and the resist modifier make it the best at saving your butt.  I have VP3 now, and that along with the ornate legs seems to more than cover any parking needs I may have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Root is a random duration<br />
<br />
This is not true at all. Mobs get a chance to break root every tick. As far as anyone knows, the chance to break a root is the same resist check as to apply it in the first place. Our PoP roots are way way better than anything else (even 14 root) because of their -30 resist modifiers. I personally use Petrifying Earth almost exclusively, the duration on Greater Immobilize just doesn't do it for me. Cast time hasn't been an issue so far, but I would like to get ahold of some ornate pants to take the mana out of it.<br />
<br />
Of course, if stuff is getting nuked a lot, all bets are off. No root stands up to that...but hopefully if you are root parking, nobody is nuking your targets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">GI to me always lasts longer then all the rest. Ive tried root and it was always breaking, especialy on higher level mobs, so i switched back to GI and never looked back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">For situations where i need root NOW before this thing kills me, i have up GI. Like in a group, raid ect.  I use the level 64 PE, when i need it to last, like while im root/dotting things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I use right click ornate legs root because its mana free! Other than that I use PE and aways have prior to Ornate legs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">And I use right click Ring of Immobilization and Virulent Paralysis lvl 3.  When I really want stuff rooted on the first shot, I'll mem Paralyzing Earth and use that.  <br />
<br />
REMEMBER!  The mob's resistances determine how long he'll be stuck there, so after you root him, it would be wise to Malos him if using a magic based root, or Malicious Decay the mob if using VP.  With MD on a mob, mostly they sit there for the entire duration.  It's really a great root . .  VP is.  Plus it has a knockback that grows bigger with each level of it, making it a VERY effective CC tool.  Nothing is cooler than knocking a mob out of camp and rooting him there for 2 minutes while the group kills whatever else is in camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I used level 14 root up until I got ornate pants. it's 30 mana, you can't go wrong =b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If I have to root park 2 or more mobs, I first fire off a MD/VP combo to remove one immediately from combat.  Next I fire off a Pet earth to hard root the secondary mob, the 3rd mob the tank has argo on falls back towards the group, I then pendant/malos the one I just cast PE on, to ensure it holds longer.  Then I pendant/malos the first mob and hard root with PE again overwriting the VP.  By this time the other shaman have already slowed/debuffed the MT mob and I am effectively CCing the other 2,3,4 etc...<br />
<br />
Pet earth is like a -30 MR check, with malos/sini is strips the mr of the creature down another 60, so in effect its a -90 SvM on the root duration/breaking.  It holds 2-3 mintues depending on the mobs MR check vs tick on roots.<br />
<br />
Now if I am soloing and I have to split just 2 mobs I open with PE on mob 1, at max range, fire off MD/VP on mob 2, then proceed to pendant/PE both, slow, cripple, and being my dot cycles on mob 1.  Hotswap in gavel, Epic, Bane, BoS first because they will NOT break root, then A:SoN and BoN, repeat 2-3x with BA4 staff and horse/cann 5 throughout, end the fight around 60 mana w/FT7 self buffed, its slow but if you are bored you can do it.  I then use regular root when A:SoN or BoN breaks the original root due to the DD check.<br />
<br />
Up to you really, but I never use that level 62 root, I got nightcaller leggings and that 30% spell haste I feel merits wearing over clicky pants, though the clicky pants DOES save mana.  Its a hard choice, if you want to be a hotswap king and max efficency you can do it.</div></div><hr />

I have always assumed that the determining factor was what the mobs resistance is when the root spell is landed.  I wonder if there have been any tests done to verify if lowering restance, after the spell has already landed, will make it hold longer.  I realize you can recast GI or PE after to be sure, but you can't really do that with VP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The monster gets a check on every tick while rooted, so I would think a debuff after could still help.</div></div><hr />
