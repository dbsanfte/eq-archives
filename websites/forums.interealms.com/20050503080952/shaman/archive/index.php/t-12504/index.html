<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The new HP updating has screwed things up pretty badly.  Sure it's nice to have more frequent HP updates from mobs, but ALL HP updates are delayed between the server and the client.  This is bad.<br />
<br />
This results in situations like what I had happen to me last night.  I died in PoEarth.  Got dragged to zone in (no mobs around, fyi).  Got rez'd.  Looted all my gear (over 1924 HP in gear HP alone).  After looting I had about 2450 or so.  As I usually do after rez/looting, I double checked my HP and then hit CannV.  Even with 2400+ hp I died from CannV immediately.<br />
<br />
Of course the GMs wouldn't do anything and failed to understand, and ignored my attempts/offers to demonstrate the bug to them.  I believe this is happening as a result of the delay between HP updates from client to server and/or vice versa.  The client knew I had 2400+ HP, but the server hadn't been updated yet so when I cast cannV the server thought I died... and of course when it comes to death the server wins over the client any day.<br />
<br />
At least 1 other shaman in my guild had this happen to him.  Anybody else seeing this?  I saw 1 other post so far, but it was buried in another thread.  I felt that something this deadly to Shaman deserves its own thread.<br />
<br />
BTW, for reference, pre-patch I always did the same routine and it never killed me (rez, loot, check HP, cannV).  This was the 1st time I've died from CannV and it wasn't even my fault.</div></div><hr />

Made sure hps were fine.  Canned.  Died again.  Rezzed again.  Decided to test it to make sure I wasn't crazy.  Died again.  <br />
<br />
I was afraid to hit Cann 5 the rest of the night.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Never had any problems with that last night altho i think i only died once all night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wow, I'm glad I wasn't the only one to have this happen...  Figured it was just because I was a Cann5 newbie.  I felt like such a dork in any case.  Was especially funny because after my friend rezzed me, I waited for about 1950 hp, said 'Well, in theory this shouldn't kill me...', and then flopped over dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eci_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So, how long should we wait now before Canabalizing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I died last night with over a bubble of health remaining and Kragg's about to finish casting.  It's one thing to die because things go bad or you make a mistake.  It's quite another to die because the game isn't giving you correct information on which to base your actions.  If I had known my REAL health - I could have started casting my heal earlier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thyalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I had it happen a few times lately.  My husband felt seriously guilty when he got me a rez after a bad RZ raid where I was going to let my corpse rot, and he canni'd to get me mana and killed me :(<br />
<br />
I can now tell him it wasn't him :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>howjan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This bug had been on test for a week or so.  It's disappointing to see it go live, and yes it was /bugged, reported, and so forth.  <br />
<br />
I died a couple of times in fire last nite, looted up and hit can5 asap without a problem.  Either the bug is intermittant or it was taken care of on test.  I'm unsure which.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I died due to an error in reported HPs long before this patch. Your actual HPs are those on the server not on the client: the client attempts predict what your HPs are but there has always been the potential for error.<br />
<br />
For example, pre-patch when casting torpor, the HPs increase server-side from torpor was occasionally one tic behind when the client thought the HP increase was.  You could actually see your HPs get a torpor boost (client side) and then see your HPs fall again as the client received a HPs update from the server.  I died when I saw a client side HPs boost, pressed Canni 5, and then saw my HPs drop back when the server update arrived.  After that happened to me I have always counted to six (ie. an extra tic) before pressing Canni V.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dissonant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">A friend of mine died 3 consective times doing Cann5 the first time he had 1950hp(pretty risky anyway :p)  the second time he had 2200 and the third time he had 3400hp!  <br />
<br />
I didn't have a problem with it though.  I was grinding in Tactics with 3500 self-buffed, I hit cann5 everytime it popped, i had anywhere from 2800-3500hp when I used it and it never killed me.<br />
<br />
Who knows... the server/client hp update error might only be in certain zones?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Soveraign</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">This is interesting.  I was noticing my HP occasionally go *down* by like 1 percent real fast then back up while medding last night and thought I'd maybe had too much wine.  This morning I realised I in fact did have too much wine.  Anyone else seen their HP number do this?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">My Cann5 death was with rez effects still on, but was about 3 hp updates past when I should've been able to cann safely, so it's apparently more than just a 1 tick lag in hp or anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Soveraign</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Just had a thought.. perhaps folks are dying from CanV when their *unitemized* HP is still below 1924 HP?  i.e. If you have 2424 total HP, but 500 of that is in items you still croak?<br />
<br />
Just a thought, might be worth a quick test.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Are people dying when they have been sitting there with enough hitpoints for awhile or when they recently had low hitpoints and hit cann5 when they saw their hitpoints had gone up enough. For example your health is low so you cast torpor, when you see your hps get to a certain point you hit cann 5 but you die. Or where your hps enough for a cann 5 for a few minutes before you hit canni?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Had this happen to me other night.<br />
Ressed, looted waited till I got back to 2k hps  clicked the button and hit the ground. I wasn't healed so it was multiple ticks between looting and canniV death. First ever canni death :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Happened here as well. got rezzed, looted up. had 2800+ hp after a can4, cast torpor, cast can5 then wham! dead.<br />
I wasnt so upset about dying as i was annoyed my guildchat was full of &quot; haha you noob&quot; messages :)<br />
Just happened on patch day and i havent been able to reproduce it since.<br />
Odd bug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Hail,<br />
<br />
This bug got me last night as well once, even after knowing about this thread. :(<br />
<br />
Died in BoT (icky Vinds coming through walls), rezzed, looted my gear, cast Torpor, &amp; then hit Canni5 w/ 2250+ hp only to die again. :(<br />
<br />
This was less than a minute after death, but I'm unsure of the time between finishing the looting of the corpse and hitting Canni5.<br />
<br />
I died again a little while later (DAMN pick-up clerics :( ) and was afraid to hit it post-rez. :p  I waited until I was full-hp, then waited another 2 ticks before casting to be sure.  Didn't have any problems the rest of the night using that strategy (waiting 2 ticks past having solid hp total) even if not at full health.<br />
<br />
I sent a /bug report.  First one I think I've ever sent where I wasn't completely cordial, but I was pretty miffed.<br />
<br />
Chuk, I can only imagine those /tells, lol. ;)  <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Rebelheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">our HP update is delayed, I think many has noticed that..<br />
btw GM dont always play shm, he /she might not even know what canni5 is ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">My guess is that it's related to hp update delay.  Not DISPLAY delay, but actually hp delay.  As in, the heal spell lands on you, but your health doesn't update and you die anyway...<br />

We're not the only ones, either.  The poor folks dependent on mod rods to chew mana from flesh are disemboweling themselves, as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Nazzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">After reading this thread and the one on the clerics page i don't feel so bad for dying.  Cann5 didn't kill me but torpor did.  Kind of.  I was in a fight and had low health so i cast torpor on my self and watched my health go up i was at half health when i got hit for 350 damage and died.  I should have had about 1700 hit points at the time.   I thought it was really strange at the time.  The hit point delay would explain how i died.  Just wish i would have know about this before hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Happened to me over the weekend too. I had 2221 hp after being ressed and equipping gear. I did still have res effects though I doubt that matters. Like others, no one believed me when it happened and think I just did Cann 5 with too little HP. I learned long ago that GM's are clueless when they told me Alchemy was working fine (months before Kunark if anyone remembers original Alchemy). I didn't bother petitioning or feedbacking it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Definately a HP update problem I think. On a related note I had a mob pounding on me in Tactics and was healed for 3400hps then died.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Server updates with motion change also,  if your running from something and want to cast on it, its best to turn a slight bit once your stopped, otherwise your almost assured an interrupt.</div></div><hr />
