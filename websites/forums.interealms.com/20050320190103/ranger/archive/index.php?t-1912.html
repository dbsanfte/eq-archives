<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Silence</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently purchased the Xbox and all i can say is wow what a machine.I purchased Wreckless:the yakuza missions and was wondering does anyone know a cheat code to turn the dam timer off, I'd love to just cruise around and check everything out without running out of time.Any help would be appreciated:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drexel</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't have Wreckless, but I did a quick search and didn't find any cheats to remove the timer.  Sorry, I wish I could be of more help there.<br />
<br />
The only games I have now are Halo, Blood Omen 3, NFL Fever, and JSRF.  Halo is a must have. <br />
<br />
Blood Omen 3 is a great game, but it's pretty buggy (nothing too serious).  NFL Fever is tons of fun (ph34r the Norfolk Gladiators :)).  JSRF is ok for ****s &amp; grins.<br />
<br />
I'm still looking for a good basketball game, there are so many to choose from.<br />
<br />
I haven't bought a new game in awhile, Dungeon Siege has kept me pretty busy, but Morrowind comes out at the end of this month and will most likely be my next XBox purchase.<br />
<br />
Have fun! :)</div></div><hr />
