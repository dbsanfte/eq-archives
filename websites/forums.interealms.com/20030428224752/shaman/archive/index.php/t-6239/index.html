<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wongfeihung</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wasted 15K and capped my skill in 2 hours at Shadow Haven...<br />
tried to earn my money back at Bazaar but heh what a waste of time,<br />
only potions that people will buy are sow, ant, and unlife...<br />
the expensive ones such as gate potions are super hard to sell with sellers at Bazaar selling them cheaper than the price to make, what a blowout, this stinks.<br />
<br />
Btw, where do I get a Faithstone?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I feel you pain brother Shaman.   The Faithstone of Everfrost can be made by a high level potter.  I bought mine for 4k on Solusek Ro.  It's very convenient having a gate spot to my home.<br />
<br />
Good Luck,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Being bound in POTS room, I really have no need of a faithstone. It is just too convenient</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brakums</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Im just waiting to see the new potions they implement with PoP if they do</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I feel your pain - I am at 157 skill, I made 30 grow potions yesterday and not one skillup. Auugh.<br />
<br />
I can't justify blowing 15k to get to 180, so I just keep making sow, using the profits to make more titans... :)<br />
<br />
Oh well.<br />
<br />
I might blow a wad if there's anything good in PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>FloppyDisks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Grow all the way.  I had skill 70 from years ago when I did alchemy.  A few months ago I dropped 10k and went from 70 - 180 using Grow.  Just sell them back to a vendor, no market for them.<br />
<br />
It grinds to a halt when you hit 170.  Reasonable skillups up to that point but from 170 - 180 it is silly.<br />
<br />
This was with 255wis too.<br />
<br />
I maxed it for one reason and that is so I can carry a backpack full of one charge potions with me to give to guild members when they need to leave.  We've only two active wizards and once they leave melees are up a creek if they do not have a thurg potion.<br />
<br />
Useful too for deep chardok and seb exp groups and someone has to leave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I couldn't handle selling all my grows to a vendor.. luckily i found a gnome with a height fetish.. He purchased 10 stacks from me lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tristarss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">be glad you werent doing alchemy prior to &quot;grow&quot; being put in. I spent well over 70k getting to 180.</div></div><hr />
