<br />
In particular, I am referring to this portion:<br />
<br />
3)      Planar Progression.<br />
<br />
 Planes of Power has provided us with valuable insight into the group and guild dynamics that are involved in large scale games.  The way that we had expected guilds to advance through the story of Planes of Power has become a roadblock for some guilds, and some members have fallen behind and found it difficult to catch up.  Obviously this was not our intention.  We want players to play with their friends and guild mates.<br />
<br />
To correct this issue, we will be removing the flag requirements for entry into the following Planes of Power zones:<br />
<br />
Bastion of Thunder<br />
Plane of Tactics<br />
Halls of Honor<br />
Plane of Nightmare<br />
Plane of Storms<br />
Plane of Torment<br />
Plane of Valor<br />
Crypt of Decay<br />
<br />
 This will make the majority of Planes of Power zones available to everyone, and should allow most guilds to travel and adventure together.  We understand that those that have already earned the entry flags for these zones have put some effort into that accomplishment.  We will be giving a reward to those that have done so,  though you'll have to wait to see what that reward is.<br />

I'I really hope they add a leve requirement to the zones instead, otherwise more of &quot;random class _01 that doesn't wanna say what lv i am b/c it will mean i won't get a grp) ie the lv 50 cleric i gpred w/ a few times in disease before i got flagged, /sigh constally running out of mana w/ kei, crap-tacular buffs, really upsetting.<br />

I have spent hundreds of hours completing the quests to get access to those zones and hundreds more doing trials and trigger events for myself and my guildies.  And now it will be Karnors Castle 4.0 in all of those zones.<br />
<br />
Unbelievable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm posting the same thing here that I did on the cleric board where I first read about this.<br />
<br />
I am not in an uber guild, far from it. We do top velious stuff most and the occasional high luclin thing. I however do not like the idea of letting everyone and thier brothers into the tier three planes. I do think that giving everyone access to PoS/PoV is a good idea, but I worked really hard to get flagged for tactics, CoD, BoT, and HoH and I like having places to go (with the exception of BoT) that are generally peaceful and not busy. <br />
<br />
Now they are all going to be jam packed with the same people that train the graveyard in PoI/PoN over and over</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">it good idea but also suck if every newbie can access to those zone, I think VI better add lvl limit for those zone, like lvl60+ to enter PoV/PoS, and lvl63+ for BoT/HoH/PoTactic/CoD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Glad they are doing this. And, yeah, I'm flagged for Valor, Storms, and Tactics. The flag system was a nice idea on paper, but it didnt work in actual practice and I'd wager it cost SOE in the pocketbook by way of cancelled accounts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Karverez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thank god for this.  I do hate to admit to this, but I pay for eq on a monthly basis, why should I have to worry about getting a flag to get into a zone that I belong in.  This is my second char on my way to 60+, it's a long and annoying road.  <br />
  On another note.  It's another way for those who don't know how to play, to get into areas where they don't belong.  It's a 50-50 shot.  Getting flagged once is bad enough, I was almost done with 2, and a third on the way...  Entirely way too much time to invest.<br />
<br />
Edit:  60+ for CoD!!??  You have to be kidding me.  Maybe for the item half, but most definately not for the exp part.  Make it a key or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zyphun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I dunno, I just started playing again. I left EQ the last time because the stress of getting people through the events needed for second tier zones in Planes of Power was to much. it took all the fun from the game for me. I started over from stratch and I am working my way back up to the point PoP is going to really matter. All I have to say is I am really dishearted in hearing Sony is going to be removing the need for flags from second tier zones. The reason I'm dishearted is for the same reason some people have mentioned, it kept the immature players that never learned how to play out of my hair. Don't get me wrong, I am snob, I'll freely admit it. I like being able to play in a zone without a couple dozen idiots running around causing trouble because they can and they think it's funny or even worse yet, you get the brainless that think they know what they are doing and end up getting in over their head and causing more mayhem and torment then all the immmature screwups combined. I may not have agreed with how the events work, I may not have liked the headaches it caused, but it certainly created a more pleasent enviroment for people to play in that really wanted to play. Now those people all going to get crammed into the elemental planes, I hope there is room.</div></div><hr />

And that's what will happen to any of the people who dont know how to handle themselves (or those who are just too low level to handle those zones). <br />
<br />
I've been flagged for Tactics for a month, but havent hunted there yet because I dont think I'm ready to hunt there...dont have the greatest gear, only level 62, and not a lot of AA's. Of course, I am skilled enough to hunt there and a very old school shaman...but those zones require a bit more than skill alone.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Torment will still be empty.<br />
<br />
So true =)<br />
<br />
PoV/PoS/PoI factory should be open for certain, they are the defacto 60+ xp spots for the masses and if you suffer from bad luck on trials, your 61+ progression isn't likely to go anywhere.<br />
<br />
The rest should still require flags imho.<br />
<br />
Tbh, PoN/PoD would work fine if they both had spots akin to the PoI factory, IE for PoN, fix the pathing and warping issues with Hobgobs, especially the bat just before the first junction, and the horrific pathing around the entrance to the cave.  And tone down Consorts a bit, with a decently equiped paladin/sk they are fine, but with anything less they are just the most unfun and horrifically messy xp possible.  I did them once with a warrior tanking, never again, I'm amazed we killed as many as we did =)<br />
<br />
The PoD cave rats and spiders should have there level raised also imho to bring it into line for 60+ players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Precisely. I've gone through the nightmare of not only getting myself flagged for tiers 2+ but having to go back time after time to help others get through and it's just goddamn moronic. They're addressing this issue about 8 months too late in my opinion. <br />
<br />
I can see the key quests, for 3rd tier(let's be realistic, BoT key for example is way easier than getting people through those trials) but they've made it too hard to progress for the majority of the 60+ population(that's right, majority..people in the elemental planes are not a large part of the 60+ player base). Now if only I can get a refund for the dozens of hours spent doing that pointless bull**** before they figured out how bad of an idea it was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">This is complete crap.<br />
<br />
I have spent a lot of time flagging my guildmates. We (as a guild) have spent a lot of time working the bosses to get everyone into tier3. We are not an 'uber' guild, most of the guild are adults who work fulltime and have commitments, we have spent a LOT of guild effort working flags, and gearing up in Ssra/ST keys/ST to be able to kill stuff like AD/behemoth to gain tier3 access - we don't sploit or zerg..always the hard way for us ;)<br />
<br />
This will devalue the work my guild has done over the past 5-6 months, we are concientious about flagging as many as we can, including the most casual players. <br />
<br />
Now all that work means we get to share with all the PoN people, marvellous...<br />
<br />
Personally, i'm sure I could have made another 60-70 aa easily in the time I have spent on flagging/backflagging..<br />
<br />
I suppose on the positive side, having to learn strats and get geared/aa'd to get to tier3 has made us a damn sight stronger as a guild, and has encouraged everyone to play their class to the limit and work as a team, just a shame to see all this thrown out the window to appease the 'hit autoattack and bitch about loot' crowd..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Still happy ?<br />
<br />
Yup, extremely happy. Big freaking deal if a lvl 46 can zone into a tier 3 zone. Kinda like a lvl 20 zoning into ToV, so what? It's a small price to pay in exchange for being able to group with your friends without having to go for the least common denominator zone that everyone is flagged for. <br />
<br />
It's not like groups of lvl 50s are suddenly going to be overrunning tier2+ zones, no more so than any other high lvl EQ zones get overrun by lower lvl people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Banana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Gurck I lead so many open flagging raids on quellious, you are always in PoV/Storms when I do them too, I've asked you if you wanted to come but always you say that it isn't for you. <br />
<br />
On a side note, this sucks. HoH is the place that when im sick of grouping I go to relax, solo, duo. BoT will be the same way it is because the key to get in wasn't really hard at all. Torment will stay the way it is, with zero in the zone (3/4 of the mobs are immune to slow for all those that don't know what im talking about). Valor/Storms will be flooded with 46 to 59's that don't know what they are doing trying to zerg mobs ending up with 3 to 4 deaths per pull. CoD will be filled with about 2x the amount of necro's soloing which makes it 4 people. Tactics........the places xp just went down a few notches, before with one group you could clear all the way down to the mess hall and come back to full pop the xp was great, now it will be like seb used to be. HoH will take the biggest hit, the mobs are easy enough for a druid/wiz/nec/shm/bard to solo at 60, and groups will take over the trial rooms. <br />
<br />
All in all I think the change sucks, and they say a reward to those that have all the flags currently like myself? What reward, Oh congratulations on the pride of getting yourself flagged before all the newbies did!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Wolfmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Already flagged for those zones but very happy they are opening them up for all....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Traans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">here here, people complain that they take to much time, you have to kiss uber guilds ass's to go, but all you need to do is work when you play, yes goto PoS and hunt the diaku, it takes a day or two but at least you've earned your flag, AND you can flag a group of friends now. NONE of the alt quests require a uber guild to do, just 5 friends. and if you really want to group with your friends, than work with them and help them get thiers.<br />
<br />
what sony's doing is makeing litterally hundreds of hours put in buy others flagging themselves and other useless. they say that we'll be rewarded? those zones ARE our reward. as much as any piece of loot or level. for those who think nothing's going to change take a look at BoT, when the flag is almost trivial. i won't go there anymore it's gotten so bad.<br />
<br />
next you'll be saying getting rid of the VT key will allow uber guilds to equip their new players more quickly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Just finished most of my alt quests (and just 1 more to go for HoH), but I still think it's a good change.  Sucks putting in the time to get there with the flags.  <br />
<br />
Notice the rest of the post, there are some really good things in there:<br />
<br />
We've remedied the  long-standing situation that caused characters to lose all their buffs if they zoned with fewer hit points remaining than the bonus hit points provided by their items.<br />
<br />
Possibly the single most annoying bug around, when you get hit with it.<br />
<br />
...as well as removing the restriction that forbid the casting of Gate spells in Veeshan's Peak.<br />
<br />
This was the only reason I never bothered to go look at VP (well, the quest is long too), because I knew they make you jump through hoops to get out.  This would make VP a fun place to explore with a group.<br />
<br />
We have corrected a problem that was causing some people to be unable to log back into the game quickly if the were disconnected.  This has been a complicated problem to correct, and we're glad to have found and fixed it.<br />
<br />
Another majorly annoying issue if it happens to you.  Nothing worse than going LD on a raid and not being able to get back in for 20 minutes when the raid is long past where you are now standing (for example, under a flurry drake in ToV).<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall, looks like a lot of great changes going in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Tier 2 flags gone.... Good idea.<br />
<br />
Tier 3 flags gone...  ***?<br />
<br />
Tier3 alternate quests should be made to work just like killing a boss to get your flag and all would be fine IMO.  I'm curious if you'll still have to even do the whole set of flags to get elemental access or just the Tier3 bosses now.  If you can skip all the prior flags, that is utterly retarded.<br />
<br />
Way to utterly gimp an expansion.  Flags were screwed up but as usual SoE goes overboard with their 'fix'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">See, now on Maelin, I'm taking a rough estimate in saying there's rarely more than 100 people total in the Tier 1s, Valor, Storms and BoT combined (the other zones, I'm unsure, never felt like jumping through hoops to get there).<br />
<br />
I will agree though, I do hope some sort of added level limit is put on some of the higher zones to prevent some 65 PLing their 46 n00b to 65 within a day and a half, although that'll probably happen anyway.<br />
<br />
My 2 cents</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Many people against the change are citing that tier 2/3 zones will now be filled with noobs and doods, and you're right.. but have you considered why?<br />
<br />
SOE upped the level cap, gave PoP zones insane ZEMs, and lowered the level range of mobs you can get exp from, all to ensure that everyone would buy their expansion.  One of the differences between PoP and other expansions is that when Velious and Luclin came out, you could still get good exp in a place like Seb.  PoP severely limits the game for 65s.  You have your choice of outdoor, DL-type zones and nothing else.  Every zone in PoP mimics the Kunark Express (tm) zones - LOIO, OT, DL, KC..  If there were dungeons we (and I say &quot;we&quot; because I doubt any DL doodz ever bother reading any message boards) could get away from people we don't like simply by going to one.  The problem isn't with flags or the removal of them; its with PoP itself.  The simple fact is that over the years, SOE has become more and more greedy.  Why design aesthetically pleasing, diverse zones including indoor dungeons, if you don't have to?  Their two big buying groups, uberguilders and d00dz, would buy PoP anyway, and without bothering to do a good job they saved a lot of money.<br />
<br />
Verant originally came out with a great game (Sony bought them FYI, there is no more VI, its SOE (Sony Online Entertainment) now), and RoK / SoV followed in that great spirit... starting with Luclin though, I've seen a side of Sony I'd rather not have.  The side that cares only about profit, about expense vs. income, and to hell with Norrath.<br />
<br />
If you want to vent about this change, fine - but don't vent at the removal of flags, vent at the hastily designed expansion and the company behind it - Sony.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Too little too late.  The flag concept for the majority of the zones in the game is LAME.

Essentially sony thought everyone in the game wanted to go around smelling like catass, rather than the select few that really wanted to go to places like ST and VT.<br />
<br />
Not only that, but they only added lamer outdoor zones that the LOIO-&gt;FM-&gt;DL-&gt;KC felt at home in (please, don't even talk about CoD, it is smaller than blackburrow).</div></div><hr />

I don't mind that...but...<br />
generally morons that dont know how to play their class dont make it past tier 1.<br />
Now they are going to be in...tier 3????<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I'm happy about this.<br />
Why?<br />
Well I have flags to every zone other than elementals right now, and almost got elementals, but here's the thing, I DONT CARE if I can go there if my less uber friends can not! <br />
<br />
Most people have friends who are lower level and/or just not in an good raiding guild that can get them those flags easily.  Flags are a ****ing pain and it's about time they opened up the content to everyone who ****ing PAID for it! <br />
<br />
So I agree with this move on general principle.  Sure it sux that I had to do all that flagging for myself and guildies and now it don't mean jack.  But you know what?  The game will be better for it in all the ways that matter, and that will make me happy.<br />
<br />
As for people worrying about &quot;newbs&quot; cluttering up their favorite exp zones . . guess what, you've had them to yourselves long enough!  It's time to share.  And players will work it out in a few weeks about which zones and which camps and which levels and which people are &quot;allowed&quot; where.  I mean honestly, you may be &quot;allowed&quot; to take a random lvl 52 druid into your Plane of Tactics pit group, but would anyone WANT to?  Other than PLing reasons that is.  <br />
<br />
Good lord tho . . . PLing just reached a new height.  It's gonna be laughably easy to level a character from 50 to 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">You got it right, Landragoran.  The flagging issue has, from a lot that I've read, caused definate problems for some guilds.  Some people get flagged then spend all their time in the uber xp zones, and their guildies are left to rot in Tier 1.  Not to mention, as someone else said, the entire flagging setup is pretty lame.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, they should have kept the flags as required entry - but go back and take a serious look at retuning the methods of getting those flags.  Also, flag quests should let you progress in the same manner raid flags do.  You'd still need flags to advance, but it wouldn't be so difficult to flag people that it'd break guilds up.<br />
<br />
On other things.  Being one of the few guilds (that I know of) who hits VP, the gate change will be nice.  Even without it, it's really not difficult to get out - you either have to be able to clear a lair &amp; walk out, or use some imagination &amp; get rezzed out.  Still, it's a hassle, especially when people have to leave in a hurry.<br />
<br />
As for Schpleef's comments about the mad xp in PoP - they also said they're going to look at increasing the range of xp givers for 61+, and tuning up some old zones again, to give better xp.<br />
<br />
Overall, there are a lot of changes in the works.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most people have friends who are lower level and/or just not in an good raiding guild that can get them those flags easily.  Flags are a ****ing pain and it's about time they opened up the content to everyone who ****ing PAID for it!<br />
<br />
/agree completely<br />
<br />
I'm in a smaller guild and nothing has caused us more grief or been more of a hassle than these damn flags.  The unflagged players feel left out and the DPS crew who have theirs feel like they are being ordered around.<br />
<br />
And don't pretend it takes &quot;better&quot; players to kill cactuses in PoS than it did in Overthere.  I'd have no problems with level limits to zone in, but thank god the stupid hoop-jumping is over.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">So what if they removed the need for a key to access ST, or VT?  I'm sure all those who have EARNED thier VT key would be overjoyed to see everyone else have it handed to them on a silver platter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Need to be in an uberguild...&quot;  Puh-leez.  You need to be in an uberguild to access the elemental planes.  The pre-elementals all have doable alternate access quests which require no uberness, just effort.  The same effort which hundreds of thousands of charachters have put in to earn access to the 'best' zones of an expansion, back from the days of Kunark.<br />
<br />
The trials suck ass, granted.  So dumb them down.  Give groups 30% longer to kill each wave.  Tactics flag is one-groupable once in storms.  CoD flag is easily duoable.  Torment... who wants torment?  Really?  But still one-groupable.  HoH alternate flag is one groupable with ease.  BoT flag probably requires the most people to do, but it's hardly as if BoT is empty.  Perhaps all the people getting access to PoS could *gasp* work together to achieve a common goal?<br />
<br />
I'm still missing CoD, HoH and Torment.  I'm not too bothered by this - I'll get there once I've earned my right to be there.  While I'm fully aware that this is a game, all games since Pong evolved have evolved you 'working' to 'earn' things, so get over it.<br />
<br />
Edit: As regards flags seperating members of a guild between tiers; I had 15 guildies (most of whom would have been expping in Tier 3) come down to PoS for a few hours and help me and another guy complete our BoT keys.  If peole in your guild are unwilling to do this, then you don't need to look for an uber guild - you need to look for guildies who appreciate making guildies happy over watching an orange bar go up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I am pleased at the thought of avoiding some minor backflagging, but unhappy that hours of work are effectively in the crapper.  CoD has a fairly easy key quest that now flags 6 people for crying out loud and do we really need more corpses in the Tactics GY during RZ runs??  BoT and PoV already have enough &quot;exciting&quot; train content so no real loss there.<br />
<br />
SOE could have taken a much less extreme approach and just made flags a tangible thing, like a charged item, that could be looted by a guildleader to distribute flags at a later point, but maybe that is too easy.<br />
<br />
And yes Chuk, there will still be no people in Torment. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Been weeks and weeks since my last post, and this merits one.<br />
<br />
Should have been done from the start.  An expansion that offers a zone (PoK) that can take you to newbie zones, new spells (the no-drop ones), and 3 xp zones that a decent amount of people are limited to (for whatever reason), doesn't cut it for the cost of an expansion.  If the proposed change was done from the start, people would have accumstomed themselves early on with level of difficulty per zone and know where they should be or not should be.<br />
<br />
However... that being said, I'm also one of those that have put in countless hours into getting flagged long ago, and helping others getting flagged since then.   I do fear some influx of players infesting into places they are not ready for.  It'll probably drop off after a while once they realize it, but it's going to be painful for the ones that can handle the zones.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming you'll still need to do the &quot;ladder&quot; of flag mobs (AD, Bertox, Saryrn, Grummus, Terris, etc.) for requirements into the elemental plane web.  So, there shouldn't be much worry about &quot;lesser&quot; guilds wasting these boss mobs up, and if they and kill them, then they're just as deserving to be there.<br />
<br />
There is also talk about revamping xp in other world zones, to spread out xp spots.  Quite frankly, it's very needed.  If they up the xp level in places like Akheva, Ssra, Umbral Plains, it'll help alot.  Maybe not to the degree of PoP xp spots, but it'll have to be at least noticable.  I recall when I was 61, some guild folk wanted to hit Umbral Plains to avoid the PoP hooplah overcrowding (PoP debut day).  Even though we were killing dark blues, I saw hardly no movement in xp.  Even set on AA it was slow.  That's just plain assinine.<br />
<br />
As for the &quot;reward.&quot;  It better be worth it for the time invested getting these flags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">This change will make the game much more enjoyable for me and my entire guild.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Darkoth Utgard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I welcome this change.<br />
<br />
Why should non-raiding exp groups need to spend possibly weeks camping key pieces just to have a small variety in exp zones? I've done it (every alt quest except HoH, prior to the group flagging patch); its utter agony, demoralizing, and should never have been that way to begin with.<br />
<br />
Leave the timesinks for the raiding guilds. Don't penalize group progression because the ubers burn through content too fast. You earn the right to exp in a zone by being able to survive the content, not because you have spent X amount of hours camping keys for it.<br />
<br />
Glad I can finally look forward to leveling my alt again. I had all but abandoned him, since I couldn't ask my group to relive the agony of camping keys for him.<br />
<br />
Btw, if you read the rest of the article, they said they are looking to add more content (ie loot dropping named) to some of the crappier PoP zones, such as Torment.<br />

<br />
If you can't handle a quest to get into tactics that took me a grand total of 4 hours to do (and that was for 2 groups of tactics flags, till we redo behemoth) then you don't have the patience to be playing EQ.<br />
<br />
The people who will be in these zones have no business playing there, and having to weed them out of the people who DO belong there will be a pain, and will be detrimental to my playing time.<br />
<br />
I say this again. If you can't handle such a pitifully easy trial like the Trial of Execution, you have no business in anything higher than what you are flagged for now. You're just going to waste people's time when you get there without having gone through the trial.</div></div><hr />

<br />
look at BoT who's flag has been trivialised by rotting medalions and quest items. look at PoV/PoS, how long have you stayed at East wastlands camp w/o being trained. it will not be pretty people will NOT be weeded out like people think. one would think tier one isn't duoable pre 50 yet i see groups of 46-49's and druids and wizzards who can't handle thier mobs training. you think HoH won't be home to every xp'ing wiz and druid around? or bards for that matter if the mobs don't summon =p. and yeah i'm waiting for a lvl 64 warior w3k base hits to start tanking for me because he DL'ed all the way up and didn't worry about equipment.<br />
<br />
heck the quests aren't even that hard! they just take patience and yes, decent (not NToV) equipment to do. if you can't do them you don't belong in tier 3. yes you paid for the content. just as you paid for VT, VP and other zones you probably won't see. if you complain about not being able to xp in tier1 anymore and being blocked by the trials , yes i can see that argument. i'd still be dubious to put you in my group tho, having done the trials and flagged alot of people they just aren't that tough once you learn to work together (yes even a group of 65's will fail if you don't work together)<br />
<br />
do you remember when you first got these flags what a sence of acomplishment it was. no suddenly my hours of playtime is being made futile and worthless. yes i do view this is a slap in the face. i hope this reward is pretty danged good</div></div><hr />

As an aside, on a semi-retirement from EQ I figured this would happen eventually. I'm glad to see it. With work now I can't play the crazy amount of hours I used to. It was an eye opening experience going to casual player mode. Seemed like all I was doing was key quests when I came home. Sure we're all shamans and people need us in the tier 2 zones, but like...getting flagged for the tier 3 stuff is a pain in the...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Getting a 62 shaman through the trial of execution has little to do with the skill or gear of the shaman and everything to do with who you know, whether your guild has 62+ tanks, wizards and chanters.  And if I am wrong and I cannot competently slow the mobs there without getting killed, I will not hunt there.  Sorry to waste your play time finding out, but it seems mean spirited and selfish to resent opening these zones to more casual players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I personally think if the intent is not to keep friends seperated to let maybe one or two group slots be filled by unflagged people.

Level two would've been a good idea, but they never know where to stop.  People who yell uberguilds have no idea what they're talking about.  You can't Zerg Behemoth.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Actually I read that EQLive post a bit more in depth and they said something interesting.  They said they were going to adjust the level range at which post 60 players could get exp from mobs to equal that of pre-60 players.  In other words, a lvl 60 could get exp from a lvl 46 mob, so a lvl 65 should be able to get exp from a mob 14 levels lower . . i.e. lvl 51 mobs should give exp to a 65 now.  This represents an ALTERNATIVE for people now.  It means that a lot of zones which were &quot;closed&quot; to lvl 65 people will now be open because they can gain exp there now.  Might not be uber exp, but at least the mobs won't be green and light blue anymore.  <br />
<br />
Plus with Veksar coming out soon, the revamp of VP with removal of Gate restrictions, and revamped Hate there should be more zones than ever for an enterprising group of 65's to go spelunking in.  Adding more kewl loot to the game as well so they say, which is pimp.  Everyone likes to get loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Just rediculous. No, I am not incredibly dense.<br />

Fine, open up PoV/PoS - the trials were too hard anyway, and upsetting for people who got left behind.<br />
<br />
But damn, 3rd teir?  You're killing me.  I put in a LOT of hours to get to the few places I can go.  Sometimes I like to hide in a corner in HoH and solo away.  I used to be able to in PoV, before there was over 100 people there every night.<br />
<br />
I agree with what Shamam said - get some lvl restrictions going. 63 for T2, 65 for T3.  I do NOT want to deal with the lvl 58 quad kiter training when I'm trying to solo somewhere. Not that hard to keep that little &quot;your will is not sufficient to enter this realm&quot; (or whatever) message when you try to click into somewhere you're not flagged for.<br />
<br />
I'm not in an uberguild (Juff and I are in the same boat), but the majority of us are flagged for at least 1 T3 zone. We are not a hardcore raiding guild, or zerg/cleric zerg...we have guildies who value guild integrity over xp grinding 24/7.  <br />
<br />
And what, pray tell, is this supposed reward?  I can't think of what they can possible give us to make up for the hundreds of hours of effort put in to that which is  being yanked away. A rusty sword? The same one you are stabbing us in the back with?<br />
<br />
Next thing you know, I'll be able to go to PoFire, take a gander a Fennin Ro, he will fall before my feet after I hail him (no aggro plz, that's too hard) and suddenly be handed all the key pieces to PoTime for my entire guild and whoever else may be at the zone at the same time.<br />
<br />
/angry sarcasm off :p<br />
<br />
Please.  The reason people are whining about not being able to access these zones is because they are RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF THE ZONE IN, and OMG they are clicking and they CAN'T GET IN!!!<br />
<br />
Did people whine about not getting into PoM?? No because you had to clear NToV (most people) to get there.  Did people whine about not having free access to Vex Thal because they payed for the Luclin expansion?  No, because the zone is hidden in some obscure corner of UP.  <br />

Im not pointing you out specificaly so please dont take offense but ...<br />
<br />
<br />
This is what im talking about. Its not getting in a group cause its full cause there is 1-3 46's leeching, probly even AFK alts. Worse then that even is a group of people way to low in there causing havac for everyone else. <br />
<br />
Its my opinion that its simply going to cheapen the game due specificly to attitudes like that. What happened to teaming up with friends and meeting people and just leveling. Im all for people getting into new areas, i remember when i was stuck in PoN and PoD and PoI and stuff , it was frustrating being able to see so little of the game , but taking the flags away is not the answer. It only makes the game blur by even faster and push the desire to become 65 asap while missing out on 50% of the level relivant content. <br />
<br />
Revamp the alt quests and make them easier for small groups, this i feel is a much more creative solution. I want my friends there with me to , but not if it removes all the challanges and rewards, because with little or no struggle, the reward is not nearly as valuable dont you think ? The point of this game is to over come challanges and reap the rewards. Take the trial for PoV/PoS. What was more rewarding ... When you squeaked by for your first time after failing 3 times but getting him to 5%, then FINALY getting his arse. OR when you and 4 other 65's were chain passing people in your guild?<br />
<br />
I ask this only. Isnt there a point where the game threatens to become TOO easy ? Where it threatens to suffer the fate of UO ?</div></div><hr />

Other than that its a great change.  You people focus to much on the extremes, there simply aren't that many doodz out there that will ruin your game.  There is a large percentage of the population that is quite capable of playing their class, and has a good understanding for game mechanics, yet they just are not uber enough to get into those areas yet.  Those people are forced to exp in 2 or 3 differnt zones, and thats wrong.  <br />
<br />
As for calling people newbies..as long as you started playing eq after the level limit was raised to 60, you have no room to talk.  <br />

I do think there should be some changes made to prevent people from blowing the tier3 boss encounters though, and I would not be opposed to a level limit that could be bipassed by killing the appropriate boss mob, or doing the appropriate alternate entry quest.  <br />

Most of this game is easy very easy indeed. Most of the big guilds players are not amazingly skilled they have just got lots of time. <br />
<br />
Most raids that got you that equipment require x amount of AVARAGE players. Quick news flash you are not a better player than someone else just because your gear's better or you are in one of the top guilds on your server. See what you can do with the same type of gear and you will see what's what. <br />
<br />
Things will balance out after a short while people will not go to a zone where they are owned every pull, they will go after the mobs they can kill with the least effort. This is the point of maximum return which is why Loio/OT/DL etc were popular. <br />
<br />
So PoV is going to be even more crowded but so what its dull as hell anyway. Safe easy boring repetitive exp grind just like DL etc. <br />
<br />

Bleah. I'm tired of whiners creapin' on my Kool-Aid.<br />
People weren't upset about not being handed ST/PoM/VT access because there were a great variety of diverse zones to raid, explore, and gain experience in in these expansions.  Without flags people have 6 PoP zones to check out, and only 4 of those to gain exp in.  These four zones are all basically the same as DL, and that doesn't change as you go up in tiers.  Without doing a /who I honestly couldn't tell which plane I was in half the time.<br />
<br />
To add an extra slap in the face for those too thick-skinned to care about the first one, PoP forces you into these boring, DL-clone zones.  You simply can't achieve level 65 in any non-PoP zone unless you have months to play 24/7.  Its also quite difficult to achieve 65 in tier-1 zones, which is the cause of a lot of the deserved complaints you call &quot;whining&quot;.  Your attitude seems to be &quot;how dare they desire level 65 and maybe some aa's?&quot;</div></div><hr />

You can set your watch by the trains to graveyard from people that don't know what they are doing or groups too low level to be there. The same thing will start happening everywhere else. How often will someone will try pulling that elite at the top of the stairs in tactics then end up training everyone sitting in the GY from the train someone just ran through the arena?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Imho, PoV/PoS should have been open from the start, just with a level 60 entry requirement, and PoN/PoD should have both had areas akin to the PoI factory (Which should also be unlocked imho, perhaps expanded also when the Manaetic Behemoth is dead), consorts and mephits both utterly sucked in comparison.<br />
<br />
Tactics, BoT, HoH, CoD and Torment are simply not going to work for this though imho.  BoT is bad enough as it is, 1 train can take out a lot of people, it'll be KC mk2.  I'd be willing to bet that there would be a rabid Wrulon at the HoH zone in more often than not too, and CoD is just plain not suitable for players that have matured in non stop outdoor environments, it is a zone that requires fast thought and lots of dungeon experience if you want to do well there.  A bunch of born and breed Dreadlands rejects will cause nothing but problems there.  I guess at least Torment will still be left alone, silencing mobs do wonders for scaring away the crowds =)<br />
<br />
And regarding the frog twinks, yes I Pl'd my cleric frog much of the way to 46 (Using my 51 enchanter I'll add), but after that I leveled the good old fashioned way with the nearest to PLing being 2boxing the ench in the group if needed.  I did the PoV/PoS trial first go at level 60 with friends (Am currently at 4 trials, 4 successes too =).  I did my BoT key with pickups, and all other flags I obtained through raids when I was at the level where I could actually contribute.  Not all the frogs out there hid behind the stage whilst the real people did the business for them =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">There are alot of people in those zones right now that are stupid, can't handle themselves, nebies, doodz, underleveld, etc.  They get in by riding on the coat-tails of their own guild, or by spending time farming key components, or even buying a key MQ in the bazaar.  The flag system has never kept stupid people out of zones. <br />
<br />
There will be more of them now, simply because the population will rise and with that rise, some of those peope will be stupid, and some of them will be quality players.  On the other hand, because of the population rise, they will probably end up increasing drop rates, increasing mob density, or even tweak the mobs abilites.<br />
<br />
There is no precident in EQ for limiting the content the way they did in PoP.  The flag system was poorly implemented from the beginning, and this new changes fixes many more problems than it creates.<br />
<br />
I do sympathize with those that had to work hard to get their flags for those zones, and I am all for some sort of reward to them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
BUT....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Some level restrictions should be in place<br />
<br />
<br />
tier 2 shoudl be restricted to let's say 58+<br />
<br />
tier 3 60+  <br />
<br />
<br />
etc etc<br />
<br />
Some ppl are not in uber guilds and CANNOT get flags. IF flags were so EASY to get nobody woudl be complaining but they are not.<br />
We all paid lots of cash for pop and what did we get? 4 xp zones? *** how many more zones were closed to us? A LOT more than half.<br />
This expansion screwed the casual player and now when they finally realize their mistake and fix it u dare to bitch?<br />
What if u don't mind me askign can a level 47 (insert any class u like here) or in fact a whole grp of level 47's do in tactics? or COD? they will go down so fast they won't even have tiem to blink. Their spells / melee hits won't land and no grp of higher level will take them since they won't really participate in any way with dps or anything.<br />
Would u at 65 trust your life to the mana pool and garbage heals of a level 47 cleric? Would u really allow anyone who is not at least 60 in your grp? of course not cause all they would do is leech xp.<br />
<br />
This change is not bad.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Actually I read that EQLive post a bit more in depth and they said something interesting.  They said they were going to adjust the level range at which post 60 players could get exp from mobs to equal that of pre-60 players.  In other words, a lvl 60 could get exp from a lvl 46 mob, so a lvl 65 should be able to get exp from a mob 14 levels lower . . i.e. lvl 51 mobs should give exp to a 65 now.  This represents an ALTERNATIVE for people now.  It means that a lot of zones which were &quot;closed&quot; to lvl 65 people will now be open because they can gain exp there now.  Might not be uber exp, but at least the mobs won't be green and light blue anymore.  <br />
<br />
<br />
/boggle<br />
They are taking away the exclusivity of tier three and giving you minor exp inzones you've3 already camped to death and your HAPPY?  BoT is gonna be a MESS.  I won't camp there unless it'll be in one of the towers after flags go down.<br />
<br />
The one thing that being in tier three gave us was the probablility that the people there weren't going to be completely incompetant</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">the point is, Tier3 shouldn't have been exclusive to begin with.  Shoulda just been a level cap in place and let us go at it without all the hassle.  Btw, the alternate access quests have JUST been revamped so they're actually easy enough to do that they don't take forever to get done.  <br />
<br />
And I know a guildie who's got a lvl 46 cleric alt in PoTactics . . . just in case he can leach some exp from a group that don't mind.  <br />
Honestly, PoTactics is the easiest zone by FAR for an under-leveled character to access.  Just go along on a MB raid!  <br />
<br />
I'm very glad that I won't have to raid those ****ty ass lower tier gods anymore to play catch-up for recruits.  It's just getting boring and awful.  <br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to new zones and new revamps of zones.  I play to play with people.  If the game could offer me an &quot;Exclusive&quot; zone just for Landragoran to get good exp/loot in solo, I would still want to go to PoN and play with a group of newbs and try to keep everyone alive vs. the cave gobbies. <br />
It's a social game folks.  It's not single player.  And as a social game, if your friends can't come, it's a bummer.  Flags just isolate, they don't do anyone a lot of good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">As a part of the leadership of a small guild, who worked our asses off to get every member through a trial...every member BOT flagged, HOH flagged, Tactics flagged... and many members COD flagged.<br />

I am so happy I will not have to do these quests again.  Sure, the timesink part kept others out, but the timesink part also had me chained to camping the damn keys with my guildmates for weeks.  Because if the guild helps one person get a key, we have a responsibility to help all of us get a key.  blahblah.<br />
<br />
That being said, BOT/Tactics/HOH and even Valor and Storms wouldn't be hurt by having level requirements.  Like 60 for 3rd tier and 55 for second... at any rate, remember Cazic Thule, when it was uber exp?  You didnt have level 45 people in there, the difficulty of the mobs dictated the people that could group there and to some extent, this content in bot/hoh/tactics will too.  Of course you will have people who bring their twinks, but that would have happened anyways.<br />
<br />
To be honest my first reaction reading it was mad, because I had put in a lot of time and effort to get my guild flagged, but in the end this is a good change, it makes the game more fun.  Flagging and excluding people is really unfun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is essentially a summary of a lot of the incredibly stupid whines in this thread.<br />
<br />
Had I not seen so many morons and incompetent players in tier 3 zones and &quot;uber&quot; guilds, I might actually take it seriously.  But I have, so I don't.<br />
<br />
PoP should have been introduced this way.  They finally recognized it and in the long term it had to be done.  All the backflagging would get increasingly bad as time went on.  <br />
<br />
It's clearly better for the game as a whole.<br />
<br />
Let's be real, ever since Kunark plenty of incompetent players have shot rapidly up in levels and glommed onto big raiding guilds.  The old LIO-FM-OT-DL exp train ran just fine through PoP.  Level, gear and flags do NOT define skill of a player at all.  <br />
<br />
Not that EQ is especially difficult anyway of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Trials are an accomplishment. They were a way to prove you had the skill to progress. Like a tradeskill. Try doing your 8th Shawl combines with a whopping skill of (1) in each trade necessary. Then try it again when you've gained the necessary trade knowledge to do so. Apples to oranges? Not one bit.<br />
<br />
Did Trials suck *** through a sillystraw? Yes. But it took skill and dedication to get through them. You were then rewarded for your effort by having your Tier2 flags, and could begin working on Tier3.<br />
<br />
My guild was flagging people for T2/T3 easily. We had even flagged a 46 Cleric initiate. It was THAT EASY. Some people struggled with it, and that's fine. Some didn't. We appreciated that we had a place to hunt that was free of the mind-numbing /OOC and endless bounds of bi-polar chimpanzees who never learned to play their class because they PLed themselves with KEI. The same ones who never learned mana preservation and aggro control. The same Knights that can't control their aggro--and as someone who used to play a Paladin, that pisses me off to no end, because it's bloody easy to do if you took the time to learn your class. The same Warriors that don't realize slamming the taunt key repeatedly will lower  your aggro. The same Wizards who get chewed up for one nuke too many. The same Clerics that can't time a heal to save a GAR. The same Chanters who can't handle two Imps in SolB. The insane amount of Shaman twinks who solo their way through levels without learning how to work in relation to other classes.<br />
<br />
Why water down the game to make it easy for people that have already had it a lot easier than the majority of us have had? Obviously, if so many of us made it that far without the gimpification, nothing was broken. <br />
<br />
Open up PoV/PoS. That's fine. But if you do that then what is the point of PoJ? Trials better be the first one-half or one-third of a flag to get you into Tier3 if that's the case. I'm willing to give up PoV/PoS--and I was looking forward to earning my way through Trials, because it would mean I learned this class right, not like the KEI-junkies, the over-nukers and the rest of the Honors-LOIO crowd--if they make it at least three times harder for Tier3.<br />
<br />
I loved the fact that the majority of people in the zones I EXPed in were there because they knew their class, because they passed the test that said, 'This {insert class here} knows his or her stuff!' and not because VI went a big floppy one and opened up the zones to Next Door Jimmy the Wondertard.<br />
<br />
Nerun said,<br />
I say this again. If you can't handle such a pitifully easy trial like the Trial of Execution, you have no business in anything higher than what you are flagged for now. You're just going to waste people's time when you get there without having gone through the trial.<br />
<br />
This is 100% true. That 46 Cleric we flagged? The 55 Monk we flagged? The 58 ShadowKnight we flagged?<br />
<br />
A) The Cleric couldn't buff to save their life. My Paladin had the same buffs, and actually brought my own peridots. The Cleric often ran OoM and it got to the point where nobody in guild would group with her in those planes until she got levels. We all died entirely too often.<br />
<br />
B) The Monk's DPS was gimped by the fact the MoBs were red to him. Pulling singles at his level was difficult, and he'd usually get chewed up very quickly on a pull. My paladin, more times than not, would run out, cast Light of Nife followed by Celestial Cleansing, then drag the MoB back myself.<br />
<br />
C) The SK got chewed through like a rag doll. His gear wasn't the best, but back when I had first got flagged I was still in Kunark/Thurgadin armor, and even at 62 had a hard time. It wasn't until I got several huge upgrades in the HP and Mana department that I could handle the tankle responsibilities without being a manasponge.<br />
<br />
So go ahead, you can group up with Next Door Jimmy the Wondertard. But if I see any of those of you who wanted this to happen whining that there are too many idiots, too many trains, too many Chanters or Wizards or Knights or Warriors or whatever that can't play their class cluttering up the zones, I'll just smile smugly, knowing that you brought it upon yourself for not speaking out when you could have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree, friends stick by each other and work at getting each other flagged.  I've lost count of how many hours I've sat at poj platform buffing friends and guildies, even after I was flagged.  A good friend of mine has had his regular single group go through the majority of the alt quests together side by side and hence are all flagged for pretty much everything that is going open.  When your sat alone on the poj platform whilst your friends are in a random pickup in pov/pos, perhaps you should question just how good those friends are.  I know I would be.  I've refused to help ONCE on a poj trial for someone I knew, that was when I was 12 hours through camping Vendorfire as Kogu (Although I did camp Kog and log on Seb to buff there group).  Hell, I'll extend that offer to ANYONE on this board from BB (Who isnt a twit =), got a promising trials group but no cleric?  You cover the peri's and as long as I'm not busy, I'll do it as Kogu.  Drop me a tell and tell me what you have for a group.</div></div><hr />

Yes but what do you do if your friend lives 10 or 11 hours behind you. Do you really wanna have to stay awake at 4 or 5 am trying to get them flagged? I think this is a good idea and agree there should be level limits. I really dont give a crap about PoP right now. I think it is just way too crowded. I love going places like CT, Seb and LoY which alot of times are close to empty when i am on. (gmt +2) I see thm opening these zones as a way to clear more of the people out of the other old world zones. I liked when PoP came out cause it gave the &quot;uber&quot; guilds something to do and got them out of the farming business. I remember pre-PoP zoning into  &quot;insert high level zone here&quot; and doing /who and seeing nothing but &lt;UBERGUILD&gt; ( and everything being camped. Then the next day seeing trader&lt;UBERGUILD&gt; with &quot;insert high level item here&quot; x10 and the price being 90-150k. At least now prices seem more reasonable. I also like the fact that they are revamping old zones too.</div></div><hr />

This will make these zones function like the vast majority of other EQ zones.  <br />

<br />
... and I have to disagree here ...<br />
<br />
Back on Rodcet, CT was almost always empty. It was a BYOG zone, but when you did, you usually kicked some serious tail and usually had the zone to yourself (or one or two other groups, TOPS).<br />
<br />
I haven't been to CT on Maelin at all, but judging by the numbers in the Tier 1/2 planes, it's probably empty 90% of the time.<br />
<br />
I do know back on Rodcet, it was NORMAL to see 100 some people in Tranquility, normal to see 60-80 in PoN, normal to see like 25 in PoI, 30 something in PoD, 60 in PoV and like, 6, in PoS. Usually I see like a bard, wizard or druid in PoS and that's IT, both on Rodcet and now on Maelin.<br />
<br />
The server I see this upcoming change impacting the most is Stromm.<br />
<br />
None of the original servers that have been live for over 4 years since EQ launched, but Stromm, being the &quot;newbie server&quot; because it's always at the bottom of the population list on server select, which means either it's hard-coded there (like Stormhammer is at the top, although if that didn't have the lowest population, I'd be surprised) or it truly does have a higher population than Veeshan, Bristlebane, or any of the other servers that are normally spotted &quot;in that neck of the woods&quot;<br />
<br />
Think the overcrowding is bad on your server? Just wait until the Stromm population hits the 50s and starts hitting those Planes ... now that will be crowded.  At least the prior servers (Maelin included) already had guilds in the elementals (or at least close I'd assume) and at least it'll split up the huge rush that'll hit, especially on the new server, especially when the time comes.</div></div><hr />

Needing to work together as a guild to progress in the game is a good thing.  By dumbing the game down, and handing you everything on a plate, they're also taking away some of the great things about EQ.  Things like a bunch of peple spending a few hours of their time to help you.  Things like the sense of achievement you get when a difficult quest or key is completed.<br />
<br />
If a hack came out that granted full planar access, I'm sure people would be going crazy.  But because Sony will give the sheep what they want in return for mo' money, it's all okay.<br />
<br />
Once past the trials, access to the rest of the planes is an amazingly small timesink, when compared to PITAs like the 8th shawl, or the VP/VT keys.  hmm, that's a good point,  I'd like upgraded versions of the 8th shawl and Aid Grimel earring in return for my defunct flags please Sony.  If any dedicated tradeskillers moan, I'll debunk them as 'whiners' and 'idiots'.<br />
<br />
Much of the pre-PoP game will turn DB to 65 soon anyway.  There'll be plenty of places for lazy people to hunt.  They even removed the key from AC you know.  Scurry along, little sheep.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are (considering?) making more zones accessible to more people. That in itself cant be bad.<br />
<br />
Maybe you are mad because those people dont deserve/belong there? Well, let them try out the zone atleast and if its too tough I am sure they will leave again. But if its not I guess the previous block was an artificial one.<br />
<br />
You make it sound like people will just be able to walk up to a mob and make it roll over and give up all the loots. People still have to fight the mobs, they still have to team up with friends, they still have to know how to play the game. All this wont change. Quests will also be the same. But maybe there will be some happy tradeskillers that now have access to zones where items they could use for crafting drops. That doesnt sound bad to me.<br />
<br />
And whats difficulty in EQ? It certainly has very little to do with intelligence. Things are much more often made difficult because of rare items or mobs (or both :P). Having access to zones limited that way  has always seemed like very bad design too me and it seems SoE is starting to see it that way too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Horofaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">Ok If you are worried about ppl being 49 and in Tier 3 planes. All i see out of that is a bunch of corpses in the GY. Come on now. obviously there was a reason why it is a Tier 3 zone. You will not see a lot of noobs or doobs in these zones. and if you do they will not be alive long enough to actually do anything. I am not flagged and i am not planning on going to these zones till I have reached 60 for the teir 2 zones and 65 for the Tier 3 zones. it is a waste of time and energy to go somewhere that is lvl specific and not in your general lvl. <br />
<br />
I am a 55 shaman on the Veeshan Server <br />
<br />
I am proud to hear that the flags are gone and that ppl that have played their chr for years can go to a place that they can hunt and have fun. Ppl that have been 60 for a long time that have been helping other to grow and find out how to play their class. <br />
<br />
I am ashamed to play with a bunch of morons that think that everyone that did not get flagged, that have played for years and didn't wanna get flagged cause they don't wanna jump through hoops to make everyone happy. Don't know how to play thier characters. <br />
<br />
I must admit that i have played for years as a shaman and i am only 55 but I took time to learn the lil things that shamans are best know and not known for. I do know how to play my shaman. But i choose to help others and worry about lvling later. the exp will always be there but friends and family won't. This game was built to be a fun game for EVERYONE to play and lvl TOGETHER.<br />
<br />
Sony came out with PoP. I bought it just so i could use the stones. I had no intenetions of getting flagged till ALL my friends could get flagged.<br />
<br />
I hope i have taught you a little about what the game should be about.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Bloxr Fatso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">Hey everyone, I've had nothing better to do in the past few months while I've been &quot;vacationing&quot; in the &quot;wonderful&quot; country of Saudi Arabia but read every post on the board, yet I have refrained from posting (I'm rather emotional and tend to have no self restraint in cussing).  After reading this post, I cannot help but post my opinion, no matter how pretentious it may be.<br />
<br />
Ok, I started typing a long description of how when I was younger I saved up all my money for a Nintendo when it came out and the only game I had for about a year was Super Mario Brothers, and how it took me a months to beat and how much pride I had that I had beaten it.  But I digress.<br />
<br />
Within the first week of Planes of Power coming out, I, along with most of my guild and most of my friends (who are unguilded, yet skilled players) had access to POS/POV.  This was at 60-61 (most people had max 60 prior to the release of PoP).  After attempting trial of execution multiple times it was easy to figure out that it was a DPS fight, and not a typical long term DPS fight, but a fight that depends no the highest possible damage output as fast as possible.  Ok, I'm rambling now.  Basically what I want to get out is that we could get through this trial with ANY group consisting of a cleric/druid and a tank and ANY 4 other characters that were skilled at their class and doing their part to do the maximum possible damage in the shortest time that they could.<br />
<br />
Then there are the other tier 2 planes.  The PON maze is not easy, but as long as the people going through it have a clue at how to play their class can get access to the lair of Terris Thule (but who really cares unless you plan to kill Terris Thule, this is not an exp zone).  BOT key takes a few of your best friends, I was helping pickup raids with this key prior to my deployment where their best tank would be a warrior with about 4k hp, you in no way need to be uber to gain access to BOT, you just need friends.  CoD, PoTactics, and HoH... I would prefer not to mention those.  If people can't put in the LITTLE amount of time it takes to complete the alternate flagging quest, then how could they manage to level a character to 60+?<br />
<br />
Ok, it's hard for me not to just ramble on.  Honestly I believe that no matter how buggy the flag system may be, it was a very descent way to take the game from a game where you need to be able to level your character and earn plat and buy descent gear in Bazaar to the point where you actually need to have SKILL when grouped/raiding with others in order to progress.  This takes me back to what I was originally going to say about the Nintendo and Super Mario;  I had to work to beat the game.  Nothing was handed to me on a silver platter.<br />
<br />
This is why I seldom post here.  All my posts would come out rather unintelligible when I would choose to reply to something.<br />
<br />
Ignore my post, I think that this change would be complete and utter bull**** and the &quot;reward&quot; that they could give those already flagged for these areas could be nothing more than a buy-off to make the unflagged feel that the flagged have no reason to bicker about the change.  &quot;Afterall they got &lt;insert ridiculous &quot;reward&quot; here&gt;, and once we get the skill of a one armed blind retarded monkey so we can pass the Trial of Execution, we'll get that reward too!&quot;<br />
<br />
To those that this may offend (you one armed blind retarded monkeys), I'm sorry.  (Not really but that almost sounded like a disclaimer.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">How insane is it that the easist place that's high enough tier to find runes for your 65 spells is BoT, where as a shaman you need to be 65 with Malos to stand half a chance of slowing things?  Come on give it some thought people.  The entire tier idea was not well thought out whatsoever, this is just one example.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I'm not looking forward to the Invazion Of Tha D00dz... but the problem lies in the expansion itself and how SOE basically took dumps in boxes, put them on store shelves, and watched us buy them.. not with the removal of the flag system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">removing the flag system is not gonna be the 'Invazion of tha d00dz'.  Why?  The d00dz pretty much are in the ele planes.  Its the n00bz that the invaqsion refers to.  <br />
<br />
There are a ton of reasons why the noobz never progressed to tier 3 planes.  A couple, not in a capable guild, not kissing enough ass, not doing the alt quests, not GOOD ENOUGH players.<br />
<br />
To open up the planes is just a stick in the as$ for those who progressed through this expansion and have been to PoTime or are on the verge.  What you used to have were great spots for the ele guilds to relax on downtime (not that there is much of that) without having to pis$ off the n00bz by mowing through zones.  It was a great social system, seperating the ber from the not-so-ber.<br />
<br />
Instead of a rational, progressive change to the system, they (SOE) agressivly fuq it to the point of why even bother.  THe next step is the opening of the ele. planes as exp zones.  Do you really think they'll stop in tier3?<br />
<br />
No reward is justification enough for a change so obviously motivated by greed and ignorance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">... where as a shaman you need to be 65 with Malos to stand half a chance of slowing things? <br />
<br />
<br />
You don't at all need malos or to be level 65.  I got my BoT flag when I was 62, and have never had a problem slowing anything in there with Malo at that level.  At 65 now, if I'm feeling particularly lazy, or we suddenly have 3 mobs who NEED slowed, I don't even bother casting malo, and I can slow 65% of the mobs without it first try, about 80% 2nd try.<br />
<br />
I think most people are really going overboard.  Are things going to be ... interesting ... for the first couple weeks as people who are too low level come into a few zones?  Yeah, probably.  But after that, it's going to be perfectly fine, just a little more crowded.  You're not going to have a group of level 49's trying to kill mobs in BoT over and over and over.  Noone is that stupid.  And noone is going to group with these people either, they cannot contribute to a group at that level.<br />
<br />
But overall, tier3 zones are NOT that hard.  You don't need an EQ PhD to be &quot;good&quot; enough to play them.  BoT is really no harder than PoV is, short of a slightly easier ability to train yourself with multiple mob pulls.  Hell, if you include that damn proc spiders and golems in the wastes have, BoT mobs are easier to tank.  Tactics maybe a bit of a difference, since 90% of the mobs outside the pit mitigate slow, but people will learn to avoid that real fast.<br />
<br />
It was a great social system, seperating the ber from the not-so-ber.<br />
<br />
How can any planned separation of people be considered a &quot;great social system&quot;?  I don't think this setup was planned.  A lot of people saw it when PoP came out, but SOE, in their infinite wisdom, pretty obviously didn't.  They assumed people would go through the timesinks required to get to better places.  But they've found out people don't like timesinks.  Oh sure, people in the uberguilds will, for their chances at new challenges and new loot.  But casual players, who just play to hang out with friends and explore a bit, aren't going to spend the time required to camp all these pieces.  And for them, if they were foolish enough to go past level 61/62, are stuck in 3-5 zones.  Buying a new expansion shouldn't force you into a cage to enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Man this is getting long.  One last thing, for the person who said &quot;go read the box you bought&quot;, in reference to what you were able to do, mine says:<br />
&quot;20 new planar zones full of scripted events and dynamic content that will challenge the most skilled players&quot;.  To me that doesn't say, &quot;3 zones unless you're in a guild that can kill ubermobs or spend days camping quest pieces&quot;.  I consider myself a rather skilled player (as much as this game requires, anyways), as are the group of friends I play with, but we only have access to 9 of those 20 zones (still 1 piece from HoH flag).  There are plenty of people who are skilled, but don't have a steady group of people or a guild to help with these things.<br />
<br />
I'm indifferent on the change, I've done all my alt quests (but for 1 piece of HoH), but I have a lot of friends who haven't been able to finish them or get in on a raid killing a mob.  It'll be nice to be able to group with them again.  Also people who plays alts who are 55+, the pain in the ass of flagging someone's 2nd character is even worse than the first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">Gotta love the people who foolishly believe &quot;but that'll never happen&quot;.<br />
<br />
Noobs will go in these zones, and noobs WILL train the graveyard constantly, and they WILL be annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">plan and simple we need more places to go to. opening up all the planes steps on the toes of a certain class of people. not that they are better or worse , but a percent of people that like to exp in a area where people generaly dont act stupid, where everyone knows each other and most importantly , knows who to NOT group with. I think if they do this then some alt revamps are in order. Im sorry but veksar doesnt excite me one bit. If i understand the layout of it, its all under water, which means that is basicly a wasted zone that no one will go to  to exp and only if it has really nice loot will it even be used at all. Casters hate water enviroments, period.<br />
<br />
I think a slight adjustment to CT might be good. Not alot , just raise the level of the mobs a few and put a bonus for exping there so it comes close to CoD or PoV based experience. I means its a high end zone anyway, why not make it into what it was intended to be anyway. I think revamping some old zones that are proven to have 0 traffic anymore would be a nice idea too, ala CT. Why not make a dungeon, yes a good old fasion chardok style dungeon in the middle of Nek Forest, that place is just screaming to be expanded upon if you ask me. How about bringing in the story of the combine city in the lost vally ? Here you have a city filled with spires, make them go places. Make them teleport you to the center of the planet where ancient creatures long since forgotten come to life, or even rip off  LoTR and go into a abandon mountain city where &quot;the dwarves dug to deep and too greedily&quot;  is now over run with high level goblins/orcs and has a balrog style boss that could even be made into some sorta event. Not like nothing in EQ isnt borrowed from LoTR anyway.<br />
<br />
SoE built a trap for themselves, they made you able to get to 65 and made it easy ( now even easier ). Now i agree that 65 isnt the only level that matters and i do again agree lower level content needs to be looked at all the time, but it cant be denied that they have certainly created a division of EQ players that simply have NO where to go and for this they MUST create content for them otherwise a feeling of &quot; we beat the game i guess , whats next to play&quot; will seep into all at the 65ish stage of the game.</div></div><hr />

People in smaller guilds don't need PoP.  I could care less about it myself and I have a lot of flags.  PoP simply sucks, the loot is horrid unless you are in a large uber raiding guild.  <br />
<br />
If they reworked the experience and loot tables in Luclin and places like Cazic Thule, Sebilis, etc. there would be no reason to change the flag requirements in PoP.  <br />

When they made the experience rewared so high for PoP they basically &quot;forced&quot; everyone to go there.  Redistribute the experience reward to other zones and people will go back to them.</div></div><hr />

Arrogant?  Why yes, it sure sounds that way.  When did we say that ANYBODY not flagged is a n00b?  Are you saying there are no n00bz in tier 1/2?  That's one of the things I like about going deep into Tactics or BoT, is I don't see the same trains that I do in PoV and PoN.  The people who are now in there tend to be the ones who can handle the mobs.  After all, they had to make it through the guild quest or a long alt quest.<br />
<br />
We went back time and time and time again to flag people left behind.  And now, all the time we spent is moot.  How would you like it if Can V was handed out at level 60 for free?  In this game, effort + risk = reward.  When SOE takes out the first two elements and leaves the third, those of us who did it &quot;the old way,&quot; have a right to feel upset.  <br />

Going in deep into either of those zones is still gonna take skill. It will be the same as with all zones, the idiots will hang out by the zone lines, the rest of us will still be able to find a nice quiet camp in deep. For me it will just mean that when someone that doesn't log on often comes back to play, we'll be able to take him to a nicer spot w/o having to worry about flags. My problem hasn't been doing the alternate quests as much as getting all the people that don't play much any more to get on for getting the group flags. We just did 18 people for CoD and a couple still got left out. Now no need to go back and do those. <br />
<br />
We went back time and time and time again to flag people left behind.  And now, all the time we spent is moot. <br />
<br />
... and now, no more going back and flagging the rest! Shrug, I'm not one of those that wasted 100s of hours on the trials, I got carried through by some friends in our resident uberguild. Flagging isn't anything more than a damn time sink and just because I wasted my time doesn't mean I wish it on my friends.</div></div><hr />

How many boring-ass, contrived flag quests/encounters did you need to do to get access to ToV?  Kael?  Skyshrine?  SolB?  Permafrost?  Right, none.  <br />
<br />
Once again, my mind simply boggles at the fact that our society has such pathetically low expectations for people that there are apparently sane individuals out there who think that EQ takes any significant amount of skill to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u120"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p120">And you really think it's not going to see 50 times more trains when anyone can go there?<br />
<br />
No, I dont think it'll be 50 times worse. I think too many people here, at SteelWarriors, and on our server boards are buying into that hysteria without even thinking about it logically. Yeah, the first few days there will be some lookie-Lous, and of course some trains...but there are trains and sub-60 people there now, I guarantee you. People that cant handle it wont stay for long. No level 46 warriors or clerics are going to be trying to hunt in your Tactics pickup group...that is completely absurd if you really think about it.<br />
<br />
It's rather telling that a lot of the people I see in favor of this change are guild leaders like myself. We're the ones who know what a pain in the ass all this flagging is, and how much stress and inner turmoil it has caused for some guilds.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u121"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p121">I am of two minds regarding this. I have all the flags they are opening up but torment.(real raid flags, not quested alt flags)<br />
<br />
First mind) Oh great.. all that work to get into zones less filled with fscking morons down the drain, now in 2 weeks all the lamers will be trying to xp in tier 3 and ruining the place, and on a pvp server like I am.. all the gimp mb squad lamers will be pulling their zone in.. click hotkey.. click zone out bs in all the good zones now. Thanks for dumbing down the game so all the gimps can go anywhere.<br />
<br />
Mind two)bout fn time. Im sorry.. but flagging is the most asstacular thing SOE has ever invented. It wouldnt irritate me that much if the alt quests would let you progress along the storyline.. but they dont.. they reserved that honor solely for the zergalicious, bending over everyone else without a tube of lube. They made the most common xp zones 60+ behind a giant cockblock, and the sad **** is that its not other players pulling the cockblock.. its the stupid game itself, for no real purpose other then to coddle some peoples senses of accomplishment. PoJ trials are ass, I passed my second try.. but they are still ass. It doesnt take a great deal of skill to pass a PoJ trial.. just some nice DPS. Grats DPS heavy classes. It doesnt take mad tactics to flag people for BoT. 3 druids a cleric and a warrior can flag 18 people every 8(?) hours =p. What is the point of flags again? For half the zones there the flags are merely a way to let the top guilds have personal playgrounds, not an indication of &quot;deserving to be in a zone&quot;.<br />
<br />
Im sorry.. but saying a 65th(insert class here) doesnt belong in X zone because &quot;They dont deserve it maan.. they dont have the skillz cause they didnt team up with 9 groups of their closest friends to zerg Y mob man.. unskilled newbs! How dare they invade my personal playground!&quot; Sorry but anyone of this mind can proptly shove their pc tower into their nether regions and die.<br />
<br />
Flags are the absolute worst thing Sony EVER put into everquest. Flags must die a horrible flaming death and then burn in hell for eternity afterwards.<br />
<br />
level 50s dont do NTOV, they can technically get there.. but they just dont do it. And not because there is some magical cockblock that doesnt let them in. Most pop zones are XP zones, not ST/VT loot pinatas. I dont particularly have a problem with elemental loot and potime bs being keyed and whatnot.. but how dare they.. HOW DARE THEY HOW DARE THEY **** HOW DARE THEY sell an expansion for money where all the XP zones worth anything are locked behind invisible barriers. It is nothing short of a CRIME against the playerbase in general.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u129"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p129">POP was designed as a raid expansion, it was marketed that way.  If you think you deserve to be able to go everywhere without a guild you're wrong.  No one made you buy the expansion, no one made you level to 65 and lose all the old xp spots.<br />
<br />
My guild has struggled pretty hard with some POP fights and I think it's really stupid that the time and effort we've been putting in is being freely handed to everyone that shelled out $25.  The &quot;reward&quot; they're going to give us for our effort will not make up for the loss of the semi-exclusive xp zones we spent the time and energy to get into.  And yes, I'm quite certain that tactics/BOT/HOH will all be just about unusable as xp zones thanks to all the trains from sucky players that don't deserve to be there.<br />
<br />
They call them tiers for a reason, they were designed to seperate guilds and players.  If you want to xp with your non guilded friends you can go visit them in PoNightmare.<br />
<br />
The other option to EARN your way into tier 2/3 is do the alternate quests, which probably take less man hours than the much larger scale guild raids for the same zone access.  Quite a few people have done that work and EARNED their way into tier 2/3 xp zones (Hiya Gwain and Henora)</div></div><hr />

I then dont have a problem with them adjusting quests and making them a bit easier.  What I do have a problem with is handing on a plate what I have spent months working for.<br />
<br />
This change is actually gonna stuff over the middle levels guilds the most.  Elemental plane access wont change so the uber guilds are fine, lower level raid targets wont change, but the sudden competition on middle level raid targets is going to going to get a hell of a lot bigger.  On top of that is those guilds that want to try the scripted events with no chance of completing them thus removing the chance for others to do them.  We have a couple of guilds on our server that have wiped on MB multiple times because they dont have the numbers, the skill (not that I thought it needed much but was proved wrong), nor the strategy to do the encounter, which then removes the chance for others to do it.  They arent just doing it once,but do it time after time after time, killing anyone elses chances.  Now they are gonna get to do the same to HoH trials, Caprin, Bertoxx if they ever get there.<br />
<br />
People saying there wont be the trains? Rubbish, it is already getting bad with some of the people that are finally getting into BoT after getting rotting parts in PoS.  I have noticed the number of trains in there getting progressively worse and worse, and cant see that getting any better.  Cant wait to zone into tactics to a wall of mobs pulled to the zone on top of people rezing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u134"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p134">I like the idea of opening more content to players not in a high-end raiding guild in principle, but there are some issues that this change would cause that bother me greatly.  I suppose I should note that I am a member of a high-end raiding guild.  I have killed all of the flagging targets up to Rallos Zek, and will be entering Tier IV likely within a week - so not much of this directly affects me.  That doesn't mean that I don't care about what happens to other part of this game.  And it doesn't mean that I think other players are &quot;d00dz&quot; or unworthy of getting their money out of this expansion - 4 zones of content was a raw deal.<br />
<br />
That said, here are the problems I see:<br />
<br />
General problems<br />
1. Initial Chaos<br />
Life is going to be very messy in all these zones for at least the first 2 weeks.  Yeah, eventually people will fall back to the hardest content at their level of competance, skill, and power - but that's gonna take some time, and nobody is going to like the chaos that will reign until that gets sorted out.<br />
<br />
2. Zone Size<br />
Flatly, most of these zones were designed with the idea that they would have restricted access.  There just isn't much room in them.  Valor, for all that people laud it, isn't very big at all.  Outer cave, inner cave, left castle, right castle, and lever - and the zone is full.  You can squeeze groups at frogs and maybe steps (no one hunts undead or guards) - but that's still looking at 36-42 people for comfortable capacity, where everyone gets spawns at a steady rate.  Yet we often see 60-80 in Valor.  And many of these zones have less available space than that.  As people try to push to the bigger, harder, flashier locales, there will be serious overcrowding issues.<br />
<br />
3. Flagging Mobs<br />
A lot of people here have assumed that because, for example, Aerin'Dar will no longer be needed to enter Halls of Honor, that the flag from Aerin'Dar will no longer be needed to enter Temple of Marr (HoH-B).  I posit that will not be the case; completing the three Trials of Honor without having killed Aerin'Dar will result in the message &quot;While you have fought with Honor, you lack the Valor to enter the Temple of Marr&quot; when you attempt to zone in (you receive this message if you meet those conditions now, in fact).  Many of these events are blowable, others interfere with non-raid groups.  I'll try to detail these below, also, but suffice to say, without changes to the zone structure, several places may get very messy.<br />
<br />
Bastion of Thunder<br />
1. Training<br />
Bastion of Thunder probably has the greatest potential to be a training nightmare with this change.  Its not really very hard to get a group that can take a giant, even a group that is lower level than current BoT residents.  But this zone is already crowded, and the influx will push people into less optimal pulling spots.  Combined with the random AEs in zone, and the difficulty in splitting mob in many (most?) wings, *especially* water, and a lower level group can get into trouble fast.  This is compounded by the easily-trainable nature of BoT - linear wings set around the zoneout is a nice layout, but makes training tempting, and easy.  Most newcomers won't train, of course - but we all learned in Karnor's that it only takes one.<br />
<br />
Crypt of Decay<br />
1. Carpin Script<br />
The Carpin Script (or whatever your server calls the quest for the key to lower ruins) is the poster child for blowable content.  Carpin Deatharn isn't really THAT hard - a 2 group endevour can probably pull this off.  And that blows the event.  Without a revamp to the way this zone works, getting keys to visit Bertox downstairs is going to be very, very challenging.<br />
<br />
2. Zone Size<br />
This is also the poster child zone for zone size problems.  Where exactly are more than about 2 groups going to FIT in here?<br />
<br />
Halls of Honor<br />
1. Honor Trials<br />
The Honor Trials are blowable.  One group can easily kill the Trial mob and spawn the Custodian.  They're in for a surprise, and will likely die, but that won't stop people from doing it.  Competition for Honor Trials is already steep on a lot of servers; an influx of people messing about with the quest givers won't help.  The fact that they look just like the normal mobs and have similar names to the occasional rares in here won't help prevent accidental attacks on the Trial givers, either.<br />
<br />
2. Zoneline Griefing<br />
Its really, really easy to mess up the entrance to HoH-A, a fact I am reluctant to admit here, even.  Some mobs see invis, and trains so equipped are nasty, but beyond that, some of the &quot;bruiser crew&quot; of mobs in here (Undead Inhabitant, etc.) don't reset to their spawn when moved.  Some of them can see invis, too ... and a see invis Undead Inhabitant parked at the zoneline effectively makes zoning in instant death until GM intervention.  Unless this is altered, I can't wait to see people who think this is funny - or who want to deny content to others.  Its happened before with just the people in Honor who keyed or flagged in; it'll be really exciting when anyone 46+ can do it.<br />
<br />
Plane of Storms/Plane of Valor <br />
While Valor is going to be more crowded than a 100 man raid on Beholder's Maze, I actually support this idea.  The Justice Trials (while *not* hard, I promise) are artificially slow, and tended to be a chokepoint.  And, really, its not like these 2 planes have anything that is either blowable or horridly destructive.  They are just nice zones.  Okay, okay ... people COULD haul the spawned bosses (Drornok or Ston'Ruok) to the ZI to *really* grief people (they don't reset), but that's more work that your typical player is going to go to - even the kind that do this sort of thing.<br />
<br />
Plane of Tactics<br />
1. Rallos Script<br />
This is a problem even NOW.  The Rallos script kills people ALL OVER the place.  The spawned Tallon in particular shoot people through walls at times, sometimes as far away as the ring around the pit (or the pit itself).  I have a neat screenshot somewhere of being blasted for 2764 by Tallon while in the pit, soloing.  The problem will be a lot worst with a lot more people here.  And I cannot imagine the carnage when someone spawns Rallos Zek the Warlord and all the players who didn't heed the warnings (if they were given) or who &quot;wanted to watch&quot; stayed in the pit.<br />
<br />
2. Zoneline Griefing<br />
The side paths that lead to Vallon and Tallon don't have signs warning people that the mobs there kill.  But drag a Henshin Shadow Master to the zoneline and watch folks die as they zone in.  Bring that named guy (whose name escapes me - he pops near ZI *anyway*) for even more fun.  And even if a group is pulling these who can kill them, it ought to be fun to watch the &quot;Vallon wing&quot; group accidently kill off the &quot;pit ledge&quot; group when a Henshin Shadow Master does that funny AE super-knockback and sends them spiraling to their death in the pit below.  Oh - and did I forget to mention that split mobs parked at the ZI are really, really bad?<br />
<br />
Torment, the Plane of Pain <br />
1. Uselessness<br />
This plane will still never see the light of day.  The mobs are too hard for not enough.  Oh, and there isn't much room either.  Spare people who aren't racing for elementals access to this plane - they may not know it, but they'll be thankful for the locked entrance. =)</div></div><hr />

I like your Idea.  Really I do, but......GOOD LUCK getting groups.  If you're not the only slower you might be ok.  If you ARE...you'll be resisted just about everytime and once the group figures out that you are 55- they are going to boot you.  Like i said, I like your idea of leeching.  If it works and doesn't affect group performance go for it.  I myself NEVER group with anyone who is /anon or /roleplay unless I know them.  It's not that I'm too high and mighty....FAR from it.  It's just that with the levels and abilities of PoP mobs..you HAVE to know your party's strengths AND weaknesses.

If you can't handle a quest to get into tactics that took me a grand total of 4 hours to do (and that was for 2 groups of tactics flags, till we redo behemoth) then you don't have the patience to be playing EQ.<br />
<br />
The people who will be in these zones have no business playing there, and having to weed them out of the people who DO belong there will be a pain, and will be detrimental to my playing time.<br />
<br />
I say this again. If you can't handle such a pitifully easy trial like the Trial of Execution, you have no business in anything higher than what you are flagged for now. You're just going to waste people's time when you get there without having gone through the trial.<br />
<br />
<br />
Small mindedness like this is WHY this change is good.  There are SO many people who aren't in guilds who would LOVE access to some of these zones.  Getting a pickup group for trials......done all the time on Fennin....and there's usually about 4 64+ pushing through the 58- crowd.

We are casual and the problem is not that we cannot do them (for tier 2 at least), its that being casual we do not have enough opportunity.  <br />
<br />
3 weeks I scheduled raids on Behemoth/Grummus, whoever was up we would go for.  Grummus was the only one up so we went for him, got him to around 27% but learned so much we felt he would be a pushover the 2nd time.  2nd week Behemoth was the only one up so we went for him, again we lost, maybe at 37% or so, but also felt like we learned enough to beat him with another try or two.  3rd week, neither was up, some uber guild swept Grummus before our scheduled raid.  Make it so they are up more frequently or can do them in different rooms or something.<br />
<br />
This isnt PvP, I dont feel like I should have to race to everything to get in on the action of the game.  Its PvE and everyone should get a chance to experience things, not just the people that have more time on their hands.<br />
<br />
Same thing goes with the PoJ trials, if they are too hard, dumb them down slightly (personally with the right level group they are challenging, but not over hard).  I think the real problem with the trials is the waiting, get rid of the 30 min thing and also make it like the hedge maze, let 10 groups go in different rooms to do the same thing.</div></div><hr />

I really don't approve of the abuse of power by big guilds, even though I am in one.  I really don't like the senseless slaughter of people - they are paying for the game, too.  But ... if there are something like 200 people in Tactics when it gets opened, it would be a guilty pleasure to watch a high-end guild launch the Rallos script and see just *how* many people the spawned Tallon Zek thinks are in aggro range. =)<br />
<br />
Edit: For the love of life people - when I start a statement by saying how much I disapprove of the very action I'm talking about, use really exaggerated numbers, and end with a smiling-face emoticon, it means I'm trying to be humorous.  I should not have to have a -&gt;sarcasm here&lt;- tag at the front of posts where its present.  I don't seriously intend that people should trigger this pain-in-the-hindquarters event just to kill people experiencing in the zone (although that's what happens when its triggered for legitimate reasons...).

This is a very very min-max oriented view on what to do in EQ. Not everyone always goes to zones where you are at the limit of what can be done. This change enables more people to try out &quot;hard&quot; stuff while taking none of the old less-than-ideal content away.</div></div><hr />

I don't feel that people should be given auto access to planes, there are two methods of entry for all planes intended to be for xp, it's not that hard to pregress, but it should be a gimme.<br />

Except the access we get won't be earned.  Stepping into PoV for the first time made the dozens of trials I tried all worth it, I felt I had achieved something, same as it will be when we get flagged for Bot/Hoh.<br />

<br />
What is less than ideal?  PoV/PoS is just about what I can stand as far as xp'ing.  I could probably do BoT, but until I earned the key, why should I.  Maybe I'm odd, but I think people should earn things and not just be given.  it's part of the game to earn what you achieve.</div></div><hr />

Do you remember velious?  There was very little content in Velious that was keyed.  Take a zone like ToV, which for a while was considered fairly difficult.  Did you feel that people who were doing ToV didn't earn their access to that content because they didn't spend hours working on some key part just to access the zone?<br />

Anyway, I'm flagged for most of which will be open, but I'm frankly not heartbroken over the change. There is a class of people who play this game called PART-TIMERS. We are no less dedicated, skilled or game savvy, but because of jobs, spouses (omgz) and children, we don't play 12 hours a day. I got some of those flags while sitting at work because, well even tho I play 40+ hours a week, it's at a fixed time while mobs are random. Thx guild palos~<br />
<br />
Flags would have worked better if they accomodated people like me. If flags were more trial-like, key-like (I have my VP-ST-VT keys) or even ring-like, then you could collect the forces needed at --&gt; ANY TIME &lt;-- demonstrate you're not a noob, kill schtuff and get flagged. But, many times for flagging you are at the mercy of odd spawntimes, a guild killing mob X for the loot or a larger guild retroflagging or preventing you from killing it and getting flagged. <br />
<br />
I must confess, I'm a bit lost tho. The already put in flag quests, then expanded those flag quests, then made those group-wide quests. Isn't that enough? What's the issue here?<br />
<br />
Read this if nothing else:<br />
<br />
In my mind, don't remove the flags from those zones, just make the quest flag work as if you killed the mob so the person can progress to the top end easier without making their guild bottom feed. And if you can't/won't kill AD --&gt; AND &lt;-- don't want to do the HoH quest, then I'm sorry but I have no pity. Do one or the other. But, if you don't want to do the CoD quest because you still need to kill Grummus at some point, then I think you have a valid complaint as the quests are useless -- which they are as they stand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u155"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p155">&quot;And the threats about starting certain events to kill off a bunch of &quot;newbs&quot; really shows how much class the people that have access to the zones now have.&quot;<br />
<br />
A lot of the events will be triggered accidently.  Honor Trials start when you kill a mob not much harder than an XP mob (and in the same room as them)..  Carpin Deatharn's script in CoD is startable by 2 groups, and a 1-group force with a charming necro might pull it off too.  Most people haven't even *heard* of the Carpin script; they aren't going to know.  Heck, the stomach event in Torment is so easy to blunder into that the first time I took a 2 group exploration team into Torment we realized in the middle of it that we'd triggered an event.  And we knew the event existed!  (At least that one is safe, no one will use Torment in anything near its current state).<br />
<br />
My comments about Tactics and the Rallos script aren't meant to imply that it will be launched intentionally to kill people (its too hard to start up to do that) - and my one comment about the guilty pleasure of watching triggered-Tallon gun down 200 people is made in jest (its more a comment about the inane bugginess of the script that the people entering Tactics).  But people *do* use the Rallos script, and often.  Your part of the game may be the experience mobs in Tactics - but other people use the Rallos script as their part of the game.  It *should* be fair to use both.  But its not.  Launching the Rallos script is a guartanteed death for anyone in the pit.  It also puts into danger anyone on the ledge around the pit and in certain parts of the tunnels downstairs, depending on how out of whack it is feeling that day.  This is a problem now.  There are already threads on other boards that the Rallos Zek event shuts down the utility of Tactics for 2 hours.  Imagine if any time someone did Venril Sathir's Remains in Karnor's Castle, everyone else in zone took 2500 damage - because that's what is going on here.<br />
<br />
My complaints about these zones largely assume that people are competent players who are not intending to ruin the game for others.  I did note places where a griefer can cause serious damage (like HoH-A), but problems like the ease of training in BoT (where patrolling casters can gate and bring back 10 adds, or where mobs in the Wind wing can aggro through the floor) or the lack of space in CoD or the ability for experience groups to deny raiding guilds content (which is as bad as the other way around - fair is fair, after all) are all problems that can happen accidently.  They are the result of large numbers of people - of any type - having access to zones that were intended by the designers to have limited numbers of people in them.<br />
<br />
&quot;This change enables more people to try out &quot;hard&quot; stuff while taking none of the old less-than-ideal content away.&quot;<br />
<br />
A lot of people seem to believe that the problem I describe are a fiction crafted by high-end raiders and &quot;wannabe-uber guilds&quot;.  As evidence that this is not the case ... does anyone remember the Runnyeye revamp?  For two weeks there were 150 people in that zone on every server ... and then folks realized there was nothing there and went home.  Does anyone remember the Cazic-Thule revamp?  Every day there were 150 people in that zone on every server ... and they *stayed* there, because the XP and loot were better there than elsewhere.  The only reason that CT isn't still full is that PoP XP is better.  Now, imagine opening Tactics (the best of the zones being opened, RZ script aside).  There will be 150 people in that zone, because its better xp and better loot than the alternatives.  They will be there even if they die (I remember stacks and stacks of corpses at CT ZI).  People trained CT stuff around all the time ... and the worst stuff in CT has a rain spell or AE slow.  The worst stuff in Tactics divides into 2 identical copies when slain or creates a huge AE + dispell + the largest knockback you've ever seen.<br />
<br />
I really do think that the non-raiding playerbase needs a way to get more of their money out of this expansion.  I am not at all certain that this is the best way to deal with it.  At the very least, I'd suggest opening zones in stages.  Start by opening Valor and Storms - see if those zones can survive the change in playerbase.  If that works, then a few weeks later open Thunder and Honor.  Those zones are a bit harder, and a lot more complicated - with a lot more than can go wrong when filled with those inexperienced with the zone.  If that works ... maybe consider opening Crypt of Decay, but please make it so that the Carpin script is not blowable by experience groups (for what its worth FOR the experience groups - if Carpin is up, half the zone in essentially unusable for experience, too).  Don't open Torment at all (trust me when I keep saying ... you do not ever want to use this zone - I am not being elitist ... I wish *I* never had to use this zone).  Don't open Tactics either - instead, make Tactics more accessible by making the Behemoth slightly easier (perhaps lower the spider rate and tone down his stupid AE a bit), but letting him respawn more often (24 hours on success, 1 hour on failure), allowing more people access to him.  That way, someone would have to succeed at at least one PoP-style raid, and be a bit better prepared for the complexities that can happen in Tactics.<br />
<br />
As a final note - I am certain that the designers of this expansion didn't intend to permanently deny content to most of the playerbase.  Open and sponsored raids on Vox and Nagafen are still common.  Open raids on many other targets occur; which targets are popular varies by server.  Open and sponsored raids *should* have been viable in PoP.  Aerin'Dar is a pretty easy open raid target (the skills involved are kiting and rooting adds and blasting a dragon - things that are easy to coordinate on an open raid), and is done this way on some servers.  Before I joined the raiding guild I am with now, I got Honor access this way.  Grummus isn't too bad as an open raid either.  Terris Thule would probably be open raid material if not for the Hedge Maze event ... but I assure you - that is there for YOUR protection; you do not want to go to Torment.  Bastion of Thunder keys are doable with 3 groups; I have seen 18 people in Storms spontaneously communicate and organzie miniboss hits for key components.  Admittedly, the Behemoth event is just not structured well for an open raid, but that event has its own issues, and the Tactics alternate key is not difficult, especially now that it keys a group!  Planes of Power was intended to require cooperation; it did exclude by apparent intention people who have no friends in this game and prefer to play in a nearly solitary and antisocial manner - but the entire game is so designed.  Its a massively multiplayer game, after all.  What failed to happen was the sense of cooperation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u156"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p156">FYI, I'm the foremost advocate and hard worker when it comes to flagging people in my guild. I'm the one who's been pushing for it. I'm the one who's got people to do it. So lets try to assume less, and learn more.<br />
<br />
Then extend the same courtesy to everyone else and quit assuming the majority of unflagged people are morons who cant play. That's just as idiotic as assuming that the majority of those who already are flagged do know how to play. They dont. That's just as stupid as thinking large guilds are more skilled than medium or small guilds. They arent, they're just bigger and that gives them more ready resources to pull from at any given moment. That's all.<br />
<br />
My experience observing large guilds in action has been that most of them lack organization and common courtesy. They're like the proverbial bull in a china shop, and half the time a drunk bull that doesnt know where it's going. And when I look at the rosters of the large guilds on my server I see a sprinkling of a few old schoolers here and there, but the rest are powerleveled twinks, powerleveled newbies, and a bunch who think they are old school but I was level 50 buffing their ass when they were fighting polar bear cubs with splintering clubs. That last category is the majority of EQ players today, but they're quickly losing ground to the 'powerleveled' (read gimped EQ) newbies.<br />
<br />
Honesty doesnt win you friends, because most people cant stomach the truth. And the honest truth in this case is that you people are just upset because you think this proposed change takes away your hard work and sense of accomplishment (superiority). That cant be taken from you, because it's yours already. <br />
<br />
Dont kid yourself (and us) about this supposed newbie invasion in tier 2 and 3 if they remove the flags. That's utter bull****, and we know it and you know it. And if you feel like triggering the Rallos script after this change just to see how much chaos ensues; then you're the problem. Not them.<br />
<br />
And, Foggy, I freely admit I'm an arrogant bastard. I'm also tactless and a dictator when leading raids. Ask anyone in my guild and they'll tell you so. But despite that I have their respect as a leader because I am unselfish, truthful, and loyal to the people who wear my clan name, and when I lead we are usually successful where we have watched other larger guilds fail. So, yes, I am elite, but I am the farthest thing from a d00d that you'll find. So you can shove your disparaging remark tenderly up your ass.</div></div><hr />

If you think that sitting around in an outdoor zone being spoonfed xp is the exact same level of difficulty as the trials then obviously lifting a 500lb boulder is the same as lifting a plastic spoon in your world.  I tip my hat to you, ur uber.<br />

I would agree that the trials are not a cockblock, but the rest of the quests are.  Requiring camping of rare key parts for run of the mill xp content is rediculous.<br />
<br />
And replace my ToV example with Traks Lair in Kunark.  No cockblocks to that content, why not?  That was a premier xp spot for a good long while (don't even count the sebilis key, everyone knows how easy that is).</div></div><hr />

I plan on taking him as high as I can get, assuming I don't get too bored with the game or other RL things don't interfere too badly. I've never seen planar content and have never seen Vox or Naggy. I would like to be able to. My problem is that my playing style is casual and exclusively solo. That being the case, there are probably some mobs I will never see - such as Vox or Naggy - unless I change my style. However, I payed for ALL of EQ, just like everyone else, and there was no clear mention that certain content could not be accessed without help from others (and sometimes many others). I can see that certain mobs aren't soloable, but not zones. Since I'm not planar level yet, I haven't had much reason to voice complaints.<br />
<br />
For those of you that worked to get the various planar keys, it kind of boggles me that the experience of playing EQ was less of what you wanted than simply having the keys and claiming the exclusive rights to certain things. It's not your game to have an exclusive right to any part of it. I suppose we'll have to differ on our opinions on that aspect of the game.<br />
<br />
However, I am concerned about an aspect of deleting the flags that has been mentioned in this thread, but not really discussed. If SOE changes the old world or other zones so that 60-65 levels can now get experience from mobs as low as 40-46, the middle level game is going become as screwed up just as much as everyone thinks the planes will become. Right now most of the old world is relatively quiet. But can you imagine a small group of 65s blasting their way through SolA, Nurga, or any other mid-level zone? You go to do some killing in DL and nothing is there. A group of 65s goes to KC and runs through tossing some AEs here and there just to see if they can kill the whole zone en mass.<br />
<br />
I think SOE is taking the wrong road with flags. There should never be any real flags for progression. You progress through higher level content. SOE needs to add more zones for 60-65. This was the game model they started with. It's the one used for the expansions. And it's the one they need to keep. Anything else will just get a bunch of people upset, like now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I (and several others) keep making the analogy to the hybrid experience penalty. How many of the people currently flagged for tier 2+ levelled from 1 to 60 without that penalty? How many did it with access to a 2k FBSS and a weapon with a ratio better than 0.5? Should those of us who had to level with an experience penalty, dying without even the hope of an experience rez, with hitpoints and AC equal to a ranger, without the 2handed damage bonus, etc. etc. look at THOSE people as noobs?<br />
<br />
Should we have fought to keep the hybrid penalty in place because WE had to level with it? Should we fight against the introduction of spells like Ethereal Cleansing because WE didn't have those spells, so why should you? Should a person who did the Ro quests when they required blacksmithing and the spawns were exceedingly rare have fought to keep those changes from being made? Further, should someone who went through those things get some kind of reward for having &quot;suffered&quot; through them?<br />
<br />
Part of EQ is that things get easier. There's a double edged sword - those who do something early will usually have the hardest time doing it. They don't have the equipment that later folks will have, they don't have access to information, etc. They also reap the greatest rewards - they get equipment to use and they get to sell things for outrageous prices when they are new. So they both benefit and they a harder time.<br />
<br />
People who come later may have a much easier time, but the rewards are not as great. By the time I could fight in places where bronze armor dropped (medium sized, at least), bronze armor was vendor loot - yet people payed a lot of platinum for bronze armor when it first started appearing on the market. There's an inherent advantaged to getting somewhere first.<br />
<br />
This is a good change for the majority of players. It is indeed going to be painful for some people to have competition in their hunting grounds, but the very idea that that competition somehow doesn't &quot;deserve&quot; to be there is ridiculous. Hell, people were upset when Panamah was gathering groups of casual players together to get flagged for the higher planes - they were &quot;gimping&quot; their way through by &quot;zerging.&quot; It sure seems that for many people in that position, it IS elitism.</div></div><hr />

The worst offenders by far are 1) the blowability of Carpin and Honor Trials (problem for the raiding guilds not already past these), 2) the tendancy of the Rallos Zek script to slaughter experience groups wholesale - often by accident (problem for everyone, but mostly zone-newcomers),  3) the possibility of non-pathing mobs becoming stuck near the only ZI to certian zones - primarily HoH and PoTac (problem for everyone), and 4) how bad Torment sucks (not a problem, really - it'll just still be empty. =P ).<br />
<br />
If they fix these problems by redoing the Carpin setup somehow, making the Honor Trials mobs respawn quickly if the Custodian of Marr is allowed to despawn instead of dying, preventing the Rallos-script edition of Tallon Zek from shooting people not in the event area, and doing something about the pathing for the Undead Inhabitants and Recuso Degenerates in Honor ... then I'd be a pretty universal supporter of this change.  Things in Tactics will still be nasty when someone lets a Shadow Master loose, and Rallos Zek the Warlord will *still* slaughter experience players by the handful - but, really, there are things like that in a lot of zones, and we make do. =)<br />
<br />
Torment will still be empty, of course ... nothing save a rewrite is fixing that place. =P</div></div><hr />

<br />
I must have missed the part where we asked for this change. Was there some big petition on the boards someplace?<br />
<br />
Sony says, 'Hey, we're getting rid of these flags. It was a bad idea because it caused problems for the players and guilds and we didnt mean to separate people from their friends.'<br />
<br />
I, and others, say, 'Cool, good idea.'<br />

But it's going to create a hell of a lot more mid50s pretending they can handle tier 2 mobs. <br />
I can see the good sides and the bad sides, before I was flagged anywhere I would have loved this b/c I felt left out of it b/c my guildys could go palces I couldn't and it did put me off logging on sometimes, but then again the trains are bad enough in tier 1 zones, they don't need them in tier 2. Just make the trials a little easier but still something to do.<br />
Although what will be next? Free epics for anyone 60+ who still hasn't got it? :p <br />

A small price to pay.  Those unwilling to pay it, don't deserve the rewards IMHO.  I've not implied anyone is a noob or a beggar.  Lazy?  Perhaps.<br />

<br />
Then what hard work and effort are you all claiming to be cheapened? What do you deserve compensation for? Should I get compensation because when I started going to Hate, all the mobs had pets and that combined with the bad pathing made virtually any pull an outright train? Should I get compensation because when I leveled up to 50 there was no Kunark, no Dreadlands, no Paludal Caverns, no Planes of Power with all their outrageous ZEMs? Should I get compensation because I leveled up to 60 before they removed the hell levels?<br />
<br />
Let me remind you again, before you (in the plural sense, not you specifically Juff - although you have) start insinuating I'm a lazy ass because I support this change; I already did the Justice trials (many times). I already have all but one medallion to get my BoT flag, and have helped many others finish theirs. I've been flagged for Tactics for a couple months now. <br />
<br />
I am the guildleader of a guild that has been rock solid for 3 years, until Planes of Power. I am the one who hears all the concerns and problems from my guildmembers, so I know what, who, and where the problems in my guild are coming from. The select few people outside my guild that I associate with are guildleaders of our allied guilds and we have all seen the exact same thing happening. I've seen the exact same things posted here and on other class message boards. Do you think we are all making this **** up? Did you READ the reason Sony stated they were making this change?<br />
<br />
Go ahead and say that if guilds break up because of Planes of Power, then there were already problems in the guild. That's a handy excuse..for the ignorant. You dont know anything about me or my guild and it's history as one of the oldest guilds around. If I say Planes of Power caused problems, caused us to lose members which never happened before; I'd say I'm probably a pretty good authority on that one. If my other guildleader allies tell me they are having similiar problems, and all their level 60's leave for larger guilds and half of those remaining quit the game...I'd say they probably know what the hell they're talking about when it comes to their own guilds. If 3 semi-large established raiding guilds on my server all fold in the space of a month or two since this expansion came out, you kinda wonder. If you dont think this would lead to a good number of people quitting the game, and Sony seeing that and thinking 'Whoa, hey what's going on here?'...try opening your eyes and seeing more than just what is happening to YOU.<br />
<br />
Would hailing an NPC to get your epic be a good idea? Turning in a fish roll to get a full set of Kael Armor? Getting 4AA per moss snake kill?<br />
<br />

<br />
Those are not even close comparisons. Are you a drama major? If they are 'fairly simple key quests' then what's the big deal with removing them? I didnt hear a big uproar when they removed the Cobalt Scar key requirement. I doubt many people would care if they removed Sebilis or Howling Stones keys. Or are you now going to reverse your opinion and say these are hard quests, like Veeshan's Peak/Sleeper's/Vex Thal?<br />
<br />
This isnt about whether the flags are hard or easy. It's about an expansion design that divides the player base. All level 60+ must hunt here...the rest of you hunt someplace else because you either cant handle it, or you cant get there, or both. That's why they are scaling exp in other zones also. Ding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u171"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p171">I believe I said &quot;Lazy?  Perhaps&quot;.  The perhaps was the caveat because no, I don't know the exact circumstances you and your guild have.<br />
<br />
What I do know is that if you have 18 level 60+ people all dedicated to getting themselves everyone of them flagged, it will happen.<br />
<br />
Yuo can kill larvae in PoD.  You can kill Daiku in PoS.  You could do the Torment access and HoH access quests 3 times.  You can probably kill the minis in PoS.  Sure, the trials are an awful PITA, and the one flag I *do* wish they'd relax or remove, but a strong group of 5 could push each of the others through.<br />
<br />
When all this is doable, I see no reason why it should be gifted to people.  I don't want anyone to take this personally, I view myself in the same way.  If I wanted Malo enough, I'd have 100 GWurm heads mounted on my wall, and the spell in my spellbook.  If I wanted my Epic enough, I'd have run aroaund doing favours for people so they'd help me finish it.  But I've not put the work in, so I don't deserve those rewards yet.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u173"><b>stewardx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p173">I really wish verant had just upped the ability of people to exp in other zones and not thrown away the whole concept of flags.  Access to the tier 2 and 3 PoP zones required some amount of work but was hardly impossible and in fact could be done with relative ease when compared with getting a VT or even ST key (neither of which I have).<br />
<br />
I really cannot understand why people where bitching so much about it.  PoV/PoS where a challenge but were far from impossible.  Yeah it took about 50 tries for me to get thru at lvl 61 but as more and more people have become flagged it has become easier as crowding (at least on xev) is not nearly as bad now as it was a couple months ago.  I have gone back several times to help friends get thru and had no lines or only one group.  If you want to change the trial find a way to get rid of the 30 minute time lag for successful groups.<br />
<br />
The BoT medallions are difficult but definately doable with even a pick up raid.  PoT alt. quest is pathetically easy.  The hedge was also easy although we had an exceptionally competant enchanter, but even then that was the only CC we had...no other bards or chanters.  I really cannot see how people complain about these.<br />
<br />
I also cannot buy that you have to be uber in away to do these.  I am so so far from uber its funny.  I am 63 and have none of my spec spells yet and I have been playing from week one of eq.  I only play 15 hours a week or so if I am lucky.  Granted I do not have all my flags but I have worked on them and gotten them and I am sure that anyone who wants to put out the effort can.   But then why bother if you can just farm stuff for a few months having all the old cash spots all to yourself and then complain to verant so they give you access.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u174"><b>Asraguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p174">Hey Guys/Gals,<br />
<br />
I like the idea that VI is removing the flags because people find it unfair that they don't have access to the majority of PoP if they are in small guilds or are casual players. However, I don't like the implications of what doing this will mean.<br />
<br />
The mobs in Tier 3 zones are tough, much tougher than those in PoV/PoS. I would say the difference in difficulty of mobs in Tier 1 zones to Tier 2 zones is equivalent to the difference between Tier 2 zones and Tier 3 zones. Infact I would go far enough to say that unless you are level 63+ and in decent gear that you are wasting your time in a Tier 3 zone trying to EXP. Sure you can do it but how effective you will be is severely limited.<br />
<br />
Previously, with flag requirement, it basically entailed that you had to be in decent gear and level 63+ to get into Tier 3 zones due to the difficulty of the bosses you had to kill to gain access.<br />
<br />
A good example of where this has not happened has been with BoT. On Tribunal BoT is flooded with level 60s in Bazaar gear trying to EXP and I avoid that zone like the plague. Any pickup group I have ever joined in BoT has been a failure with heaps of downtime wasted rezzing. If not cuz of the low level/under-equipped people in it but cuz of the trains from other low level/under-equipped people trying to EXP in that zone.<br />
<br />
I don't want to sound snobish or anything but once tiers 1-3 are opened up and you get people who were previously in Tier 1 zones trying to EXP in Tier 3 zones then its just going to be havoc. The hunting grounds previously limited to level 63+/decent gear will now be open to people who just don't have the stuff it takes to EXP effectively in these zones. <br />
<br />
I can just see level 51 peeps trying to EXP in PoTactics /sigh.<br />
<br />
Cheers,</div></div><hr />

You miss the point. I play seven days a week, 4-6 hours a day. 40 hours a week on average is pretty normal. I'm in a VT+ capable guild. BUT, since I play at a fixed time and a) mob spawns are random and b) patch times and repops are not, I'M STILL NOT COD FLAGGED, for example. I've NEVER even seen the gimpy Grummus up. The few times we had a shot, we were busy with something else. And, since I PLAN 100 PERCENT to advance beyond CoD, THOSE QUESTS ARE WORTHLESS TO ME. I could easy get CoD flagged via quest, but what's the point? I'll need to kill Grummus sometime. I don't care about just exping there.<br />
<br />
This isn't just a drop I'm not getting; this is a huge chunk of the game that I assure you I'm reasonably ready to tackle.<br />
<br />
In my opinion:<br />
<br />
1) Keep the quests and have them work like you killed the mob, giving people full access. This would prevent backflagging nonsense at a time when people are quitting the game in droves.<br />
<br />
2) Make the tier2 flagging mobs spawnable without loot so people can get flagged and advance through the story line but they aren't at the mercy of so many capricious whims of battle 10 other guilds (and the number grows daily) for the kill when your guild has little motivation because 80-90 percent are already flagged. <br />
<br />
3) Create new flagging quests, similar to PoNb or PoI factory maybe. I liked thoses concept even if they were too easy. Something ring-like and you could spawn.<br />
<br />
4) Think of something else! I don't want a free ride. Lord knows I worked for my VT-ST-VP key. But, I want a chance. I don't care if I'm first. I'm keenly aware I don't play enough to warrant that. But as it stands, even tho I was flagged for pos/pov/bot/hoh etc within the first 4-6 weeks, I'm still waiting for places like CoD only because the system is too flipping random for something too important.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Who complained to Sony and made this (proposed) change happen? I seem to recall Sony announced it, and that's when the bitching began. That's when this big pity party started, and the one over on SteelWarriors, and who knows what other class boards have similiar threads. <br />
<br />
Yeah, sure I've seen comments here and there griping about flags. Hell, I might have even posted one at some point, but I still worked on my flags because that's how it was. But, I didnt start a petition to get rid of them, and I didnt see anyone else do that either. Did you? Please, show it to me if you did so you can support your argument. <br />
<br />
Otherwise, quit acting as if you are the only ones who did any work and all we did was complain and got something handed to us. Because I'd bet that a good percentage of us who are in favor of this change, probably already have some or all of those flags. Want to take a wager on that poll? You already know I have some of them. I'll bet you Eion, Thurdar, and Jharassik have some too, and I dont even know them except from the boards here.<br />

That's just as idiotic as assuming that the majority of those who already are flagged do know how to play. <br />
<br />
IMO this is a roleplaying game, so the &quot;skill&quot; comes from doing what you are told and listening to what you are being told. The majority of people in the world are morons in the sense that they don't LISTEN enough and they don't do what they are told. (I think only 25% of the US population even attempts to go to college or a figure similar to that).. this means that the other 75% don't have the dedication it takes to do something sooo easy as college. This translates well into EQ. A non moron will find more resources to somehow get into pov/pos.. (pay plat for play for example).. <br />
<br />
So unflagged people are either unresourceful, have not yet tried to get flagged, are in the process of getting flagged or are morons. (morons in the sense that they don't listen and they don't do what they are told).<br />
<br />
I have a high opinion of myself, BUT sometimes I don't even listen, and if *I* don't listen sometimes then that means it's REALLY easy not to listen to what you are told and mess things up. &quot;If you have aggro, please don't press taunt again, I know you have your kick and taunt macroed, please take it off or don't kick.&quot; &quot;Please don't snare the mob until it's around 30% (to non puller).. if we keep aggro where it should be it won't run around&quot;.. OR on raids.. &quot;DON'T SIT EVEN IF OOM&quot; (right before the person sees loading pls wait..) or &quot;HUG THE LEFT WALL&quot; (right before raid wipes or almost wipes..) and my FAVORITE &quot;DON'T ATTACK KARANA PLEASE SIT BEFORE HAILING&quot; (right before karana is attacked and ppl don't get flags for another hour).. <br />
<br />
Notice the raid things I put in caps because that at least gets some attention. I've personally gotten this a lot &quot;I KNOW how to play my class&quot; I personally have been in game for only 6 months, I've only played a shaman and I know that rangers should not be calling &quot;ZONE&quot; in a pop xp zone.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u186"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p186">I think SOE is taking the wrong road with flags. There should never be any real flags for progression. You progress through higher level content. SOE needs to add more zones for 60-65. This was the game model they started with. It's the one used for the expansions. And it's the one they need to keep. Anything else will just get a bunch of people upset, like now.<br />
<br />
Basically, the game would be good w/o planar flags if EVERYTHING decent was no drop. If I am level 52 with 6k hps then why not go to pov? The gear we have makes content SUPER easy so the flags are there kind of like no drop must have equipment in order to survive in this zone. That's how I look at them. <br />
<br />
Seriously though, your guild can't do xxx mob, then just wait a year and when elemental 20 wis rings with 20 to all resists player made crap gets on the bazaar, along with 60AC armor with nice stats, then try it and see what happens.. you'll win. Why is uber warrior level 65 with 100 aa better than decent warrior level 65 120 aa? Because he worked hard on raids to get his gear so he can fight the tougher mobs while the 2nd warrior just bought most of his gear and did pov/pos where his gear was superior to the mobs he's fighting. You think a level 52 paladin would want a pov group if he had to get all of his own armor? sitting at 600AC with his 20 damage 50 delay 2HS.. I doubt it..

Let me restate. I have never seen nor heard of Grummus being killed by ANY guild during the 40 hours+ a week I am online AT A TIME my guild was not previously raiding. I think twice I've heard of Grummus kills, one time I know we were doing Emp, the other time I think was our first Seru. Trust me, I'm watching. People are watching for me. It hasn't happened yet not because the only friends I have on Fennin are my own alts -- tho I admit it's so much fun to talk to myself. <br />

Perhaps if I blew off my own guild and just sat in PoD with a tracking alt waiting for Grummus to spawn I would be flagged, but raids are mandatory and my desire is to help my guild first, myself second.</div></div><hr />

In my opinion, opening the PoP zones was a good decision.  I guess that's natural, given it was my opinion then too.  :)  Flagging over and over and over was killing my guild.  <br />
<br />
The fallout impact in zones subsequently was pretty minimal, and certainly nothing like the horror show that some were predicting.  Primarily because lots of crappy players from elemental/near elemental guilds were already in those zones, so it wasn't that big a change.<br />
<br />
BoT can be a bit rough around the edges, but I was flagged for BoT before this change, and it was the same then too.  Leapfrogging, training, etc., it all happened before this change.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, to me hindsight says this was the right move by SOE and those who thought it was a bad idea were wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u191"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p191">The only thing I would add to that is that the whole damned expansion was a mistake.  The last thing we needed were more zones where retards could level.<br />
<br />
But yeah, opening the lower tier zones up wasn't a terrible idea.  It at least made it so that those of us that bought the expansion and didn't want to put the effort in to do the lame entry quests, didn't waste money for a few zones.<br />
<br />
The trials were a decent idea, what the HELL happened with the rest of the quests to get into the advanced zones?  Did SoE wake up one day and say &quot;I bet everyone who plays this game wants to either raid with 80 of their closest friends, or they want to sit around in outdoor zones and camp annoying crap until something drops.&quot;?<br />
<br />
I hope when lead designer of PoP gets home today, his mother runs out from under the porch and bites him.</div></div><hr />

First this doesn't really help with backflagging unless your guild was falling apart do to poj trial or bot key quests? And 2nd, you can't say hindsight because a lot of peeps are in bot/hoh xping like mad, but what will happen once they get all the aa possible? then we can talk about hindsight..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u193"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p193">I think the passage of a few months is time enough to apply hindsight and assess whether a decision then was a &quot;good&quot; decision or a &quot;bad&quot; decision.  <br />
<br />
I see your point, but I think it's largely irrelevant.  <br />
<br />
We did/were doing the trials, but doing it over and over and over and over was asinine.  The vast majority of folks in my guild aren't going to elemental planes, and they don't really care.  But they did want more zone access.  Even though we had invested huge time in flagging (my ass has left an inprint in PoJ trial room), this still was the right decision by SOE.  <br />
<br />
Dartanian I agree.  The PoJ trials are actually fun, and finding a better way to use them would be great.  The WAY they wanted to use them was like making someone eat lobster every night for a month.  The first couple of days you love lobster, by the end of the month you want to puke if you look at it.  <br />
<br />
PoP did a lot of things right, and a lot of things wrong.  It was ambitious, and that's good at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u194"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p194">I agree with you Gart. It was a bad decision from the start to have trials for the ridiculously easy zones of PoS/PoV. I don't even find BoT nor HoH to be that challenging when most times you have a druid/ranger/bard/cleric puller to get singles. Now CoD and PoTa...holy sheet I love those zones and I'm a bit surprised they dropped flag requirements for CoD. Then again, any inept_dude_who_fought_outdoors_all_their_lives_and_skipped_dungeons_01 is going to get their ass kicked in CoD very quickly and probably never come back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u195"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p195">The problem is Solariis, CoD and PoTa put together don't even come close to even the Fungi king crawl of Sebilis.<br />
<br />
Especially potactics, any zone where invis works reliably automatically loses the dungeon tag in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Both of those zones suffer from the retarded PoP low aggro radius garbage.  What the hell is up with standing 10 feet from a mob and it takes no notice of you?<br />
<br />
CoD and potactics are certainly a step in the right direction, but they are a pale imitation of the good dungeons of the past.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I suppose your local chanter, tank and cleric must love your &quot;let's not single pull and drag the enitre zone to the group!&quot; tactics. Or, you don't consider it a challenge, but do it anyhow? <br />
<br />
It's not always about challenge. Sometimes, people just want to fill out an AA to get that one ability they have been dying for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But isn't that the crux of it?  Why should the reward be that much greater for 5% of the challenge?  Why should the group that sits in lake of thunder or the overfire and single pulls all night with relatively no risk get a greater xp/loot benefit that blows all other high risk groups like 4c Cazic Thule away?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Great, head for dreadlands, pull up a zonewall and fill out your AA at half the rate that the rest of us are getting xp at.  I have no problem with dreadlands 9.0 being available, but it certainly shouldn't result in faster character advancement.</div></div><hr />
