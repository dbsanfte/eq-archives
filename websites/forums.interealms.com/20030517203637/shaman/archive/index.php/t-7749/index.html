<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ramma2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I'm in Dawnshroud, and I want to start pulling from the Shroom Temple (I'm 29 btw)<br />
<br />
Any good strategies or rotations what anyone has used to go through this place?  Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Klax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When I solo there with my monk I always aggro pull.  Basically you slowly walk towards the closest one until it aggros on you, as long as you don't get too close none of the other will join in.  I can pull very effectively doing this and quickly once you get used to their range.  <br />
<br />
Might wanna give it a shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">pull with slow, the others won't aggro if you don't get nito normal aggro range. slap on EB then melee the biatch, wait till u hit lvel 34, ull tear through them. Heres whati  think yuo should hunt there-at what level:<br />
29-34=Shrooms<br />
34-36=Shrooms+Zelniaks<br />
37-39=Move down near to GE and pull tribals and Large Zels. Thats where i am atm. 37 as i've seen from other psot is a mini hell level, pretty slow exp comapred to 36. I'm gonna head out at 39 to DL, hope this helped</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Been hunting in DSP lately.  Just dinged 31 in there. (hrmmm that probably means my sig is WAAAY out of date :-) ).   Tried the shroom temple for the first time last night.<br />
<br />
There seem to be a few &quot;traps&quot; that spawna shroom on you when you walk through doors (or the shrooms are there invis).  I get a message when it happens though, so I expect a trap.  <br />
<br />
If you expect it, then you can just yank that shroom outside to fight.<br />
<br />
The shrooms don't path straight from their &quot;stones&quot; to you, so you are trying to yank them outside, expect at least one add.   It seems better to stay inside the building and let proximity aggro pull them to you.<br />
<br />
There are a couple of smaller shroom patches around the zone that have 3 or so shrooms.  There's one just to the left as you leave netherbian lair.  There's one over the hill to the left near some vendors who don't seem to help or aggro :-).   <br />
<br />
My wizzie partner and I can pull those three shrooms, and then yank a few zel's or even 'red' wolves before repop with KEI.   The effort on the wolves isn't worth it, but its nice to say you can take down a red or two :-)<br />
<br />
Experience/downtime is better for a duo in the shroom building though, even without KEI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ramma2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I appreciate the info fellas, but if you take a look at the post date, this was over 2 months ago.  Needless to say, I figured it out and am now cracking down on 39.<br />
<br />
Thanks though!</div></div><hr />
