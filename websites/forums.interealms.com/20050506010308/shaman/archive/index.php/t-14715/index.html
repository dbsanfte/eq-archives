<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I am a lvl 39 shaman with 1300 hp's<br />
<br />
Canni II is 70 hp for 30 mana<br />
<br />
Canni I is 50 hp for 20 mana<br />
<br />
At 1300 hp, 70 hp seems kind of a steep price to pay, but I'm just curious, at what level do you start using it?<br />
<br />
PS - I mostly solo - so having some hp is fairly important and I dont have loy (for stoicism)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I used Can 2 as soon as I was able to gather all the components at 40 long long ago.  I probably had less HP and less Wis than you had but you know what was great about the jump from Can to Can 2? Not having to Can Dance as much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Use it as soon as you get it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yep.  Also i don't think it's quite 70hp it that makes a difference.  it's closer to 63.  Canni III does 74 damage.<br />
<br />
Buk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It will probably take you longer to get Canni II than you think, unless you have higher level help.  I would use it ASAP.  Its not about the ratio, its about faster canni.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If ya got it use it. If ya don't and your not gonna be 54 tommorrow get it. I used canni 1 up til 54, and it sucked alot from 51-54, i just told myself i was close to canni 3 and didn't wanna waste leveling time doing the quest. Now that I got cann3 I really wish I'd had cann2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's 67 HP for 30 mana at lvl 39 (Canni 2 mana increases by approx 1pt every 3 levels thereafter). <br />
<br />
I'd say start using it at 44 when you can get stoicism. Although Canni 1 can give you 50hp for about 25 mana at lvl 44 it's not just about the ratio at that point, it's about time. By 44 I found Canni 1 was just taking too long. However, knowing then what I know now, I still wouldn't have used Canni 2 without Stoicism.<br />
<br />
A few here went without Canni 2 altogether. I can't imagine how frustrating that must have been.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm 39 and with 1300 HP self buffed and I use Canni 2 now. Like everyone else has said, it's an issue of time for me. Also, your HP regen is almost doubled by Cholorplast, so that makes up for Cann 2 having a worse ration than Cann 1, IMO.<br />
<br />
-Tok</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Loreddar Of Karana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you don't have LoY and cannot get Stoicism, then I would say that Canni II isn't worth the trouble. You don't have much to gain with it, especially if you solo a lot. The nice thing about using a Canni spell is to regain mana as quickly as possible, but you correctly point out that maintaining HPs is also crucial because of your soloing style. I also solo almost exclusively and can identify with that. At lvl 39, your best ways of regaining the lost HPs used by Canni II are Greater Healing and Regeneration. Greater Healing gives back 300 HPs for 150 mana. However, it takes 5 Canni IIs to return to you the 150 mana you used to cast Greater Healing, but uses 335 HPs to do so, for a net loss of 35 HPs. Not a good result. Regeneration gives you an increase of 5 HPs per tick. At lvl 39, Regen will last for about 13 min (give or take - I haven't figured it out exactly). This will be 130 ticks of Regen, or about 650 HPs for 100 mana. The Canni II cost to regain that 100 mana will be 268 HPs (which actually gets you 120 mana). However, you still have to sit and wait for the Regen to work. You may be able to gain mana more quickly, but you still have to sit and wait for Regen to recover your HPs. This is a much better result, but you're still going to be sitting and waiting (which will also bring mana back up on its own).<br />
<br />
The situation changes dramatically with Stoicism, because you can recover a LOT more HPs for much less mana, making it more efficient. This is what I do now that I have both spells. It takes 6 Canni II spells to recover the mana used by Stoicism for an HP cost of 402. However, I get back 640 HPs from Stoicism, so I can cast 3 more Canni IIs before I start having a net loss of HPs. This means I can gain 90 extra mana by casting 9 Canni II spells for every 1 Stoicism with no net loss of HPs. And I have a couple of focus items that makes this ratio even better. It still takes some time for all the casting, but it's a lot less downtime than just sitting.<br />
<br />
Now, things change quite a bit if you're not soloing and have a cleric that can heal you. You no longer have to worry about the HP cost to regain mana, because someone else is healing you. This is like getting free mana. When you're not casting spells to help the group kill mobs, then you cast Canni and let the group healer give you back your HPs. If you plan to do groups instead of soloing, then Canni II would be worth the effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The math does not do justice to the value of cannibalize, as it ignores enviromental variables.<br />
<br />
In a real situation, you are regenerating and casting other spells while using canni.  The increased speed and efficiency of canni 2 are very much worthwhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">People tand to focus too much on the hp:mana ratio, when really, its not that important. At the end of the day, its all about rate of mana return over time - Canni2 allows you to reclaim mana faster, and yes, that mana might come at a slightly higher price in terms of hp cost, but you are missing the point if you worry about it.<br />
<br />
Let me put it another way: Hypothetically, lets assume that you have a huge hp pool of say 5000hp. Assume you have a mana pool of 2000mana. Lets assume you regen 20hp per tick. Ok, calculate how long it it will take to cannibalise from OOM to full using Cannidance1. Do the same thing using Cannidance2. Obviously, you will get to full mana using Canni2 much faster. But if you sit on your butt for the difference you will regen more hp than the loss from the ratio.<br />
<br />
Using 67:30 for Canni2 and 50:24 for Canni1<br />
<br />
Canni2: it will take 67 casts (&amp; ticks) @ 30mana, and will  cost 4489hp (at 67hp per cast) and take 6 minutes 42 seconds.<br />
<br />
Canni1: it will take 84 casts (&amp; ticks) @ 24mana, and will cost 4200 (at 50hp per cast) and take 8 minutes 24 seconds.<br />
<br />
so, using Canni 2 will cost you 289 more hp to generate 2000mana, but will take get you the mana in 1 minute 42 seconds less. If you then sat on your but you would regenerate  340 hp in that 1 minute 42 seconds, which is more than the difference. So, actually, Canni2 is more efficent than Canni1 if you take hp, mana and time into account<br />
<br />
To answer your question, use Canni2 as soon as you can get your hands on it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">As soon as you can get it.  In groups I've found it difficult to canni fast enough.  Solo, it doesn't seem to be as criticle.  I'd be happy to have a 1000hp canni, even though I only have 1600hp(unbuffed) at level 49.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ishy Drackos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">use it as soon as you get it. canni 1 gets painful after a while</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Chaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The Cannibilize spells all seem to be very well balanced for the level you can actually use them.  When I was about to reach level 39 I found that it was getting highly annoying and very straining to canni enough with Cannibilize I.  When I dinged 39 I memmed Canni II and it was heaven.. until around level 49 or 50.. then I started dreaming of Canni III.  And likewise with Canni IV.<br />
<br />
The spells are pretty well balanced for the level you can mem them.. and they peter out just before you're able to mem the next spell in the line.<br />
<br />
Don't listen to the naysayers about Canni II.  Get it, you'll love it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Use it as soon as you can get it. Don't wait for canni3 if you can avoid it. I did and was not a happy camper in my low 50's. Canni1 becomes wayyyyy too slow at those levels.</div></div><hr />

Using Cloro (10hp regen/tick)<br />
Using 3hp/tick ar natural regen<br />
Not counting medding (same on both cases)<br />
Cannidancing...<br />
c2:<br />
67 hp lost, 13 hp gained ... 54 hp lost/tick <br />
30 mana/tick<br />
<br />
c1:<br />
50 hp lost, 13 hp gained ... 37 hp lost/tick<br />
24 mana /tick<br />
<br />
Gheal 300hp. so to get ~0 hp loss:<br />
<br />
c1:<br />
Gheal each 8.1 ticks (1500mana/81ticks)<br />
so in 90 ticks you get:<br />
 90*24 - 1650 mana = 2160-1650 = 510 mana gain<br />
c2:<br />
Gheal each 5.5 ticks (1500mana/55ticks)<br />
so in 90 ticks you get:<br />
 90*30 - 2454 mana = 2700-2454 = 246 mana gain<br />
<br />
c2 is not that fast in the long run unless you have a cleric healing yourself or stoicism. <br />
<br />
You will waste that fast mana healing your self more frecuently (other way you would die).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>trolebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">better thought... all that maths only say can1 is more efficient than cann2 (we knew that).<br />
<br />
Use cann1 when only medding, and cann2 for battle cann (when you need mana NOW and not every tick). <br />
In the end, you dont stay 90 ticks only canning... and every tick you dont canni, you regen 11 hp or more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">At 39, Canni I takes 50hp for more like 23 mana. (It scales).<br />
<br />
Canni II takes 67hp for 30 mana.<br />
<br />
Canni I is slightly more efficient, but Canni II makes up for it because you don't need to cast as often to have the same mana regen.<br />
<br />
Canni I is also more efficient than Canni IV, but I don't think anyone's suggesting they'd still use Canni I at level 58, it's a similar thing.<br />
<br />
If you can get hold of it, do so, and try it out for yourself. You won't notice the slight drop in efficiency, but you will notice that you'll cast it less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Dont listen to the math geeks =)  Canni2 is worth it at 39, even better at 44, and is really nice at 52.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Thks for the advise guys went out last night and got 3 of the items i need for spell<br />
<br />
clay<br />
shaman powder<br />
and crushed diamonds<br />
<br />
A word to anyone reading this, you will definately need some help at lvl 39 to get the ingredients for the spell.<br />
<br />
Shaman powder - need a ranger go to south of Trak zone - these frogs agro like crazy - so have 3 people in your party.<br />
<br />
Clay in CoM - Army Behemoth - tough to get to, have 4-5 in your party.<br />
<br />
Helps if you have some high lvls willing to help you out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The bone chips dropped in the left court yard at Karnors for me. If a group already has the spot, park behind them (there's some crates and boxes there with no spawn) and they'll let you loot. There's little you can add to a group there at 39, so offering external heals and buffs is a sure fire way to get the chips.<br />
<br />
May be irrelevant if you have high levels helping, but they were the toughest thing for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sharkus Greenfang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Canni 2 and the Concussion quests are a complete mystery to me.  When Kunark launched these two spells came up for shaman and wizards but no other classes got spells at this level.  Why this level, why those spells and why do both quests involve content suited for groups over level 50?  <br />
<br />
It's something I wish they would have fixed a long time ago.  Either make the spells purchasable, the quest ingredients obtainable by characters of the correct level or move the spells up in level(along with their effect).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">While I agree about Cannibalize II and Concussion being too hard for the level you can scribe them, other classes also have Kunark spell quests.<br />
<br />
Druids get Beguile Plants (level 29 spell) which is hard to get at that level.<br />
<br />
Enchanters get Illusion: Iksar (level 20 spell) which is also tough at level 20, even with a full group of that level.<br />
<br />
Neither of these are close to the level of usefulness of Concussion or Canni 2, but they're still very hard for the class in question to obtain at the relevant level without high level help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">the ratio is all wrong.   I'll have to look at the spell itself again but I know that's wrong. <br />
Canni2 is worth using immediately because of this one thing: it's faster!  That is also what makes Canni5 so great, it's incredible SPEED!  You get your mana back faster, have to spend less time casting for it.  Faster = better.  And the ratio is slightly better than Canni1, this i know, even if I can't remember it atm.  Oh nm here it is.<br />
At lvl 39 it's 67 hps for 30 mana.  At lvl 40 it's 31 mana, at 41 it's 32 mana.  And so on to a cap at lvl 46 of 37 mana per cast.  That's a better ratio than Canni1 obviously, and it's much faster.  Get this spell soon as you can cuz it will make your life easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Landragoran, while I agree Canni II is worth using because it's faster, it is still worse ratio.<br />
<br />
From Lucy:<br />
<br />
Cannibalize:<br />
1:  Decrease Hitpoints by 50 <br />
2:  Increase Mana by 20 (L24) to 29 (L65)<br />
 <br />
Cannibalize II:<br />
1:  Decrease Hitpoints by 67 <br />
2:  Increase Mana by 30 (L39) to 37 (L65) <br />
<br />
The mana isn't 1 extra per level, it's a linear scale between the level you get it and level 65.<br />
<br />
At level 39, when you get Cannibalize II, the mana return from Cannibalize is 24.<br />
<br />
Given by: 20 + ((65-39) * (37-30) / (65-24))<br />
(Think of this as a line on a graph - 65 is the level you get 37 mana, 24 is the level you get 20 mana, 39 is the level we're looking at)<br />
<br />
At 39, the ratio of HP/mana for Canni I is 2.08. At 39, the ratio of HP/mana for Canni II is 2.23.<br />
I.e. At 39, Canni II takes more HP per point of mana returned - it has a worse ratio.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you don't believe me, you can simply look at level 65: At 65, Canni I is 1.72 HP/mana, Canni II is 1.81 HP/mana. Furthermore, Canni III is 1.76 and Canni IV is 1.80. The Cannibalization AA skill is the same as Canni IV.<br />
<br />
In summary, at level 65 (and at most levels), Canni I is the most efficient in terms of simple HP/mana, but no-one would dream of using it. The difference is insignificant in the scheme of things and fewer casts is better. :)<br />
<br />
Sorry if this is too much like maths, I'm a bit of a pedant, and like to correct things that I think are wrong.</div></div><hr />
