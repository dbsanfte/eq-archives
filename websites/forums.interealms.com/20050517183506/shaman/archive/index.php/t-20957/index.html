Go to test server and use the /testbuff command to see if ya like a certain class. I wouldn't reroll and then decide ya hate the class.<br />
Perhaps I am being ignorant, but how do I play on the test server now?  There used to be another icon to click, but it is gone now.<br />
<br />
And what should I be concerned with if I am a player on a regular server?  As far as directories, files and such.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

The file is still around it is just sort of hidden.  Look for testeverquest.exe in the same directory that everquest.exe is in.<br />
<br />
Some people copy the eq directory and then patch test.  I only use one - the live files will repatch over the test ones when you go back to live.<br />

Something different about test - We don't use shout.  Ever.  The only possible exception is if you are training to zone but even then people usually avoid it for /ooc.  Shouting will get you put on ignore or ridiculed by a lot of long term test people.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just out of curiousity, how do the long term Test folks feel about /testbuff?  I noticed that /testbuff only takes you to 25, but the message you get seems to imply that you can use it again.  But so far I have not been able to.  Figured 50 was a good level to go to.  Have a 48 warrior already, so 50 wouldn't be much different.  :)</div></div><hr />
