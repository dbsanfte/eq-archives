<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Peroxide</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">EQ2 is just EQ1 with better quest system and graphics.  Unfortunately the quests are still the same.  You are not gauranteed to get your quest item off the mob and after 4 straight hours of not getting my quest item I decided its the exact same game except for graphics.  I will stick with EQ1</div></div><hr />

In my experience if you are looking for one drop off of one mob, you will always get it.  However, if you need multiple drops from multiple mobs then the rarity varies by quest.<br />
<br />
The biggest difference in quests I think, between eq1 and eq2, is that if you do the quests at the appropriate level in eq2, you are actually getting good xp while also doing the quests.  The other, of course, would be that every group (or raid) member gets credit for any quest drop or kill.<br />
<br />
If those two things - graphics and quests - are the only things &quot;better&quot; about EQ1 to you then you are in the wrong game anyway.</div></div><hr />

4 hours solo, 2 hours grouped (6 hours total), 1 item needed and it did not drop one time.  In your experience everything is great.  In my experience its the same damn game.  My only question is when are you going to wake up and see this for yourself?</div></div><hr />

Whats to wake up and see? It wasnt an issue for him for whatever reason (differing expectations etc). Get over it. <br />
<br />
What is this oh so precious item that is depriving us of your company by virtue of it not dropping? Maybe you were going about it the wrong way, or its a known problem that will be fixed..etc, but that doesnt matter because you're leaving, right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
In 76 levels and just over two months of playing, the only thing worth mentioning that I see the same between EQ1 and EQ2 are some of the familiar zones and NPC names - a commonground that has actually made my EQ2 experience even better.  If you stop comparing EQ2 to EQ1 it will likely make your EQ2 experience much better too.  However, if EQ1 is still so great for you, why did you start playing EQ2 in the first place?<br />
<br />
As for your item, you are being pretty vague.  Did you even kill the mob you needed to get the item?  It really sounds more like you were trying to find a rare mob and couldn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Peroxide</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The mob(s) was killed over and over and over and over. Have I mentioned it was killed over and over and yes it was the correct mob because I completed the quest before with another character and did not have the same trouble.  Just because I still like EQ1 does not mean I can't try other games right?  I liked EQ2 until this happened and then I woke up.  Even had this problem not happened I would have never left EQ1.  5 plus years of play invested in a game how could you just drop it?</div></div><hr />

Easily...<br />

I don't 'play' something that I don't find fun.  I went to work to do something that I didn't find fun, but I won't do that unless I am the one being paid, not doing the paying.</div></div><hr />

I stop playing EQ2 when it started to make me feel like a second job (it was somewhere in the mid L20s).<br />
<br />
I must say the first 20 levels of EQ2 are very well made. I enjoyed those levels very much...and then it changed quickly in the mid 20s where all of a sudden you have to spend long hours to camp for drops/nameds/cluelessly running all across a zone repeatedly trying to hit an area to update your quest...searching spoilers from web trying to save time...it's like a second job. Moreover, 90% of the quests can not be done alone. Grouping is mandatory. It was EQ1 starting all over again.<br />
<br />
However, the above were merely my personal feelings. The nature of this game just doesn't fit my RL situation.</div></div><hr />

Everything would be so much more fun if every drop and named just appeared in front of you as soon as you accept the quest. Also, there should be a hotkey that would make your character automatically run to the right spot of the map for every quest in your journal. Now that would leave more time to browse the spoiler sites so that you can save even more time! WOOT! Cause that's why you play the game, to save time!  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
WoW has a feature similar to this. If you know the location of your spawn, you put in the co-ordinates and it autoruns your character there. :eek:<br />
<br />
I'm sticking with EQ2, myself. Although now that they've added SWG to the Station Pass, I'm probably going to be splitting my time between that, EQ2, and PlanetSide.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah. We spent HOURS upon HOURS in Thundering Steppes killing Mighty Griffons trying to get Bloodtalon to spawn over the weekend. It was our third time spending hours camping that area trying to get him to spawn.<br />
<br />
In some ways it's similar to EQ1 in the sense that you can get tired of the monotonous grinding through the same trash for hours on end, and when the named spawns he's stolen by some roaming pack of level 35 punks who have no business being IN the area and hadn't just spent hours killing the Placeholders.<br />
<br />
Then you get to enjoy the fun of killing placeholders for a few more hours because Sony decided to make Bloodtalon &quot;Rare&quot;...<br />
<br />
But I still like the game overall. LOVE my new Apartment ;)</div></div><hr />

Heh, this was night before last. AFTER they claimed to have increased the spawn rate on Bloodtalon.<br />
<br />
I know it's a new game. In fact, we're paying to play the final phase of beta. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Adran Windrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ah. Oops. Well, my comments were mainly aimed at the original poster. :) My point was really that they noticed a problem and tried to fix it. They may not have got it right yet, but at least they're responding.<br />
<br />
Also, I agree with Sekin - the first 20 levels are great, so much so that I keep wanting to start new characters and try out classes. (Although I have to admit 18 is my highest level post-beta, so my experience of the &quot;finished&quot; game is limited.) I do look at the next 30 levels and wonder if it's as fun at 40-50 as it is at the moment. I also think I shouldn't rush to level too fast, as the content is still growing and being tweaked, and we are, as you say, still testing it for them.<br />
<br />
One difference I see between EQ1 and EQ2 is that a lot of people play more obsessively now, and many are more interested in levelling than exploring and experiencing the world. Even my guildmates, who would all say they were &quot;casual gamers&quot;, are playing most nights, although we all have several characters and aren't speed-levelling. When we see new zones or mobs we admire the graphics, but there isn't that feeling of excitement there was when we first explored Norrath in EQ1.<br />
<br />
I remember zoning out of Everfrost to Qeynos Hills and being excited at a zone with different landscapes. Everything was green instead of snowy white! I remember exploring Kunark when no-one had any idea what was out there. It was thrilling in a way no computer game ever had been before.<br />
<br />
Back in EQ2's beta, I declared I wouldn't visit the spoiler sites, and would just let the game unfold as I played. I wanted that feeling of exploring a world I got back in my EQ1 days. That lasted all of about a week into release. ;) As fun as it is to explore, there's only so much time you can spend randomly hailing people and poking around before you wonder if you're actually playing a game or ticking boxes on a checklist. I've realised no new game will ever give me the same sense of wonder, and to take them for what they are.<br />
<br />
As many people have said, EQ1 has been around for years, has tremendous depth, and had that &quot;first MMORPG&quot; factor for many of us. EQ2 isn't going to recapture that no matter what it does. However so far it seems to be a good, solid game, more polished on release than many of the others I've tried, and likely to hold my interest longer than anything since EQ1. I played EQ1 for nearly 4 years, and I doubt I'll ever do that again. AO lasted 3 months, DAoC lasted 6, SWG 2, CoH 5... you can see the pattern. So far, if I pace myself, I can see EQ2 lasting much longer. I hope it does. It's not perfect, but it's the best so far since the original. I just have to make sure I don't outpace it.<br />
<br />
Bleh, shouldn't post late at night. I'm rambling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I agree Adran. The game is HUGE fun, and even though I don't try to level too fast, the quests just keep dinging me!<br />
<br />
It's a pity there are only 4 character slots per account, because I would have a bunch more alts if there were more. (3 of my slots on my 2 accounts are taken up with my kids.)<br />
<br />
Right now the fun for us is in doing the Heritage quests to level our guild up. (And to get cool EQ1 named items.)<br />
<br />
Just finished the dwarven workboots quest and now we're working on Ghoulbane and the Manastone one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">All I can say is that it's easier to follow the the storyline of the quest and get it done.<br />
<br />
Remember in EQ1 when you got stuck at the start of the quest, or could not even start it because you didnt know what to say?<br />
<br />
/say what boots?<br />
/say what maple?<br />
/say what dwarf?<br />
/say ***?<br />
say i can help<br />
<br />
(and you start to auto attack because you forgot the / in /say)...<br />
<br />
Maybe EQ1 is more fun, but not for me.  To me, EQ1 now = hail mobs, then camp for keys, so that you can spend the next few weeks raiding some zone with 72 other ppl just as bored as you are.<br />

Hahhaha!  I did that doing my freaking epic with like the second puppy spirit in freeport.  Talk about freaked out!  I was worried I would screw up my epic faction and it didn't exactly help that I was KOS to humans either.  I ended up rooting him and camping.<br />
<br />
Exciting?  Kinda...annoying? For sure.  I'll take EQ2 quests over EQ1 quests any day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have at least 7 quests just within NC, plus some that start in NC but list as Enchanted Lands.<br />
<br />
This game is not for power levelers, it's for folks who want depth.  I am blown away every single day by the quests available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">lol.  Of course not.  We load up on zone quests and then proceed to &quot;clear out the zone&quot;, including the quests.  That may take a couple of days or more, depending what we feel like doing.<br />
<br />
Having a regular group of friends to play with sure makes things easier.  We share the same objectives and quests, and don't try to out level each other, keeping the group tight (28-30 now).<br />
<br />
I never understood those power gamers... they complain that EQ2 = xp grind, and WoW is easier to level, easier to solo (yeah, solo in a MMO, go figure).  Why not just sign up on a game that starts you at level 50, or 65, or max level, and do /claim uber_weapon_without_camping?  Sorry for ranting. lol.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I think we might put the fishbone earring on hold, and do the Catacombs before we out-level it.  I think it's good for levels 25-30, and our group is 28-30 now.<br />
<br />

Actually, its all pretty reasonable up until the very last mob.  Frankly, I wouldn't even bother with &quot;Ancient Watcher&quot; because I have to believe he's bugged.<br />
<br />
This is a single group, instanced zone right?  You get there, the mob is flagged as Group x 2 triple up, even con to a 31 Mystic.<br />
<br />
Ok, Doomsquall, right?<br />
<br />
Oh, DS got nothin' on this guy.<br />
<br />
Our tank, L33 Guardian with Runnyeye quested armor and better went down like a wet paper bag.  The mob proceeded to cut thru our party like we werent even there.  He killed me in 3 blows . . . 1056, miss, 947.<br />
<br />
That mob simply does not belong in that zone.<br />
<br />
Hint:  If you leave one of the smaller gargoyles alive, this mob will not aggro at all, enabling you to kill everything else in the zone (numerous named).<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Thanks for the advice.  I just want to see the zone and get a feel of it before it becomes &quot;pink&quot; to me like FMG.<br />

That mob is needed for the haste ring quest. The ring is VERY nice. It can only be worn, IIRC, at 33. Stats are: Ancient Slayer's Ring of Wisdom: 9 wis 5 sta 16 health 30 power 269 vs mental 168 vs disease, effect haste of the ancient slayer, AC 49 at level 39.<br />
<br />
Anyway, my guild farmed him for all the guildmates. There is a trick to beating him. The guy has a grav-flux that pushes you up and then back, and a NASTY rampage.<br />
<br />
The trick is that half of your party must be at least 35 to do it. Having a 40+ tank is really almost necessary. We did it with 3 experienced guys and 3 people who needed the quest over and over each night till it was done, it takes 30 mins tops to kill the gargoyles then him.<br />
<br />
The tank neeeds to stand in the corner, back to the wall so he cant' be gfluxed. The healers need to stand off to one side, far enough away from the barrage, but not directly behind, as that will be in the path of the gflux. Casters stand there too.<br />
<br />
The scouts/other fighters stand directly in front of the mob at the point where the moat comes to a corner, (this will be right behind the mob once the tank engages and taunts him to turn around). And they need to be prepared for gflux. Ranged attacks from rangers are more useful than backstabbing due to gflux.<br />
<br />
If you do it this way, you will win. The mob will be grey and drop no loot, but you'll win. It's a tough battle and things easily can go wrong and a wipe can happen very quickly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I understand what the mob is for, however, consider . . . .<br />
<br />
Do you really think that Sony intended for players to kill gray mobs for loot?  Everything about EQ2 is risk vs reward.  The way they've implemented trivial loot reinforces this.<br />
<br />
So why on earth would a mob that could *easily* wipe an entire raid be there?  It doesn't make sense.  <br />
<br />
The kicker is that you can't even bring a raid in.  One group, instanced content.  <br />
<br />
I still say the mob has some data wrong and shouldn't be hitting nearly that hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">It's not his hits that wipe ya.<br />
<br />
It's the rampages and the gflux. On the other hand, that's what makes him so very cool. Because it's fun to have to think out a stragey to beat him. Once we figured out that he flings people around, it was a bit of thinking to find out where to put the main tank so he wouldn't move too much (he still goes up, but not back, when he's against the corner)... and where to put people so they get the least affected by his aoes. <br />
<br />
The gflux is very fun to get caught up in... and up up and away! <br />
<br />
He doesn't drop any loot, so the quest can only be done once by the person who's getting the ring, so it's not like the market is going to get flooded with these rings. <br />
<br />
You are right that he is veryhard for his zone. We had a group of 35's try it - he was green to them - and they wiped. Mostly because of the rampage and then the main tank died and the mob turned around and then rampaged the healer, and poof, total wipe. I think they could have succeeded had the mt not died, but you need a lot of healing power to keep the mt alive at that level, and the mt needs to hold aggro all the time.<br />
<br />
If your mt can't hold aggro and stay alive long enough for him to be dropped, it's all over... and I'm not sure a level 35 mt could do that. The gflux is bad enough that the dps from the other classes is severely minimized... rouges get one backstab in, then are gfluxed away, they have to run back and do it again... takes time... so dps suffers.<br />
<br />
I remember hate raids, and CT gfluxing everyone, and I loved getting gfluxed by this guy... just brought back some really cool memories and made me go Woo! Although I think they could drop his barrage hits a bit and that would make it easier for a group of 35's to take him down, as the tank could stay alive longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Oh, we knew about the Gflux.  We were ready for that actually.  We positioned him sideways in a hallway with MT keeping his back to a wall and putting the mob's back very close to the opposite wall so our Scouts didn't get thrown very far at all.<br />
<br />
We just weren't ready for the 1000+ hits.  That was just plain silly.<br />
<br />
When the only way to beat the encounter is to make the mob trivial, something is broken.  :(</div></div><hr />

I could list out things I didn't like but it would just be seen as hostile and argumentative probably, even if not intended that way.<br />

He doesn't drop any loot, so the quest can only be done once by the person who's getting the ring, so it's not like the market is going to get flooded with these rings. <br />
<br />
You are right that he is veryhard for his zone. We had a group of 35's try it - he was green to them - and they wiped. Mostly because of the rampage and then the main tank died and the mob turned around and then rampaged the healer, and poof, total wipe. I think they could have succeeded had the mt not died, but you need a lot of healing power to keep the mt alive at that level, and the mt needs to hold aggro all the time.<br />
<br />
If your mt can't hold aggro and stay alive long enough for him to be dropped, it's all over... and I'm not sure a level 35 mt could do that. The gflux is bad enough that the dps from the other classes is severely minimized... rouges get one backstab in, then are gfluxed away, they have to run back and do it again... takes time... so dps suffers.<br />
<br />
I remember hate raids, and CT gfluxing everyone, and I loved getting gfluxed by this guy... just brought back some really cool memories and made me go Woo! Although I think they could drop his barrage hits a bit and that would make it easier for a group of 35's to take him down, as the tank could stay alive longer.<br />
<br />
With the new group rules for mob cons he conned green for a group that ranged from 32 to 40. We have failed him once, but that should really never happen again. It is just a long fight. We just turn him in the corner where he stands to negate the Gflux. Casters stands just beyonf pillars and do not get any AoE at all. Other melees have to run a bit since they do get thrown quite a lot.<br />
<br />
He does drop loot. Fairly nice I understand (was a sword), but unsure about how apropriate it is for the level range that is neede to take him out. When we did it the entire group got the quested ring.</div></div><hr />
