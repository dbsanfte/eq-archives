<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KURB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My ranger just ding 40 this past week and i have gotten some decent upgrades to make him a viable fighter for his level. And tho i wish i could have the UBER items from ST and ToV and the beyond i know this can never be.  Im a casual player, always will be so long as im in college. i just cant dedicate the time to KurB Syde that i wish i could. I look through the magelos here at the glade and i see Items i know i will never have, then i think about time played and i relize some of you guys have been here since the start.  Thats where eq2 comes into my mind. I want to be that ranger.....the one the lil rangers come to for help :)  much like i have came to the glade to ask you all for information. So if i can go to EQ2 and get to that level i will be doing a good like you all have done me :) Call it a pipe dream, call it what you will. But my logic is, eq2 ( hopefully) will set me on course to in a few yrs be THAT ranger.  <br />
