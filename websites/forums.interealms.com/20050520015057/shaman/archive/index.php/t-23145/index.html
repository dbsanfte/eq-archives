<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">..I am finally flagged for Plane of Time, so a shameless 'woot me' post was in order ;)<br />
<br />
Anyway, I joined my guild back in November 2002. We are part of a three guild alliance, known collectively as WAP (watchkeepers, aurora polaris, phoenix alliance)<br />
<br />
PoP had just been released and they were about a month out of Halls of Testing, doing luclin minis (vadynn/DS) and tier 1 pop stuff. We slowly worked our way into kael/ntov (first aary kill late nov02), while working PoJ trials and wiping/working on lower end pop stuff like factory/xanamech/pos keys. I'm still wearing my trusty Vindi Bp which was my first loot ;)<br />
<br />
I remember grummus and behemoth being teeth-breakingly hard, and how satisfying it was to see them fall ;)<br />
<br />
We worked first broods for ST keys, ST for primals, we banged our heads against the wall until we could finally farm EB weaps from kael/ssra (farmed ssra till we all got REALLy tired of snakes heh), to help us break into tier3 pop. (we skipped emp/VT)<br />
<br />
We did all HoH trials when they were damn hard to us, RD made us tear out hair on many occasions. Also, getting people aa became a priority, so we had a 3 week raid break when Ldon launched and everyone adventured, bought Ldon gear/augs and got aa.<br />
<br />
Summer 2003 saw us get into sol ro tower, this was a nice step up, farming the minis for solid loots and a lot of ornate dropped. Again we had a gearing and strengthening period as we worked on RZ etc.<br />
<br />
RZ died in october 2003, solro in november 2003 which saw us fully EP flagged.<br />
<br />
The first few months in EP were hard, but lots of fun as we worked air and earth rings, learning new strats. Then you reach a point in EP's where everything clicks (was probably 4-5 months ago for us), the balance of skills/tactics/gear/aa etc and you begin to mow through the content.<br />
<br />
There is a great feeling of satisfaction of hammering through a full fire spawn, or the night we completely cleared PoEa (stone, mud, vine, croc, dust, arb) in about 4 hours ;) You know you are ready to move on when you start doing Dust ring in Air for a laugh. (spiders anyone? ahahahh)<br />
<br />
The last few months have been working EP Gods, farming EP content along with some GoD progression. Think we got Xeg in may/june, fennin shortly after, rathe dropped in july, and finally coirnav died last night (we had over a minute spare at the end ).<br />
<br />
Anyway enough rambling from me, just wanted to share some of my journey with you all ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>vincenzovs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Big Gratz to you!<br />
<br />
Must feel good :)<br />
<br />
Interesting to see you skipped VT. My guild are doing the same. Our current target is to get into EP, and we are working on RZTW, Mith Marr, Saryn, Bertox atm.<br />
<br />
Each time we do Rydda Dar I get a massive adrenaline rush. Such a fun fight.<br />
<br />
MB is awesome just for that wonderful knockback. I sometimes feel like going and seeing that Froglok (______ the Fist) in Innothule just to get a taste of it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">GRATZ!  that is awesome that a guild alliance can work together like that to get into to time, shows real team work.  <br />
<br />
My guild is working on that damn squid (he WILL die next time...i'm itchin for Calamari).  I joined after VT farming (like not even a week after being done with VT...so Apr.) Been in EPs now for about 4 mos...tired of farming, wtb farming in TIME!<br />
<br />
Gratz again, that is awesome for you guys, you should be VERY proud.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">big time Grats to you and your alliance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I dont see why a guild should really be 'done' with vt/emp.  Between the unique items and gearing up recruits, there is always a use for it (Especially when nothing elemental is up).  My guilds 1st emp kill was back in 2/03.  They cleared VT not long after.  For the past six or eight months, VT has been our after hours raid target.  I've lost count of the number of 4am AHR kills or 2am Emp kills we have done.  Why?  Because its fun and productive.  Only our last VT clearing did we shift it over to /rand.  One reason we may farm it so much is we are a hydra heavy guild.</div></div><hr />
