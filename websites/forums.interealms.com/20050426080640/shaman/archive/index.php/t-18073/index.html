<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ancient_mariner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">1) getting to Akheva: run through Dawnshroud to Maidens Eye, in ME take a hard right and follow wall until you see castle entrance to AR. invis should be up while running athough there isn't much chance of aggro. When you get to AR entrance, run exactly halfway between the 2 Xius Vi (they see invis) guys on the steps, if you get too close to either you will get aggro and get smacked... even if you do, it won't be too bad, you can make it to the AR zone. Once you get into the ruin, keep going around the big round thing, (watch for the Life Tappers) and you will see the zone. <br />
<br />
2) inside Akheva: cast bearform to see, set up right at the entrance facing the long tunnel. Get your alpha dogdog set up and buffed, and and set to guard. There are 3 centi dators in the first long tunnel, 1 in the middle and 1 on either side at the end. You can single each of them. Pull with slow ALL THE WAY BACK to your dog. If you don't, you may aggro one of the wandering transient patrollers. These guys are necros and can ruin your whole day... after pulling with slow, I rooted, plague, BoN, and E-bolt (reroot as necessary), and let dogdog go to work. At about 45%, I recast BoN. That usually is enough. The centi dators don't hit very hard, so dog is usually good with a regen. With KEI, HP buff, and canni III, I was pulling and killing one every 6 minutes or so. There are 5 centis total that can be pulled, and they respawn almostly perfectly.<br />
<br />
3) dealing with the transient patrollers: my method is to kill one (just be prepared to get nasty spells thrown at you) and avoid the other. They appear on the same cycle as the centis so once you kill one (or both) you are good for 1/2 an hour or so.<br />
<br />
4) XP and loot: I make about a blue regular xp an hour here... which is about average for me soloing. Loot is up to 4 pp per mob, along with centi meat, toes, twilight worms (fishing bait I think), essence of darkness, and a very occasional weapon (have seen spear and short sword so far, no long sword).<br />
<br />
hope this helps.<br />

<br />
the centis and transients are not undead. If you go past the first room, you will run into some of the floating black robe guys, and I think they are... but I don't mess with them (they up to level 57). Allakhazam has the centis and transients listed at 46-53, but I haven't had a problem as long as I single pull... transient patroller adds have chased me out a time or two, but that was carelessness on my part. <br />
<br />
Invis works for the most part, but be careful moving through some of the inner rooms. There are traps that spawn up to 6 mindworms, or the 4-armed life-takers (they all level 57-60).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was duoing AR with my BL friend this weekend for a bit.  The xp isn't bad the but loot is garbage.  I guess if you stay there long enough you might luck out on some centi weapons.  It's a cool looking place and mobs are generally spaced for easy pulling.<br />
<br />
The one thing I'd say to watch for is the named looking roamer in robes (I forgot his name).  It appears to be a named but didn't drop anything special the 1st time we dropped him.  2nd time we fought him he gated and came back with a posse.  I think the phrase my friend used was, &quot;we should invis and relog because the last thing I want to see is a train of root casters&quot; - however we were semi-deep and couldn't log due to fighting roaming aliens.  His next quote, as we ran for our lives to the zone was, &quot;good thing we had pets.&quot;</div></div><hr />
