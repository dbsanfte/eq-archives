<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>RangerS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I read through the AA thread and found this 'general' AA advancement plan. But I don't know what level you need to be to train witch ability. Could someone help me out with the numbers. Thanks!<br />
<br />
<br />
Run3 <br />
Regen 3 <br />
Combatfury1 <br />
Finishing blow 1 (this speeds up xp grinding by quite a bit!) <br />
Mental Clarity 1 <br />
Natural Durability 2 <br />
Endless Quiver <br />
Archery mastery 1, 2, 3, <br />
Ambidexterity <br />
Innate Camo <br />
ND3 <br />
Combat stability 1 <br />
Combat agility 1 <br />
Physical enhancement</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Daesun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Go into the game and press V to display the AA ability window.  This shows EVERY AA skill you can train in and the requirements.<br />
<br />
Be aware that since PoP, Finishing Blow is a worthless skill.  I'd love a refund.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drienne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Finishing blow is worthless?  If you're talking about Coup de Grace, it requires that you have Finishing Blow at level 3.  And if you're talking about Headshot, that only works for (I assume) green mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>RangerS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am on a work call until next week and I am without EQ. Someone please post the levels needed for each ability for me please. Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Level 51 for General abilities<br />
Level 55 for Archtypes<br />
Level 59 for Class Skills<br />
<br />
Run3 <br />
Regen 3 <br />
These 2 can be attained at level 51, and are general abilities.  Most people recommend getting run3, and then leveling to 60 before worrying about more AA points.  You must spend 6 points in General before you can get any Archtypes.  The above represents 6 aa points.<br />
<br />
Combatfury1  (2 points)<br />
Finishing blow 1  (2 points)<br />
Mental Clarity 1  (2 points)<br />
Natural Durability 2  (2 + 4 = 6 )<br />
These are Archtypes and can be attained at level 55.  I think all Archtypes cost 2, then 4, then 6 for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd level of the skill.  So the 4 skills above represent 12 points.  You must spend 12 point in Archtype before you can get any Class skills.<br />
<br />
Endless Quiver  (9 points)<br />
Archery mastery 1, 2, 3,   (3 + 6 + 9 = 18 points)<br />
Ambidexterity  (9 points)<br />
Innate Camo  (5 points)<br />
These are Class skills, and can be attained at level 59.  The above skills represent 41 points total.<br />
<br />
ND3  (6 points for 3rd level in Archtype)<br />
Combat stability 1  (2 points for first level in Archtype)<br />
Combat agility 1  (same)<br />
Physical enhancement  (5 points, Class skill, pre-requisite of at least 1 level of NDurability, CStability, and CAgility, it gives 2 percent more in each of these 3)<br />
<br />
Level &gt; Gear, and Level &gt; AA skills.  I got my first 6 AA points before level 60 to break the monotony, but looking back, I could have skipped all AA until level 60.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I followed the above until MC1... at this point I branched down a slightly different road, but will end up in the same point eventually.  This is my path...<br />
<br />
Run3 <br />
Regen 3 <br />
<br />
Combatfury1 <br />
Finishing blow 1 <br />
Mental Clarity 1 <br />
Combat Agility 1<br />
Combat Stability 1<br />
Natural Durability 1 (may also go HG1 or SCF1 for this last arch)<br />
<br />
Endless Quiver <br />
Archery mastery 1, 2, 3, <br />
<br />
(at this point I'll plan for the following and have not finalized decisions in this area, other than knowing I'll be getting PE before ND2, and I value CA over CS)<br />
Ambidexterity <br />
Innate Camo <br />
Physical enhancement<br />
Combat agility 2 <br />
Combat stability 2 <br />
ND2 <br />
<br />
And at some point, <br />
MC3 <br />
NH3 <br />
Body and Mind Rejuvenation <br />
<br />
Basically the expenditure of my AA's will be decided on what gives the most benefit now to help me get more AA's points.  The new POP aa's have changed some things for me, and I will have to rethink at what point I will level beyond 60.<br />
