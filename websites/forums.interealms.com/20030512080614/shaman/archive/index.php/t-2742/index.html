<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is for the true newbie shaman, or more experienced shaman that might want tips. ;)  I wrote this for the shaman in my guild a while ago.  Please reply with other suggestions/ideas for the New Shaman on Raids.This is my personal opinion and how I go about handling things on a raid;<br />
<br />
Bring Shrink potions to every raid. It's one of your contributions. Most big tanks should have their own, but in case they don't, it's polite to have a couple 10s to pass around. If they want to buy it, fine, that's nice, offer them a raid discount, but don't expect to get paid for it. It'll let you shrink 'em down in outside zones and without the hassle of having them in your group on indoor raids. Always keep yourself shrinked. (Caveat; It's not always a good idea in Kael, you can't get up the stairs without jumping ;P).<br />
<br />
When the raid leader announces groups, WRITE THEM DOWN. Also note what everyone's class is (hopefully level wont' matter, but if they're less than 42, any of your 50+ buffs wont' work on them :( ). Tanks like to feel that you care, so ask them what buffs they really want/need. Plus some of them might max in something and not need it. If you're the only shaman, don't be afraid to tell them they can't have the dex buff - or, if you have JB pieces, use 'em to cast the lower level buffs. Most tanks have no clue if it's your 40th level buff or your 50th level buff ;P. And if you're casting HoS/Focus, it'll top 'em out most likely anyways.  (Note; Dex &amp; Str buffs don't stack with HoS/Focus anymore).  Write the buffs they want next to their name in order that you'll be casting them. Do one type of buff at a time and if you can cast one on yourself to set the timer first, do so. Then you know when to start buffing everyone else when it fades from you. If it's a buff you don't want to waste the mana on yourself for, ask one tank you can rely on to be your timer and cast on them first. With HoS &amp; Kragg you will have to stagger them. Far too mana intensive to do a full round. Again, make a couple tanks be your timers to let you know when they're fading.<br />
<br />
If you're doing Group Versions of the buffs, just make sure the Group leader /tells you when they need new ones and have them make sure everyone is in range.  That's part of the Group Leader's job.<br />
<br />
Never unmem slow (or whatever your spell you need for your debuff job) or your heal spell once in the raid area.  At least one other shaman should be the back up slower and keep it memmed in case the primary slower dies.  Don't expect to be able to mem a spell in an emergency.  You never know when you will need it. (And if you ever unmem Canibalize other than when you die, you've failed Shaman school, go make a cleric or druid).<br />
<br />
For the first pre-raid round of buffs, wear wisdom/mana gear. After the raid starts, get on your ac &amp; resistance gear. You'll never see full mana again anyways, so your pool size won't matter. Only how fast you can get your mana back will. And when you get summoned in the middle of the mosh pit and can't get out and are taking 150+ hits, you'll be glad you're wearing your armor.<br />
<br />
Rangers are your friends. They don't have a lot to do with their mana during a raid, and their heals are just a little bit more than your Canibalize is usually. They can basically give you their mana. Use it, ask for the Rangers to heal you when you are down low and just stand and chain Canibalize. Don't bother dancing, it's faster this way. And NEVER Canibalize below 1/2 health in a raid. Mobs like people that are injured, they're smart that way. If you get to 2 bubs of health some mobs will turn on you and kill you, even if you've done nothing else to them.<br />
<br />
If there are multiple shaman on the raid, the higher level ones should cast the buffs that they have that the lower level one's dont. Coordinate and talk to the other shaman. Usually it's polite to ask the higher level one what they want you to do. Ie; Focus &amp; Avatar (lvl 60), Group Stam &amp; Agi (57), Group Regrowth (56), Acumen (lvl 56), Kragg (lvl 55), Riotous Health (lvl 54), Deliously Nimble (lvl 53), Regrowth (lvl 52).<br />
Main tanks and pullers should have every bit of Hit points and ac you can muster. So Kragg, Stam and Agi are musts. MT also needs to keep aggro, many times they use procs to do this, so Dex is a must. And Str might help them hit for more.<br />
<br />
If you do not have Focus available, HoS is good for your damage dealers who shouldn't be getting hit. But it's also 50mana more than Kragg, so if you're the only buffer and have to buff 10 tanks, Kragg gives more HPS and is probably your best choice.<br />
<br />
All Enchanters and Clerics should have Agi &amp; Stam on them. It's just a little bit extra that might help them survive. Their own shield buff will not stack with HoS or Kragg, and it will overwrite it, so don't piss them off by casting it on them unless they ask. Some Enchanters prefer the extra hps to the ac of their own buff.<br />
<br />
Time the MT and Puller's Regrowth with your own. No one else really needs to have it on them all the time except maybe a Necro.<br />
<br />
The highest level shaman is always the slower. Not only is their slow a little bit better (1% per level difference) they will be resisted much less. Second highest shaman could keep it memmed for when the primary slower dies (very likely at some point in the raid). If the secondary Shaman is 54+ and has Plague of Insects, they should keep ready for magic resistant mobs. If there's a 3rd shaman, have them do the Disease debuff. Otherwise the Insects slower is gonna get the crap beat out of them cause both of those spells seem to have a higher aggro rate even than Turgur. Combined, you're looking at new bear skin rug.<br />
<br />
Slow the mobs as they come in and are mezzed. Get the one the tanks are on first, then have an /assist key set up for your enchanter to follow them along as they tash the parks and slow them. Make sure you announce your slows, and that they announce their mezs and tashes so you know when to do your thing. Hopefully they will then mem blur the mobs and you won't get beat on when mez breaks. But if not, you've now gained more aggro on the mobs than the enchanter has. This is a good thing. You're tougher than the little guy or girl in the robe. You can take it, they can't. In a serious cluster fudge, and the enchanter is getting killed (hopefully their healer is doing their job and you won't have to worry about that), root park and slow. Move around quickly and get the mobs off the enchanter. Hopefully you're used to doing this from regular xp groups. Get yourself right up on the mob, F8 to target, root them, get aggro, and move back and slow. Give the Enchanter room to breath and do his thing. You dying on the raid sucks, but the Enchanter dying could mean a wipe out. Take the death if you have to, it's the noble thing to do.  6 Slowed mobs in camp are ALOT easier to deal with than 6 non-slowed mobs.  Lets the enchanters get a mez in between hits and can make the difference between a wipe out and an amazing recovery.   I've been on raids where the RLer doesn't want the shaman to slow until after the assist is called on the mob.  IMO, they're an idiot and probably end up with dead enchanters all the time.<br />
<br />
Many many mobs require you to be in Melee range to cast on them. This is especially true in the Plane of Sky and with any Named mobs in the other Planes and zones and any uber mob encounter. But you should be close when you Slow or debuff anyways so the mob won't ping pong and piss the tanks off. The mob running after you means the MT is not taunting, which is your best chance of having it gotten off you anyways. A good MT will get the mob off you in max 3 hits. Just stand there and suck it up. Don't be a little girl and run around with it. Don't be embaressed to heal yourself while getting beat on.  If you can't get a heal off, go practicing channeling, you've obviously been root park/rotting too much.  But healing will get you more aggro.  If your healer isn't casting a quick heal on you when they see &quot;You will not evade me Fenira!&quot; have a little talk with them.<br />
<br />
If you are not the main slower, do not be discouraged. You still are a secondary healer and that is an important job. If no one else is casting Cripple (lvl 53), do so. It makes a big difference on Rampaging and Enraging mobs. But it does piss them off, so watch out for it running at you or getting summoned. As a secondary healer play the /assist monster game. See who he's beating on and toss them a heal. Also babysit the enchanters and other clerics. Again, hate to say it, they're more important overall to the raid than you are. Dying to save them is noble. Pay close attention during a big pull or if the enchanter is charming for crowd control. Keep them targeted and heal them AS SOON AS THEY TAKE DAMAGE. Do not wait, do not hesitate. Especially if you are using Sup Heal. Casting time is too slow to wait on. The enchanter will be dead if you wait until they are down 2 bubs of health.  Get the Fast Casting Focus Ring from Mages, it's very useful.<br />
<br />
Since I'm not 60 yet I dont' have first hand experience with Malo and Torpor. But Malo is a 45 UNRESISTABLE Fire, Cold, Magic, and Poison Resists debuffer. It's probably the biggest aggro spell in the game. For super mobs, toss it first, then after the Enchanter has tossed their Tash or Tish on (20-40% MR debuff) and it's mezed, toss on the slow.  Torpor isn't really for the fighting tank, as it slows (30%) and snares them (snare portion does not effect swimming ;) for all of 14 seconds. Tends to piss them off. But for 200 mana you can heal 1200hps in 4 ticks! Take that cleric! Great for between pulls and so awesome for filling up your own mana pool it's not even funny. With Cani 4 you can get back almost 700 mana from 1200 hps or Cani 5 (alt ability) mana regain is just sick. Canni V takes 1924 hps for.... don't know exact number, but it's about 35 percent of a lvl 60's mana pool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Gosh, thats alot of work to be doing, writing groups down, asking people what buffs they want, I'd be going nuts! Imagine doing that with 5, 6, 7 or more groups. It's the raiders responsibility to make sure they are properly buffed, not yours.<br />
<br />
Educate your guild on your mailing list/board about what your buffs do, how they stack, which they should get and how to ask for them, your raiding life will be far less stressful!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Doesn't hurt a bit to take out Canni for a real fast buff when you have all your other spell slots dedicated to more important things.  Should always be flexible on spells to take off mem, even canni soetimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I find it alot easier for ME to do the timing instead of suddenly being spammed with requests.  I know when the buffs will be fading and have them memmed and ready to go.<br />
<br />
I also then have a list of the enchanters and clerics and know who's health to keep a second eye on.<br />
<br />
When you hit the 60 lvl raids you're mainly only doing group buffs or select buffs, it's not so hard to keep a list.<br />
<br />
And Cani- if I'm buffing, I'm sure to need to cani some during it, if you have Regrowth on you're getting health back WAY faster when standing.  Tossing in a Cani between buff casts helps speed up mana recovery.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks Fen! I enjoyed your guide. As someone who's new to raiding, I'll take any advice I can get. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Time the MT and Puller's Regrowth with your own. No one else really needs to have it on them all the time except maybe a Necro.<br />
<br />
With the glory that is mod rod 2, casters/clerics can benefit from having regrowth during long fights.  My clerics insist on it, but often a druid in a Velious quest bp will supply the group regrowth.<br />
<br />
A couple of other things to be aware of:<br />
<br />
1) If you're helping out with agi/sta, be aware that the group versions don't stack.  If you have the group versions, tell groups to click off their single target agi/sta before you do the group versions.<br />
<br />
2) Malo isn't very taunty at all, generally.  Slow, however, will get you smacked.<br />
<br />
3) Torpor + mod rod 2 + clerics/casters = endless mana.  It's been an interesting paradigm shift to go from the role of &quot;Super Star Debuffer!&quot; to basically a twitch to clerics during long fights.  I do think that 60 shaman with torpor have a valuable niche in long high level fights, but it's a big change.  Our raid leaders set up groups:  MA cleric cleric cleric bard shaman to ensure that clerics have the mana to finish long fights.  Instead of thinking, two shaman is all we need, lately I've been thinking, if we only had a couple more 60 shaman with torpor at this raid!  <br />
<br />
It's a big easier at 60 to keep a fairly stable spell line up, mine looks like this while buffing while on raiding:<br />
<br />
Chloro - never dememmed<br />
Torpor - never dememmed<br />
Group Agi - swapped out with Malo<br />
Group Sta - swapped out with whatever else I'm casting<br />
root - never dememmed (if it's useful at that raid)<br />
slow - never dememmed<br />
Group focus - switched out with group regrowth<br />
Canni- never dememmed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I did not always know this -- that Shaman slow and root spells don't break mez because they don't do damage.  So go ahead and cast slow and root on each mezzed mob.<br />
<br />
At level 52, I can't slow most raid mobs until the chanter Tashes them, which happens after the MT calls for assist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">After you get malo, this is my experience:<br />
<br />
Main tank engages<br />
I malo immediately<br />
Bard does his debuff thing immediately<br />
(at this point 5-6 seconds have gone by)<br />
Enchanters tash (they start the tash after they see my Malo announcement)<br />
Mages/shaman do malosini<br />
Shaman slow<br />
MA calls assist (our tanks really like to build aggro before they call assist)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thanks for the comments and input folks.<br />
I will note that Cripple seems to earn more aggro than just about anything else I cast; except healing the Cleric who just CHed the MT and stole aggro from him.  I always seem to get summoned after that one :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I play with a lot of really good rangers and they are always needing more mana hehe.  If you are on a raid, usually there will be multiple clerics there and those outside of group 1 will (in my experience) have plenty of spare mana to throw you heals if you ask.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>ryse_eq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Usually in a raid the order of debuffs (that usually ensures slow and others to land ) goes as follows:<br />
<br />
1: high level dispell magic<br />
2: malo<br />
3: tash<br />
4: malosini (sometimes it casted or not)<br />
5: turgur (slow)<br />
6: cripple<br />
7: other nice debuffs (MoK, etc)<br />
<br />
3a: insidious decay<br />
3b: plague of insects<br />
<br />
Fortunately, during my guild's raids, I usually am not the only 60 shaman.  Generally speaking either myself or 2 other guildies have mgb plus malo, torpor, cann5, etc, so buffing is easy.  The hard part is... sometimes I might have to be the primary healer of my group since i might be hooked up with all the monks/wizzies/rangers and/or clerics whine about the c-heal rotation so they forget people.  Trying to heal everyone in the group, debuffing, buffing, cybering.... equals some really sore fingers :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">No no no NO<br />
<br />
On a raid, a shaman has only 1 duty, and it is an extremely important duty:<br />
<br />
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to see how many times you can get summoned by the same mob in a single fight!<br />
<br />
You get a point for every time you get summoned in a single fight, and a bonus of 2 points if you survive. You also get a bonus pont if you manage to get ping-pong summoned between 2 mobs at the same time, as well as the point for each individual summoning<br />
<br />
My current record is 8 points from a single mob - 6 summons and survived) and 7 points on ping-pong summons - died tho : (<br />
<br />
Who cares about buffing and all that crap - play the summoning game - its fast and fun! It really teached you how to maximise your aggro generation and your AC!</div></div><hr />

<br />
-- if you don't get summoned, you're waiting too long to slow --<br />
<br />
Otherwise, the clerics have to heal the MT too much, and then they dont' get their cybering time in, and they get cranky, and all hell breaks loose!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>zooilogical</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I've been 60 shaman for a while now, few things i can say about debuff agro. Malo is NOT a major agro, I often cast it as soon as the MA has engaged a mob. Malosini is also not a very big taunt. The 2 spells that will get you killed are Turgurs and Cripple, they both have a pretty large taunt. My experience includes 60+ mobs in Kael, ToV , Sleepers, Umbral Plains, Akheva, Western Wastes, and of course the planes. I have never gotten fatal agro from malo or malosini. I have died many times due to Turgurs or Cripple agro.  My spell setup usuall includes the following <br />
<br />
Malo (always memed, always)<br />
Cripple/Talis Cat/Talis Brute/Cerelity<br />
Regrowth/Group Regrowth/Immobilize/Khuras<br />
Turgurs(always mem'd)<br />
Primal Avatar(always memd, damn those melee crack whores)<br />
Chloroblast(always mem'd)<br />
Cani4(always mem'd)<br />
Torpor(always mem'd)<br />
<br />
Also although this may raise some controversy hehe I keep a charsima kit always on me , maybe I'm superstitious, but I have 2 opal steins and a kolbold jester crown that I slap on occasionally when I'm having trouble sticking a slow on tough mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jori</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">First time poster, long time lurker here :)<br />
<br />
A couple things I do when raiding:<br />
<br />
Debuffing:<br />
<br />
I don't use a &quot;Malo on Target&quot; macro, instead my macro goes like this:<br />
<br />
/gu &lt;==&gt; Casting MALO on %T &lt;==&gt;<br />
/cast 5<br />
/pause 30<br />
/gu GO DEBUFF TEAM GO GO GO!!<br />
<br />
Heh I got a lot of teasing about my debuff team cheer when I first started using it, BUT, it got the attention of the chanters, mages, other shaman and (when needed) druids.  The /pause 30 works great to where, shortly after my cheer, in goes tash, in goes sini, and in goes slow.  After two or three times of using the debuff cheer, people in the guild were *amazed* at how much more quickly the mobs were getting slowed. The MT was thrilled, the clerics even more so.  It seems pointless to me to have a macro saying Malo is in, because it can't be resisted, and you can get slow on a lot easier and faster when the debuffers know Malo is going in.<br />
<br />
Buffing:<br />
<br />
Well, two different strategies here.<br />
<br />
First, if there is more than one shaman on the raid, we often have a shaman raid chat channel.  There we can decide who is doing what buffs.  We currently only have one shaman with MGB, so Focus is pretty much defered to her. :)<br />
<br />
If I'm the only shaman on the raid: heh I tell the guild they can find me by the lines of mod rods on the ground. :)  MT group gets buffed first, then our puller group.  These two groups require no tells to be sent to me, I know what they want/need.  Everyone else waits until after those two groups have been buffed, and then they start spamming me with tells. (I set up a seperate chat window *just* for tells, to make it much easier to keep track of requests)<br />
I've had to train some members of my guild that they really *can* get buffs from other classes (namely regrowth, the druids are bored, they love to buff!!).  I've also had to train a couple people that if they don't ask for a buff *before* a pull is incoming, they're more than likely not gonna get it.  There's a reason I tell the guild that the shaman buffing station is shutting down in 1 minute, and then again in 30 seconds, and then CLOSED! They'll get rebuffed when they either die, get dispelled, or the buffs wear off.<br />
<br />
I think, perhaps the most frustrating thing is when I have a latecomer to the raid, and they have their group leader send me a tell for group focus, sta, and agi.  Sta/Agi, really, nbd, but group focus drains the mana, especially when I *know* I just focused that group (or we just had MGB focus). So I always end up saying &quot;Group focus? How many people missed the last group focus I cast on your group?&quot; The reply is almost always the same &quot;let me ask&quot;  /wait forever &quot;oh, ok, just late_to_raid_member_01 needs focus&quot;  /sigh sometimes I think it's just a ploy to keep me low HPs for the majority of the raid! ;)<br />

Have the buffing shaman anounce frequently which buffs he is casting. &quot; Casting HoS, Acumen PST&quot; This will prevent the slowing, debuffing shaman from getting tons of needless buff tells.</div></div><hr />

I agree with Bowler.  My typical raid buffs cast at 60 are gsta and gfoc, with the appropriate warning to the cleric to get out of range if he wants to keep that nifty self-only mana regen spell s/he has.  Periodically I'll get a special request for agi or cha, and I generally give item buffs for this (got your nifty little bag of JB items?).  <br />
<br />
I also carry a Hammer of the Dragonborn for the Primal Essence right click.  Primal Essence is 20 str 20 sta 20 dex 20 agi targetable from the hammer.  Although many of our tanks are already primal (and PA overwrites PE), there are a ton of casters who still want it.<br />
<br />
My spell lineup is <br />
<br />
1. Superior Heal (no I don't want to mess around with the little heal in a raid.  I pretty much always have kei anyway), <br />
<br />
2. Group regrowth (if I get it, they get it, although sometimes the druid wants to do this, which is fine), <br />
<br />
3. Cann4, <br />
<br />
4. Turgurs, <br />
<br />
5. Malo, <br />
<br />
6. Sini (or Plague of Insects or gsta, switched out depending on need), <br />
<br />
7. Cripple (or Insidious debuff or gfoc, switched out depending on need), and<br />
<br />
8. Torpor.<br />
<br />
That's a raid lineup.  In solo or group lineup, spell 5 is generally Bane of Nife, spell 6 is generally Pox, and spell 7 is always Paralyzing Earth.  One of the dots can be changed to Malo if necessary, but honestly, Malo has much less utility in groups than in raids.<br />
<br />
Cripple will get you killed more than anything else, even Turgurs, but it's very important, especially on flurry mobs.  If you do a count of 5 or so after a resisted cripple, it'll help get the mob's attention off you and onto the MT again.  Same with slow.</div></div><hr />
