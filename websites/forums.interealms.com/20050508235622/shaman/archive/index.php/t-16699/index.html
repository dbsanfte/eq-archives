<br />
I'm in the same boat. After completing my 10th mission (and talking to the correct NPC), I received the message my stone had grown more powerful, however no stats. I've bugged it, but as of yet, no luck getting the stats. <br />
<br />
I believe you'll see the stats in inventory, however you might want to combine it (with your charm) to be sure. If you don't have a charm, simple charms (1 - 6 points) can be purchased at all camps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You will not see any stats, as long sa the stone is in inventory. I never saw. However, as soon as you augment some charm with it, the stats will be visible and in effect. I put mine into the Intricate Wooden Figurine, can always get a new stone if needed :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valdak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thank you, I will combine it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">not to mention that the stats won't show until you zone :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Daedric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Don't worry about putting it in a bad charm either.  You can always get another stone.  I know this for a fact since after completing an adventure, but wiping on a chest (doh!) I hailed the NPC at the camp before getting a rez and he gave me another adventure stone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I believe the progression of the bonuses is +1 to all stats and +10 HP and +10 Manna for each up.  So in the end it will be +10 to all stats and +100 HP and +100 Manna.  However, that&#8217;s just what I&#8217;ve read.  I&#8217;ve yet to see it for myself.  I&#8217;ve done about 20 adventures but they have been spread over all the themes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have gotten the message about my adventure stone getting more powerful, and I do have it in the Magenta Talisman charm that I bought, but I still do not see any stats on it.  Should I dissolve it and get a new stone, then recombine it with the charm?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">For 10 adventures in a single wayfarer camp you get a whopping 2 hp and 2 mana :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've done 12 successful missions in Rujarkian Hills. Hailed the npc 6 times, after the 10th successful mission I hailed the npc (was hailing every 2 times) got the message that my stone glowed with power (or whatever it says), and still get no stats. This was all done while my stone was in the bank. Immediately afterward I bound it to my crappy little brotherhood charm, still no stats. Oviously I've zoned many times since then, still no stats. Heard many are having this problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">After you have done 10 missions in a theme and hailed the right NPC you get the msg that the stone became more powerfull. You have to zone to see the improvment.<br />

BTW I use the adventure stone in the intricate wooden figurine. With PoTime access and 100 adventures done in each theme it will be 180HP / 200mana, 20SvAll + some stats.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- did the first two, but no text from Teria Grinntti with 32 wins. Also, is there no 50 win NPC for Mir?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Extraor Dinary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Instead of finding who I'm supposed to talk to and hailing them after x amounts of wins I just run around and hail every NPC in a camp that I'm about to do an adventure in.  I don't do this everytime but once in a while.  Sometimes I get 'You have received a valuable piece of information' message and just spam hail him until I get 'You must do more adventures' text.  After 10 adventures in Butherblock I got the 'Your stone glows with power' message and noticed a 2hp 2mana increase in my charm sometime later after zoning!  I was told the increases only show up when in a LDoN adventure but that appears to be false.  Apparently only the charms you buy from the merchants that are like +6 to a stat that you can add the adventurer stone to will only work in the adventures, but the stats the adventurer stone gives you as you increase it with adventures are always on.  Like many I have the Intricate Wooden Figurine which, after my flags, is <br />
<br />
AC5 STR +3 STA +3 WIS +4 AGI +4 HP +24 MANA +30 SV ALL + 3<br />
<br />
After my text 'Your stone glows with power' it became.<br />
<br />
AC5 STR +3 STA +3 WIS +4 AGI +4 HP +26 MANA +32 SV ALL + 3<br />
<br />
I had the Figurine and stuck the adventure stone in it before I did any adventures and have had it in there since day 1 so sorry to say I can't comment on any of the problems people have had.  The only thing I can think of doing would be dissolve the stone, get another one, stick it in your charm and then spam hail everyone at every camp till you get the 'You must do more adventures' message to see if that fixes anything.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Some of the people that you have to hail are not in any adventure camps. Plus I'm trying to put together a guide for this for my site. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The list of people to talk to for each camp seems fairly accurate, however I think the amount of wins may not be for all those listed.  In any case, if you start with the first guy to talk to at the particular camp, and keep hailing him after every adventure, you will learn who to next talk to.  Then keep talking to him/her to find out who next to talk to and so on.  It's not very hard to figure out.<br />
<br />
Right now, after 150+ wins (40ish Mir, 40ish Mmc, 30ish NRo, 20ish SRo and EC), my adventure stone is:<br />
AC3, +3 to all stats, +3 to all saves, +30 hp, +30 mana<br />
<br />
I don't think the progression is linear at all, I just tried typing an example and proved myself wrong :).  The last couple upgrades I received, I stayed at +2 stats, but the hp/mana increased to 22, then 24, then like 27, then 30.  So not sure what the real formula is.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, I did notice that the upgrade wasn't always immediately apparent, but zoning made it show up for sure.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">One issue that may confuse things is people doing adventures that are not level 65.  It was told to me once that lower level characters have to do more adventures to get the incremental increases in augment stats.  I was told that points, rather than number of adventures won determine the increases.<br />
<br />
I have spent zero effort in proving or disproving these statements, because I frankly don't care.  But it may explain why some of the augments haven't shown stats yet.</div></div><hr />

That would make sense, considering the text for it says &quot;Recommended level of 65.&quot; now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well I doubt thats true. Low level chars might have to do more but it's not because it's total points. Personally I've done probably 1/3 to 1/2 of my ldon missions on hard. Even doing hards which give double the points of regulars it was hail every 2 get stats every 10 missions at the camp.<br />
<br />
As far as the charm stats go it is +2hps/mana to start off with and every time you pass a 10hps/mana line you get +1 to all stats. At some point later on tho you start getting more hps each bump. Otherwise it would take 50 bumps or 10 in each camp or 100 runs in each camp which it doesn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">They will show before zoning.  Try removing the charm and then putting it back into the slot and looking again.  Worked for me.<br />
<br />
Zoneing essentially accomplishes the same thing, which is basically re-equiping the item in its slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The Adventure Camp charm I bought when LDoN first came out only worked while you were in an adventure. If you augment such a charm with your adventurer's stone, it is quite possible your charm augmented with the adventurer's stone will only show increases when you are in an adventure.</div></div><hr />
