<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dumahim Ashenbane</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't spent as much time in PoP as I should be, but that's only because I've been making Nightmare bows, but what's going on with these spell parchments?  I'm guessing I've spent 20 hours between PoI, PoN, and PoD and not even seen a single parchment.  I was ok with that, because 20 hours isn't really all that long.  But I started asking around in the guild if anyone else has gotten any, and not one guild mate has seen one yet.  I'm talking people with nearly 100 hours so far.  Nothing.  This seems incredibly odd.  Are they really that rare?</div></div><hr />

At one stage while I spent 5-6 hours getting 1 parchment another guild group in the same zone (PoD) got 5.  Guess it is just luck really.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dumahim Ashenbane</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 01:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Killed quite a few things in PoD.   Spiders, Rats, bugs, globs, fleas, etc...  Went a bit into PoI, spent time there.  Heard tin men drop em, never seen anything.  Spent most time in PoN, but keep getting stuck in the same spot south of the river, so I don't think I'll get anything there.   Where should I be looking?</div></div><hr />

You just need to find the mobs that drop em. Sorry im not going to ruin the fun of finding them but i will say i have seen them drop in trials and off specific types of mobs in each zone &lt;cough&gt; usually the higher level stuff &lt;cough&gt;.</div></div><hr />

Tend to get 1 an hour in like pov maybe less.</div></div><hr />
