<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In the ongoing saga of LDON - what's been your latest bad group?  I just got out of a hard (loss) where the tank (Paladin) had...6,700 health.<br />
<br />
The puller (63 Bard) brought back two and before the second could get locked down (no resists, just normal casting time) - dead Paladin.  The rest of the group was light DPS, the Cleric was only 64 (How I got talked into a hard I dunno) and was CH'ing the tank 2-3 times a fight.<br />
<br />
/e shudders.  Man, you just need to put people on your DNG list and put the bad adventures BEHIND you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tindaorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">my worst would be a hard adv where it consited of a 65 Monk,Cleric,Ranger,Paladin,Me,Wizard.  Cleric went LD at begining of the adv and wizard went ld a total of 5 times throughout.  I ended up healing with no C and me on CC and slows.  We won the adv but was alot slower due to me having to med a few times and the monks craptastic pulls..<br />
in short we go lucky</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Umm. why does him having 6700 hit points make him a bad player?<br />
<br />
My Shadowknight has 7011 Fully buffed. And he has all the Hit point AA and Most of the tanking ones. Do I Suck at EQ?<br />
<br />
Sorry something is wrong here. It isnt a bad player. And I push the envelope of single group content all the time. And have all the flags I can with the exception of GoD (Which I am working on) that don't require raids.<br />
<br />
Only exception is I dislike LDON But still go there when needed.<br />

<br />
Just LOVE those little suprise package groups.<br />
<br />
Of course, they freak when I'm like, &quot;Inc 6&quot;, so I guess it all works out in the end.  By the time the adventure is done, they're sufficiently terrified of my pulling they're ready to log anyway.  Then I can hopefully get a guild group!  :)<br />

Well, he didnt really say the guy was a bad player, but that the group itself was &quot;bad&quot;. There is a difference between inadequacy and ability. His example is proof. One 2-pull, and without any &quot;abnormal&quot; events, the tank was dead. With 2K more hps, he MIGHT have lived long enough to get some heals down and lock down the 2nd mob.</div></div><hr />

Hehe on easy my shammy just pulls whatever comes (I 6 box). Doing Tak again after 120 missions elsewhere and had my first death in like 2 months. &quot;Bad&quot; shammy pulled 10 (8 and then that famous Tak proximity aggro grabbed two more mid fight) and only lost my wizard. AOE Taunt/Defensive then Slow mez, slow mez, slow mez, meanwhile tank/nuke/nuke. Thank god for Cel Regen/DA and pally/cleric grp heal.<br />
<br />
Oh worst experience, losing a LDoN as I clicked on the &quot;Yes&quot; to pick up the last collect followed by the next mission where I lost when I had the last slaughter at 1%. Since then have not won with less than 20 minutes to spare. Put a fire under my ass it did :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I know the LDoN hards at 62 aren't the same as the LDoN hards at 65, but I've resurrected an old pulling trick that seems to limit the adds.<br />
<br />
I used to use this in the old pre-revamp Hole when I soloed/duoed there.<br />
The Old elemental X's use to come in pairs and it was near impossible to pull singles, until I learned a new use for a spell I never used much.<br />
<br />
BURST OF FLAME - yes our level 1 DD for 5 pts of damage quick cast low mana spell.<br />
<br />
Stand near max range, cast and enjoy.  Most of the time it will pull a single (it does still get some doubles in Fezzik camp in Droga). There are some zones where mobs are tighly packed (LDoN guk) or places where MoB's have a huge agro radius (Fear  :p ) where it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Yes, you need the right group members in order to have a spare gem slot, but if you do, give it a shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Two SKs, a cleric, enchanter, me(shaman) and some other class in a Normal Tak LDoN.  &quot;What?&quot; you ask, &quot;That's an awesome group!&quot;.  Yeah it is, except everyone except me and the cleric(guildmate) were so terrified of multiple pulls that the adventure took over an hour to complete(on a collect 20!).  The SKs insisted on single pet pulling and the guy pulling didn't even have pet hold.  The cleric and I tried to say we should just rush and let the chanter mez but we were shot down because it was too dangerous.<br />
<br />
Sheesh, I can CC whole rooms of mobs in Tak with just my right click root pants and get everything slowed and primary heal with just Q and the occasional Tnarg(I do it in crazy patchwork guild groups all the time).</div></div><hr />

<br />
You sir, ma'am are insane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Delvean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I did a normal LDoN about a week ago with a group of all 65's. Generally, I don't take pick up groups for normal LDoN's anymore since I would much prefer to do a hard or GoD. However, since the invite came from a cleric in a guild that has been farming time for quite a while now, I figured it would be a fast easy 51 points while I waited for some friends to log in.<br />
<br />
Things started looking bad after I joined the group. There was 5 of us there already, the cleric, me (paladin), a druid, enchanter, and a wizard. The cleric said he was grabbing another wizard for DPS. Instead, he invites a barbarian warrior, however, he didn't realize that the warrior wasn't a wizard until after several pulls in the adventure when we were deciding who should tank. This isn't a problem really, I figure it will just take us a little longer to win.<br />
<br />
Now, the cleric insists that he pulls. He proceeds to start pacifying and single pulling mobs. He is waiting until each mob dies before he goes to get another. Mind you, this is a time+ cleric and we have an enchanter in the group. We have a collect 29 in an easy rujarkian dungeon and it is going incredibly slow. We come upon our first slave slayer and the druid charms it to speed up our DPS. She asks the enchanter to haste it, but the cleric steps in and says it is too risky to haste anything other than a dire charmed pet. For whatever reason, the enchanter listens to the cleric, so the druid just uses her own pet haste spell her wolf.<br />
<br />
Mobs are dieing faster now at least with a charmed pet, but pulls are still slow. So I jump the gun on the cleric and pull 2 myself before he can pacify one of them. He proceeds to spam the group asking who pulled and stating that he is the puller and not anyone else.<br />
<br />
A little further in, we have a runner that makes it into the next room before it is snared and aggros 3 mobs on us. Predictably, the cleric starts spamming EVAC EVAC EVAC. Meanwhile, I am spamming exactly the opposite. The druid listened to me, but unfortunately the wizard listened to the cleric. So now we are back at the zone in instead because the cleric didn't think we could handle 3 mobs. He now proceeds to lay into me cussing and saying that he is the group leader and he calls evac and no one else and if I have a problem with that that I should just leave now. I was very tempted to do so, but we were only several items away from finishing the adventure, so I stay. I did reply that a 3 pull was absolutely nothing to worry about and that I frequently handle larger pulls than that with no enchanter in the group. He made some response about how there were more mobs in the room that could aggro (which they didn't cause they were too far away).<br />
<br />
Long story short, we finish the normal adventure in somewhere around 80 minutes and we were having a decent drop rate. The cleric was a total moron and I won't be grouping with him again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Me and my friend usually do ldons, 65 sk,sham,wizz,cleric. Havent failed on in a long long time.<br />
<br />
We do them slow, two boxing, bout 45mins to an hour to complete.<br />
<br />
My pulling style can be frightening to the non defensive aa'd folk.<br />
<br />
The SK pulls everything and if you get more than 5 evac, else just tank the lot.<br />
<br />
I alternate pulling with the SK or sham depending on which one is free at the time. Either one can tank a couple without drama and a few with concentration.<br />
<br />
Prefer the SK cause all the pulled adds stick on him first.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I invite some people along for fun, but after last night I decided never again!<br />
<br />
Did the old MGB thing in POK, and a chanter MGB'd kei as well so i thought to myself, seems ok, he was lfg, late at night groups are scarce, so I asked him if he wanted to attend our ldon. Asks if he can invite a friend, fine.<br />
<br />
We get in there, 10 minutes into the adv the chanter ask &quot;are you dual boxing?&quot; to which i say yes, as i said, me and my friend make up tank/slower/cleric/dps. Silence, then he decides he wants to pull, ok fine.<br />
<br />
After 5 minutes of decidedly terrible pulling. He cracks it and just stands there watching mobs pund on the cleric (who hasnt all his defensive aa's yet) and lets him die.<br />
<br />
Its no big drama for me cause I can heal and slow an easy ldon fine. So i say no drama, just run him back.<br />
<br />
Next thing I know him and his mate /q out.<br />
<br />
So anyway we finish the adv kill or 55 mobs in about 1:10 as usual allowing some reduced dps time for the cleric to run back from pok, but sometimes I wish you could set a &quot;no dont give the arsehole the points when he went 'link dead' flag&quot;.<br />
<br />
So me and my friend have decided that we dont need anyone else so we arent going to invite people unless we know them.<br />
<br />
Why dont people realise that the world is like a mirror. It dishes back at them what they give out. All they do by behaving like immature kiddies is make people more reluctant to group with them.<br />
<br />
Anyway /whine off<br />
<br />
Laters folks!<br />

Rowf! rowf rowf!<br />

<br />
The leader got a *HARD* LDoN and didn't bother to tell anyone until AFTER we had wiped to the first room when he brought 4.<br />

I did a Hard LDON with a 6200 HP tank with 12 aa, a 65 cleric with zero AA, FT5 and 4K mana.<br />
<br />
I won in 1H15. Paladin died once, cleric mana was steady altho she needed 2 med break.<br />
<br />
I was pulling with my bard tho, so single pulls helped.<br />
<br />
nothing is impossible, it was just truely &quot;'hard&quot;, and i helped the cleric healing.</div></div><hr />

Nah nights like last night validate the 6box. Had easy LDoN with 3 Named in adjacent rooms. Never seen anything like it. Nothing like hording 3 drops and all the loot :) Got a Arch. BP and a couple other lesser items in Tak. Things do go faster with a looter and/or puller so sometimes I bring along another live one ;)<br />
<br />
It also makes my early am playtime easier since no need to waste time finding grp.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well, I just lost a NORMAL LDoN the other day. I really thought it was impossible for people to suck that much at EQ, but I guess it is possible. No cleric, 4 tanks in group, 1 paper monk and me. Think about the DPS in that group.<br />
<br />
God damn, first pull the monk pulls like 5. Great, in my own guild, I know that people can live long enough so I can slow them all THEN heal. But nope, paper monk dies, later find out that Daluda's is basically a CH for him...2 of the other tanks have less than 5k hp. The tank from my guild had about 8k hp, but that doesn't help when 5 unslowed mobs (due to me blast healing =/) are smacking you down.<br />
<br />
I guess gear is more of an issue than skill, but the monk was seriously brutal. Couldn't pull worth a damn...one of the newb tanks didn't know how to get an adventure, then didn't know how to use the magus...*sigh* First LDoN normal loss since the expansion first came out.<br />
<br />
/agree with CHutoi, I HATE people that make me group with a lvl 60 tank and a lvl 50 cleric, recruiting with a 65 wiz or something. No more LDoN pickups for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The last LDON that went out the window was a normal with some of my decent friends.<br />
<br />
Usually theyre a decent bunch of fellows but that day was different.<br />
<br />
We ended after our second wipe when we had runner that the pallies forgot to root.<br />
<br />
The first wipe was probably from my train when i took a wrong turn :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Patzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Was on a random LDoN with a bunch of people I didn't know. <br />
<br />
About 10 minutes in someone decides to play &quot;whats in the chest&quot;.... Poison of course.<br />
<br />
I was healing as much as I could and also trying to cure poison (which wasn' working well at all). I give up trying to cure after about 10 seconds and just focus on healing.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden someone is SCREAMING &quot;SHAMAN WHY AREN'T YOU ****ING HEALING AND CURING POISON&quot;. I had been busting my BUTT keeping people alive as much as I could with my greater healing. No one died but we were pretty bad off. We get ourselves together...... <br />
<br />
So what does Mr. Genious do? Yup, he goes for the chest again... Total wipe.  *angry* doesn't even begin to describe....<br />
<br />
Another one was...<br />
<br />
We had a pretty shoddy group. Slow pulling, Slow Killing... We ran out of time with 3 more to go for the collect. The a few people in the group decided to not even bother finishing the 3 more kills and just bails. Total waste of time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its my worst group cause it happens a LOT.</div></div><hr />

The group will be like guild druid cleric me sk wiz and usually an ench from lfg tool. We were getting bored with the standard ldon so I had the cleric and me pull and wed get like 5. Then the cleric would go back to a room and blind a mob. Like 10 sec later this huge train arrived and I was cycling through targets like mad clicking TA and balancing and i was like AE AE AE **** and I think I freak out the ench because they never wanna do LDoN with me again. Even though nobody died and we won in 12 minutes 8(((((((.<br />
<br />
PS: 6700 HP is weak as hell for a tank if you are expecting to win an LDoN. Hell I almost have that unbuffed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Well, he didnt really say the guy was a bad player, but that the group itself was &quot;bad&quot;. There is a difference between inadequacy and ability.<br />
<br />
<br />
huh?<br />
<br />
I dunno what all that is,  but what is clear is that, geez blazz you sure do like to hear yourself talk.<br />
<br />
always some semantic shenanigans going on.<br />
<br />
in straight talk, yeah the paladin was a bad player.  and he was for 2 reasons<br />
<br />
first, he's a bad player because the first thing you need to know is what you can and cannot do.  being able to tank a couple of mobs for a number of moments while things get locked down is a requirement.  it's not semantically locked to his HP but it's part of it.  looking at the group and his own experiences, if it looks like he can't do the adventure, with a 64 cleric or whatever, he needs to state that.  otherwise he's wasting his time and the group's<br />
<br />
secondly.  sadly, due to game mechanics, better gear does make for a better player.  each player of course has the limits of his playskill but that's always magnified by a factor of XXX based on gear.  I think in all ways stating that all other things being equal, better gear == better player is an absolutely fair statement.  there's also the idea that part of being a better player is working out the ways to access better gear.  that's not cool to hear or say but that's the truth, a lot of this game is logistics.  being better at logisitics and outfitting your toon is the number one thing that influences how well you do your role in EQ.  which is the bottom line.<br />
<br />
case in point, I play on a couple of servers.  mostly the same classes (bard and shaman/ sk, cleric or ench).  on druzzil, where my bard has the same spells and effects (in terms of clickies utitility abilities etc) but substantially fewer HP and less AC, even doing something trivial like making a run in to solo drussela can be touch and go (lulling everything, timing my DA, and being very very carefull) where on my other server I can zone in train to her, fade, take some HT from any pathers, pull DS while killing them and gate out in literally under two minutes.  in early GoD I could solo in the sewers, I could never have done that on my lesser geared toon.  I'd say that although my player skill and knowledge is same, on one server I'm a middle-level bard due to limitations and on the other I can do some really fun stuff.  gear = skill in EQ there's really no other way to say it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I'll also state that a 64 cleric and a &lt;7k tank doesn't necessarily mean a loss in hard LDON, not by a long shot.  nor does a a wipe or 2 at the beginning.  collects make hard ldon fairly trivial.  as I'm sure everyone who's had more than a handfull of LDONs, you often end up losing people during the course of an adventure, have a ranger tank when tank LDs or shaman heal when you lose cleric etc...<br />
<br />
of course if both your tank and your main healer both suck, it's the ONE possible combination that makes things hard.  I remember one adventure when the tank was really sloppy and slow and kept losing agro and the healer was molassis on the draw and so after one slow I'd be there basically tanking every mob while healing myself... that really pissed me off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">One of two things have to happen in a successful hard LDoN.  <br />
<br />
Good CC or a good puller.  You can win with either, but you will lose 90% of the time without either.  A Shaman can only cast so fast to bail the group out, and if you do it constantly, eventually a resist or two will end up in a wipe.  I love having Bards pull/CC, but it is just my personal preference.  Being able to pre-slow mobs makes LDoNs trivial even in high risk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Just got out of a hard LDON. Myself, four other guildys, and a pickup bard from one of those guilds where it seems like 99% of the membership has an attitude problem. Myself, cleric, shadow knight, paladin, ranger, bard. Seems like we're good to go ... we zone in. Two single pulls, we're more than fine. Next pull, he brings four, and doesn't tell us he has four until he gets back to the group and then tries to play Fading Memories ... which doesn't work because the four mobs converge on him and eat half the group alive in short order. Not a problem. Rez up, zone in, rebuff, all is well. The cleric, paladin and bard do not have KEI / VOQ ... he's OOM ... and PULLS. Brings the same four and a buddy mob. We wiped. We got cussed at by the bard ... AFTER he ran up to us and died practically in our laps from his idiocy. We left. Ignore *******_bard_01.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">in straight talk, yeah the paladin was a bad player. and he was for 2 reasons<br />
<br />
You are operating from a different idea of what the term &quot;Bad player&quot; means than what Snoww and Blazz (and I for that matter) use.<br />
<br />
When we say it, we are talking about their skill at the game. Not their level of equipment.<br />
<br />
looking at the group and his own experiences, if it looks like he can't do the adventure, with a 64 cleric or whatever, he needs to state that. otherwise he's wasting his time and the group's<br />
<br />
Here you are making an unwarented assumption. Do you know if that Paladin had ever done a run under those conditions? Or do you feel that he shouldn't do it until he already know that can do it (and he can only know it for certain if he has already tried...).<br />
<br />
gear = skill in EQ there's really no other way to say it<br />
Sorry, but that is utter BS. While gear does place an upper cap on your capabilites, it isn't equivilant to skill. If it were, then I could take your well equiped bard and do anything you could with it. I wouldn't be able to, since I have never played a bard (even for 1 minute..) and am not sufficiently familiar with what it takes to play them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">huh?<br />
<br />
I dunno what all that is,  but what is clear is that, geez blazz you sure do like to hear yourself talk.<br />
Agree, Vicaden washed down with Bloody Marys do that to a person. <br />
in straight talk, yeah the paladin was a bad player.  and he was for 2 reasons<br />
<br />
first, he's a bad player because the first thing you need to know is what you can and cannot do.  being able to tank a couple of mobs for a number of moments while things get locked down is a requirement.  it's not semantically locked to his HP but it's part of it.  looking at the group and his own experiences, if it looks like he can't do the adventure, with a 64 cleric or whatever, he needs to state that.  otherwise he's wasting his time and the group's<br />
It depends. We do not know the full story here. DId the Paladin form the group, or was he asked to tank a hard, and responded &quot;I can tank em as long as we get single pulls&quot;.  6800 hps is adequate (barely) to tank a Hard, if you have good pulling, slowing, and healing. But again, we dont know much other than that single bit of information, therefore, you cant just label someone &quot;bad&quot;.<br />
secondly.  sadly, due to game mechanics, better gear does make for a better player.  each player of course has the limits of his playskill but that's always magnified by a factor of XXX based on gear.  I think in all ways stating that all other things being equal, better gear == better player is an absolutely fair statement.  there's also the idea that part of being a better player is working out the ways to access better gear.  that's not cool to hear or say but that's the truth, a lot of this game is logistics.  being better at logisitics and outfitting your toon is the number one thing that influences how well you do your role in EQ.  which is the bottom line.<br />
I dont really care for your personal definition of the words I guess. &quot;Bad&quot; and &quot;better&quot; are measures of skills, not gear. If you want to accuse the Pally of poor judgement, as in your &quot;first&quot; portion, then I can accept that FAR more than using gear to define &quot;good, bad, or better&quot;. Better gear = more flexibility and less impact from mistakes. This example is a case in point. If the Pally had 9K hps, he probably survives the 2-pull &quot;mistake&quot;. <br />
<br />
On the flip side, I have seen people in awesome gear that are truly &quot;BAD&quot; players. Honestly, when LDoN first came out, it because fairly easy to seperate the wheat from the chaff. There were people in my own guild that made me cringe when I saw them in my LDoN groups. <br />
case in point, I play on a couple of servers.  mostly the same classes (bard and shaman/ sk, cleric or ench).  on druzzil, where my bard has the same spells and effects (in terms of clickies utitility abilities etc) but substantially fewer HP and less AC, even doing something trivial like making a run in to solo drussela can be touch and go (lulling everything, timing my DA, and being very very carefull) where on my other server I can zone in train to her, fade, take some HT from any pathers, pull DS while killing them and gate out in literally under two minutes.  in early GoD I could solo in the sewers, I could never have done that on my lesser geared toon.  I'd say that although my player skill and knowledge is same, on one server I'm a middle-level bard due to limitations and on the other I can do some really fun stuff.  gear = skill in EQ there's really no other way to say it<br />
Once again, I STRONGLY disagree. Are you saying you have LESS SKILL when you play on certain servers where your gear isnt as good? Come on man, thats a ridiculous assessment. Skill is skill. Gear helps people translate that skill into functional abilities, thats all. Heres my case in point. Give me the EXACT same geared Bard as your, and I will suck, because I know nothing about playing a Bard. But hey, I guess if I have that gear, I am HIGHLY skilled!<br />
<br />
There is another factor your not considering here, either, and thats the glut of people in todays EQ who seem completely clueless about how to play some classes. I dunno if its eBay or just being spoiled by the dumbed-down mud-flated version of the game we play today, but I see LOTS of 65s with pretty darn nice gear that just plain suck. By your definition of &quot;skilled&quot; I suppose anyone can go to Yantis and buy themselves a HIGHLY skilled character for a couple 100 bucks, eh?<br />
<br />
Sorry man. You want to accuse the Paladin of poor judgement for trying to tank a Hard with 6700 hps, fine. But did you ever think that MAYBE some people just want a challange, rather than the same dreary old /yawners that LDoN Normal has become? Don't burn a guys ass for trying to play a bit above his level of gear, THATS where true SKILL makes itself apparent. The guys who do more with less.</div></div><hr />

Duly noted.<br />
<br />
However, the penalty for taking a level 35 keyed warrior into Sebilis is CR.<br />
<br />
The penalty for LDON is a * LOSS * which affects standings AND points.<br />
<br />
Having said that, we completed a hard LDON last night with a 6k Paladin. Granted, he could not tank two unslowed for more than 3 seconds, the Cleric was BARELY level 65 and slower than molasses going uphill in the winter, but we won.<br />
<br />
Thank the RNG Gods for a forgiving drop rate.  Oh and a 65 Wizzie and 65 Mage and 65 BL who could crank out some serious DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">The worst ldon I had was with a paladin tank, me, a necro, a mage (guildmate), a cleric and some class I can't remember.  I agreed to come at 5pm (raids start at 6pm) figuring we'd finish in 40 minutes.  After 30 minutes, the group is finally together.  So we get an easy Tak adventure and things get hairy on the first pull.  We're plugging through without getting many drops and we come to a room with 3 mobs in it.  The brilliant paladin was tanking the mob and pushed it through a door and we get 3 more mobs.  Cleric gets aggro right away and runs around the room (newb move).  Paladin bites it, then the mage bites it.  Finally the cleric drops.  Me and the anonymous guy run to zone, the necro FDs.<br />
<br />
At this point I pop the &quot;I gotta go raid, sorry I can't continue&quot; and the necro goes nuts on me saying how the group comes first and it's crap that I'm leaving.  I felt bad, but I kind of didn't, because the group sucked so bad that taking the loss and going to raid was more acceptable than trying to win.  The paladin got all pissy at that point and I finally just left.  I got revenge on the necro though because he tried to apply to my guild after his crumbled and I let the membership officer know what a jerk the guy was and he got denied. :)<br />
<br />
Two days ago a group of guildmates did an easy mistmoore adventure (PL wins for charm stone) and we finished in 19 minutes.  Then we proceeded to clear the zone in the next 7 minutes.  Mudflation creeps up faster than you know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">The penalty for LDON is a * LOSS * which affects standings AND points.<br />
<br />
<br />
When people complain about losses or not wanting to do hards because they might lose, I kick them out of the group.  Rankings are mental masturbation.  The top person on our server has over 900 wins and we call them a loser with too much time on their hands.  You don't lose points for failing, you just get none, or you get the consolation points.  The only thing that matters is getting enough points to buy five 40hp and your necessary spells.  Doing 200 or so adventures with about 10% of them being hard, you can get enough points for everything you want.  I think 370 wins will max your augment, so there is basically no reason to do ldon after that other than for experience.<br />
<br />
I've bought 4 Solid Coals of Prowess, 2 Radiant Pebbles of Perfection, 2 Radiant Coals of Prowess, Bane, Anathema, Odium, some of the Reebo's spells and remove curse spells.  I sold back the 4 Solid Coals to exchange them for Radiant ones.  There is nothing I want from ldon at this point.<br />
<br />
If I were a casual player, I probably wouldn't get more than a fully augmented breastplate from ldon, because the zones are so boring and tedious after you do more than 150 adventures anyway.  I'd rather do tradeskills than ldons at this point.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">The penalty for LDON is a * LOSS * which affects standings AND points.<br />
I dunno about this statement Faern, you dont actaully LOSE points when you lose an LDoN, all you really lost is some time, time that could have been spent MAKING points, for sure, but its still only time. Standings are . . . well lame. I measure myself against my peers in other ways, like size of . . . um feet :)<br />
<br />
LDoN Hards are reasonable risk vs reward though. The dropped loots are nice. You get more points per minute with successes (usually, since you cannot do 2 norms in an hour due to &quot;You are not recovered from your last adventure&quot; thing), and even the XP is better. Funwise, they are different from Normals, not better or worse IMHO. In norms I pretty much create my own fun, but in Hards, you kinda have to be all business, which is fine. <br />
<br />
All in all though, think about what you actually &quot;lost&quot; Faern. If you were in there for half an hour, you got 1/2 an aa. You lost a smidgen of regular XP if you died and got a 96% rez. You lost half an hour &quot;recovering&quot; from the death before you could move on to something else. Thats it. You cant consider it &quot;lost points&quot; because if you do, then tradeskilling and questing are &quot;lost LDoN points&quot;, so are Raids, see what I mean? <br />
<br />
I know it can be fustrating to lose, and to die. I perfectly understand that, and agree that you were in a &quot;bad&quot; group. But didt winning a similar one with a similar tank give you some extra satisfaction? Just a tiny bit? If your anything like me, stuff like that is what this games about, not gear, or flags, or raids or anything. Stuff that gives me a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment is EQ for me. And you cannot have that without some disappointment and fustration on the flip side when you lose (fail, whatever). How does that saying go about not being able to appriciate the light until you know darkness?</div></div><hr />

Me and a Rogue friend went in the other day, and asked the rest of the group to hang at the ZI a bit (all friends, BTW) to test a theory. Yup, we smoked the first 4 rooms with ease, and got collection drops at about the &quot;standard&quot; rate (2 every 3 minutes). We arent &quot;uber&quot;, mostly straight EP + leftovers from VT. Honestly, 2 solid players = no such thing as a &quot;bad&quot; Normal group. 2 players can easily carry it all. <br />
<br />
Thats not the case for Hard. In Hard, 1 bad player usually costs you the whole thing. One mistake is all it takes and your on CR. <br />
<br />
This whole thread is actually just further proof that there needs to be a &quot;middle&quot; LDoN setting. A middle and Faerns tank is probably fine. Doesnt seem like it would be too hard to put in either. Make em hit between Hard and Norm. Make em worth 75 points. Create gear in between the stuff that drops in Norm and Hard (maybe even leaning toward the norm end of that spectrum). <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Hmmm bad groups huh? Well if you lose a easy you suck pretty bad - and I have lost a few.  Mainly because of LD or peeps leaving for emergency guild matters.<br />
<br />
My primary gripe is when someone has to leave and the group gives that person massive grief.  Now if we are talking hards it's one thing, but it's no biggie on normals IMHO.  I remember one about a year ago when our cleric had to jet, we were about 1/2 way thru the adventure and the group would not continue.  That's when I said, &quot;hmmmmm 360aa shaman here btw&quot; but there is no talking to peeps who are chicken.<br />
<br />
But really the only time I got super peeved was when I did a easy adventure with 4 65 necros, me (shammy) and a mage.  I assembled the group and added the necros when I saw that a bunch of them were LFG for quite some time. <br />
<br />
I was puller and the dps smack was something to see.  I can't remember how I died (rooted or something when pulling and away from the group so no other deaths) but I did somehow and asked in group chat if I could get a necro rez.  We were almost done with the adventure and all 4 said they had no component.  I then said I'm happy to pay for it and I have the pp on me but no one would fess up.  Now maybe I'm crazy, but I think the odds of 4 65 necros without a component is exactly ZERO %.  Darn there was smoke coming out of my ears I was so peeved, and of course they took off immediately after the adventure and left me to fend for myself to try to get a rez. (Guk not being the easiest place to beg a rez).<br />
