<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just found this one (and logged it):<br />
<br />
I was not paying attention to clicking and picked up a stack of components for SoW potions.  So, droped 20 of each into my bag, hit combine....<br />
<br />
<br />
Got a 1 shot SoW back<br />
<br />
<br />
Ouch<br />
<br />
<br />
Watch out because this may be true for other tradeskills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jmizzou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sorry to say, this isn't a recent development.  Quest and tradeskill containers treat a stack of items as 1 item, regardless of the number in the stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Borkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If it can be considered a bug.. it's a daaaaaaamn old one..   been that way since day 1 if I recall...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Odd, because before I would get a &quot;cannot combine&quot; message.  I know that for a fact because one time out of boredom I tried to take a stack of 4 leftover SoW components and combine them just to see what would happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tagra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If they're stacked the game doesn't know if there's 1 or 20 in there.  If they aren't stacked, it'll see each one.<br />
<br />
I think it's lame and they should fix it!  But it's a flaw that's been in the game for a very, very long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">True with all tradeskills, and probably true with all combine containers for quests as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I know it has been like that for a while. I rememebr many moons ago when making sows for bucks I lost about 100pp one night when I was really hammered ;)<br />
<br />
I *did* think that at some point you got that &quot;doesnt combine message&quot; but I might just have been hammered then too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Oye yes this is old, just ask the jewelers...<br />
<br />
20 blue diamonds + 20 enchanted bars of velium = 1 extremely expensive velium blue diamond bracer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You can buy a velium blue diamond bracer cheaper than a blue diamond lately.  Anyone notice this?  Just go to bazaar and check it out.  I dunno what JCers are doing but their economy makes it impossible to make cash at that kinda mudflation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I might have this mixed up, I don't remember offhand, but if you hold the &quot;shift&quot; key down it will only grab one item off a stack and if you hold the &quot;ctrl&quot; key down it will grab the entire stack, or visa versa. That has saved me from blowing tons of supplies with trade skills. If you hold that key down that grabs only 1 item you won't have to worry about it and makes for skilling up much faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vallya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Visa versa</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">yeah my  brother did the same thing he put 20 small peices of ore and one flask of water and got one metal bit lol. he was kicking himself after.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">no it is CONTROL to pick up one, SHIFT picks up the whole stack! if you tend to forget, always LOOK FIRST the first time you pick something up... also remember that once you have the Ctrl key down there is NO NEED to let go of it while you are still tradeskilling -- control+combine and control + auto equip work just fine so you don't have to let up and then accidentally switch to shift and lose 100pp on ingredients.</div></div><hr />

Actually, this makes perfect sense to me.  Many new uses for BD's have been added, so the demand for BD's is going up.  Price for BD's on Rodcet has jumped from 500p pre-Luclin to 1100p now.  <br />
<br />
On the other hand, many BD bracers are already on the market, and as people get new Luclin high-end resist gear, they are selling theirs.<br />
<br />
It's kinda hard to melt down that BD bracer to yield a BD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Smithing uses BD's like there's no tomorrow.<br />
<br />
BD's are used in pottery I think as well.<br />
<br />
Next thing you know, we'll have BD fletched arrows and BD tailored shirts and BD vodka, and we'll all be backstabbing each other in the back :)<br />
<br />
Boo, Verant. :P</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I hate it when someone backstabs me in the face.  :D</div></div><hr />
