The topic of :how do you feel about not being able to transfer your char.<br />
I am glad, it is a new game. Transferring a char to it would skip some of the funnest part of the game and allow people to jump right into the high end game.<br />
<br />
It is not a patch, or an upgrade, it is a compeletely new game set in the same world.<br />
<br />
I might play, depends on what is going on in my life at that time</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm ready to move on to something bigger and better than EQ.</div></div><hr />

Not sure if this is adding to the rumor mill but I could have sworn I saw something to that affect in one of the articles online.</div></div><hr />

<br />
from John Smedley<br />
 A lot of people have invested an incredible amount of time in EQ, and we understand and respect that. We're not going to reward that by turning off EQ in order to get everyone to play EQII .<br />
<br />
We've worked out a very great storyline and transition path for those players that choose to check out EQII . We will be announcing the specifics of how descendants of your character(s) will carry on the family name well into the Age of Destiny that EQII is set in.<br />
<br />
It sounds like they may be working on a way to play your current characters family line (descendants) in EQ2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Makes sense to me.<br />
<br />
It looks like they are making radically new game rules, as far as skills and progression, etc, I dont see somehow converting our current chars through some translation algorithm  makes any sense.<br />
<br />
In order for EQ2 to be worth making it needs to break the game enough to require new chars, IMO.</div></div><hr />

I think that'd be pretty cool :).<br />
<br />
That said,  I agree with the other posters that this will be a huge departure from EQ and there won't be any practical way to convert current characters to the new system.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nunyas Bidness</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I might get it... but i also feel that the poll doesn't reflect the topic.<br />
<br />
It's a new game capitalizing on the EQ name and will be set on the same world, which may or may not contain Velius and Kunark.  So having the ability or inability to transferring current EQ chars over to EQ2 isn't a big deal to me.<br />
<br />
Things that dictate whether or  not i get the new game include the monthly fee and whether or not i have the time to invest into another MMoRPG, game play etc....<br />
<br />
That said, the graphics look NICE...  It'll definitely be something i look into in a couple of weeks at E3. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I feel the same, but I know it will not work out that way. Within a week of release there will be power gamers who have already worked up to the max level, and that saddens me.</div></div><hr />

What if your eq character was sterile? <br />
<br />
Hmm..... shouldn't half elves be sterile? Kinda like mules are?</div></div><hr />
