<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Area</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Decided it's well past the time I should have Stoicism, so gets a warrior to help and wanders off to Dulak 2 hours later and god knows how many drunken pirates later gets an 'empty flask'<br />
<br />
Logs off reads quest (once more to be safe) logs back on .........&quot;be a doddle now&quot; I thought.<br />
<br />
/hail gives in 'empty flask' gets a 'large rock' follows quest as suggested buffs up gets pet etc ...... hands in the 'large rock' <br />
<br />
NO spawn ? ..... warrior helping swims about and checks nothing ?!?<br />
<br />
/petition time .... 1 hour later warriors amour has rusted and I'm running low on fish scales ........  GM answers <br />
<br />
GM &quot;you handed the stone to XXXX NPC is this the right NPC ?&quot;<br />
<br />
Me &quot;yeah sure but no spawn&quot; ...... looks again the XXXX in question is my pet ..... O*F.G !!! <br />
<br />
*beats head on desk* .... *feels better*<br />
<br />
At this point in time was ready to start sodding quest all over  :(<br />
<br />
Anyway GM arrives gives me a new rock and warns to be more carefull in future .... so trys to hand in a 2nd time but pet is close and saying &quot;i'll take it np Area&quot; had to walk pet away then /guard.<br />
<br />
Moral of story be very carefull and make sure pets are out the way at hand in.<br />
<br />
Have funs.<br />
<br />
ps got the spell in the end. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Had a similar deal once upon a time in my old guild.  Killed Zlandicar and an officer looted the Heart before randoms.   We decided on a winner and he tried handing it to them, didn't think very much about the small trade window though.<br />
<br />
  The mage pet looks pretty nifty with a Zlandicar heart :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Didnt think a brief warning at the end of a huge thread was nearly as funny as the whole sad story.<br />
<br />
Sorry I threw you. I'll keep me warped sence of humour to meself in futures :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No need to be fiesty, I was just wondering if I was missing something.<br />
It was amusing, and I am glad you finally got the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I knew two guys who used to swap a manastone back and forth (this was post nerf, so it was a fairly valuable item).  One was a druid, the other was a mage.  Yep, the mage handed the manastone to the pet instead of the druid.<br />
<br />
Doh!</div></div><hr />
