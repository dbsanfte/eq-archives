<br />
Bad part is I left Trel, Bara, and Meiyo on Seafurie island right in the middle of a near-Doku ranger pull. Don't get killed please!<br />
<br />
Gratz to Trel on corrupted clops though.<br />
<br />
Looks like I could have troubles making it for Monky night as well though. I will be back on as soon as I can.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baracus Baraculous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We made it out from the mini-pull (4 seafuries + gorgon) Trel did an outstanding job of parking them, and meiyo did a great job of tapping and tanking.<br />
<br />
Alls well that doesn't result in corpses.<br />
<br />
Grats to Trelgar on another step on his epic. Grats to Bracs on a new belt from Trelgar.<br />
