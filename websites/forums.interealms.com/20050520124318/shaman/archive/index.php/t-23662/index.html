<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pinot Noir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry, everyone.<br />
It has already discussed below... <br />
At that time, the conclusion is that this AA was useless.<br />
Reason;<br />
1. 3&gt;6&gt;9&gt;12&gt;15 total 45 AA it is too expensive.<br />
2. the amount of healing is 25&gt;35&gt;45&gt;55&gt;65. it is too weak.(If it is wrong, pls correct it.. I have a poor memory and cannot get a result from this BBS by using search)<br />
3. it does not overlap other ward.<br />
<br />
But OoW, the upgrade version of Call of the Ancient is there...<br />
<br />
It means that Dev team like this AA and they think it is usefull AA.<br />
<br />
So if someone in this forum finds this AA's usefulness, pls tell me when and how to use.<br />
<br />
I really appreciate if someone helps me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sorry, I thought it wasn't useful, got my 9 point refund for 2 levels. <br />
<br />
Reasons for disatisfaction:<br />
<br />
* Way too expensive to max<br />
* Every druid and cleric in the guild had it and it doesn't stack<br />
* Killed easily by AEs (the ideal situation where it would be the most useful)<br />
* Seemingly very small range<br />
* Thought my 9 points could be spent better elsewhere</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think they *fixed* the death by AE problem, but I agree... way too expensive IMO. Only reason I spent points in it is because what I have left is worse than CoA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Never saw a benefit to it.  Used my refunded points to complete lighting reflexes, in hopes of keeping myself alive in GoD:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The first level of it is useful.  Sometimes the target npc strips the group or raid of nearly all buffs. In a situation like that every little bit helps, and area effect regen: how can that not be useful?<br />
<br />
Maybe the higher end of it is too pricey to max out, I haven't tried, but the first level of it is situationally quite useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i have level 1 and like it.  It is a back up regen really.  nothing fantastic, but it lets me canni and use it to regen HP instead of useing the torpor line...save me a little mana /shrug.<br />
this will be one of the last AAs i max out though...it isn't really a must have...<br />
may be nice to use in conjunction with the GoD aa where you cast from your HP pool instead of mana pool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I got to where it was basically this, or start on innate str,sta,wis,int, etc. (which most are already maxed unbuffed anyway) so I chose CotA. Its an ok aa, but nothing that is anywhere near &quot;needed.&quot; Its nice when you have a druid, cleric and shaman in group. You can keep it up a good majority of the time by taking turns and its a little regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">With the ward now being immune to 'most' spells (who know what that 'most' actually means, though), the ward could be useful. But since practically every druid and clerics in my guild as at least a couple level in it, that AA is on my &quot;let's see what I can spend on now that I have over 600 AA&quot; list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">With the wards now presumably being immune to most spells so they won't get easily killed by aa's that resolves one of the major issues. The other would be the poor scaling vs cost. The first level is pretty cheap and not bad as far as regen goes. The successive levels get more and more expensive. 42 aa's more aa's for slightly more than double the regen for 14 times the cost? Lower the total cost some and change the scaling so it's more worth getting the later levels.</div></div><hr />
