<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ladara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, since being back in game and my desire to level, level, level, I have neglected my spells. I normally have all of my spells obtained the level before, but it just is not so now. I am currently halfway through lvl 58 with plans to hit 59 by this upcoming weekend. I spend most of my time in PoP, so I have obtained no spells and very little loot since it seems I manage to always loose the roll.<br />
 <br />
So I am posting here the spells that I need, if any of you come across them please keep me in mind. I would so greatly appreciate it and we can work out whatever trading/begging/favors/plat we need to in order for me to get them into my spell book, hehe.<br />
 <br />
Level 51:<br />
Everlasting Breath (not Enduring Breath) - Luclin drop<br />
Levitation (not Levitate) - Luclin drop<br />
 <br />
Level 56:<br />
Wake of Karana - Kunark drop<br />
 <br />
Level 58:<br />
Fist of Karana - Kunark drop<br />
Regrowth of the Grove - Kunark drop<br />
 <br />
Level 59:<br />
Legacy of Thorn - Kunark drop<br />
Spirit of Oak - Kunark drop<br />
 <br />
Thank you all for your help!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ladara, good suggestion especially for the componentless Lev and componentless EB, is to look for the LoY spell combines for them. For example I picked up Dew Clover in the bazaar for 200pp and got a Yaeth's Left 70 from a guildy who found it probably in a_random_zone. The problem with these 2 spells as well as remove curse and remove greater curse is that they are all 1 mob in the game drops them kind of spells, where as the LoY drops are possible to drop multiple creatures/places. As far as some of the other spells, honestly, check the bazaar, my level 57 group AGI spell was only 50pp. If you don't have a lot of plat to go around, when you and I group I'll take yah to good loot mobs. The rats in PoD commonly drop stuff from 33-75pp each. The flies drop good sellable loot too.<br />
<br />
As far as bartering, if you help me do some farming that I need (see other post), I'd be happy to help you get some of your spells if their bazaar prices are reasonable.<br />
<br />
Reguardless, a caster without the spells they need is like a warrior who doesn't take a trip to the trainer to learn their next level's disco. Gotta get those spells :-D. Focus on ones that you will be using more often as apposed to those that are a convinience like the lev and eb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Canoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm pretty sure many of those are buyable ladara.....<br />
 <br />
Check out eqdruids.com the spell listings will let you know which ones drop and which ones you buy from vendors (bladecoat and natureskin are 2 that come to mind that i'm pretty sure are buyable at the Fironia Vie druid vendor).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ladara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Soriathus - <br />
 <br />
Well, the problem with that is:<br />
 <br />
1) I haven't bought LoY, although I have been seriously considering it for the spell research alone.<br />
 <br />
2) When I finally do get LoY I still have to find all of the components and someone to research them for me.<br />
 <br />
So for now I am sticking with the old option of begging/buying, as well as, when I can getting grps together to go farm Juggs/Reets in Seb and hitting Fungus Grove, of which I know a good majority of those spells drop in both.<br />
 <br />

 <br />
You are correct, I accidentally posted the buyable ones with the dropped ones. I went back and updated the list of dropped spells needed, as well as which expansion drops them.<br />
 <br />
Thank you both for your input, it is greatly appreciated.<br />
 <br />
Ladara.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well you don't need LoY. The drops aren't in LoY and finding someone to do the combine isn't a big deal. As far as Juggs/Reets I'll do that any day of the week. :-D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ladara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I updated the original posting of the spells I needed to reflect the ones that I still currently don't have.<br />
 <br />
On another note...Jinxter, I have a few stacks of 'clockwork grease' that I have been foraging in PoI for you; so look me up some time in game.  I have been looking for you off and on, and haven't seen you online.<br />
 <br />
Thanks,<br />
