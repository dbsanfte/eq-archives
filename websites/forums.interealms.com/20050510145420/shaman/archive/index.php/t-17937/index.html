<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">From what I've seen on my gear, and others have noted the same, sta over 255 gives you 2 hp per sta.  With a whopping gain of 20 hps for 10 sta... I'm coming to the brilliant conclusion that it's time to ditch some of these high stamina items (sacrilege!) for straight up hps (and saves) - hovering always at 255 or above.  I suppose I wanted to get feedback from other bears - as I feel a little strange changing my gear focus.  It just seems... wrong somehow.  (Old news to a lot of you, I'm sure.)<br />
<br />
For example, replacing my bracer of fortitude with the windrider's trinket... I guess I just never thought I'd see the day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah sta past 255 gives half the normal return for all classes. It was one of those things they put in with pop to cut back on the hps inflation that they saw during the beta. If your over 255 unbuffed or even buffed I'd definitely recommend swapping sta gear like the bracer of foritude for pure hps or other gear. Eventually the sta just kinda happens. Personally I'm at 305 sta unbuffed and dont wear any specific sta gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yea, it's tough.  Getting pure hitpoint equipment is expensive.  Here's an example... I got Mithril Gauntlets:<br />
<br />
25 ac 10 str 15 dex 75 hp 15 svc<br />
<br />
(generally around 75k in the past, probably 150k now because some people are idiots on xev)<br />
<br />
When I could've gotten Kylong Darkmail Gauntlets:<br />
<br />
23 ac 5 str 5 dex 10 sta 45 hp 40 mana<br />
<br />
(generally around 10-15k in the past, probably 25-30k now because some people are idiots on xev)<br />
<br />
They equal the same amount of hitpoints if your stamina is below 255.  Mithril Gauntlets are superior in the hitpoint and resist scene once you exceed 255 stamina (which is very easy to do as an ogre), especially when you don't have ND3.</div></div><hr />
