<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I saw someone say that armor helped pets in the newbie board on sony -- I looked at that with a jaundiced eye but I know that the enchanter summoned armors at least give the haste and all...<br />
<br />
Does this mean you could up your pets ac by 200 and +400 hps if you were silly enough to give them that much stuff -- or more sanely give them lesser things that have +hp and some armor...<br />
<br />
If armor does help then there is no excuse to not giving it at least patchwork...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes your pet will wear armour, inaddition he will benifit from its wear.  You could give him a set of common armor and his AC and stats would go up accordingly.  This really only helps our pet if he will be tanking for a little while.  Our pet is not affected by changes in his Stamina but all the other stats seem to help him a bit.  What I do is get a bag of summoned armor as it ussually is pretty cheep if you ask a mage.  Though most time our pet is not allowed to tank due to it being so much lower level then most mobs we tend to hunt.  If he does have armour it will help him stay up just a bit longer maybe long enough to get healer or two off but not much longer.  Its really just a personal preference.  If I have summoned armor avalilble I'll give my pet some.  If not I dont generaly give him any as I use the money from saling it to pay for his weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">it should help, but the excuse is its a real PITA to give your pet armor besides a haste mask and maybe the pet belt..there are what 19 armor slots? thats a hell of a lot of stuff to tote around to give a pet, and since we have no clue what the base AC of a pet is the other argument is it gives nothing additional to their tanking ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was under the impression that all you needed was some form of armor (anything with AC) to give them the &quot;AC bonus&quot;.  So a single piece of cloth would suffice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vazzkorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Did some parsing awhile back, dont have all the detail with me right now as I am at work, but I can definitely say that armor helps the pet.<br />
<br />
Did parses with pet with no armor...<br />
<br />
Pet with leather armor (mage)<br />
<br />
Pet with Chain armor (mage)<br />
<br />
Pet with Plate armor and all mage toys...girdle, rings, etc<br />
<br />
Definitely makes a difference to the damage the pet takes over time, I kept the buffs the same on every test, and you could see a change in damage taken over time in each instance.  All the tests were done with lvl 55 pet in the exit hall in Nurga...all dark blue at 58...so the mobs were pretty much of consistant level thru the whole test.<br />
<br />
If your gonna solo for the day, It is well worth the extra few minutes it may take to load the pet  up.  If your just gonna group...then its not worth the time it takes<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">if you do get details..i would be interested in approximate AC gain and percentage decrease in melee damage taken.  Its all relative though, nurga mobs arent that high level, and wont have that high of an ATK so a lower AC value mitigates a lot more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When farming stuff I allways give the crappy armour to my pet, at any one time while doing my Nadox quest my pet was wearing shoulders, gloves, arms etc.<br />
<br />
But I would never bother to buy them or bug a mage for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">if I were grouped with a mage and we planned on being where ever we were for a long time I would go for it, even in tactics Dog dog can take enough hits (unless its a warrior/deathknight) to pull one off long enough for a slow/malo/root and still survive for me to heal and back him out. <br />
<br />
but aside from weapons I wouldnt bother to get a bag of mage gear otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>krindaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Equipping Fluffy with armor when I go to LDoN when our group doesn't have any reliable CC. I've done some pet parking with Fluffy there and it really does help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Some mages over at the Mages' Compendium did some extensive tests and found that all pets will wear armor, but they they don't have all the slots.  Something like they only have 1 ear slot, 1 wrist slot and no rings.  Probably wrong about the specifics, so check out their board.  Bet that thread is still around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It will make a difference.  I tested this out myself awhile back on my necro pets.  I never actually hauled armor around with me but I would usually donate and ask a mage to summon some gear for me.  This was only if I was gonna be trying something new or if I was gonna be pet tanking hard mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Skeeter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's worth the hassle to bug a mage for the mage summoned items - especially if they're hunting in the same zone as you, you can buff their pet.  Throw focus of soul and strength of daiku on their pet, they'll love you!<br />
<br />
Things to get --<br />
-the bag of plate armor (they summon a bag and it's filled with armor, it's just one casting for the full set of 8 plate pieces).<br />
-a couple of weapons.  they'll know what to get you.<br />
-the haste mask.<br />
Every mage gives their pets those items at a minimum -- many add the elemental defender (a cloak) and possibly other items.<br />
<br />
If you're soloing, duoing with a mage works really well too.  Their pet can tank better than dogdog, and your quiessence works nicely on slowed mobs so they can nuke instead of healing.  Mage has great nukes and pet damage -- shaman adds slows, heals, crowd control, and dots that make mobs melt.  Just stick to mobs that don't run or use root (mages don't have root, so you'll need to root -- those ornate pants are handy for that, heh).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sounds like an item that had summon plate armor bag would be a nice for BST MAG NEC SHM and make sense also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I seem to remember hearing that putting armor on the epic pet (human model) will show graphics.  Thus proving they wear armor.</div></div><hr />
