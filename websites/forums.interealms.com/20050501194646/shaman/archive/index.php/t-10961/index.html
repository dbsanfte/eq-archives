<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I guess there's no point in hoping that anything will come of this, but I think that mistakes were made with regard to the lukewarm upgrades to shaman abilities in the past few expansions.  Perhaps the wounds from the affliction focus nerf have given people a new perspective, and shamans will get another look, though.<br />
<br />
Shamans have suffered from weak nukes, dots, and healing because of perceptions of their power due to:<br />
<br />
1) slow<br />
2) malo<br />
3) cani<br />
4) buffs<br />
<br />
1) slow mitigation and BST 65%, ENC 70% slow<br />
<br />
2) mage mala/malosinia yet still have perhaps the best sustained DPS<br />
<br />
3) upgraded bst/enc/dru mana regen buffs, bard manasong, FT (non-ubers easily get FT7 - FT3 boots, 8th shawl, solstice ear), SCM, focus items ... there are (admittedly uber) wizards who nuke nonstop and do not OOM, and super-efficient 4+ dmg/mana before focus PoP nukes<br />
<br />
4) stat buffs don't matter.  bst/enc/dru have better buffs for casters, rng/bst/enc have equal or better buffs for melees.  shamans only really have a stackable HP from Fo7 and ATK from ferine avatar (an expensive single target buff) to offer.<br />
<br />
--------<br />
<br />
What shamans got in PoP:<br />
<br />
1) slow: a relative downgrade (slow mitigation cutting down the gap while BST and bard got upgrades)<br />
<br />
2) malo: a minor upgrade (for a lot more mana)<br />
<br />
3) cani: no upgrade (a relative downgrade considering the increased rate of mana consumption from PoP spells, and the upgraded passive mana regen buffs)<br />
<br />
4) buffs: a slight upgrade (200 hp more from Fo7 from KF?) and 140 atk compared to 120atk from primal avatar<br />
<br />
... and barely improved dots (mostly unusable in groups due to agro), nukes (pathetic in comparison to other classes), and a quirky rain that looks good on paper but works out to have too many resists<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
What's wrong with shaman DPS from nukes, DoT, and rain?<br />
<br />
Nukes:<br />
atrocious efficiency for a 160dps poison nuke, or poor efficiency for a weak slow casting 100dps cold nuke (worse than bst and rng) - in the past, shaman nukes had to be gimp because of their far superior mana regen<br />
<br />
Rains: <br />
the resistability, lack of focus effects, and the (always-resisted-under-8-percent-health) makes them less effective on all but extremely low resist mobs.  Wizards can get more efficiency out of their nukes than their rains.  This is an issue for all classes, and in fact druids got a -50 resist modifier on theirs to make up for it.<br />
<br />
DoT: <br />
less efficient than focus nukes by any nuking class.  marginal DPS upgrade from pre-PoP DoT should be okay since both can be stacked, but ... huge number of poison counters leads to a ridiculous amount of agro for nothing but damage, leading most shamans to rely upon rains and nukes, even though they are less efficient<br />
<br />
Suggestions:<br />
<br />
nukes: <br />
more mana efficient at least; higher damage for the 65 cold nuke would be good<br />
<br />
rains:<br />
give all the PoP rains (not just druid) a -50 resist penalty and fix the always-resist-at-under-9-percent-health bug (yes, it is a bug)<br />
<br />
dots: <br />
we're really only talking about breath of saryrn (sic), since ultor lasts 156 seconds and is thus, in groups, very inefficient.  the mana cost is too high (the druid dots and nukes are within 5% as efficient before focus items), but the biggest problem is the agro.  there should be NO agro from the dot except that caused by the damage actually done, since that is the only effect the spell actually has.  there is a bug (yes, a bug) due to the implementation of poison counters as a means to keep agro from the tash line high.  the spell could be changed from pooison to disease counters (while keeping the poison resist, much like slows keep their magic resist) if the problem cannot be fixed directly<br />
<br />
heals:<br />
quiescence needs to heal more and be affected by healing adept.  450/tick, not the 300 that torpor already gave.  shamans are supposed to have superior heal over time to everyone except cleric, in exchange for weaker direct heals than druids.  quiescence should stack with cleric HoT.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Why should a shaman's DPS be upgraded?  Their distinguishing abilities that made them so desirable instead of another DPS have received no uprgade, and have been downgraded relative to improvements in the weaker versions given to other classes who also offer great DPS.  With MGB, shamans don't really stack in raids.  Giving them an average DPS capability would make them of average use when the traditional shaman role is already filled.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
OR, keep the shaman DPS spells as poor as they are now, but give real upgrades to<br />
<br />
1) slow - a 75% slow that mitigates slow mitigation and has a -50 resist penalty - necessary to keep the same superiority shaman slows *used* to enjoy.  Maybe a PBAE 60% slow.<br />
<br />
2) malos - faster casting time, less mana use<br />
<br />
3) cani - hastened cannibalization AA - or even an upgrade to the regular can4 line (necros get a lich upgrade, come on)<br />
<br />
4) stats are useless.  haste, casting haste (BoR), atk, mana regen, HP are useful buffs.  ferine avatar should give a lot more than 140atk considering the group ranger atk buffs add up to more than that, and the 65 BST atk buff is 150atk.  let shamans transfer mana to others, increase weapon/archery/backstab skills, a raw +melee dmg modifier, give them the cleric spellcasting haste buff, I'm sure you can think of something ...<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Fix shaman DPS/HoT or fix shaman utility.  Please.  Other than past perceptions of shaman godliness (soloed Yeldema - OMG!) there is no reason for things to remain as they are.<br />
<br />
And of course, remove the str/dex spells (maybe keep single dex as proc rate for pets and clerics is something, I guess)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Im going to chime in with my suggestions:<br />

pre pop I felt shamans were well balanced now they are not even close to balanced. While every class took two steps forward in power we took one. The whole shamans have slow so they're overpowered additude pisses me off to no end.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I just think we've lost our &quot;wow&quot; factor.  That special ability of a certain class that makes you just wanna be them!  <br />
<br />
Clerics get rez and awesome heals, being able to help out in the most way possible, that's a reason to be a cleric.  <br />
<br />
Enchanters can charm almost anything and give incredible mana regen, slows, hastes, crowd control . . very nice stuff all of it.  <br />
<br />
Wizards can drop the big bombs, making people say &quot;wow! big nuke!&quot;  <br />
<br />
Magicians can pump out the phat DPS and got uber pets that count as another free tank!  Add CoH for raid and group utility and that extra &quot;wow&quot; factor.  <br />
<br />
Rangers can open up with some totally pimp archery DPS that just flat out ownz.  <br />
<br />
Warriors are clearly the best tanks, and are the meatshields everyone counts on. <br />
<br />
 Druids are jack of all trades or something.  Can do DPS and healing both at a very high level, making them a good fill-in for whatever you need, healing or more fast damage. Plus they add nice stackable mana regen which everyone loves.  <br />
<br />
Beastlords combine shaman spells including slows with their own special brew of huge pet dps and warrior-like self DPS and added stackable mana regen and attack buffs.  Very nice.  <br />
<br />
Rogues can do consistent DPS like nobody else, hands down great to have along.  Plus their new SoS skill makes them useful in entirely new ways!  Very wow.  <br />
<br />
I dunno, the list goes on.  I just wish ppl could list something about my class that's a &quot;wow&quot; factor other than the much-nerfed, much-pimped-out Slow everyone likes to talk about.  I guess we do have a lot of different things we can do, and that in itself is a strength i enjoy about the class.  But a wow factor is nice to have too you know . . .  we haven't got a wow factor since Canni5, and that only hurts ourselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bonestorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ever since the Planes of Zerg came out our high level DOTs have become pretty much worthless imho. The main reason being most stuff dies well before the a DoT has time to run its full duration.<br />
<br />
And secondly due to the &quot;ZERG&quot; nature (i.e. everyone throws as much damage out as quickly as possible) of pretty much all of high level encounters I find that im throwing nukes in to increase the overall DPS.<br />
<br />
They either need there duration radically reduced ie 2000hp in 3-4 ticks or scrap them and give us higher hitting Poison and Diesease based nukes.<br />
<br />
ON THE THING WITH SLOW MIGATION, ive often seen it quoted that we slow 75%, and Enchanters slow at 70% and BST's slow at 65%. And that we still have the overall advantage. This is also BOLLOX when you consider that &quot;ALMOST&quot; everything on the Elemental planes mitigates slow so that this 5-10% slow advantage we are supposed to have over other classes is reduced to a difference of 1-2% in some cases which means it isnt going to matter much who slows when you have some MOB hitting you for 1000-2000HP a pop.<br />
<br />
HOWABOUT REPLACING OUR CRAPPY SINGLE STR/DEX/AGI WITH BANE SLOWS!. THAT ARENT MIGATATED!<br />
<br />
Something else that has recently come to mind is the pre launch nerf to do with Advanced Natural durability. Originally all classes would have recieved this but in the end only the tanking classes (war/sk/pal,etc) got it. Would it have really hurt to have given us this and maybe other classes. When you look at the &quot;Cock waving&quot; on the Ascension board you'll see from the Shammy magelo's in particular that even the top end Shaman with around 4500HP would only gain around 600-700HP extra. This is really nothing when you have standard trash mobs that quite happly quad for around 900 in PoWater.<br />
<br />
GIVE US ADVANCED NATURAL DURABILTY!<br />
<br />
Fix this **** plzthxkbye.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I don't know how much does SoE/Verant read this board, but seeing the &quot;evolution&quot; of shamans throughout the game - or the lack of it actually - I'd say that they really never read these boards. Sure, they have made couple of posts over 4+ years, but never really read anything. So these suggestions here are nice and all, but pointless - who's gonna hear/see these from &quot;development&quot; anyway? How about creating, for example, a nice, polite, detailed &quot;open letter&quot; to SoE/Verant 'development' from shaman community and send it to SoE/Verant and then pursue the &quot;fate&quot; of that mail? Request - politely - a reply from official person. We have had our &quot;fun&quot; calling druids &quot;whiners&quot; when they united for their cause, but the funny thing is - they got what they asked and were noticed, and we in all of our &quot;uberness&quot; were/are never heard. Probably no one even knows that we, as a community, are out there. Why not to do something finally and get the &quot;ball rolling&quot; or at least get some answers.<br />
<br />
Anyway, nice suggestions all. Now we need just wait a bit, until the 24/7 playing shamans from &quot;uberguilds&quot; of different servers read this topic too and start shooting down those, who posted here, with their &quot;Shamans are fine!&quot; talks. Like they usually do, i.e. &quot;everything is OK with me, I have all me big spells from all levels for all places and I am so uber and always get a guild group, so things with the shaman are OK and the rest of you are just gimps!&quot; - kinda thing. Bah..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">They used to read these boards(doesn't mean they didn't have a few selected people they were asking when considering a &quot;change&quot;). Now they don't anymore.<br />
<br />
Honestly not all &quot;Uber Shamans&quot; deny the fact this class has been lacking for quite some time now. <br />
There'are at least just as many &quot;newbies&quot; who hurt this class by saying they are &quot;gods&quot;, because they play in zones from 3 expansions ago and feel like gods. Just a thing to consider before the bash the &quot;uber&quot; talks start.<br />
<br />
Alienating all the &quot;ubers&quot; will make those whose opinion actually has some weight lose the will to change anything, since their gain in power from an upgrade is less significant compared to a semi uber.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I have avoided 6 months of these threads, but I have to chime in now.<br />
<br />
Sitting in Emp camp last night waiting through 6 PH's in a row for Malo and Topor which won't drop anyway I had some time to think about this.<br />
<br />
Shamans are a tad neglected.  Sure I felt pretty good about my abilities in a KUNARK zone..but I had a good group of folks with me, and there was no pressure.   In PoP, and even velious I start to feel a bit wimpy compared to my compatriots.<br />
<br />
I've been 60 a while, I have grouped and become quite friendly with many people on my server, and I have yet to be invited to a Trial group.  People I know are getting tagged, and they're telling me &quot;We'll get you tagged next time&quot;..but what they mean is that they NEEDED a mage and they NEEDED a wizard and they NEEDED a pally/sk..so if they have an extra space next time they will throw me a bone 'cause they like me.<br />
<br />
I know my DPS sucks..but there are other ways we should/could be contributing to the group.<br />
<br />
I dont' want to be just a buff-bot.  I don't really want to level 61 without my 60 spells.  I became a shaman because I'm a supporting/helping person and my monk wasn't doing it for me...but now I'm really just the pit crew while everyone else goes out and runs the race.<br />
<br />
Not quitting, not whining, just feel a bit unbalanced and neglected.  Shamans are about creating the 'winning edge' for the group..our help should be invaluable..not merely optional.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>mogug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">LOL well wait until your 65 and still waiting to get your 65 spells .... just like we waited to get our 60 spells.<br />
<br />
I been 65 for months now and have yet to see a single level 65 spell.<br />
<br />
All in all I totally agree with everything posted here. Shaman need some lovin.  We are weak in PvP unless we find someone who doesn't have resist gear. 6 seconds to cast a spell is an incredibly long time in a PvP encounter.<br />
<br />
<br />
Even after malo, landing root or blind is a 1 in 4 chance on an avarage person and 1 in 10 on someone who has good resists. Someone with great resists or grouped with a bard well you can just forget landing anything on them.<br />
<br />
I have actually slowed down playing my shaman because I could bring little or nothing to a high end group.... with slow mitigation and the length of time our spells take to cast I felt like I was not really participating with the group.  As it was until slow mitigation all I did was slow mob on INC and buff when required. Possible backup heal if crap went wrong.  Now When I slow a mob the mitigation makes it a real question if it was worth the mana. In a raid situation the mobs drop to fast anyway. In a group situation I am right back to slowing on inc and hoping it lands and the tanks can get the mob off me.<br />
<br />
Anyway \rant off and until we get some lovin I am playing twinks.<br />
<br />
Mogug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I agree with what you are saying.  I have said the same things before, but it doesn't change anything.  Maybe my words didn't come out right, but it was the point of several of my posts.  Shaman as a class have been largely neglected.<br />
<br />
The problem is perception.  People still judge us by a dragon that we solod several expansions ago.  Groups still think we are the best slowers.  We have trained in it for 60+ levels and are good at it.  Malo and torpor help us be great slowers.  Many people don't realize just how small the difference is between our slow and BST / ENC slow is.  I think a BST with his 65% slow and the ability to take little damage when a big mob is beating on him ( with their AA damage reduction skill ) is actually a better slower for big uber mobs.  Their AA is &gt;&gt;&gt; torpor in that situation.  I can't count how many times that I have been told by my raidleader &quot;Ok, I need you to get this mob slowed ASAP, or we all die.  I know that there is no way torpor will keep me alive if my slow is resisted.  I won't even get into runes, but lets just say that runes are a much better defense against an ubermob than torpor is.  For the not-so-ubermobs, Throw in mez, and skilled enchanters don't even have to worry that much about resisted slows.  Most other classes just don't know how much the scenery has changed and still look to use to be the main slower, like we have always been.  They still perceive us as the main/best slowers.<br />
<br />
But the fact is we are a stable class.  WE have some strong abilities.  Good shaman can get by and do well relying on these.  I am a cornerstone in many groups, and can get the ubermobs slowed on those raids.  But like Landragoran says &quot;we lost our WoW factor&quot;.  Don't plan on getting it back anytime soon.  Our &quot;WoW&quot; factor was lost to mudflation and mitigation.  Just like alchemy, We are &quot;working as intended.&quot;<br />

I agree that we need SOME upgrade, maybe a new line of spells, maybe a faster acting higher DPS dot, a Lure based slow, a Mana-dot. SOMETHING!<br />

<br />
Guys the shaman class is NOT broken. As a shaman I get way more group invites than any other class I have played. You need to realize that EQ is a game that constantly evolves. At one time every class had that one little thing that made them unique, thus making them special and most times sought after. That was the old days, now days the game has changed and the lines between classes has been blurred. Take a look at clerics as an example of what I mean. At one time their entire day was spent sitting on their butts while popping up every once in awhile to cast a CH. Now they have been given the ability to melee and their DPS is pretty damn respectable. Remember back when Enchanters were the only class capable of a mana regen spell? Hell now everyone and their brother has one. \<br />
<br />
Sorry for ranting but apparently the game has evolved and left some of you behind. If it's any solice think about this: No raid was ever canceled due to a lack of rangers, druids, SK's, beastlords, paladins or wizards.</div></div><hr />

You realize, of course, there are other levels of Shaman besides 65?  Some of those people even enjoy levels &lt; 65, and their opinions are as valid as yours.<br />
<br />
Guys the shaman class is NOT broken<br />
How often do you use your poison DoTs?  Your disease DoTs?<br />
In exp groups?<br />
<br />
If you do use your DoTs in regular exp groups, you are either dead or wasting mana.  What needs to happen is to cut the mana cost to about a quarter, make the casting time 1 sec or less, and reduce the aggro significantly such that it wouldn't matter near as much if the dot didn't run to completion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Gawkmar: the first shaman in a group or a raid is always desirable, if only for focus and the 5% better slow.  However, shamans are increasingly replaceable; that people choose not to rely on an enchanter or beastlord to slow is mostly a matter of ignorance and lack of trust in the competence of strangers playing in a nontraditional role.<br />
<br />
There is no reason a raid cannot go on without a shaman, just the same as it can go on without any rangers or beastlords - at maybe 5-10% reduced efficiency.<br />
<br />
The difference is: classes which can now do &quot;good enough&quot; as a slower have had humongous DPS upgrades, giving them a meaningful contribution even as the second or third instance of their class, while shamans have got, colloquially speaking, dick.<br />
<br />
The level 65 shaman spells are nice.  They should be nicer.  Quiescence, Fo7, ferine avatar, blood of saryrn and malos are all upgrades - but they are outstripped by the new and augmented spells of other classes.  The 63-64 spells are pretty weak.  velium strike and tears of saryrn are far behind the DPS spells of other classes.  malosinia is OK (but 300 mana - 50% more mana for a 16% improvement over malosini?) and so is petrifying earth (shame you can get it on a spectral though)<br />
<br />
Shamans were a better class (relative to their potential replacements) before PoP.<br />
<br />
I can't dispute that shamans have a much easier time on the whole getting groups than say, monks and rogues ... but perceptions in the lay public aren't a good measure of a class.  Certainly a slower is needed and shamans are still the best (marginally) at that one role - but not enough to compensate for the group's loss of DPS (relative loss of ground to other classes in PoP).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Baldaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">AA to reduce mitigation is an excellent idea that should be there for us.  Even if all it does is change a 50% mitigation to 40% after three levels.<br />
<br />
We don't need increases in nukes,dots,healing,DD's and a fix to alchemy.  We need at most an increase in 2 of the above.  We're not by any stretch of the imagination broken but if someone with real actual game knowledge (not the developer with the level 12 halfling ranger) does not begin to examine our class in the grand scheme of the game we may be in real trouble if the game lives much longer.  My two simple suggestions follow.<br />
<br />
Our 'quick' heal should be equal to a druids, at most our 10 second heal should be the 2950 version druids got before PoP.  I would not care if they left kraggs mending as is because frankly, I don't use it now and would never use it with a slightly upgraded fast cast heal.<br />
<br />
Our DD's should really either gain a decent chunk of damage and an even bigger chunk of mana OR they should have the cast time decreased significantly and an recast equal to the decrease added to them.  We can do solid DPS with our nukes for a priest class but the fact that our cast times are so massive for the damage is at best an insult.  We make mana using time but our spells have been built to waste time.<br />
<br />
I'd love to see dots improved but they are an extinct animal.  They simply do not work in the game as it currently stands.  The disease dot would need to have an astronomical mana to damage ratio to ever be remotely useful in a group.  The poison would also have to be reworked a fair amount.  They will forever remain the solo shaman/druid/necro toy.<br />
<br />
I'd love to see alchemy fixed (and anyone who ever worked on it fired) but again, it simply will never happen because they do not have someone with knowledge of the game that can spend the 2 hours needed to fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Mudcrush Durtfeet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Seriously.<br />
<br />
   I don't expect to convince many if any of the previous posters, but certainly people who read and don't post may find some wisdom in these words.<br />
<br />
   Shaman are really good at one thing.  Mana regeneration.  Use this and you shine.  If we got dd and heal spells as efficient as clerics and other classes it would be grossly imbalanced in favor of shaman due to easy mana regeneration.  Even so, we get a pretty good ratio damage spell in tears of saryrn if you take the trouble to use it properly (often alternating it with torrent of poison).<br />
<br />
   Ok shaman are best at TWO things.  We are the best casters at TAKING damage (due to good armor and slow).<br />
<br />
   Please don't compare level 65 shaman to other level 65 classes if you yourself are NOT a level 65 shaman, compare yourself to people of other classes close to your level and equipment.  I think you'll find you stack up well.<br />
<br />
   Comparing myself to other level 65 characters of other classes, I find myself greatly desired in groups for xp or raids.   Shaman do very well in raids, even in large numbers there is always something to do.  You can always nuke (unless mob is immune to cold AND disease).   I did about 20k damage in a 90-120 second or so fight today by just nuking. :-)<br />
<br />
   There are many, many other issues, more than I have time to go into right now.</div></div><hr />

Sorry for ranting but apparently the game has evolved and left some of you behind.  <br />
<br />
Yes, it's left us behind.  What new ability have we gained since Kunark?  Canna V - just a far faster version of Cann IV.  iCH - with mudflation of HPs it was required.  Everything since then has been an slight increment over what we've had.<br />
<br />
You can claim, for example, that enchanters have always had charm and therefore they didn't really increase in PoP but the fact that their charm is now so much more effective (due to charming such bad-ass mobs) that one of their key abilities has increased.<br />
<br />
Our key ability has been weakend and our secondary abilities (buffing) has barely increased.  Not like the increases mean anything, I could safely be at level 65 and not have my 61+ spells and have no real impact.  In fact, a guildmate of mine is lvl 65, still doesn't have topor and has bought the few PoP spells he actually wants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>bearknukl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Was far into the mana the other day, had Quelious on, stacked with regen tunic, horse, and my own regen I couldn't get the mana out fast enough.  Found my self canning at FoM accidentally cause FoM's like a new experience (just bought horse and tunic new).  <br />
<br />
Anyway, i found it fun and group found mobs dieing alot faster when i was stacking Epic, Bane of Knife, Ebolt, Plague, and Dog on mobs.  As soon as I enter PoK, within no later than 15minutes im getting called to some group in some plain.  Not because of my ability, or my level (hell im only 56) but because people still want shammies.  <br />
<br />
If I were looking for spells, i guess maybe its my inexperience, but I'd be looking for something with form of Entertainment value to it.   Maybe Kodiak Bear form with a Mana + HP regen stack. Functional and funner.<br />
<br />
I like how chanters get different races to select from, druids can stop the rain, mages can summon fireworks and beer, etc.  We're more utilitarian then the spartans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Thorhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">After reading all the posts here it does sadden me to see the shaman being passed over with all the neat stuff other classes have received over the past year.<br />
<br />
Without going into a detailed explaination of my greivances I do think the class should at least get a look from Sony.<br />
<br />
Case and point being, at 56 I was invited to a PoJ trial. I contributed nothing. My plan was to Malosi, slow and cripple. After the first 2 malos were resisted I decided to cast slow. The mob now being 26% health. What was the point? The group failed. On the second attempt I cast nothing but poison DD's, so in effect negating the reason I was even there. Someone with better DPS would have been better.<br />
<br />
Enchanters and Beastlords now cover slows nicely. My role as the all time debuffer has diminished. Thank goodness there are still folks who remember the old days when shaman were kings.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying we are not powerful, I'm saying everyone has got a nice tasty biscuit but us.<br />
<br />
I dont even want to get into the fact that I will probably never get Malo and Torpor, so really what is the point? Why should class defining spells be so hard to obtain or expensive?<br />
<br />
I will sit back and wait for all the +60's with everything, to tell me not to bitch. That is fine, but things look a lot better when you are looking down. BTW, I can lick mine.<br />

<br />
*(level 60 : still no malo after months.)<br />
in the last year i can't remember one single time this spell in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
*when i check what we get after 60, what we are supposed to do after 60, i've no reasons to level more at the moment.<br />
LoY &gt;&gt;&gt; Pre order or Later &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Later... if...<br />
<br />
*About PvP: we are the clowns of the party.<br />
<br />
<br />
*It's true with Kunark we were a bit unbalanced, we were the class really needed for the success in raids, not anymore these days.<br />
<br />
*Now if i don't have Virtue on me i'm wondering if my tank will be good enough to save me with the resist i got on a slow in PoP.<br />
<br />
*HPs/Acs/Wisdom/Resists gear VERY HARD to design for a causual shammy gamer now.<br />
(an example: best Helm we can buy easily (just with 'decent' ACs) in trades is the JB helm with 18ACs... /waves Kunark.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway i saw good ideas on this board:<br />

 _ AoE Malo<br />
 _ Lure slows</div></div><hr />

One time or another SOE/VI whatever they call themselves seem to be. I am asked to Slow mobs, i expect my class to work not find 5 or 6 resists happen. Sure life is easy with slows but what else am i saving for my mana? i sure the heck dont have mana to dot when slowing with all these resists.<br />
<br />
Dont bet necros are upgraded, ive played one for a long time, easy players forget how badly they where... Guilds stopped buying into them many times over.. Until finally C3 came out then necros could do better jobs on raids.<br />

This reading of BL seems to bother me, i tend to find too many classes with slows and ours seem to be harder to land. Any reason why?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Stonienogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">shaman need forage and track, we are the medicine men of the evil races. evils can't be druids nor rangers, and only de's can be bards, evil races have basically no track and can only forage at Iksar levels. if for no other reason than to balance good and evil, shaman need forage and track. Adding alchemy components to forage tables would probably be too much free plat lying around, but at least let us pretend we're looking.<br />
<br />
My cleric was always my bot on the 2nd box, til I got her epic a couple months ago, and I realized how much more fun clerics are to play lately. Sure I still have to sit and med sometimes, but when stonie's got stuff slowed and crippled and keeping the group full health and still not budging his mana, I get tons of time to stand up and add dps as the cleric. I pretty much shelved my rogue once I realized I could be a melee half the time and a prime healer the rest. <br />
<br />
Speaking of cripple, that is one skill of ours that most people don't bring up, only Enchanters can duplicate it, and it's highly valued in uber encounters, especially when you can't slow the mob at all or it has special abilities you want to reduce. Lots of enchanters probably don't cast it much for the big agro it generates, but I love crippling everything I'm slow-parking to reduce the damage i'm taking by a lot. It's another line that's from the original release that hasn't seen an upgrade since level 54 in kunark. <br />
<br />
I love my shammy, but I'm tired of being the latest class everyone makes fun of for being beaten blue and bruised by the nerf bat.</div></div><hr />
