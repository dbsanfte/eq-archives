<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Iranicus Spellbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After one failed attempt because I didnt know where VS was gonna be, I went down again with a couple of friends and got my cudgel :P Group consisted of (me) 59 shaman, 65 necro and 62 cleric. Necro single pulled VS i slowed we smoked it easily. Then necro pulled rile's spirit to us, fded, i did hand in and boom he disappeared and I was wielding a new amazing looking cudgel :P<br />
<br />
Thanx for all the info posted here really helped in making the second attempt tons easier, as fighting 4 arisen, 2 respawns and an untargettable VS can be difficult.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gummox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Every post I've read so far recommended taking at least a full group, or 2 groups if possible to kill VS.  How did you pull it off with just 3 people?  Did you root rot VS, or did you or a charmed pet tank?  Are VS and Rile guaranteed to come single if they're pulled by a lvl 65?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Iranicus Spellbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">VS was a total joke not even close to difficult the big thing is he harm touches only once! not multiple times and doesnt even cast spells. I fought him twice so 100 percent sure of it. Necro just snare pulled VS and got 2 arisens with that, he then Fded and I tagged with Malosi, in which right after turgurs and he was slowed. At that point that fight was a total joke, he hits for 200 max, I tank things harder in PoD and my gear isnt great. VS dies quick (only has around 12k hp) I looted skull of rile. Then necro pulled Spirit of Rile, once again he fded I did hand in, got my cudgel and Rile disappeared. For kicks and some exp we killed all 4 arisens and gated out. Noone even needed a heal. <br />
<br />
Only thing you have to worry about is keeping everyone nice and comfy on their butts for 12 minutes so that noone agroes VS when he isnt targetable.</div></div><hr />
