<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ledas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
 I know that there is a forum for tech help but it seems that few read it and at the moment this system by Sony has me lost.  Four days ago I suddenly started crashing to desktop halfway between the server screen and the character selection screen.  It does this on any account and on any server.  On my other computer I am having no trouble doing anything.  I started with online tech support which first told me to delete some files and repatch.  That didn't work so I went back.  They then told me that it was an in-game issue and to talk to the GM in the stuck character chat room.  They told me that they couldn't help and to try the email tech support. <br />
 <br />
 SO I emailed my issues to Sony tech support along with the appropriate files that they request.  I got a reply that I needed to upgrade my video driver through the Sony website.  I checked the website and found that the driver I have installed is the same as the one listed on the EQ website.  I haven't gotten a reply from them about that one yet.  So last night I decided to wipe and reinstal EQ from scratch and repatch and still not working.  My firewall is off and I have shut off any virus protection.  SO this morning I go back to the Stuck Character chat room, because I have no place else to ask on a Sunday morning, and the GM there told me I had to upgrade my NVidia card to a Radeon card because NVidia's sucked.  I asked why that would be the trouble since my card is listed as supported.  He then proceded to ignore me for the next half hour, I was the only other person in the chat room btw.  Finally he told me to talk to tech support and that he couldn't help me.  He was a total jerk and kept calling me &quot;dear.&quot;<br />
<br />
/vent off<br />
<br />
 I don't care about the crap I just want to be able to play again.  I had just finally gotten a second computer so me and my wife could play together, something we haven't done in 5+ years of playing.  I was actually enjoying this damn game for the first time in about 2 years and this happens.  Cast comments or whatever but if anyone has had similar trouble or has an idea I would very much appreciate the help.<br />
<br />
Thanks all!</div></div><hr />

Tried the uninstall driver and reinstall.  Didn't work</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Have you installed any drivers from Windows Update lately?  I know the network drivers that Microsoft keep trying to push to my laptop don't work.  If you aren't sure what you've installed, you can go to the Windows Update website and click on View installation history.  If there are any driver updates listed in the time since you've had the problem, go to the manufacturer's site and install their drivers.<br />
<br />
Run dxdiag.exe.  Look on each tab and make sure it says &quot;No problems found&quot; in the notes section.<br />
<br />
Do other DirectX 9 programs work?  I like using the Doom3 demo as a graphics subsystem test, but it's a 430MB download if you don't have it. (Okay, I really use it as a stress relief when I can't work out what is going wrong)<br />
<br />
Rename eqclient.ini and then run OptionsEditor.exe from your Everquest directory.  On the third page (Engine Settings) click restore defaults and then set your desired resolution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shammygirl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">make sure all your firewalls and norton type programs are off...and UPDATE drivers, not uninstall</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Scowls1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">run your virus scanners and  adware.  disk clean up and defrag. clean up the system some possibly.  sounds like your problems are in your drivers though.  if you have the time, reformat and reinstall everything</div></div><hr />

I would not do that quickly.<br />
<br />
Do the things other people have said about virus scans, ad removal, and so on.<br />
<br />
Can you pinpoint WHEN the problem began?  If so, you may be able to solve the problem by going back to a restore point previous to that time.  Go to Control panel, click on Help and Support, click on System Restore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I played Tuesday with no issues what-so-ever.  Wednesday morning I got up and it was doing this.  I have had my firewall and norton stuff off since I got the computer 2 weeks ago as I have had issues with it on another computer years ago.  I hadn't downloaded anything or done anything different.  I turned it off Tuesday(was working fine), went to work that night, came home and went to bed.  Got up Wednesday and turned it on and BAMN crash to desktop every time since then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Scowls1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">run your antivirus stufff, as in  before you log ion, get rid of them if tehres any, not turn them on to play.<br />
<br />
if you played fine tuesday, see if you have a restore point close to that.  <br />
<br />
reformat is a last resort, of course.<br />
i would still say problem is software or hard ware related.  make sure ram and everything is pluged in all the way, dust the inside of pc and what not. can try switching ports on the router/switch...maybe its gone goofy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ledas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well I restored to Monday night as I know that it was working correctly then.  Still crashed at the same point.  Don't know I am totally lost at this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Do other DirectX applications work?<br />
<br />
Does dxdiag give any errors?<br />
<br />
Have you removed eqclient.ini (back it up first) and let EQ regenerate it?<br />
<br />
Are there any errors in Everquest.log?<br />
<br />
Can you log on to the Test server (run TestEverquest.exe)?<br />
<br />
Does Everquest give any error messages when it crashes?<br />
<br />
Are you trying to load full screen or in windowed mode?  Does it make a difference if you try the other mode?<br />
<br />
Does your VideoModeBitsPerPixel entry in eqclient.ini match what your desktop color depth is set to?<br />
<br />
Are you using version 71.84 of the NVidia drivers or are you using a beta (or ealier) version?<br />
<br />
Assuming you're running Windows 2000 or XP, are there any errors in the event log?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Glauri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You mentioned another computer that functions normally. Have you tried copying all of your EQ files from the &quot;good&quot; computer to the &quot;bad&quot; one?<br />
<br />
In addition to XP updates, DX9c, current video/sound drivers (don't forget the sound drivers -- they can be weird), you can (in XP anyway) run &quot;msconfig&quot; from the &quot;Start&quot; &quot;Run&quot; line, and disable everything under the &quot;Startup&quot; tab. Then re-boot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well I restored to Monday night as I know that it was working correctly then.  Still crashed at the same point.  Don't know I am totally lost at this point.Actually, this is good progress in diagnosing a difficult problem.  Doing this restore tells us that the problem is probably NOT a software problem in your computer's operating system.<br />
<br />
If other programs are running fine -- email, word processing, internet browser, other games -- then you probably have a software problem in some Everquest file.  Glauri's comment about copying all the EQ files from the good computer to the bad computer could be the easiest way to fix that.<br />
<br />
If you are getting problems in other programs, you could have a hardware malfunction.  DXdiag or your computer's own diagnostic software may be able to detect that; run those and check.  Also, follow the suggestions about vacuuming out the dust and replugging your connections.  Those are good general practice anyway, they won't hurt anything.</div></div><hr />
