<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nindalf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Saw this on Graffe's - thought some might like it.  O and on a side note grats Eudas CT Warrior on Dragonsbane.  Eudas held Myga's corpse open for 5 minutes before loothing the dragons blood.   Meanwhile I'm standing beside him begging and pleading.  He wouldn't let me loot the blood because I am apparently a CoE &quot;recruit&quot; and they cannot allow CoE to become more powerful.  I am sick in the stomach.  What sort of sick person monopolises a spawn like Myga to stop guilds from gaining in strenght.  Whats next?  Camping the Ragefire turn in guy and killing him before any cleirc can do there turn in to prevent more cleric epic's entering the game?<br />

<br />
That is sweet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nolani Silvermoonbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah those statements made me sick too Ninny :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arborealus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Eudas behavior was noted by us all Ninny...truely reprehensible...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jlove Fizzboom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think it is fair to say that after that foolishness, on top of his blatant statements that he will not respect the camps of other people after the bird/turtle in IC -- this Eudas fellow will not enjoy the respect, in any form, of the honorable and proud members of this guild.<br />
<br />
Most likely he was using his 4th computer to look up the quest to see if he could complete it and then sell the spell.  Isn't too hard to figure, given his known propensity to ebay.....<br />
<br />
Amazing, isn't it, how the people who behave most reprehensibly always tend to end up in the same guilds?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wynnie Walaryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">wait wait wait.... isn't this the guy that ninjaed a CoF on a Naggy raid?  pretty sure that name rings a bell now.  <br />
<br />
and i agree Jlove, it is fascinating how arseholes gravitate to each other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Awewa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No Wynnie thats Ernie who ninjaed the CoF... he left veeshan in the split a while back...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wynnie Walaryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ah gotcha :) thanks hun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wynnie Walaryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">btw Eudas did NOT get the blood...<br />
<br />
Draynor of CoE did :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nindalf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">two different myga's two days apart wyn<br />
<br />
I was standing right there watching Eudas killing Myga</div></div><hr />

Eudas is the one that took the LoA bunch to Hate and abandoned them on the second floor, ssaying he was &quot;tired&quot; and it was their responsibilty to get themselves out.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thus beginning a very late night CR that took around 3 hours to complete, if I remember correctly.  I think Halbarad and Gileean were both there if you want details.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Said it before, say it again.  Eudas &lt; dog doodie.</div></div><hr />

Isn't that Ransure in the distance, waving his dangly-bits at the enraged dragon-kin?</div></div><hr />
