<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seefar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">At level 53 I still have several items I need from Mistmoor for my epic. I can't seem to get anyone at my level interested in going there because they say they can't get exp there anymore. <br />
<br />
I was there a couple weeks ago with a Druid friend (level 42) and I wandered into the stable area (52 level then).  A bunch of MOBs all DB just popped out of the woodwork and we had to run to the zone.  We tried it again and the same thing happened.  <br />
<br />
So, what I need to know is:<br />
<br />
1. What level is the exp. in the stable area?<br />
2. How many people would I need to camp that area.<br />
3. Any tips on camping or pulling from that area without getting clobbered.  <br />
<br />
Thanks so Much</div></div><hr />

You sure you're not meaning the stables in the &quot;City of Mist&quot;?</div></div><hr />

I said I wanted an Uber character and the owner said the account was totally UBER but I keep getting OWNED so ***! I've F'ing had it!<br />
<br />
Who gives a flying FFFFFFF if it's Mistmoor or City of Mist.  I need that stuff from the F'ing stables so you people help me or ELSE!<br />
<br />
Ok I've done some goofy things before but I've never been accused of Ebaying.  Now I'm really embarassed.  <br />
<br />
Um yes, I meant City of Mist.  <br />
<br />
So, when you are all through laughing can you help me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'll be laughing for a good long while now...<br />
<br />
anyway, a single group can do it, you could solo it, a duo could do it, trio... tis pretty easy. lb's at 53.<br />
<br />
*lol*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">:applauds your ability to laugh at yourself. :)<br />
<br />
Good to see some people don't take things so seriously.<br />
<br />
Kinda important to know exactly which zone you were talking about, since our quest takes us through both Mistmoore and CoM, don'tcha think? ;)<br />
<br />
Harvyst is right. I got my reports around level 53'ish pretty easily. I was duo'd with my Druid at the time, but she really just sat there like a bump on a log until I needed her mana pool.<br />
<br />
I take it you're after the Spectral Courier? If so, I've seen him more on the right side stables than the left. When I did him I just pulled him (and everything around him) to the zone, rooted him, then zoned out. After a couple of minutes I zoned back in to find him waiting patiently for me where I glued his butt to the floor (how nice of him, 'eh? :)). Might give that a try.</div></div><hr />

Maybe I mist something here....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Speaking from my Paladin's experience in CoM, there's definitely a right way to pull the stables and a wrong way to pull the stables.   Don't sit near walls.  Don't stand near walls.  You'll aggro everything! (well....a lot anyway - heh)<br />
<br />
Luckily my first trip in there, a shaman was solo'ing that area and offered to let us pull it and he'd help crowd control and heal us as he only wanted one or two piece still.  He saved our butts when my first pull, pulled 6 :-)   Then proceeded to show me how to pull it succesfully.  :-)  (meaning 1 - 3 mobs per pull).   <br />
<br />
Pathing can mean you get more than you expect until you get the different areas of the stables split up on spawn time a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You can solo it at 55 or so pretty easy.  The right side is where he spawns most of the time.  And you can alpha dogdog with the drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I did the stables solo at 51 ... of course, it was expensive and I died, but I got my student's log.  I used the IVU potions to scout and got lucky (all undead up), pulled, got singles.  Singles are easy, but fighting in the CY of the stables is dumb when root rotting.  I did it and pulled all sorts of nasty crap.  There was another nearby group so I stood and died (so as not to train em)after looting my log.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Siamese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">...and don't cannibalize yourself down to where you will aggro anything near you.  Uhmm...purely hypothetically speaking of course...yeah...hypothetically....yeah...<br />

d'oh.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Stables is a prime spot for powerlevellers and small groups - I found them more than willing to let me hang around incase the Courier popped, in exchange for buffs and slows.<br />
<br />
I soloed there a bit too, but it was a nuisance.<br />
<br />
Then later, I brought along a few friends (45-48) and kept them in buffs (and slowed mobs) there. I could have got exp on some of the mobs at light blue, but they got much more with me outside the group, and I got my Student's Log, so we were all happy.<br />
<br />
I was 56 at the time - I think the best bet would have been a duo low 50s or a small group 40-50, where everyone gets exp there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just got though killing the Courier yesterday.  So thought I would give you the info I figured out though trial and Running hell bent for zone.  <br />
<br />
The Sables are to your left after crossing the bridge and entering the gate.  <br />
<br />
To get there for lower level people I discovered a nice little trick to breaking the spawns near the zone in if you have mix between undead and living monsters (Ghost like mobs do not see inv so I think of them as live).  Buff your self up like your ready to fight and then set your summon pet button up so you can summon as soon as you need him.  Next cast regular invisiblity on your self.  Now slowly work you way down the entrance hallway till you can tell what type of mob is standing just to the side of the door way with out agroing it.  If your lucky you will have one live one dead.  With Invisibley up you will only agro the undead mob till he hits you or your invis drops.  <br />
<br />
Time out here<br />
Little bit spell knowledge here that is not common knowledge to some people.  The spells that provide you with invisiblity to a type of monster will prevent agro of those types monsters even though a monster that it is social to runs by it that is agroed on you.... Hummm not sure if that was clear.  Example:  Mob A (is undead), Mob B (is Not Undead); You are running with Invisiblity up and you have monters agroed on you.  If the monster chasing you runs by Mob B it will not agro due to the fact it can not see you.  Now if you ran by a Mob A then it would agro on you as it can see you.<br />
 <br />
Though in certain spots its not the best idea to be running around with out our trusty pet.  Once those first two mobs are dead its quite easy to start pulling the ones at the gate.  I found I could pull them 80% time single with just casting a slow on them and had lots room on the bridge to separte them with root.  In the stables area most every room had sets of two mobs behind each door.  The trick for me was to get them out and to an area away from any possibility of an add.  <br />
<br />
In the stable areas I found most of the monsters at level 50 would not jump me from a distance right away unless I stopped and staired at them for a sec.  So you should be able to step up to the doors at max range and open them with the U Key.  Then slowing the one you see or rooting it.<br />
<br />
The area to the left as you enter the stables you need to enter carfully.  As you enter that stable area there will be two doors behind you as soon as you enter the courtyard so dont stand still at all just hang a right and head for the wall behind the broken wagon. If you start a train at this point I would just trun back around and run for zone. :D  If your lucky you will not have gotten anything mad at you.  Now the door closest to you will have two mobs in there.  I would suggest you try to root one inside and pull the other out to kill it behind the wagon near the wall.  Next pull the two monsters behind the other door.  Then there are Three on the back wall one on the left and two on the right one up top and one down bottom.  I'ld fight them on thier spawns as it seems the safest way to do it.<br />
<br />
The area to the right as you enter the stables I pulled to the main hall in the stables as I found I didnt get any adds there and that area seemed to get more adds if I tried to fight in the courtyard area. <br />
<br />
Well if you have any questions about it leave a message here or give me tell during the day on ARo.</div></div><hr />
