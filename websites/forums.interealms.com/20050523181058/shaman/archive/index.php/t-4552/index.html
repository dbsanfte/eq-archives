<br />
Hello Sir, I feel privileged to even email you. First off let me thank<br />
you for the great effort you have given to make EverQuest a remarkable game.<br />
It is because of that and the fact that I know you care that brings me<br />
to writing you. I'm not very good with words so please bear with me.<br />
My name is John Jenkins and I play EQ. I have played since phase 2 beta.<br />
Currently ,one account is having serious trouble. On July 15 I played<br />
for a while than I sat and camped. I'm not sure where as this was some time<br />
ago but I am sure it was a relatively safe spot as I always log out this<br />
way. On July 16 I was home from work sick and decided to play. Upon<br />
trying to log in I noticed my subscription had ran out. Being sick I<br />
decided to resubscribe later in the day. I ended up getting very sick<br />
and being unable to do anything much less play for several weeks. On<br />
Aug. 17th I resubscribed and logged on only to discover that I was<br />
naked. Weird part was is that I was not at my bind point. I was in the<br />
proper zone but not at the correct location. I immediately checked for a<br />
corpse and contacted a Guide. They told me I had no corpse anywhere.<br />
Amazed I asked for options. I was told by Sr. Guide Ainure that I would<br />
need a GM to restore me. I stayed online for hours waiting for<br />
assistance. No one came. The following day I was around for over 20 hours<br />
waiting for help, again, no one came. I went online, used live chat and<br />
sent email. As of yet I have heard no response. on Aug. 19th after being<br />
online waiting for about 14 hours I finally decided to find a GM and<br />
created level 1 characters to search other servers. I immediately found<br />
GM Zaltaran who agreed that I would need a restore. Upon checking the<br />
logs I was told by Zaltaran that I had logged on July 15 with a corpse.<br />
This was news to me. He further stated that the corpse had decayed at<br />
9:24 on July 22. He checked the logs further to see that the last save<br />
went back only to July 15 but after I had died. Because of this he tells<br />
me that even if I was restored I would be naked because I was naked at<br />
the time of the last save.<br />
I should mention that Castar's 3rd birthday was on the 16 of this month<br />
as well. This was not a low level character and I am in a large guild so<br />
we have some very good gear. I found it very hard to believe that<br />
character saves only go back for 3 weeks as I have heard several stories<br />
from trusted guild mates about restores that go back months. I was<br />
offered a leg up kit however 20 muffins and 20 milk are a far cry from<br />
replacing all the rare items, do drop armor, rare quest components,<br />
items I had from the middle of quest, and my Epic weapon.<br />
EverQuest means a great deal to me and this news hit me almost as hard<br />
as news of a death of a family member. Getting this character back to<br />
where he was simply by fighting and earning this all over again would be<br />
an effort that Im not quite sure I will be able to put the time into.<br />
Starting over naked at 58 is alot harder than starting out naked as<br />
level 1 as very good gear is essential at higher levels. Not to mention<br />
the lost items from questing.<br />
Please, I know you are a very busy man but I also know you care deeply<br />
about the game. Is there anything that can be done to rectify this? Any<br />
assistance would be deeply appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thank You,<br />
John Jenkins<br />
