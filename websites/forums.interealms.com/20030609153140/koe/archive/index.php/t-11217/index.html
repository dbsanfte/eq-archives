<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know quite a few Keepers have some of these level characters and just wantes to get a few ideas.  First of all, where are you hunting from 25-30?  My lil bard Amhot flew through 20-25 in Paludal, and now she is doing well in Netherbian.  I have read the mosquito room in Echo Caverns gives about a blue per kill.  Any truth to this rumor?  Or anyone want to come with me sometime and find out? )<br />
<br />
Secondly, Amhot just got her 26th song, Fear.  What is the best place to start using this where the adds will not be a concern?<br />
<br />
Last...At 27 I will get the infamous charm song which will allegedly allow me to swarm kite 10-15 mobs.  What zone should I start scouting to prepare for this?<br />
<br />
I am really impressed with all that a bard can do, just hope I don't get carpal tunnel syndrome from playing one.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jdeezay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well on the fear comment, if you can land it on the mobs go to OT in the SW corner. Drag mobs all the way into the corner and fear kite, should avoid most of the add problems there and solo exp at 26 should own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>itchyban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can't comment on how well a Bard would do against the Needlites, but as a mage, they were my happy hunting ground from my mid-20s through, as I recall 30. They are on a predictable clock, can be single pulled (except for splitting the pair in the back, right corner) by working the room clockwise, and give great XP. I duoed with a melee class in there for a bit one day, and we had *lots* of time to trade languages waiting for the next cycle of 6 or 7 Needlites.<br />
<br />
Added bonus is that they hit very quickly, but for not much damage. I maxed my Dodge and Defense skills while in there with very little risk to my body.<br />
<br />
Highly recommended!<br />
<br />
After the Needlites, I hit Marus Seru and then quickly discovered the delights of the DSP Zelniak family (Small, regular, and Large) which was great XP up through 40.<br />

High Hold Keep, kill goblins.<br />
Best exp in the game at that level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Adelrune Argenti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have had Caanais in Marus Seru and Echo Caverns. I hit 30 and 31 on the Needlite room solo. As a bard, I was using a damage shield, snare/slow, haste song and DOT song all together on these. The Needlite Queen can hit harder but she isnt tough. The room can be single pulled as a bard using lagarns. Just make sure you use it on all of them. Once the room is broken, it is cake. I did level 30 there last night easily. Now I need to find a place at 31 to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">From 26 to 45 you can absolutely own Eastern Wastes as a bard.<br />
<br />
Start on the cougars and dervishes, then move to swarming the ulthorks at 30 or so.  THe only question is how long your hands will let you swarm.  You literally never have to stop and will be getting an XP hit every minute or so once you get the hang of things.<br />
<br />
Good cash and Thurgadin is right next door.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Folene</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm not sure about Luclin (graphics eat my computer), though I've found hp vs exp on mobs is way not worth it there when I have gone. Though I have countless gimps I tend toward either SK or Loio in the early 20's and there are many places I have not been. From porting various gimps around I've found that 27-34 exp in Stonebrunt is by far the best I've ever encountered. Stonebrunt has a few places where its non stop pulling and you can sell the various gemmage (seb gems but rarer) in zone. <br />
<br />
If you ever want to group one day my under 50 gimps are:<br />

Sholia Dreamwraith - Lvl 43 Gnome Enchanter<br />
Belcei Shade - Lvl 29 Barbarian Rogue<br />
Geloe Silentwing - Lvl 25 Barbarian Shaman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well just experimented in needle room in echo and let's just say...WOW!!  2-5 exp per kill using DS, haste and heal.  Got through most of level 26 in just over an hour and made about 50pp from the loot.  Think I am gonna stay here through 30 if the exp does not taper off.  Thanks for all the input.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Adelrune Argenti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ice, learn to twist another song into that mix, put a DOT song in and it goes so much faster. Also, lose the heal song until the downtime. Much better going with the slow/snare one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Delkain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Bards sound like a lot of fun, but I've already got too many alts, heh.  I was level 20 - 30 pre-luclin, so my huntin grounds are kinda outdated.  Just Loio and  OT, is what everbody did back then =P   Oh, there's a cool little druid pl trick you can do from 19 - 22ish.  Ya go into Lake Rath and bind yourself at the gnome that gives the coin and port to WC to turn it in.  Lots of zoneing, but at 19 it's just under a blue bubble per hand in.  Sure it's lazy and messes up your skills slightly cause you don't use them, but leveling 2-3 times in one day by soloing is pretty cool =D<br />
