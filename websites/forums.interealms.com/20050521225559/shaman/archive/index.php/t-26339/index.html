<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Whee!<br />
<br />
So, what should I be careful to avoid (besides death) and be sure I don't miss?<br />
<br />
Is Kod'Taz just another zone to pass through for someone sporting MPG/RS gear? <br />
<br />
What's up with Ikkinz? Is there a (perhaps year-old) primer on KT and beyond? (KT is too short to search on :( , although I did find http://everquest.allakhazam.com/maps/god_progression.jpg which helps, sort of...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fr0z3n</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hmm KT ( b**** zone actually :p ) but still leads u to yxtta where u can camp a nice earring ;)<br />
and ikkinz grp trials / raids wish are great source of items :p<br />
<br />
Btw Gratz on the acces :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">wow, that map is terrible, the arrows all go both ways.<br />
<br />
Kod'Taz has great stuff.  First, excellent exp, though not *quite* up to exp zones designed for level 70 (specifically, Anguish/RSS).  It's better than Plane of Earth.  <br />
<br />
The mobs themselves offer a real range of challenge, but a group can handle them all np.  You can duo all except Rampaging Nocs, I expect.  They have varying abilities based on model type that I'm sure you're used to from Vxed/Tipt.<br />
<br />
Very few mobs see invis, and those are very consistent.  The two wandering Ukuns see invis, and the undead (the Trusik ghosts in the small area called Martyr's Passage), and wandering muramites (not animals) in the area of the ikkinz temples.  Other than those few, it's quite safe to run around Kod'Taz while invisible.<br />
<br />
There is loot to be had, though you may or may not need it.  Guise of Seething Satisfaction (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68702) and Reflective Orb of Energy (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68701) are random/veryrare from any trash mobs.  <br />
<br />
The named have augments and spells.  You don't need flowing thought, but you should pick up the shaman-usable 20ac augment to go in your shield, if you don't have Ground Murkglider Eye.  The 35hp augs aren't as special as they were when GoD came out, unfortunately.  Still, you'll want to camp named in KT if you didn't manage to get Nihil from Vxed/Tipt.<br />
<br />
As Frozen mentioned, KodTaz access = Yxtta access.  There's a short but kinda steep learning process in figuring the safe route to Yxtta, since you have to pass both see-invis ukuns, and the Martyr's Passage area.  The canyon walls are your friends ;)  Yxtta has Glowing Bone Ring  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68635)  and Attuned Discord Earring (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68636) , both random/veryrare from trash.<br />
<br />
KodTaz also = access to Ikkinz.  Ikkinz one-group trials allow only, and basically require, one full group.  There are two really good SHM drops , Bracelet of the Fearsome (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68767) from Ikkinz1 and Glyphed Prayer Ring (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68796) which is pretty common from any of the Ikkinz trials.  There's an exceedingly rare earring from ikk2 with a fire focus we can't really use, but is technically SHM usable.<br />
<br />
Ikkinz1 is Temple of Singular Might.  You need tank, cleric, and a mezzer to win on Plan A.  Any group not including a mezzer will have some pretty severe trouble with the final boss.  Defensive/Evasive/Stonewall disciplines are Not Allowed on the boss here, just like in Tipt.  Using any disc on that timer kills agro as if the tank had used DA, there is No Way to tank using those disciplines.<br />
<br />
Ikkinz2 is Temple of Twin Struggles.  You need TWO tanks, and healing enough for both of them.  No big cc neccessary, the challenge is taking on two bosses at once.  It was a pretty extreme challenge when folks were doing it at level 65 in elemental armor.  With level 70s, shm can work for second healer, but you might need your full bag of tricks.<br />
<br />
Ikkinz3 is Temple of Tri-Fates.  Bring a knight to tank this one, if you can; the bosses (yes, ikk2 = two, ikk3 = three :p) are perma-rooted, so a knight can superagro with spells and back out of melee range between summons, to make their damage output rather gimp.  Building agro like this isn't a possibility in Ikkinz2, I'm sure you'll discover why in the natural course of things ;)  With a solid game plan and a knight tank, Ikk3 is the easiest of them all to win.<br />
<br />
I think that about covers it!  The progression quest for unlocking raid instances of Ikkinz is well covered in BiC walkthroughs, that includes some details I haven't mentioned, and maps.  Happy Hunting!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In addition to the wandering Ukun, undead, and muramites, there is at least one wandering Kyv who sees invis and will smack you down fast and hard. I hate him; I owe him so many beatdowns it's not funny. In addition to nocs, Ra'Tuks also might be problematic to duo. Cragbeasts and Hynids are pretty easy, and with a good group you can keep your camp clear.<br />
<br />
KT remains one of my favorite zones. It's out-of-the-way enough that it's not riddled with morons who start fights /ooc and train all over the place. Getting to a camp isn't just a blind run; you actually have to pay attention to where you're going. <br />
<br />
Yxtta is also a favorite solo haunt of mine; save for the occasional raid, that zone is empty almost 24:7. Great group exp. too, if the primals are down and you can get into the caves. <br />
<br />
Ikkinz trials are an absolute blast (have fun getting in!), great (common) loot ... Glyphed Prayer Ring and Type 8 35HP augs, not to mention some pretty nice random drops and tasty experience.<br />
<br />
Best thing you can do, IMO, is get yourself a map with the various Ikkinz trials marked. Group trials are down in the valleys, raid trials are out in the big circular area (you'll see what I mean when you pull your map up). And yes, valley walls are your friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">grats to you sam.<br />
<br />
now KT isn't really a place I tend to go to, as much as pass through to yxtta.<br />
<br />
mobs in KT randomly summon. not good for the solo shaman, especially since mobs in KT+ hit like freight trains.<br />
<br />
head to Yxtta. Nocs, Hynids, and Cragbeasts don't summon. someone has already pointed out the very nice gear that is attainable there. leave the Ukun and Mastruq alone, they are immune to root/snare.<br />
<br />
as far as GoD progression:<br />
Ikkinz trials are for part of a raid key, only one person in your raid really needs to do them for progression, but the drops in them are pretty nice. you can raid through ikkinz1-3, ikk4 I believe is what needs the ikk trials. once you've completed Ikk4 (or someone you're with has), you can raid Uqua. Qvic access requires both Uqua and Ikk4 raids completed.<br />
<br />
once in Qvic, you need to raid Inktu'ta, if you have Inktu'ta, Ikkinz 4 and Uqua completed, you can move to Txevu, kill Zun`Muram Tkarish Zyk in Txevu for access to Tacvi.<br />
<br />
man, is that ever a mouthful.<br />
<br />
I wrote a detailed post on how to solo the mobs in yxtta for the Attuned Discord Earring thread, but apparently it got wiped when the boards went down the other day (I had posted it only a few hours before they went down) I'll take the time later and rewrite it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Full Kod'Taz progression including all three one-group trials, needs to be completed to open up the first three Ikkinz raids.  Only one person per raid needs to finish that progression, raids are minimum 36 people, 1-3 are all opened together.  The drops from beating all of those three raids (like Elemental gods, everyone who wins gets the bit*) can be tradeskilled together to make unlocker item for Ikk4.  Only one person per raid needs to put together the unlocker, it's kinda a bitch to finish up.<br />
<br />
*Ikkinz raids provide a number of &quot;you win&quot; items (like elemental god shields) equal to the number of people surviving when you win.  This isn't really an issue on the first three raids, since only one person really needs to collect the &quot;you win&quot; items.  From Ikk4, though, everyone will need the drop to get their own Qvic flag, so most guilds will have to redo ikk4 2-3 times at least, to flag folks.  The drops are pretty good, so it's not much of a sacrifice :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ailith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Anyone have any good links to maps? <br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Cool; let me see if I get this:<br />
<br />
1. Ikkinz: Anyone who can get into Kod'Taz can get into Ikkinz1/2/3/4, although the requestor needs each of the preceding ones (needs 1 to get 2, 1/2 to get 3, 1/2/3 to get 4).<br />
<br />
2. Uqua: Anyone who can get into Kod'Taz can get into Uqua.<br />
<br />
3. Qvic: Everyone needs Ikkinz4 and Uqua to get into Qvic.<br />
<br />
4. Inktu'ta: Anyone who can get into Qvic can get into Inktu'ta.<br />
<br />
5. Txevu: <br />
...a. Everyone needs Ikkinz4, Uqua, and Inktu'ta to get into Txevu.<br />
...b. One person in group/raid needs key from High Priest to get group/raid into Zun'Muram Tkarish Zyk area.<br />
<br />
6. Tacvi: One person in group/raid needs Zun'Muram Tkarish Zyk kill/flag to get group/raid into Tacvi.<br />
<br />
- is that right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">that looks about right.<br />
<br />
Ikkinz, Uqua, Inktuta, and Tacvi are all instanced zones for events (raid expedition zones, similar to sewer trials, Vxed, and Tipt) so pretty much no single person will be walking through these..<br />
<br />
KT, Yxtta, Qvic, and Txevu are all normal zones that you can just walk to and through when you are flagged.<br />
<br />
looking through discord progression to clarify, ikkinz progression line:<br />
Group Trials 1-3 needed first, do turn-ins with rewarded items. Next, you need to do some tasks for a certain NPC. Once these tasks are complete, you can participate in Ikkinz raid trials 1-3, once you have completed raid trials 1-3 and collected the reward items, there is a little tradeskilling to be done with these items for ikk4 access. ikk4 gives &quot;sliver of the high temple&quot; half of the Qvic key, and this unlocks Uqua. so on and so forth, the rest of the info I believe is accurate...there are some turn-ins for each of the pieces after raids, but no tasks to complete.<br />
<br />
only one person needs Ikk raid, ikk4, and Uqua keys to participate in raids to respective zones. however, you personally need ikk4 and Uqua to participate in Qvic+ raids, this may have been changed with the new backflagging systems, but for the sake of proper progression, this is what you need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Would like to add that Qvic is a 85/15 zone now, though I'm unsure about further zones in GoD :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Pecannius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">&quot;2. Uqua: One person needs Ikkinz4 to get group/raid into Uqua.&quot;<br />
Nah, you dont need ikk4 to get uqua, just kt.  Uqua is just such a pita that if you can't beat ikk4, there's really no point in attempting uqua.<br />
<br />
&quot;6. Tacvi: Everyone needs Zun'Muram Tkarish Zyk kill/flag to get into Tacvi.&quot;<br />
Just 1 person needs Zun'Muram to enter Tacvi I think. The person with the key can get a Tacvi instance.  Also to subdivide Txevu.. you need a key to get to Zun'Muram area, this key drops off High Priest. Again, just the leader needs it.<br />
<br />
Also to note, all of these zones can be 85'd into.  So someone with no flags can be 85'd into KT or qvic.  They can then be 85'd into txevu, ikkinz or inkuta also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">thanks Pec, I'm just working on what I've been told and read about the flags, I'm still working through them myself. guild is currently at the end of Uqua, hoping to take Barxt within the next attempt or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Updated, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">-You dont need anything except KT to get uqua access.<br />
<br />
-there is no minimum limit what soever to get an uqua instance.  Ive done it solo.<br />
<br />
-There is no minimum limit to get an ikkinz raid, as long as you are in a raid.  We've done it with 2 people several times while waiting on our raid force to gather up.<br />
<br />
-The three single group trials must be done in order, you cant get 2 until you beat one, you cant get 3 until you beat 1 and 2.     This only applies to the person requesting the trial though.   So one flagged person can bring along 5 unflagged so you can do them out of order.<br />
<br />
-The boss of ikkinz 1 doesnt like defensive , but you can use it if you carefull.  In EQ there are no absolutes, do what works for you.  If your tank is as poorly geared as our was (a boxed alt), then you may need defensive.<br />
<br />
-You don't have to fight both bosses of ikk2 at the same time, you just have to be real careful not to aggro them both.   <br />
<br />
-All 3 trials can be done pre-poTime with max level of 65 with this group set up.  1 tank, 1 cleric, 1 secondary healer + 3 more people.   You as a shaman  can be the secondary healer (dont let anyone ever tell you otherwise).   However the first trial is ridicilously hard without an enchanter also. <br />
<br />
-Ikkinz raid 1 and 2 are very easy, level 65 pre-time.   Ikkinz 3 isn't much harder, but its quite the pain in the ass.<br />
<br />
-I would argue uqua is easier than ikk4.   There isn't much to it these days, its been radically nerfed.  Level 70 helps a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>vinces</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thanks for the info.... unfortunately there is not a lot of info all in one place concerning GoD Zones.<br />
<br />
I do have a couple questions if anyone can help me out.<br />
<br />
We just completed iki 1 raid as a guild and I have been looking for additional information on the remaining raids.<br />
<br />
A couple guides have mentioned something regarding a requirement for a halfling priest to turn in Icon of the Altar for the Altar of Destruction raid.  Is this just old / outdated info.. or is this a requirement?<br />
<br />
<br />
Secondly, I have read comments regarding having a caster withmaxxed research loot the items and do the combine for a key in Destruction.  Addtionally, it has been stated that you can get stuck if you do this out of order...<br />
<br />
I know they sound like noob questions, but I'm trying to save my guild the pain of not being ready for a raid.... any information would be appreciated.<br />

only raid leaders (i.e. person requesting the instanced raid) needs to go completely through the progression in KT. so basically, its advised to have multiple people go through the progression...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Kilgaroz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">So, for those of us who haven't gotten the Yiktu rune, where's the best place in KT to set up camp to farm it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">KT isn't considered the best place to farm Yiktu, its one of the rarest of the spell runes in higher-end GoD zones.<br />
<br />
most suggest the barindu instanced sewer expeditions are the best place to try and find yiktu runes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Hmm, just found this:<br />
<br />
You must obtain the following items:<br />
<br />
Fragment of the High Temple (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=60252), from Vrex Barxt Qurat (Boss of Uqua)<br />
Sliver of the High Temple (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=60174), from Keeper of the Altar (Boss of Ikkinz Raid 4)<br />
Splinter of the High Temple (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=60253), from Noqufiel (Boss of Inktu'ta)<br />
<br />
Hand these three items to Brevik Kalanar in Abysmal Sea, and he will reward you with a Cipher of Txevu (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=60254). This is your key to Txevu, Lair of the Elites<br />
<br />
So let me try this again:<br />
<br />
Tipt win flag grants access to:<br />
Kod'Taz and the Ikkinz instance(s)<br />
Yxtta and the Uqua instance(s)<br />
<br />
Uqua &amp; Ikkinz Raid 4 win flags together grant access to:<br />
Qvic and the Inktu'ta instance(s)<br />
<br />
Uqua, Ikkinz Raid 4, and Inktu'ta boss loots combine to create a key (Cipher of Txevu) for access to:<br />
Txevu <br />
<br />
Txevu Zun &amp; Zyk kills grant access to:<br />
the Tacvi instance(s)<br />
<br />
- does that sound accurate? Sorry, but I'm still trying to get my head around this...<br />
<br />
- edit: better?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Tacvi requires killing a couple raid mobs in Txevu, similar to how Inktu'ta requires that Cynosure Kvanji be dead.  <br />
<br />
Ikk4 + Uqua + Inktu'ta = Txevu access.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Cool, thanks, edited. I also whipped this thingy up - how's it look?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Pretty good :)<br />
<br />
Abysmal Sea also connects to Natimbi, East Commonlands, Everfrost, Butcherblock, North Ro, South Ro, and the Guild Lobby.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I'm not worried about that... but I seem to recall that you get to Inktu'ta directly from Natimbi. Only been once... had to be raided in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Qvic is accessable from natimbi, talk to madronoa(sp?) that stands right beside the KT stone.<br />
<br />
but normally, Qvic is connected to KT and Yxtta. is a bit far to run, especially with see-invis density across certain zones.<br />
<br />
the GoD progression map looks really good Sam :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Thanks! Tweaked map with above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Heh, I've never even heard of people zoning from Yxtta to Qvic.  I assume the zone is opposite KT in that canyon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Frakass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">yes, zone is just past mindrider.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">-comepletely- inaccessable. I wonder why they bothered puttnig a zone line there</div></div><hr />
