<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">reading over the epic quest, i see this:<br />
<br />
&quot;There are several methods for beginning the quest, among which have been reported are: Ocean of Tears, loc +800, -5400, Capt Surestout Rathe Mountains, (on cyclops hill), Blinde the Cutpurse; Butcherblock Mountains, +260, +1650, Peg Leg; Field of Bones, (marauder cave), Iksar Outcast/Manslayer&quot;<br />
<br />
and that I have to go to north freeport. well, i'm pretty I am kos there as an (RZ) ogre....what is the best person to talk to in order to start the quest? and do they all lead to the guy in NFP?<br />
<br />
thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Easiest place for an Ogre to start would be Rathe Mountains, unless currently you're closer to one of the other locations. You have to go to North Freeport: use the sewers, keep Gate memmed, and hope that Invisibility doesn't drop at a bad time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Or raise your faction in North Freeport. You can do this by killing the guards in the other freeport zones, if you could find some people taking out Lucan and they allow you to give him a love tap, that might be enough for the Paladins in NFP to love ya :)<br />
<br />
Using invis is the quickest way though, although getting faction is good in the long run if you want to use the NFP bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Doing the nfp part isnt so bad. The guy is the sewers isnt all that close to anyone. Just dont get impatient like i did if for some reason he isnt up and stay inside the sewer by the broken wall and wait for him. I'm iksar and wandered a bit and got aggro. Nothing major and just zoned in the sewer zone line lol. Also when talking to the spirtit he leads you to wasnt any npc's close enough to aggro. Just need invis basically getting to the guy in the sewers and up and into the inn where the spirit spawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">very fun to do and the threat makes it all the more fun.  Go in sewers - the guy is standing right at the end of the sewers.  You have to uninvis to talk to him (both times you have to talk to him).  When you get done you will be very happy to ge the heck outa town!<br />
