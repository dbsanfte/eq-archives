<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know if the bank in Kael is soloable at 58? I was just in Kael for kicks today soloing near the commoner building. The second lieutanant I killed dropped a corroded BP! I've been on arena raids and have never seen a corroded BP drop. Unfortunatley I can't use it and will have to MQ it with someone but it got me thinking about possible corroded chain drops.<br />
<br />
My armor just blows chunks and I don't have funds to pay 5k+ per piece for the dragonleg droppable stuff and I'm not in a heavy raiding guild. When we do raid I'm always losing rolls anyway :) I've heard the bank area drops are somewhat common but don't know if I could solo it or not.<br />
<br />
Anyone tried it out yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes is it soloable, but much much easier if you duo.  Make friends with a similar levelled monk for easy pulling and even easier killing.<br />
<br />
edit: forgot to talk about the armor drops<br />
<br />
Chain drops are rare.  On top of that, armor drops are rare.  So you do the math .. expect to be there for awhile if you are by yourself but who knows, you could get lucky!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Taldur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My guild raids kael alot, tormax, vindi, statute, and other mobs around there.  We have gotten lucky a few times and gotten to do the whole cycle.  In about 8 hours of killing gaints ( mostly in arena) i think 3 armor pieces dropped, all minors too.  Truth is, get on a ToV raid, and you would have much better luck.  Chain is fairly commin in ToV, iv gotten 2 or 3 pieces each time i went. ( on multiple chars).  Did one raid ever on my shammy there, and i got arms and boots, as well as some named loot for my enc. =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't understand, why can't you use the BP?  I thought maybe you had something better, but then you turn around and say your armor &quot;blows chunks&quot;.  <br />
<br />
If it's a matter of faction, then faction can be fixed easilly.  I would especially put forth the effort for a bp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">corroded breastplate is thurg plate (what I think he got).<br />
corroded chain tunic is thurg chain (what we use).<br />
<br />
A trivial difference but I think that's what he meant.<br />
<br />
My advice would be to hold on to the BP you got and auction all over that you are trading it for a chain BP.  Eventually, someone that wants a plate BP will have a chain BP drop for them, and then they will come to you, and everyone will be happy.<br />
<br />
To answer your questions:  You can solo there, but it will be long, slow, and painful.  Kael has always sucked for me when it came to drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oh, ok.  I just assumed he meant chain BP.  Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yea it's the corroded plate BP. I didn't even think about trading it for the MQ of a chain BP, good idea there :) I farmed more today but the drop rates are just horrible. Too few lieutenant spawns and you are lucky if they drop 1 in 20. It's also heavily camped so you have to do it at odd hours of the day.<br />
<br />
I found the best spot to setup is west of the commoner building which is west of the bank. Make sure you take out the 2 roamers first before pulling. Spawns are 30 minutes so it leaves you enough time to pull a few from near the bank. Watchman only need 2 BoNs but seargants and lieutenants require 4, which with one turgur and a few roots is about 2000 mana so don't try this without a KEI first.<br />
<br />
XP sucks but loot is pretty good. 5-7pp per drop and always at least one sword to sell or save for pet. Sometimes a toe or helmet drops too, both sell for 8pp+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have camped the bank area a lot - small groups or maybe 4 or 5 peeps when we were not strong enough to do Arena with that number. The drops are rare enough from the arena, but the drop rates from the bank area just suck opens puss sores. Seriously, I do not think that the bank area is viable as a farming zone. JMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shizbiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Find a monk partner and you will see a dramatic rise in your armor drops.  Opens up inside the bank and if you are strong the bridge guards at the tormax keep which are often lego's and vets and have a much higher chance of dropping armor.<br />
A monk/shaman duo I know used to average about 2 pieces a night at the bank area and got 1 chain tunic and 2 silk robes over a period of about 3 weeks a few nights a week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">When can one single pull the bridge area?<br />
<br />
I'm thinking of trying to farm my warrior twink some armour, plus get him cov faction... dual boxing with me, 65 shaman.<br />
<br />
Not sure if I can single that area though, that's the question. If I can get them alone, I think they're toast :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>loptar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">my guild and i have been in the arena quite a bit factioning since pop came out and, to be honest, armour has been dropping quite a bit.. but prehaps we are just lucky, we've seen a chain bp, as well as chain legs arms gloves, plate legs boots bracer arms gloves helm,and so much silk it's not even funny.. the rarer peices for us seem to be leather.. though. to be honest, the leather isn't worth questting from what i've seen anyhow. it's abysmal for monks and pretty sad for druids as well. the chain for shammys have ok clicks and ok ac at least :) of course prolly about 2/3rds of our drops &lt;were&gt; in the arena.. the chain bp dropped in the bank. get a few reliable people together and hit the arena.. we've done it sucessfully with an ss equiped epic ranger tanking, a 55 cleric healing, a 61 chanter and 2 55+ monks.. smoked poz's and all. just takes a good group who know their stuff.</div></div><hr />
