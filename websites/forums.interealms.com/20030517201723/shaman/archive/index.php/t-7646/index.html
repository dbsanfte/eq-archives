<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Azadark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just wondering what makes a damage bonus show up on a weapon? I know it's level related, but if your too low of a level does a weapon just not show a bonus at all?<br />
The reason I ask is I have a Pile Driver. On all the spoiler site I go to they show this weapon has a damage bonus on it, mine has no bonus at all =(<br />
Maybe the very 1st Pile Drivers that dropped had a bonus and they got changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It is class specific, shaman don't get a damage bonus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azadark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Arrg =( too bad hehe the Pile Driver has a shown bonus of 12. So that means clerics and/or druids get to use the bonus? They are the other 2 classes on the Pile Driver.<br />
<br />
PS. thanks for the fast reply =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nope, only melee classes get a damage bonus.  So that damage bonus shown would never occur in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I do not claim to be an expert, and I might well be wrong, but as I understood it, any weapon with a delay of 40 or more has an additional damage bonus...so theoretically, some of the shaman 2hb weapons have a damage bonus....? Am I wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Only for melee classes :)</div></div><hr />
