<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Frankly, it's slow that has been our problem for a long time.  I'd be willing to give it up forever.  Or trade it for anything at all.<br />
<br />
Better healing, more melee DPS, more spellcasting DPS in terms of DOT'ing or nuking, whatever--anything but more stat buffs, which even imbeciles have known since Kunark are at best borderline useful when they matter at all.  <br />
<br />
Slow is the thing that is always used to balance us against the entire rest of the game and the other classes, and frankly, right now it's our biggest downfall, not our biggest asset.  Slows are mitigated or sometimes mobs can't be slowed, and if we can get slows on, mobs die so fast that they only get on the mob toward the end of its lifespan anyway.  Slows can be resisted too.  <br />
<br />
And mitigating slows makes the slows of enchanters and beastlords effectively the same as ours. Nobody includes a shaman in groups anymore for slows specifically; they include us if they want extras like our lousy healing because they already have enough DPS, if they include us at all.  Which, if they're smart, they don't.  The only real reason to bring us along for slows is that they have no other choice of halfway decently played or geared beastlord or enchanter online at the moment.  Our best asset has become NO REASON TO INVITE US!  <br />
<br />
That means our best asset is no real asset at all.<br />
<br />
And yet it is the defining thing about a shaman, and the excuse given to give us no upgrades or trivial ones, not just for the least couple of years, but in perpetuity from this point onward.  Don't think it's going to change.  Slow will NEVER have the importance in the game again that it used to because the function of slows in EQ has fundamentally changed.  Slows are now a &quot;helper&quot; spell, not a vital need.  Replace a shaman with another cleric or druid and you'll do fine without the slows.<br />
<br />
So shamans will NEVER be balanced properly in this game again, because slows do not function as just another utility for shamans, the way they do for beastlords or chanters.  They are their core asset and singular defining ability.  Turning a core asset into a mere utility trivializes slows, and by extension, shamans themselves.  You can't trivialize the spell without trivializing the class that is constructed solely around it, and will continue to be balanced around it forever as it if were still vital rather than a mere utility, doable by another number of other classes who can also do a great deal more of significance besides.<br />
<br />
Chanters and beastlords, if they had to depend only on slows for groups, would be screaming bloody murder.  So it's no surprise if lots of us do, too.  It would be foolish not to.<br />
<br />
They can have slows.   Anybody can.  Clerics want it?  You got it bud.  Even though you don't need it, you love to bring it up when we mention how crappy our healing is.  Well, take it.  <br />
<br />
IT'S NOT DOING US ANY GOOD.<br />
<br />
I'm sure you could make better use out of it.  <br />
<br />
If they took slow out of our class abilities tomorrow, it would definitely be a historic change in the class, but I don't care.  I want a playable class, not an endless argument over whether slow is so damn powerful and by exactly how incredibly, world-shakingly much.  We've already won that argument with the developers, and -- they don't even care.  <br />
<br />
If it's so damn powerful, take it away and give us something of equally majestic power, eh?  How's that? <br />
<br />
If by their own argument slow is godly no matter how little time it spends on a mob or how mitigated it is or how many classes can do it and do much more besides, and we don't think so, then why fight us about it?  They should just &quot;throw us a bone&quot; according to their own standards and give us something else instead if we say slow has lost so  much value.  ANYTHING.  Surely it couldn't be unbalancing to get something LESS than godly, right?  Especially when we're talking about giving up the holy of holies, a *yawn* slowing ability.<br />
<br />
Just swap it in!  That would probably be spell-based DPS, because we're already mana-users and it's the only thing that stacks well without stepping on too many toes.  Crush us, ruin us by taking our slows -- I don't care.  But give me something worth bringing to a group!<br />
<br />
I honestly don't care if it's slow or not.  <br />
<br />
Because AT THIS POINT WHEN I'M GETTING INVITED TO A GROUP IT'S NOT FOR SLOWS ANYWAY!  Unless all the beastlords and chanters have gone to sleep.  <br />
<br />
And designing a class around which other classes have gone to sleep is not designing well.  Clerics and their protestations about healer roles in the game notwithstanding.<br />
<br />
I have a funny picture in my head of other classes insisting we take the best slow, rather than anything else no matter what it is, like kids throwing a hot potato or batting a turd ball at each other and trying to dodge it -- slow is the greatest, ewww don't let it touch meeeee!  No, no, agggghhh!  Now you're REALLY gonna get it!<br />
<br />
Can you imagine fighting with beastlords and enchanters over the right to be the WORSE slower?  So we can get something that actually matters and leave them stuck with the stinky hot potato instead of us?<br />
<br />
In a different world, slow wouldn't be what's killing the class, but that's not this world.  Given the state of the developers' interest in this class and knowledge of game mechanics, slow will never be anything other than a liability to us.  NEVER.  We will neither catch up to the utility of other classes nor improve in ways that matter as long as slow is an anchor around our neck.<br />
<br />
I say give it to the beastlords and chanters.  Lord knows why they got it in the first place, but now, let them have it.  Let the clerics have it too if they want.  Let the druids slow animals.  Let paladins slow undead.  Let mages slow summoned mobs.  Let everybody slow everything!  I just don't care.<br />
<br />
What I do care about is having a contribution to make outside of raids, where shaman stackability problems makes my utility already arguable.<br />
<br />
Of course it sounds crazy, but it's interesting to turn over in your head -- at this point in the game, wouldn't you be better off without slow than with it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Take our slow and give us a targetable AA &quot;stonestance&quot; with a reasonable recast timer, druid level direct heals, and a cripple that lowers mob max hit similar to Vie...just like mark is cast on a mob whereas damage shield is cast on the player. Up poison DD mana cost by 50% and damage by 100%, remove cold nukes altogether. add lower level versions of poison nukes. add a &quot;poison&quot; focus for nukes outside GoD, necros need &lt;3 also Change TA to clicky Malos or something, and lower malos cast time to 1 second with a recast of 2.25. The damn spell costs 400 mana, the 5/10 cast/recast time is bull****.<br />
<br />
then do one of the following 2 things:<br />
<br />
1) Fix DoTs. Primarily Agro, resistances, and proportional damage so that we can do more damage in 42 seconds than a wiz can knock off in one shot.<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
2) Revamp the &quot;frenzy&quot; line entirely, adding damage bonus, double attack, and overhaste. We were the original tank mages, would it break the game to be able to melee like a bard when not doing anything else? add Innate rabidity, change the proc to a DD and move it so it stacks with pestillence shock! (or overwrites it, instead of saying &quot;your spell did not take hold&quot; and being down for 2 hours :()</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Blarg, lol, although I agree somewhat that we might be lacking in certain areas especially direct damage, the game is balanced with slow in mind and that isn't going to change. IMHO, we still slow better than chanters and beastys in higher difficulty zones because we have malos unlike beastlords and we can take a hit (barely) unlike enchanters.  Also we bring a little bit of safety to the group with our healing - more so than beastlords but at at the expense of DPS.<br />
<br />
Chanters rule on safety with mez, though and when they can charm well they are off the board incredible insane class.<br />
<br />
But anyway, each of the before mentioned classes can slow and I think thats fine.  No one class should be manditory although frankly clerics are pretty close in the healing department.<br />
<br />
At this point in the game the perception of the other classes has changed regarding shaman.  That is IMHO the primary reason why we are having a little bit of an issue getting into difficult content experience groups.<br />
<br />
A nice patch like I suggested in my other post would help not only shaman ability to contribute to groups, but other classes perceptions about our utility.  I also think it would not be unbalancing and other classes would not scream in envy.<br />
<br />
My suggested patch message? &quot; also decreased casting time on several shaman direct damage and healing spells&quot;<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They take away our best ability and give it to others, yet won't give us abilities that others already have that are trivial. <br />
<br />
I don't know any other class that has had there one ability taken away given to other classes and just stood by.  <br />
<br />
Kinda like shaman loot though.  You ever seen who we have to compete with on drops.  They always go to the more important classes.  Rarely do things drop that are shaman useable and than we DON'T get them cause other classes always need them more. <br />
<br />
We are like the red headed step children of this game and its getting old fast.<br />
<br />
If we didn't have to cast Malos, than slow we would have so much of a different view point.  <br />
<br />
If you get three mobs in one pull and you have to malos and slow them all.  Lets say one or two resists on slow by that time your group is dead.  <br />
<br />
If we were to get a fast casting unresisted slow, we could move straight to back up healing.  That would at least make our heals worth a damn.  I would say 90 percent of the time if you fail on a bad pull, healing would have made a difference after a slow lands.  <br />
<br />
Its just the time factor that bothers me.  I know 99% of the time I could have made the difference if I wasn't waiting on malos and slow to land.  At least enough to keep the cleric up or at least gain aggro long enough to take some heat off the cleric.  <br />
<br />
Get real, getting resists on slow and you may as well kiss your rear end good bye.  Than what are we worth to a group.  Nothing.....<br />
<br />
That burns me up so bad, casting a malos and than a slow and still getting resists.  Than your BST buddy or ENC buddy lands slow in one cast.   Real nice balancing of classes SOE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Personally Id rather not loose my slow at all..Id even trade my healing for better Incompacitating spells..A workable blindness, silence, and cripple...Shaman should invoke fear in theyre adivisaries..Healing should be way down on my list of things to do as a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Godzilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was bringing up the some of the same issues with my post below.  Obviously or class defining role is &quot;slow&quot;.  At my lvl of 52 it's darn powerful.  So powerful, infact, that they had to introduce slow mitigation to some of the more powerful mobs.  I think the problem was that they gave a slow that is almost as good as ours to 2 different classes that already had a heck of a lot going for them as it was.  <br />
<br />
There are alot of things they could give shaman to offset the slow mitigation.  A cripple line of spells that actually does some major hurt to a mobs dps or a curse line that lowers mobs casting damage.  But this would make us even more powerful against mobs and mobs would have to be adjusted accordingly.<br />
<br />
So the option is to leave our current slows like they are and increase our dps over the short time or increase our healing.  I truly doubt we will get the healing boost and the increase in our dps with either an upgraded pet or spell dps.  This would make other classes whine and complain too much.  Could you imagine our soloing ability if we had an actual pet along the lines of a bst or increased dps.<br />
<br />
I think shaman are stuck in a rut that won't be fixed in awhile.  The same as Shadowknights.  You can't boost our abilities without making us just too powerful.  But since we are not an essential class our sit ins and such won't really hurt eq as a whole the same way any of the trinity would.  I believe we are on that backburner of the stove and the heat hasn't even been turned on yet.  The problem is that by the time they get to fixing us eq v1.0 may be dead.  Let's hope not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, I know it won't change, Purdy.  As far as us losing slow and getting anything good whether we lose slow or not.<br />
<br />
I do think the game has already changed as far as what slow actually does, though.  I do think slow has become just a utility spell, not a crucial thing anymore.  <br />
<br />
When people start getting huge hitpoints from being equipped with GoD items, and Time items work their way into the game and become more common, it will be even more the case that you'll be fine just taking another cleric or druid instead of a shaman, and not even using slows at all.  Slow will become like snare -- something you really want in special situations perhaps(or perhaps not), but completely irrelevant in a great deal of content.<br />
<br />
And when you need slows, you'll still prefer a chanter or beastlord for all the other things(actually USEFUL ones) they can bring besides slow.<br />
<br />
So right now I think of slow as a utility spell that is crippling our class's future and really making its present pretty lousy.  <br />
<br />
Frankly, I think if they took slow away from shamans entirely and gave them even halfway decent upgrades, they'd be better off than they are now, except arguably in raids.  Because most any upgrade would matter more than slow does now.<br />
<br />
The main impact of slow seems to be its use as an excuse to never -- and I do mean never -- significantly upgrade our class.<br />
<br />
On chanters not being able to take a hit, though -- they can do pretty darn well with runes.  Beastlords take hits better than us too, as I understand.<br />
<br />
On bringing more safety than beastlords, that's true when our slow isn't resisted and when we have time to heal after doing a malos/slow combo.  But that's only one kind of safety.  A beastlord can also bring very real safety by offering the ability to offtank mobs with his pet, and by landing a slow much more quickly than we can.  <br />
<br />
So I'm not sure I'm in full agreement how much tankability or safety we necessarily offer compared to BL's and chanters.  Especially since we offer so little else -- besides slows, which they already have covered too -- and they offer quite a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ghobster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would have to say improve our slow. Shaman should be renowned for slows. It'd be nice to have a target stone stance but I really doubt devs would do that. However, target stone stance would help us for raids...multiple tanks, multiple shamans for stone stance to each tank...desirability increased.<br />
it'd be nice to have in hardcore groups that seek to do mobs not usually intended for 6 ppl.<br />
be nice to have target flurry or rampage haha but i think that would ruin the 'vision' devs have for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A successful group relies on one thing:<br />
<br />
-DPS of group &gt; DPS of mob<br />
<br />
That being said, all EQ classes bring a total of 4 things to a group:<br />
<br />
1. DPS<br />
2. Increasing group dps<br />
3. Mitigating mob dps<br />
4. Healing<br />
<br />
Some classes cover all four areas, many don't.  Slow, Cripple, Mez while seperate skills all fall under number 3.  EQ developers design content where you can only do any of the 4 things to a set amount.  It wouldn't matter if shaman's were given a spell called &quot;improved cripple&quot; or &quot;summon crap&quot;- if it mitigates mob dps, it does the same thing (to the percent that game developers choose)<br />
<br />
Now, if SOE decided to remove slow from our spell line-up- they have four choices on what to give us.  Swapping out a banana for something that looks,feels, and tastes like a banana is.... still a banana.<br />
<br />
If they choose to give us something else instead then we become just like another class- just with different spell names/effects.  We do not become a druid- just heal/dps like one with the ability to cast haste/FA.<br />
<br />
The point I guess I am trying to make is:  Slow is an aspect and a detriment to further changes simply because it falls into one of the four categories.  Taking Slow away would require SOE to replace it for a similar effect or improve other effects. Any other utility that does not fall into those 4 categories is &quot;useless&quot; for the group equation.<br />
<br />
Example:  Druid's Evac ability<br />
<br />
if Group DPS &gt; Mob DPS then evac is not needed<br />
<br />
if Group DPS &lt; Mob DPS then evac is needed, but the group is a &quot;failure&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There is absolute absurdity in Blargx post. Sadly it is ironic absurdity. SOE's tunnel vision about shaman abilities in previous content and their lack of recognizing the obvious in new content amazes me. That they ask for proof about our claims and then ignore that proof pisses me off just a tad less than the fact that they only have to look at their design data, or pull logs of encounters and review them inhouse.<br />
<br />
If you base a class overall ability on a single factor (**SLOW**) and then remove that ability, the obvious net affect has to be a reduction in the overall ability of that class to perform adequately.<br />
<br />
If you provide 3 utilities to a class (Slow, Healing, Buffs) and also, through game advancement, have already taken one of those abilities (**BUFFS**) by stat itemized gear from that class and then toss in the removal of a second utility (**SLOW**) you have further reduced the need/desire for the class in groups.<br />
<br />
To then claim that healing abilities designed around a SLOWED mob encounter balance the class when the mob can't be SLOWED/MITIGATES is too obviously stupid to contemplate.<br />
<br />
To toss salt into that wound by even discussing switching to a dps role with damage tools inadequate for the encounter simply leaves me with QWERTY imprinted on my forehead.<br />
<br />
I can't believe how inept and stonewallingly resistant SOE is regarding shaman problems.<br />
<br />
I leave with this question - if quick encounters are the new 'name of the game' why were some trials in GoD set to require hours of participation to complete? Yeah, obvious is that individual encounters - single mob kills - were made faster kills ... but doesn't making killing these for hour after after to meet an objective more (MUCH MORE) stupid than a few, or even one, long duration (10-15 minute) mob takedown? In otherwords, who is SOE bsing with the excuse about quicker ... followed by shaman are balanced for the long fight comment?<br />
<br />
Great post, Blargx. I agree. Let everyone slow. Then make all mobs unslowable.</div></div><hr />

        Already done . Hello slow mitigation.<br />
<br />
 IMHO, we still slow better than chanters and beastys in higher difficulty zones because we have malos unlike beastlords and we can take a hit (barely) unlike enchanters.<br />
<br />
        We tank better than enchanter ? I have never noticed specially with their big runes , very fast casting ae stun and doppleganger.<br />

Reread his post. Slow is not an asset. As a group if you want damage prevention you get a cleric, not a shaman. Cleric healing exceeds the sum of slow + shaman healing.<br />
<br />
That being sai,d sounds good to me Blarg. We may not end up with what everyone envisioned their shaman to be but that particular ability (to spend mana to turn MOBs into wimps) has already gone down the drain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Silverbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">How about a quest that requires level 65, disables slow and unlocks aaxp that give some things mentioned in these posts like better healing or DPS?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Slow might be hurting us, but getting rid of it will turn us into druids. Plain and simple. Since we cant slow, we cant heal with HoT's, so we need huge heal bombs. Might as well toss in a DS to make up for slow not being there and since we dont offer slow, which is a key ability in a group, might as well give us DPS so we can offer something. But mobs die to fast for DoT's so we need to have Nukes for real DPS.<br />
<br />
<br />
So basicly , if you remove slow and give us other things for the lack of it, by the time your done you basicly looking at a druid.<br />
<br />
Well you can already re-roll and level a druid up. I understand your frustration blarg, but seriously, your asking to be turned into a druid i feel, which isnt really a bad thing, cause they arent a bad class if you really look at them. Just kinda stuck in a clerical role right now, which i couldnt stand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Lit, at least Druids get invited into groups.<br />
<br />
Blarg and Grafsha really do a fine job of putting this into black and white.<br />
<br />
Grafsha's &quot;. . . is too obviously stupid to contemplate.&quot; sums up our entire situation which unfortunately causes me to think that Shaman will never be fixed.<br />
<br />
Not mentioned by Blarg, but a point often brought up by Clerics and something that chaps my butt, is soloing.  When I first came to EQ in March of 1999 I admit that I mostly soloed becasue past online games did not make grouping very easy.  I did not take long for me to realize that Verant (SoE) did not really want me soloing so I changed my style of game play and became more social.  I am glad I did, since it demonstrated how online game should be.<br />
<br />
Now these twits (mostly Clerics) want me to go back to soloing.  They rave on about Shaman soloing in zones that I don't even have flags or keys for.  Yeah I can kick ass in Droga but that is about the only loot/exp solo spot that is open to me and it does not look like my horizons are going to get any broader since I can get the gear or flags/keys without grouping.<br />
<br />
I have even noticed an increase in the difficulty of finding LDoN groups.  When LDoN came out I had not trouble getting invites.  Now I can go for an entire (4-6 hours) without an invite.<br />
<br />
If we are going to be forced back into the Solo Ghetto at least add more solo friendly content for folks without Time level gear.</div></div><hr />

Slow might be hurting us, but getting rid of it will turn us into druids..<br />
<br />
It's already what we are in GoD..<br />
Slow means nothing in Inktu'ta/qvic etc.<br />
Boss are not slowable, and trash mob have insane dps / Aoe but last 10 sec.<br />
If you can't heal your tank against the mob unslowed, you'd better move to an other zone.<br />
And if you get aggro and are not a tank, you'll be one rounded anyway, slowed or not, so what's the point of slow ?<br />
<br />
I only see one trash mob that slowed or not make a difference, that's those quadding 2.5k golem of inktu'ta. They rarely come solo and doesn't drop in 10 sec. In that case, yes slow might be a life saver..<br />
but there is what ? 10 mobs like that in that zone ?<br />
<br />
I still continue to slow because I can't quit that habit, but I find myself more and more forced to play as healer in my group (due to aoe).<br />
Because of the insane dps of the mobs, clerics are all focusing on keeping Tanks alive and don't have time to heal their group if we are low on clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">We tank better than enchanter ? I have never noticed specially with their big runes , very fast casting ae stun and doppleganger.    <br />
<br />
Damn right.<br />
<br />
check it out: Enchanter HP's (http://www.eqrankings.com/?rm=list&amp;class=Enchanter&amp;server=&amp;order=HP&amp;authentic=)<br />
<br />
Where as the top shaman on EQrankings is only 400 HP more.  Add to that arcane rune and rune of Zeb, and that gives a chanter another 2350 in HP.  Then you add other class buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Interesting point, BlargX, wasn't this the tack taken at one point by warriors as well (&quot;get rid of defensive, it's killing us balance wise&quot;)?  At this point, the class you want is beastlord- it does everything you wish the shaman could do, only better.  I never noticed a difference between the shaman slow and beast slow when tanking, I'll let the parses prove me wrong.

As someone mentioned earlier, allowing you to switch to a beastlord would be a nice change.  At this point I'm not sure why the monk/shaman classes still exist, the beastlord has usurped so many of their primary roles (other than FD pulling of course).<br />

I remember when slow was considered the best heal in the game. I really have to question the decision by SOE to keep introducing new classes that usurp abilities from existing classes. Giving another class our class defining ability is now making us harder to balance. Compound that with the FPS mentality that they're designing for now and shaman are truly obsolete and left unable to adapt.<br />
<br />
ps BL's don't need FD to pull, they just use their pet to split mobs. :/</div></div><hr />

It's already been done!  Except we're druids with crappy nukes and inadequate heals.  For all the use I get out of it (except for the occasional comic relief drunken LDoN), take my slow away - SERIOUSLY - and replace it with something that'll do me some good.  OR, take away all my dots.  Every last one of em.  Replace em with anything I can use in a fast-paced group (in, say GoD), or something I can have fun with on a raid (FA isn't fun, in case it hasn't been said *chuckle*).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That might be true, but look at what they actualy do in the group. most the time the druid is brought along as the main healer unless its a serious place your going too, then you get a cleric and drop the druid for someone else. Thats just my experience in groups talking, i know that a druid brings more to the table then heals, but this is what i see.<br />
<br />
I would rather not get groups then be forced into that role. The game needs to change to be playable, not rebuild the shaman so he can play in the game if you ask me. But that might be hoping too much. Youc an call me a old stick in the mud, but i do refuse to turn into a druid clone. We need our own distinctivness enhanced, not watered down.<br />
<br />
We are a buff and debuff class. Our cripple should be seriously detrimental, our slows the best and fastest in the game. Our healing should be a mix of large per tick HoT's with blast healing equal to a druids. Our nukes need a slight improvment, but honestly i never really been a nuker class, even if i wanted to. My DoT's need to match the necro's or damn closee cause they always have and we need some way to generate DPS so we can be some what stackable and versitile beyond healing and buffs. And we all agree our buffs need aviodance and strike through modifiers and such.<br />
<br />
Thats the shaman i want. I want my slow.<br />
<br />
Dont forget, you all are looking at GoD. GoD was designed for level 70 content and beyond that SoE has said, if even in a side steping way, that there is too much slow immune and mitigation, atleast thats what i hear when they talk about it, what they really feel may or may not be different.<br />
<br />
<br />
So dont sacrifice yourself and who you are to fit in. I would urge to continue using a stonestance ( pun intended ) to stand firm on what we want the shaman to be. Im standing firm on my ideas anyway /shrug.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I'd have to agree with blargx altho I don't think quite as extreme a resolution is required. The solution for the problem is already in place they just need to realize it and use it.<br />
<br />
Slow really has been a class defining for shaman and game breaking ability from the start. Pretty much from release they started realizing how powerful slow was. Magic immune mobs was the first take on making mobs immune to slow. This had many unfortunate side effects tho and thankfully went by the way side. Spell immunity was the next step on the road. While there are mobs that are immune to other spells by far slow was the most common immunty there was and still is. Not surprisingly alot of mobs got thier magic resists dropped as soon as they where immune to slow. Better but still an all or nothing approach. Next step in the line was disease based slows. Great we now have a middle option between fully slowable and immune but the downside is we're right back to the magic immune mobs to use it. Thankfully it was only used in limited situations (seru, emp and a couple others). Finally today we've got a pretty elegant solution with slow mitigation that doesn't effect anything else and allows at least 3 different levels between immune and fully slowed and possibly much greater than that.<br />
<br />
All that goes to show that verant recognized that slow was one of the major mistakes they originally made in the game and they've been working to fix it every since. Just like CH the game has drastically been effected by it's presence and you could even say been designed around it to compensate for it. CH has been/is being fazed out by being replaced with faster casting bigger heals like supernal and holy light and newer content that requires thier usage of those spells over CH. Unfortunately, at least in part due to shaman, Slow is still a thorn in thier side. We've consistantly and repeatedly complained about slow mitigation and the frequency it's used on mobs. In some ways rightfully so since it's so important to the class. It's how ever time to accept that we too need to stop clinging to slow and allow the game to move forward with out being hindered by it.<br />
<br />
My solution is actually rather simple and involves one of my pet peives as much as shaman class balance and that is heal imbalance and clerics being virtually irreplaceable as healers. In a game with as many classes as eq and overlapping roles no class should be the only option for core parts of the game. Rare special cases are fine but not for normal every situations and for the most part that is true. There isn't just one viable tank. There isn't just one viable puller. It isn't however true for healing. Why and how clerics are the only really viable healer is rather complicated but mainly seems to stem from ch, limited other abilities as clerics and shaman having slow. I'll definitely admit that clerics used to be rather one dimensional and limited and would have been pretty threatened by other healers getting to close but they've changed and so has the game.<br />
<br />
On the healing side of things I don't think it will ever be possible to balance shaman as long as slows are a major factor. It's impossible to balance 2 classes when something is as variable in it's effect as slow is. If we're balanced in a long, low dps fight with fully slowable mobs we are majorly underpowered in short, high dps, slow immune fights. Yet if we're even remotely balanced in the short, high dps, slow immune fights we're be rediculously overpowered in the long, low dps side. Slow needs to be greatly reduced in effectiveness to allow proper balancing of healing classes.<br />
<br />
Enough rambling now to the meat of what actually needs to be done.<br />
<br />
1) first and fore most MORE SLOW MITIGATION. Yes you read that right and no i'm not off my rocker. The easiest and simplest way to decreaes the impact of slow on game design, character balance and undo the mistake with out redesigning every level of the game is mitigate the effect of the exsisting spells. Just like CH has been left by the way side with quicker content and new heals, slows need to be left behind. Elemental planes and up and kod'taz and up in GoD mobs should all mitigate slows to some extent or another. Yes roll back the changes that made GoD mobs mitigate alot less than they did. I don't just mean all mobs are only mostly slowable either I mean lots of slightlys or complete immune mobs too.<br />
<br />
2) Ok now that we've decreased the effectiveness of slows we now need to rebalance healing. 100%, 63%, 47% isn't even close to cutting it. Healing abilities is one of the least forgiving areas to be short on yet its the area with one of the greatest gaps. I'd propose something along the lines of 100%, 85%, 75%. I realize that this is a huge change in current spells and almost double shaman's healing but realisitcally that is what's needed to make shaman and druids viable healers.<br />
<br />
Numbers aren't set in stone obviously but it does need to be a pretty drastic and major change. It doesn't have to be from lvl 1 tho. You could easily apply this only in pop or even just GoD by controlling what content gets the increases in slow mitigation and which druid/shaman heals get improved.<br />
<br />
Obviously clerics are going to be panicing that we'll suddenly replace them in every group and they will be useless. I have no problems throwing them a few bones to compensate for that. Potentially slightly better nukes or even major upgrades in thier undead nukes. I'd also proprose a utility spells for clerics. A self only invis, sow, lev combo spell like selo's song of travel. Not going to contribute to thier group desirability but will make life generally easier for them. On the healing front I'd like to see another remedy upgrade.<br />
<br />
The important thing to distinguish is the different area's of healing. The most important being the now standard key straight up heals. That being clerics xxx light line, Daluda's Mending and tnarg's mending for shaman and the infusion line for druids. IE the 3.75 sec casting time, standard focusable heals which are now the bread and butter of all the healing classes. These are the spells that need to be balanced. Group heals, CH, Hot's, ultra fast heals like supernal remedy for clerics are not as important. The key to if a you can keep the group alive in standard situation is your standard heal. The others are useful in emergencies and specific situations but aren't critical to standard healing and these area's are a good place for a cleric to hold a clear advantage.<br />
<br />
I would like to see all healers have at least one group heal. At this point i'd say leave druids where they are and add an aa group hot for shaman. I'd say clerics should remain the only ones with group heal and group HoT spells of the 3 healer classes. A reasonable but not too short reuse time on those aa's with possibly future aa's to hasten it to allow more frequent use is fine but clerics should remain the only one with the actual spells as a class advantage. Some where around 30 minutes reuse seems reasonable at this point. Druid's wood might need to be tuned to meet that.<br />
<br />
On a more shaman specific note I think dot's need major work too. First thier aggro needs to be tuned. They should not generate nearly as much aggro as they do and secondly they are far behind nukes in damage and even less efficient now which they shouldn't be. For the trade off of taking time to do thier damage dots should do more damage per spell and should be more efficient at doing the damage. How much more damage or more efficient depends on the duration of the dot. The short the dot the less the advantage and the longer the dot the greater the advantage obviously. For short dots like bane and other i'd say 15-20% advantage is fine and for longer dots like our disease dots it should be in the area of 50%.<br />
<br />
If they made these healing changes, dot changes and left the buff improvements in place I'd personally be very happy and I think shaman would be pretty well balanced at the high end.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Slow might be hurting us, but getting rid of it will turn us into druids.<br />
<br />
Except, as you proceeded to state, we would be gimp druids who can't even succor. Without slow, numerous upgrades would have to be added just to make us druids.<br />
<br />
The truth of that statement sickens my very soul.<br />
<br />
The problem with fading shaman power, to me, is twofold: The game has been slammed into overdrive, with player HP/DPS and MOB damage all skyrocketing since PoP (I think they overcompensated for Luclin juuuust a bit.); and certain classes that play similar roles have been enhanced far too much. In the case of beastlords (Who straight up need to be nerfed. Sorry chaps, we were here first.), their slows catch up to ours way too much at 60 and 65, and they also contribute considerable DPS. In the case of druids, their heals are significantly better than ours, and their nukes contribute considerable DPS. The only things left are debuffing and slow. I seem to be the only one who ever needs Malo* cast on anything, and mitigation destroys our already tenuous advantage with slows.<br />
<br />
This trend naturally boils down the classes into ability archetypes: Damage taking, damage dealing, damage prevention/healing, and &quot;crowd control&quot;. The classes most specialized in these four areas are the obvious winners: Warriors, wizards, clerics, and enchanters. There has always been room for the classes that contribute more than one of these abilities, but now that room is shrinking fast, and apparently we didn't make the cut. We do damage with DoTs - necros are better. We do damage and heal - druids are better. We slow, buff, and do damage - BLs are better.<br />
<br />
In the Good Old Days™, EQ was very different. Shamans were kings of defense in a game where defense was achieved through more than just increased HP and increased heals. If things keep going the way they have been since PoP, I see the game eventually becoming EQ: Arcade Edition, where you can play one of only four classes and your success can be enhanced by feeding in more money.<br />
<br />
I liked that game the first time I played it...when it was called Gauntlet.</div></div><hr />

There's no way in hell they'll take away our slow, so essentially what we have here are talking points and thinking points, if you're flexible enough to grasp that kind of thing.  Leaving us with slow is their permanent excuse to ignore the class.  If they took away our slow, they'd actually have to work and/or think.  <br />
<br />
Why the heck would they want to do that?  Their paychecks don't appear to be even tangentially related to their competence.<br />
<br />
I have to add that a big part of the post's point is not to argue for a restructure of the class, but to make it clearer that that restructuring has already happened, and to what extent it has happened.<br />
<br />
That's definitely worth thinking about and coming to grips with.  Because it's our reality now whether we like it or not.  Slow in today's game bears very little relation to slow not all that long ago, yet we speak as if it were the same spell doing the same thing and providing the shaman class(and other slowing classes too) the same value.  <br />
<br />
Mitigation might make it seem like the changes in what slow really is and does is about matters of degree.<br />
<br />
But that's not really true.  There's a qualitative difference, not just a quantitative one; the difference in slow is now a difference in KIND, not in degree.<br />
<br />
Our old ways of thinking about slow don't really describe it anymore.<br />
<br />
We're trying to address the new EQ world with the old mental constructs of the past, and our tools are outdated.<br />
<br />
I'd like us to be more conscious of what slow really means these days, and I don't think we commonly are all that conscious about it -- certainly the developers aren't.  <br />
<br />
And once we realize that slow has become a utility, maybe often a good one but a mere utility nonetheless, maybe we can start looking more clearly at what a shaman's role really should be from now on.  <br />
<br />
Giving up slow, according to our old understanding of what slow was and has been, would be crazy.  <br />
<br />
Realize how far slow has devolved into a mere utility spell, and how the huge hitpoint items of GoD and Time will exacerbate that, and how that trend toward ever greater hitpoints and more quick-dying(sometimes even slow resistant) mobs will worsen things for shamans as long as they continue to be balanced completely around a slow spell that has become a mere option, not a necessity by any stretch of the imagination, and giving up slow moves from the insane to something actually worth considering.  For the first time since shamans came to be.<br />
<br />
Do you think any of us ever imagined that it could ever possibly come to that?  Isn't it amazing that the idea of doing without slow, not needing it in many encounters now and more and more to come, or voluntarily giving it up, could even be acknowledged as not completely nuts to every possible extent by 100% of all shamans?<br />
<br />
Yet it can be.  And there's far more validity to these ideas than any of us really would like.  More than I'd like.<br />
<br />
I'd say it's definitely worth thinking about.<br />
<br />
Using the same old valuations of slow that we developed over years -- past years -- doesn't equip us with the tools to understand slow, and ourselves, TODAY.  Or to find a way to make shaman a workable class for the potential future of the game.  The longer we go on thinking of slow as a central spell in the game when it has given up that primacy, the longer it will be before we really address the game as it stands.<br />
<br />
And the worse we will equip ourselves -- or be equipped by the developers -- to deal with the future, where the problems that have seriously devalued slow are basically set in stone.<br />
<br />
Slow is NOT coming back to its glory, guys.  Ever.  It's moving in an opposite direction at a rate that will accelerate with every new expansion. And slow is what we ARE.<br />
<br />
So, by extention, then, what happens to us?<br />
<br />
If we don't start understanding what slow really is in today's game -- a utility rapidly losing value and destined NEVER to regain it, not a core to build a class around anymore, then we won't be able to talk about what a shaman really is today or get anything significant going for shamans' future.<br />
<br />
We need to get used to honestly addressing what slow IS and will be, not what it was and we wish it to be, or wish it could be again.<br />
<br />
Otherwise we're just chasing our tails here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By the way, why is it that so many people assume that adding healing is the ONLY thing they could give us in compensation if they took away our slow?<br />
<br />
It could just as well be DPS of different types.<br />
<br />
And why would the mana cost necessarily have to be horrific?  (And since when did druids have only healing to offer, as a bit of an aside here?)<br />

My posts in this thread have tried to emphasize mental flexibility and how inflexibly we've tended to look at things(along with the developers, who tend to be far more inflexible and limited in their understanding than we are) and how that may be keeping us from really understanding things, but if you come into any ideas all clamped up and rigid, especially if they're not similar to ones you're used to, it really doesn't matter how good or bad the ideas are or even if there are any ideas on the table at all -- it'll all just go over your head or do nothing but make you angry.  <br />

<br />
I was the first person on my server with canni 5, and when I got it, it was within a few points of being able to kill me, and it gave me a ton of mana.  Really dramatic!  Now it gives me about a bubble or less.  Not much considering how often I can use it.  And canni 4 made much more of a difference.<br />
<br />
We should be able to get mana much more easily than we do these days.  Without getting rare spell drops or drops you need really strong groups to get either; canni is just a basic ability, not something that doesn't matter much and is just a neato prize.  And considering how fast mobs die these days, we don't have as much time to canni either, because we've got to be off and running instead of hanging around doing the canni thing.<br />
<br />
All in all, our mana regeneration has fallen quite far behind what it once was.<br />
<br />
I'm sure our spells will always stay costly, as habits of mind rarely change, especially among EQ developers.  But they could be made more reasonable, and we could be given better mana regeneration, to go along with the vastly improved mana regeneration other classes have gotten and become able to give to others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">The problem with the developers' image of canni, as far as I can discern, is the same problem that Thott's graphs had (well ... one of the problems, anyway).  They look at the spdat.eff data, and determine how much mana regen canni-ing provides, and then they scale up our mana costs in some sort of reverse engineered compensation.<br />
<br />
But in the real game, it doens't work that way.<br />
<br />
Canni is, more than ever, a downtime effect.  Its how I get mana back when I've just been rezzed.  Its how I compensate for manadrains (am I the only person who always fails the *first* resist check vs. Time-Terris's AE?).  But its not a source of mana in typical group environments.  LDoN and much of GoD (like the non-Vxed instances) requires a steady move in.  Canni doesn't work while we're moving.  Later GoD requires whatever patch heals or nukes we can throw.  Canni doesn't work with spam heals or chain nukes.  Canni only works when there's nothing else we are doing - and if both the shaman and the group are good, there should be very little of that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">If I ruled the world (or at least, ruled Norrath, the surrounding celestial bodies and nearby alternate planes), I would make a few changes to slow.<br />
<br />
First off, I would remove castable slow from Beastlords.  They can keep their epic, but it would be reduced to about 15% slow.  The Ranger epic would also be reduced to 15% slow.<br />
<br />
Secondly, Turgur's Insects would be reduced to a 25% slow.  Forlorn Deeds would be reduced to a 20% slow.  The lower level slow spells would either be scaled appropriately, or eliminated in their entirety if they are so close to zero as to become pointless.  I would set Tigur's at 15% AE slow and would raise Cloud of Grummus' relative effectiveness by making it a 20% slow.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, I would remove all slow mitigation from the game.  A mob can either be fully affected by slow or is immune to slow.  There will be no more &quot;slightly affected.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now that I've drastically lowered the effectiveness of slow, I would make some global changes to the damage output of mobs.  Any mob that is currently fully slowable and over about level 45-50 would have its default swing rate reduced by about 45%. Lower level mobs would be adjusted less, as they are currently being hit with lower percentage slow spells cast by characters not high enough in level to have the maximum slow spells.  It's late and I'm probably missing the obvious math, but at fully slowed it should have a bit more than current damage output levels to make up for the fact that there is no &quot;unslowed&quot; period at the start of the fight that has to be mitigated by a period of higher levels of healing.  Any mob that currently mitigates slow would have it's default swing rate adjusted appropriately to allow it to be fully slowed at the new levels and maintain its current, after-mitigated slow, swing rate.  A mob that is unslowable would not be touched.<br />
<br />
After all is said and done, slow is no longer as game-defining as it currently is.  It becomes a &quot;nice to have&quot; but not a critical factor.  Since mob damage output has been reduced at standard levels, it may allow some melee classes to solo a bit more than they currently are able at upper tiers (Monks).  At the same time, it would reduce the effective power of charmed pets, since they will be putting out lower DPS.  However, the ability for a mob to challange the average party shoud be unchanged because the end result, after slow, is unchanged.<br />
<br />
I can't decide what I would do with Bards in this scenario.  I would either just reduce their slow spells in power comparitively to the other slows - probably to about 17% for Requiem of Time - or remove their normal slows and give them some kind of &quot;over-slow&quot; effect.  This would be a slow that stacks with Enchanter/Shaman slow for about 5%, similar to how &quot;over-haste&quot; stacks with spell haste.  A 10% normal slow plus a 5% &quot;over-slow&quot; could also be viable.<br />
<br />
Since slow has been reduced in power, the healing power of Shamans can be increased to match.  It will still leave us behind Druids, but we should be much closer.  There is no need to try and balance Shaman heals vs. 75% slowable mobs while at the same time trying to balance  the healing against slow mitigating trash mobs.  Currently, if you allow a Shaman to heal effectively in the slow mitigated scenario, the healing becomes overpowered against fully slowed mobs.  Conversely, balancing Shaman heals to the damage output of the average fully slowed mob leaves us in the situation we are currently in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">For the most part your just describing the same effect that slow mitigation has. Realisitically speaking there's no way they would go back and retune so much old content for that to happen. On the other hand I can easily see them turning up mitigation on mobs in the high end zones to achieve the same effect in those zones.<br />
<br />
To everyone else i'd like to propose a thought. How would you balance a cleric vs an imaginary class that had a heal that healed for anywhere from 0 to 20 thousand points depending the mob that you where going against?<br />
<br />
You couldn't could you. That is what slow is right now and you can't balance both ends of the spectrum for a shaman vs a cleric. Since it's been clear from the start that the everything is fully slowable end is not acceptable to verant and will not happen on all significant mobs it's clear our class needs to move more towards being balanced for the other end which means more frequent and higher mitigation on mobs and major improvements in our heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Hmm, interesting, Tarradar.  <br />
<br />
Our slow won't improve, which we already know, due to Verant's over-arching game design considerations, so instead of moaning and groaning over how much worse it has gotten to no avail or pointlessly begging it be made better(lord knows how many years some of us, especially the bots among us, would be content doing that), make slow worse, across the board, and be done with it and move on to the next phase. <br />
<br />
Once slow is effectively NOT made the defining spell for our class, since it will FINALLY very clearly and unarguably be made of minor importance overall to EVERY class that has it, we can freely get upgrades that make us a better grouping class, and forever after get upgrades in a manner that actually addresses the game content at hand and makes sense in relation to it.  And get just as many upgrades as anybody else.<br />
<br />
So we might be a good or even great class due to how we really function instead of outdated ideas about how uber slow is and how it's more than enough to never upgrade us or make us desirable or particularly functional.<br />
<br />
I like that.  It would solve Sony's problems(they don't want slow and find it very hard to design around) and ours at the same time.<br />
<br />
Whether it is major improvement in our heals or major improvement in other things that would compensate does not necessarily follow directly, but of course it would be something.  Once Sony made ALL slows worse and made ALL mobs mitigate far more and far more often, we could expect major improvements in our groupworthiness without Sony either being tied to our slow or using it as an excuse to keep us crippled forever, and let us get worse and worse every expansion into the foreseeable future.  It could keep the game from degrading into either the unworkable chaos it's now headed toward or to the model of using only 3 or 4 classes in the entire game and having everyone else either reroll(Thanks Absor!) or quit.<br />
<br />
We could actually look forward to very strong improvements very soon instead of a slow sinking into oblivion while bots scream how great we are over the sound of our air bubbles running out.<br />
<br />
Interesting idea.  I kind of like it.<br />
<br />
Definitely the idea we're stuck with now, that slow should stay the way it is and that slow is a critical spell in encounters and more than enough to balance an entire class around,  is patently unworkable and ruinous to the class.<br />
<br />
Embracing its slipping into a utility spell and even accepting and cheering its being pushed into its spot there is much more forward looking and realistic than being in denial and trying, along with the developers, to fight from weakness instead of strength.<br />
<br />
We've been an adaptable class before.  Perhaps we could adapt around the current and future destruction of slows in EQ's game design by not fighting the process, but going along with it, helping it along and keeping an open mind as to what we can do when we're in the position where we can finally ask for and receive abilities and spells that matter instead of struggling to defend and hold on to things that don't and are already broken and irreparable.<br />
<br />
Looking forward instead of back(like the developers and the players pretty much have been up to now), would be really refreshing and a very positive development.  <br />
<br />
Essentially almost getting rid of slow for everybody not just ourselves, could finally be looking at slow for what it's really worth, and put us in line with EQ's future instead of having us mourning and fighting about a past that will never come again and doesn't have any real bearing on our present or future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Interesting post, but I think there is something people are not thinking about.  As I said earlier all classes break down into four categories:<br />
<br />
DPS<br />
Healing<br />
Mob DPS Mitigation<br />
Group DPS enhancement<br />
<br />
Of course, many classes fall into multiple categories (Shamans fall into all 4).  The standard group setup breaks down into the following:<br />
<br />
Healer<br />
Tank<br />
Slower<br />
Puller<br />
DPS/CC<br />
DPS/CC<br />
DPS/CC<br />
<br />
Now, many people have suggested that 2 healers are better than 1 healer and 1 slower (shaman specifically).  Currently we have, ingame:<br />
<br />
Healers: Cleric, Druid, Shaman<br />
Slowers: Shaman, Enchanter, Beastlord, (Necro, Bard)<br />
<br />
Basically, if you want to start a group you need to find a healer, tank, slower, and fill up the DPS/CC slots.  Now, if slow was mitigated to the point of &quot;non-essential&quot; or removed permanently- the standard group set-up would look something like this:<br />
<br />
Healer<br />
Healer<br />
Tank<br />
Puller<br />
DPS/CC<br />
DPS/CC<br />
<br />
Removal of slow would probably be good for us because we would see significant healing improvements...but, it would be bad for game design.<br />
Instead of finding one healer out of three classes and one slower out of three classes (with one class that overlaps in both categories), you would now need 2 players out of 3 classes.  We would win out simply that we would be required more often, but the other 2 main slowers would lose out simply because they would be competing for DPS/CC slots.  Basically, a lot more players lose out with the removal of slow than win.  <br />
<br />
While the changes may alleviate our healing complaints and the headache that slow/slow mitigation has created- it just leads to a bigger problem: Class Availability.  We already see this issue happening on raids with the removal of Shamans as a legitimate &quot;healer&quot;- this same situation would creep its way into the grouping environment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">You don't need to find a slower when you can just find a second cleric or druid.  Regardless of how much slow is mitigated.<br />
<br />
You're working off a paradigm that's already outdated.<br />
<br />
So there's no point working from an incorrect paradigm to extrapolate into the future.  The premise is already flawed.<br />
<br />
By the way, it's not at all clear that the improvements we get would necessarily be to healing, either.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Maybe, where you play. /shrug - I did a series of LDoNs (granted, easy 65s or hard 60s) with two Druids recenlty. They were arguing about who had to heal, and I said &quot;Actually, you can both dps. I'll pull, slow, and heal&quot; (had Pally tanking). I think they had more fun on those adventures than they had in a long time. One of them did toss a heal on the tank if I was slowing a four-pull.<br />
<br />
The key there is easy LDoN. Frankly with the right combo you dont even need a druid or shaman or cleric on a easy LDoN in the right camp.  Your right though, i wont do anything these days unless its GoD, Sol Ro , Elemental or Hard LDoN. So like i said, its what im seeing in how i play. I dont like to rack up easy points for LDoN, that might as well be pulling DL for a exp grind, your just grinding points is all, which is fine if you like that. I would rather have less points and more challange and adventure is all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally I think any sort of drastic change like that to slow is inherently tied to changes in healing abilities. Slowing a mob is just to directly tied to healing needs to consider it seperately which is why I propose the changes the way I do. Like I said I don't beleive clerics should be the only viable healer in normal situations. They can be the best healer and can the on healer in some specific situations but should not be the only option for a healer for you standard groups. In order for that to be possible it's going to require druid and shaman healing to be significantly increased.<br />
<br />
As far as the requiring 2 healers for a group that already happens quite freuently in kod'taz and later. Sad thing is shaman can barely even cover the second healer spot right now.<br />
<br />
Trying to balance healing abilities with slows as a significant consideration just isn't possible just like it wasn't possible to balance ch's.<br />
<br />
While I do beleive this is the best solution for game balance for healing and for shaman i don't beleive it's going to happen. It's far to drastic a change in abilities of classes and would upset far too many people for them to ever really do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Basically, it's the nature of things to never change unless there's a real need. Shamans becoming useless doesn't create a feeling of need or even interest on the part of the developers; only fewer subscriptions per month does.  Not even the intellectual interest to explore the problems seriously.  <br />
<br />
Without a fire lit under their arses, and with shamans having no ability to light one, the class won't be going through any changes that matter, and we'll actually get worse as hitpoint increases and short mob lifespans in future expansions make slow even less necessary.<br />
<br />
Our real chance for significant positive change is next to none.</div></div><hr />

This is a big part of the problem. Warriors could do their little sit-in thing and it worked because Warrior is such a &quot;required&quot; class. Shaman have become the LOWEST class on the Slower list, the only reason we are still so popular is that folks havent fully realized how much huger a BL is in their group instead of a Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">OK i am now very confused take our slow away how dare you even suggest something like that even in jest. I can see it now the next patch message:<br />
<br />
- The slow line of spells has been removed from shamans and been replaced with the reserection line of spells<br />
<br />
Yep thats all we need to be turned into ress'ers like clerics<br />
<br />
Slow is a very useful spell however it has become more of a situational spell especially in the new content.<br />
<br />
So what should this mean for the shaman class? What is the role of the shamans to be??<br />
<br />
I would like to see more Healing over time spells for the shaman probably a group version of quiescence. I don't want to able to directly heal as well as a druid but I would love to be the Healing over time king.<br />
<br />
A shaman should not be the primary healer in a group, nore should it be in a group for its direct damaging ability. A shaman perpose is to reduce incoming damage and as a backup healer.<br />
<br />
I may be seeing something in the shaman class here which you are missing but i can't actually remember the last time I used my direct healing spell.<br />
<br />
I think to that end we as a class should be looking at how this should be achieved without saying totally redisign the class. I am sure that there are all sort of spells they could add. Like a damage reduction shield, maybe some spells which would increase the NPC chance to miss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Slow is designed to mitigate a mob's dps- doesn't matter how mitigated it is in its current form.  It used to be non-essential before PoP, but afterwards, quickly became a requirement if you wanted to get a group together.  PoP+ is designed with a healer/slower in mind.  If you remove slowing then its pretty obvious that you will need another healer if you want to maintain the same xp pace in a group- if you don't, then you are looking at some downtime while the healer meds up.  The only way around this is for the developers to go back and completely re-evaluate ALL mob dps once slow has been removed.  That would be one major pain in the *** for everyone- I could see SOE still fixing that 2 years after they removed slow.<br />
<br />
Back to the breakdown of abilities:<br />
<br />
DPS<br />
Healing<br />
Mob DPS mitigation<br />
Group DPS enhancement<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
Last time I checked we were a priest class, so in my mind I think that the majority of improvements would be healing.  SOE may give us some more dps, but chances are, as a priest class, we would get better healing.<br />
<br />
Now if the slow removal was implemented, what would we lose?<br />
<br />
Soloing ability-  <br />
<br />
Like it or not, but there are quite a few people out there that chose a shaman over a cleric out there because they could solo.  In the earlier levels- our spells work around the concept of a mob being slowed.  Our dots land simply because we are able to channel them through with a mob's dps being mitigated.  Dog-dog was designed to tank slowed mobs, and we already see the trouble that he is running into in later content.  Other classes have abilities that allow them to solo: snare, pets that chain cast root, mez, fast casting heals/nukes.  At this time, we do not have any of those abilities, and unless that is changed then we are stuck lfg until we can get a group. (the same issue clerics have been complaining about for years.)<br />
<br />
What would other players lose?<br />
<br />
PoP+ unless revamped can and will require 2 healers if the content is &quot;challenging&quot; otherwise we are back to the sit-and-med method that was common before PoP.  I hate sitting around, and I am pretty sure others do as well.  We already have enough of that in other areas of EQ- we don't need more.  <br />
<br />
Instead of the old standard of Healer/Slower where you have a combination of 5 classes to choose from you now have Healer/Healer with 3 classes to choose from.  Simple probability shows that unless a server's populous immediately adapts, then you are dealing with a stricter standard for groups.  For every group that has 2 healers for a Kod'Taz trial- there is probably 1-2 more that are still looking for healers.<br />
<br />
Issues with slow is affected the high end game for most of us.  Removing it, while it may give us nice upgrades and a larger group appeal, is selling out a lot of functionability that we had getting to the point we are at today.  Slow is imbedded far deeper than cheal ever was, trying to cut it out with one swipe just hurts everyone involved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Predicus -- Actually, not that this would ever be implemented, but if it were, it wouldn't have to affect nearly as much older content as you're saying.<br />
<br />
Look how they've constructed mobs so that fear doesn't work on them above a certain level, or FD at one point didn't totally blank their memory if they were above a certain level.  Look also at the way your level compared to a mob's level let's spells have lesser or greater chances of landing.<br />
<br />
They could adapt the game so that monsters of a certain level would be slowed the old way, but monsters above a certain level would generally be much less likely to have slow stick, or become immune.  Then they could just tweak a few boss mobs here and there for the exceptions where they feel the need to tinker.  And future mobs, as the game raises levels, will be higher level, so they'd be adapted automatically.<br />
<br />
Anyway, adapting your spells to mobs doesn't always have to entail as much as you're making it sound like, though.<br />
<br />
So while your concerns are legitimate, I think in this instance they are misplaced.</div></div><hr />

Why not introduce shammy innate abillty ( aa or whatever ) to avoid slow mitigation on mobs a bit and make it a shaman ONLY ability. Each mob would be slowable 1 rank more than it is by default ( mostly -&gt; fully for instance ).</div></div><hr />

<br />
If, as a shaman, you feel reduced to being buff bot/useless status, you ned to find a new guild, change your playing tactics, or find SOMEHTING to breathe fun back into the game.<br />
<br />
Btw, I have run into asinine tanks and clerics. I don't group with them anymore.<br />
<br />
Find a group, make a group, take a camp, keep a camp<br />
Keep grabbing people who are LFG, cultivate your frineds to be more powerful. And they'll help you.<br />

Man, you will allways be needed in groups like in Sebilis!&quot;<br />
<br />
Boy, was he wrong. This new content has made us not so needed. Sometimes, we get groups because they want the buffs, but our initital job in the group was to be the slower, because ours was the best. 75% is a major difference in the dps of a mob. <br />
<br />
Well, what are we to do now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">When people start getting huge hitpoints from being equipped with GoD items, and Time items work their way into the game and become more common, it will be even more the case that you'll be fine just taking another cleric or druid instead of a shaman, and not even using slows at all. Slow will become like snare -- something you really want in special situations perhaps(or perhaps not), but completely irrelevant in a great deal of content.<br />
My guild has been farming Time and GoD for months.  Our warriors have 13k+ hps.  Until OoW came out, KT was our main xp playground.  In the months we've had access to the zone for xping, I've *never* seen any guild group hunt in KT without a slower.  Groups will flat out not hunt in hard places like KT without bringing a slower.  Even with the short fight times of most of GoD, no one in my entire guild will hunt there unless they have a slower in their group.<br />
And when you need slows, you'll still prefer a chanter or beastlord for all the other things(actually USEFUL ones) they can bring besides slow.<br />
No.  When you need slows, you take a slower who's lfg.  Shaman or chanty if possible, bst as an alternative, bard if you really have to.  Life in hard xp zones like KT and Vxed don't necessarily need 2 healers, but groups with only a single healer are fragile, and I seldom see them happen.  There's almost always a shaman + healer combo for the duel healer + slow being in group.  If there's an enchanter or BST, then the group has a cleric + druid/paladin.  Bards aren't slowers in my guild unless they have to be.  Bards are dps classes.  When you hunt in places that can kill your 10k+ hp tank in 5-10 seconds of unslowed combat, slow is enormous, even with short fights.<br />
<br />
And then there's OoW, which is even BETTER for shaman than it was before.  Fight lengths increased for comparable xp.  Dots actually go full duration in my groups.  I can malos, slow, and main heal in just about every place I've been to so far, including City and PG.  Instead of mobs hitting for 1000, and fights going for 30 seconds, mobs only hit for 600s, and live for about a minute.  With dps drasticly dropped, our *highly* efficient heal over times can actually be used to main heal tanks, or significantly assist in the healing with some quick heals.<br />
<br />
Without getting rare spell drops or drops you need really strong groups to get either<br />
This used to be the case when our canni upgrade was ancient in GoD.  It's not the case now.  Anyone with 200k plat can buy their new canni upgrade at level 68.  That's what I did.  Actually, it cost me 150k for 3 runes from a guildy, but runes regularly sell for 60-80k on my server.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you started this lame thread, oh, about 7 months ago, it would have made some sense.  Posting it now is just plain dumb.  It's like trying to scare people into buying snow chains for their tires because of the cold cold winter coming, when in reality it's March, and half the snow has already melted.  We're well into spring, and I feel like wearing some shorts!<br />
<br />
Do you ever actually even *play* your shaman, or do you just read about other people's complaints and make up **** about what things as a shaman are really like?  With OoW, shaman are gaining back a lot of power.  You can continue your rant about how shaman can't ever get groups and no one would ever want us all you want.  I'm a bit too busy to support your cause, telling the masses that I already have a group within the first few seconds of logging in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">You don't need to find a slower when you can just find a second cleric or druid. Regardless of how much slow is mitigated.<br />
Hahahahahah.  &quot;when you can justfind a second cleric or druid&quot;.  That's priceless.  Cuz you know, of everyone that plays everquest, a full 33% of them play one of those 2 classes.  There's always enough clerics and druids for every group.   :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
The reverse is also true.  You don't need to find a second main healer when you can just find a slower.  Heal repairs damage.  Slow prevents damage.  When the damage you take necessitates having 2 main healers in a group when mobs are unslowed, you can instead mitigate the damage with a slower, and survive with 1 main healer.  You still want a backup healer for emergencies, but the main healer and slower can suffice.  Why's this so hard to understand.  Slowing a mob to reduce its dps by 75% or 60% or whatever with a single spell has the exact same effect as healing *all* of the prevented damage with a single heal over time.  If you prevent 10000 damage in a minute with a slow, that's directly equivelant to healing 10000 in a minute with a single heal over time.<br />
<br />
Slows are good to have.  Slows are useful.  Arguing to completely revamp the entire class around the removal of a spell that encompasses the design of 90% of the entire game...that's just plain dumb.  Shaman are doing well for themselves at present with OoW.  Our spells need to be tweaked, not revamped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Open a second account, use your shaman to PL your new Cleric, and then duo your Cleric Warrior combo!..Then use your shaman as a buff bot...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>bearage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">I've through the various posts and I must say there is a lot of clever thought coming from this community.  However, there is also people forgetting how some of the game mechanics work.<br />
<br />
Mechanics:<br />
In Walls of Slaughter (for example) all mobs mitigate slow.  Beaslord, Enchanter and Shaman slows all become EQUAL.  Effectively in Omens Shaman have no slow (5%/10%) advantage over Enchanters and Beastlords.  <br />
<br />
I am a shaman. When I do a WoS group and I have no druid or cleric in the group.  I invite a beastlord.  Why?    The answer is DPS and slow.  ****?  You are a shaman and you invite a beastie to slow?  Yes - you know why?   The answer is Beastlord and Enchanter slows are equal to mine in that zone and in Omens in general.  It means I can concentrate on healing and debuffing.<br />
<br />
Also, Beastlords slow is faster and it carries less possible resistance statistic and turgers.  In fact Shamans turgers is the most easy to resist slow there is.  Beastlords in Omens own shaman on slow now that mobs mitigate - hands down - thats the way it is.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I find myself having problems healing an average MT in WoS with the mob partially slowed.   I blast my heal and put HOTs on him.  Yeh he lives and we get the xp - but the mana cost?  It's like im level 22 back in Cazic Thule doing the Throne Room again (i.e. kill 5 mobs med 17 mins) and fight again..  Of course in WoS I don't need to med for that time - but the mana use is such that after one fight im 1/4 into my mana (btw I have 6k mana, ft20, 7k hp 400aa).<br />
<br />
So even though for years I've played Slower, debuffer, healer for a group of 5 melee now I struggle to slow and heal.  I am a realist - I think Beastlords should never have gotten a 65% slow and half of my spells (-1 tier) - but if I'm doing a WoS group - I will use them for slow, cripple and DPS - hands down.  <br />
<br />
In addition the other day I was with my RL GF who plays an Enchanter - I had her slow.  Again are slows are all the same in WoS - so even though her slow is slower to cast than mine - I can concentrate on heals.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, I did a few tests.  I had a few mobs not slowed in WoS and just healed and I used about the same mana...I even told the group that they may as well forget slow alltogether..<br />
<br />
<br />
Do Shamans now suck?<br />
Well I believe I still play my class to the best of its abilities and will never say I suck.  Indeed I can keep a group going (mostly gheto) when no one else can and I can make the difference.  However..comparing the class to the competition - then we are falling behind BADLY now.<br />
<br />
Consider this comparison:<br />
Beastlord:   Cripple,  Slow<br />
Enchanter:  Cripple,  Slow<br />
Shaman: Cripple, Slow<br />
<br />
With the Omens mitigation we are ALL EQUAL.  Shamans use to have the edge - but not in new content.  <br />
<br />
People posting are truely correct in saying they have target our primary edge which makes the class.<br />
<br />
Yes of course we can slow and heal - but the mitigation makes our heals worthless.  I've really no idea why Druids are to be the better healer than a shaman.  A shaman in EQ lore is more of a healer than a druid.  <br />
<br />
So if we can't heal and we can't do dps and we can't really cc (root anyone) then we are out of the running.  Beastlords add significant DPS and our stuff while Encs add safety in CC and of course our skills - amongst crack etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can understand the poster saying remove slow.  I wouldn't like slow to go.  In fact its a non-issue.  Sony will never remove slow because they cannot screw old content - i.e make it harder so much so that it prevents guilds (new lowbie) guilds from climbing the progression ladder.  But they can always make them easier (Bertox yawns).  So no one panic Slow isn't going anywhere.  However, what Sony can do is moving forward reduce the use of it.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately Sony implemented it badly.  A poster here suggested that slows are made to 25% for turg and 20% for enc and 15% for bst.  He was kind of ignored when in fact his idea was very smart indeed.  What  a lot of people failed to see is that he was trying to RETAIN our edge over the other slowers.  By reducing the slows to BELOW the mitigation levels and then re-adding the 5% differences we still have an edge over our conterparts.  So to that poster - thumbs up.  However..they will never add that because it will blow old content (Velious/Luclin/PoP).<br />
<br />
<br />
What do I think we need?<br />
I think (in my humble opinion) that we are PRIESTS.  Witchdoctors.  The Shaman in all EQ and RL lore depicts shaman as healers.  We need and will retain our slow ability - and Sony need to make it so that our slow regardless of mitigation is better than bsts and enc - thats the first thing.  They can do that by reducing the effect on slow by 5% / 10% for enc and bst After mitigation (leaving Shm slow top of the list).  Next, we should get heals exactly as druids - and if not more.  <br />
<br />
What are we not?<br />
I don't believe our primary function is DPS or Dots (remember the lore chaps).  Increase our heals - respect our primary functions (debuff and slow).  <br />
<br />
<br />
In Class Balancing:<br />
Increase our cripple or decrease bst/enc cripple.<br />
Allow our slow to be above enc and bst slow even through mitigation caps.<br />
Increase our healing to druid status.<br />
<br />
Also..<br />
I don't believe clerics should be the only one to cast a CH.  I am a raid leader and I raid a lot.  I am so annoyed at being dependant on clerics so much.  Sure I use druids a lot now too.  But hell - I'd like to use shamans too.   Every other class has someone to shadow them:<br />
Necros/SK - Summon<br />
Druid/Wiz - Port<br />
shm/enc/bst - Cripple <br />
shm/enc/bst/brd - slow<br />
clr - complete heal<br />
wiz/mag/dru - nuke dps<br />
rog/mnk - melee dps<br />
<br />
Whats the odd one out?  Cleric..the only one to get a class specific spell.  This needs a balance.  What better place than to give druids and shamans a complete heal spell.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Remember..the lore..<br />

I don't agree with every detail. ~_^<br />
<br />
But I agree with a lot of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">I didn't read this entire thread since for the last 2 years this argument has been thrown out over and over so much it becomes redundant. <br />
<br />
I think the issue is that slow is mitigated by the mob at a set %. It should be that the classes respective slows should be effected differently by mitgation. IE: Shm, being the noted kings of slow, should not have their slow mitigated near as much as say a Beastlord. This would help compensate for the neg. impact on shaman while still maintaining the degree of trivialization of slow and its impact on the game entire.  I only say this because i feel that its not so much the slow mitgation vs. shaman healing power that is the problem as it is redundancy on class participation in a good group. A group with a Druid or Cleric doesn't really need a shaman as the main slower since the Clerics/Druids healing power is good enough to compensate for a lesser slow from a Bard,Bst or Enc. Most clerics or Druids want someone with a group level mana regen buff (Enc/Bst/brd have, we do not) that will allow a much faster pull rate that directly transfers to exp gain. Basically grouping is now more like a business than a game. People tend to form groups based off of what classes offer the highest exp gain potential. That being said shaman are last on the list unless the mobs hit extremely hard and do not mitgate slow. We don't bring anything to the group that an Enc/Brd or Bst doesn't offer to some degree while still maintaining the &quot;power group&quot; mentality. They all have haste, atk buffs and group mana regen and have a higher DPS value than a shaman could ever have. If we had a slightly faster casting nuke(s) or could DoT with out the fear of drawing agro (DoTs that do significant damage in a very short time) then we could be of some use but reality is that fights don't last anywhere near long enough to make DoTing viable, DoTs incur far to much agro and our nukes are worse than clerics.<br />
<br />
I could say more but there is nothing that I am saying here that hasn't been pounded into everyone's heads 400,000 times before. I pretty much gave up on EQ and only play bout 2-3 times a week. This class is dead, dead as hell and I have come to the conclusion that the Dev team has no damn clue how to fix it. It is so very clear with OoW adding more DoT's. I really, really like the new stat buffs and the cap limit effects etc, but DoT's are pointless and our nukes are so pathetic that I can't begin to understand the value of them.<br />
<br />
Any ways, thats my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>psosnake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">shamans need to have slow, it just needs to land fully and not mitigated ever...and our buffs need to add the stats no matter what the cap is and im sure shammys would be wanted more..that and fix at least our DDs or our DoTs something</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">shamans need to have slow, it just needs to land fully and not mitigated ever..<br />
<br />
<br />
Nyet.<br />
The game becomes deathly boring when slow is allowed to land fully<br />
I *hate* to admit it, but mitigation of slow is a neccasary evil.<br />
The other side of the equation need to be balanced instead, i.e; Shamans need some better heals.<br />
not druid quality,, but we should have something equivalent to Druid poP heals by the time we hit 70, IMHO.<br />
Lagging behind druids is not a bad thing,, most druids I know would kill to have my HoT.<br />
They have a problem because of this, they have to rely on blast heals, they get none of the &quot;buffering&quot; advantages a HoT gives us Shamans and Clerics.<br />
<br />
Conversely, raising our slow to something a bit higher(say, 80, 85%) would give us an edge over chanters/beastlords/bards/etc, but we'll still be stuck with gimp heals.<br />
Let sony mitigate slow, just make us a better heal spell.<br />
Hell, make it 3 differetn AA heal spells with 1 minute reuse timers on each. Or somethign. that's for antoher thread<br />
<br />
I do *NOT* want sony to touch mitigation EVER again,, I want mitigation. They can't get rid of mitigation, slow is horrendously overpowering.<br />
Slow mitigation will stay, or continue. it won't go away.<br />
We need to prepare for tomorrow, and bitch about healing, the other side of slow.<br />
<br />
.and our buffs need to add the stats no matter what the cap is and im sure shammys would be wanted more..that and fix at least our DDs or our DoTs something<br />
<br />
It would be nice to see our PoP buffs be stat breakers too.<br />
They probably *should* have been.<br />
They aren't, and Sony won't fix it. Oh well<br />
<br />
<br />
Our DDs suck, aye.<br />
Not as badly as Beastlords and other hybridsBeastlord 60-70 spells (http://allakhazam.com/db/spelllist.html?name=&amp;type=bst&amp;level=60&amp;opt=And+Higher&amp;action=search) <br />
<br />
Enchanters get better DDs, it's true<br />
Enchanter 60-70 spells (http://allakhazam.com/db/spelllist.html?name=&amp;type=enc&amp;level=60&amp;opt=And+Higher&amp;action=search) <br />
But there DDs are not even 2x as powerful as ours (http://allakhazam.com/db/spelllist.html?name=&amp;type=shm&amp;level=60&amp;opt=And+Higher&amp;action=search)<br />
<br />
A minor increase to our DDs would be nice, But neccasary? To each his own, I am not nor do I want to be a wizzy, my wizzy is a level 2 froglok and has stayed that way because I am not an alt player v_v.<br />
<br />
Our dots? I'd love to see bane and Curse of sisslak stack; I am informed they don't, but I am still going to try it for myself ~_^<br />
Necros have a few HPs on us in the DoT department.<br />
THat's fine w/ me,, necro can't heal in mid end for crap. <br />
~~~~~~~Close~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
To end, I think we need, first and foremost, better heals.<br />
I think we are, or could be, pretty satisfied wiht our other spells.<br />
<br />
A *MAJOR* problem is that our class was ignored in PoP, and raped in GoD.<br />
<br />
The fixes promised in OOW are there, they really are.<br />
The fixes are in spells and in AAs.<br />
We have to earn them, is all.<br />
All the other classes PoP spells are relatively sufiecient to deal with OOW.<br />
<br />
Ours are not, and we must earn the appropriate spells to &quot;fix&quot; us.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Dawulfie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">It would take a group both a BL/Ench and a Druid to replace us for healing, on an unslowed GoD or OoW MOB in any kind of challenging content, you need slow, even if it is mitigated, and Enchanters get smeared a lot faster then we do on a resisted slow that agros.  To replace us for slowing, you need an Enchanter and a BL, since a BL can't Malos and a few resists on an MPG named would take a pretty big chunk out of the healer's mana pool.  And you still don't get the buffs, Fero does stack with FA you know...  Even without my L69 or 70 spells, Bane+Yoppa's Rain can add up to pretty good DPS, stack Bane+Blood+Nukes and you could outdamage that BL (that is if you can find someone who can hold agro).  Or depending on the BL, a couple Yoppa's Rains can out-DPS him.  How many people do MPG groups with no slower because you have a Druid and Cleric so you don't need a slower?  Not many.  All I can assume about the healing problems is that you're using Kraggs, with the GoD heal or Yoppa's Mending, I can heal pretty decently.  Nowhere near a Cleric, though seriously for WoS trash or below Trushar's is almost always more then enough healing.  Get in a situation where you can't use horses and have no KEI, and Druids in my experience aren't that great of healers, due to their mana regen.  I can slow, secondary or even MH, and still do damage.  In non-trivial content, the Druid will be lucky to be able to heal, snare, and maybe click off a DoT.<br />
<br />
Our OoW spells are statbusters, so they have addressed that issue.  Even the uber tanks I've met really like having an extra 40 STA, and of course more STR helps with the attack, DEX overbuffs are still questionable, but it looks nice.  Add our Avoidance and Damage Bonus buffs, and we bring a lot more to a group then just a &quot;crappy healer and slower&quot;.  Maybe I'm just lucky, but I don't seem to have a problem getting groups.  People see me do a lucky set on Yoppa's rain of two 1786 crits and an 893 (SOE, it would REALLY be nice if you could put a better resist check on this BTW), and I can do decent burst damage.  You also are forgetting that Enchanter nukes check their resists against Magic, which is 99% of the time going to be resisted more then Cold/Poison based DD's, not to mention that little push knockback on the spells make them a 2-check resist.  Having the improved Canni line of spells has really helped me with DPS, now instead of chain-casting Canni4, I can actually blow some nukes off.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see a short-duration high damage DoT besides our Bane line that didn't draw a ton of agro like our Poison line.  Having a 5 second nuke would be nice.  I'm already critting 4700+HP heals, and that's with no IH5 or Ancient Heal.  I find it silly that we complain that people can replace us with two other classes, so we're unbalanced.  How about instead of having a Cleric, Druid, BL, and Enchanter just so the party can slow and have a backup healer, the party has a Cleric, Shaman, and two Rogues?  Kill rate will go up tremendously (talking OoW where CoD isn't worth the risk generally).  If I can get better heals, that's great. I'll never turn down anything beneficial.  But in my groups, I bring a lot more then slow to the table.  If our heals were much better, we'd be much better healers then Druids because of our mana regen abilities.  And we still bring slow, buffs, and superior DoT's over Druids.  Everyone want's their class to be better, and everyone can find fault with their current class.  But there's no way in heck I'd ever swap my Shaman for another class, I bring too much to the table.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We all seem to agree the big issues are<br />
Shaman is supposed to be the slow character.<br />
They gave very similar abilities to two other classes with alot more going for them.<br />
<br />
Ok balance by providing us secondary abilities that match those to the other classes.<br />
<br />
Beef up the pet to less then a beastlord but much better then it is now or allow us to do more dps under certain circumstances. <br />
Provide shammies with a single target mez or the slow be unresistable. Prefer the MEZ because all of OOW mitigates making slow less and less usefull in the high end game. If its going to mitigate anyay whats it matter ours is the highest. if my 70 percent slow doesnt do 70 percent then Im GIMP.<br />
ANd dev made it that way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i really hope, only very very few shaman would want that. Sorry, but do you realize that that would make exactly the same thing they did to us with giving a meaningful slow to beastlords, too?<br />
And it wouldnt help us a bit (especially as we can do it situationally, decay and vp does wonders sometimes).<br />
what next? we want knight like melee mitigation and ranger like melee dps? and kei/voq/claivorance? :)<br />
<br />
sorry, i am not one who says we are perfectly fine, no, we still have many issues (even when oow made alot better for us imo), but trying to get stuff we never had before and who are &quot;specials&quot; of another class (that has similar problems now like we had in god) is certainly the fast way to make us look like stupid, unrealistic whiners who only want god mode and want to be a one man group.<br />
<br />
commonly, imo its getting really lame, atm there is a real competition between all professional whiners of ALL classes about who's class is gimped most.<br />
I often read these boards just to amuse myself how some try to argue, why rangers are absolutely useless or clerics will never get groups, as well as some shaman &quot;argue&quot; there as well.<br />
<br />
its not needed any more to have the perfect group, i had a really awsome group yesterday in the lvl 68+ triggered version of murkgliders hive, with a cleric, one ranger and a mage. And it was not the cleric that did the healing. I (granted, i have time level gear, but non-raid-geared shaman are completely able to heal a good tank in there, too) was more than sufficient to heal the ranger (he isnt that geared, but a kickass player, i have more hp than him for example), dish out some dps by stacking dots on the mobs and ccing the adds with vp and root/ornate legs. The cleric pulled and nuked like a wizard (mobs in there are undead), and we had some rune drops, decent (not the best, but i've seen far worse) exp and an extremly funny and joyful evening.<br />
<br />
So we are far away from meaningless, or even as you say GIMP. We bring more to a group (especially in oow) than only slow. If you think our only &quot;trick&quot; is to slow, maybe thats the reason why you dont get groups.<br />
<br />
ah, and btw, our slows do 75% unimtigated, not 70 :P</div></div><hr />

or was that different in animal farm?  :D <br />
<br />
but yeah, i was one of the first proposing that in the old united voice thread on this board but i highly doubt anything like that would be taken into consideration at all, and i guess we all know that beating a dead horse is utterly useless.<br />
and yes, i felt enlightened and fresh too when they made the &quot;mistake&quot; with the mitigation tables in OoW :( but it still isnt that OoW is the same for us as GoD, absolutely not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">&quot;take away our slows so you can patch us to heal like a druid for twice the mana cost and bring nothing else useful to the group!&quot;<br />
<br />
By the way, why is it that so many people assume that adding healing is the ONLY thing they could give us in compensation if they took away our slow?<br />
<br />
It could just as well be DPS of different types.<br />
<br />
And why would the mana cost necessarily have to be horrific?  (And since when did druids have only healing to offer, as a bit of an aside here?)<br />
<br />
Remember, we're just working and playing with ideas here.  Why on earth make all kinds of assumptions on EXACTLY what is set in in stone?  These are all just hypotheticals here!<br />
<br />
My posts in this thread have tried to emphasize mental flexibility and how inflexibly we've tended to look at things(along with the developers, who tend to be far more inflexible and limited in their understanding than we are) and how that may be keeping us from really understanding things, but if you come into any ideas all clamped up and rigid, especially if they're not similar to ones you're used to, it really doesn't matter how good or bad the ideas are or even if there are any ideas on the table at all -- it'll all just go over your head or do nothing but make you angry.  <br />
<br />
I'd suggest less rigidity and anger and more, well...almost anything, I guess.  <br />
<br />
At least something that keeps you in the discussion.<br />
Ok make me a necro (DoTs), a druid (patch healer/decent dps), a cleric (uber healer and half-ass nuker but better buffer) or a wizard (nukeage).<br />
<br />
How about a less resistant slow that only shammys would get? So basically something that hits all non-raid uber mobs on first cast and is only available to shaman (kinda like BoN but better)? Chanters would still have to tash and beasts would be sol without a debuffer. Or perhaps a lower% slow that hits all non named mobs that is only available to shammys (i.e. add another form of immunity, immune to all but shammy slow)? I would take a 25% slow on a normally unslowable mob :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Gaknab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Oh god, not yet another thread explaining how shaman suck, how the devs don't care about us how slow is killing us etc, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
Honeslty do any of you actually play a Shaman in the high end? Judging by what is posted here I'm beginning to think not.<br />
<br />
Yes Slow has been nerfed to hell and back, yes it's not as powerful as it used to be in the Kunark era, yes we are not the gods we used to be. Honestly though buck during that time (RoK / SoV) Shaman were seriously, seriously overpowered. (Any of you who actually played a 50-60 shaman in that era will totally understand, the rest of you will not)<br />
<br />
So SoE made a bunch of changes that directly affected us and brought the overall power of the shaman class down, and more into tune with other classes. Personally I think it was a good move by them. Honeslty it was boring as hell during that time, becuase we basically trivialized the content our group was fighting almost anywhere we went. Couple that with the fact that Shaman were able to solo stuff that druids / necromancers could only dream about and you might begin to understand just how overpowered we actually were.<br />
<br />
All of this was becuase of our spellset. The set of spells that shaman were given is increadably powerful when the whole of them is used. We can do a whole ton of things decently well, and this gives our class an amazing amount of durability and flexibitiy. Couple that with Turgur's and we were gods.<br />
<br />
Slow was the killer ability of our class, when it was first introduced in RoK it was WAY WAY overpowered. I personally believe that SoE did not fully understand just how game altering that single line of spells was and it took them awhile to figure out a way to bring it into balance without totally destroying the classes that have a line of slow spells.<br />
<br />
Slow mitigation was an excellent idea. With it SoE could basically tune the difficulty of any given encounter/mob/zone with ease. At the same time slow was (and STILL is) a useful spell. Although I personally believe that mitigation is over used these days, with the way characters are increasing in power I can understand why it is so common. Believe it or not this is the ONE thing that SoE has done in the last few years that actually makes the game HARDER, rather than dumbing it down, making it more n00b friendly, eaisier etc.<br />
<br />
Sorry all, I too remember what it was like to be THE godly class of EQ, I enjoyed it while it lasted but we weren't supposed to be that powerful, and we probably never will be again. SO GET OVER IT ALREADY. Instead of whining about the past, learn the new inviroment, adapt to the changes and master them. I don't care what class you are, if you are good and know your s*@t you will be in demand.<br />
<br />
I regulary xp with the top tank on our server in MPG / RS for hours at a time. He has close to 16K Hp's raid buffed and without a slower in group in these zone his life will get chewed so fast that he will die before a CH will land more often than not in RS and in MPG clerics slowly run out of mana over time keeping him up. This is not camping by the way, we constantly move and kill, move and kill as we clear areas and run out of mobs. If you don't have a mob your currently killing you're wasting time. Add a slower (Preferrably a Shaman) of any type and it's happy time, no med breaks, constant killing and the xp rolls in. The Shaman in my guild are constantly in demand for XP groups, I can't remember the last time I was LFG for more than 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
For all you people who say you can't land slow till the mob is almost half dead, therefore it has a limiting effect I have to call bulls@*t. If you have Balance of Nihil you can land it more than 60% of the time on first cast with no debuffs in both Riftseekers and Muramite Proving Grounds. We won't even talk about Vxed / tipt / Kod'Taz where any shammy with brains Balance's FIRST then Malos because resists in that zone are a joke. If you have Balance of Nihil the mob should be slowed before it even hit's 90% life the VAST majority of the time, and yes even mitigated to partially successful slow STILL makes a very noticeable impact.<br />
<br />
Can the cutting edge content be done without a shaman? yes it can but with difficulty. However having a Shaman along makes it much easier and makes things go alot smoother. For that reason alone you should be in demand. Also believe it or not people do actually want our buffs these days.<br />
<br />
Shaman are an still a powerful class these days<br />
<br />
I remember when RoK didn't exist, when you were lucky to find a wizard who would be able to port you, when SoL B was the place to xp, when levels where HARD to get, where you pretty much had to RUN everywhere you wanted to go, it was hard to level, and death actually hurt xpwise. All you newbies who started playing post SoL have it so easy it's not funny so **** already.<br />
<br />
I love my Shaman and I wouldn't trade him for any other class in the world.</div></div><hr />

I think you almost hit the crux of it....soe needs to mitigate the spells not the effect.  It would make more sense to mitigate a max %effectiveness of a *spell*.  I.E. A chanter 70% slow with mitigation of 50% would be 35%, a shammy 75% slow would be 37.5%, etc for a particular mob type.<br />
<br />
Do that and you'd end most argument about slows.  Shammies would still have the best, most effective slows, and soe would still be able to tune the encounters based on the assumption that they can tone down the massive effect slow has on encounters.<br />
<br />
I don't think an AA to unmitigate our slows would be wise--that's a step in the wrong direction.  SOE does need to have some control to balance the game, and unmitigating things would just re-break slow in the game.  I really do think they just picked the wrong side of things to mitigate--they approached it from the 'max a mob can be slowed', not 'max spell effectiveness.'<br />
<br />
<br />
I do agree with the comments that they are moving in the right direction with our OOW buffs--they are addressing the issue of keeping us useful as a buff class.<br />

<br />
GET RID OF SHAMAN SLOWS. Period. End of Story. Provide shaman with burst healing or burst dps instead.<br />
<br />
Scaling the slows would be worthless as long as mitigation is still in effect. The difference between a 70% and 75% slow is meaningless-the cleric or druid will be able to handle healing when either is in effect. The difference between a 35% and 37.5% slow is even less meaningful--the cleric or druid will not be able to tell the difference.<br />
<br />
We should be a battle priest. Worst healer, but pretty close to druid and cleric. Best at taking damage, and dealing damage toe to toe. We should be the best melee attack buffer as enchanters are the best caster buffer and clerics are the best defensive buffer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>vincenzovs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">I specifically get invited into groups for slow in OOW.<br />
<br />
In GoD at times I feel so useless due to crappy DPS/crappy heals and very little need for slow.<br />
<br />
Ok sometimes a group will make do with a beastlord/chanter, but if you look at how many HPs the mobs in Proving Grounds/Riftseekers/Wall of Slaughter seem to have compared with the dps of the group the mob is alive for more than 60 seconds (in most groups).<br />
<br />
Most people I group with accept that the shaman is the best slower there is, and with my MD/VP3 combo I can actually crowd control the 2 pulls (if I am fast) too (in some zones -- not in all).<br />
<br />
Personally I don't want EQ to be a game where you absolutely &quot;must have&quot; one class for a spot in the group, while others don't get that luxury (unless they are distinctly &quot;solo&quot; classes).<br />
<br />
The move to having 3 slowing classes is good imho, but now I want to see Cleric heals opened up to more than just clerics, and same for chanter mez (atm only 1 other class has the ability).<br />
<br />
I want forming groups to be easy. <br />
<br />
If clerics are going to remain &quot;special&quot; however then i demand that we remain that way  too.<br />
<br />
Anyway....I'll see you all in WoW when the time comes.</div></div><hr />

People should stop worrying about slow one way or another.<br />

They will *NEVER* change it in our favor ever again.<br />

You made some mother of assumptions about us who have posted on this thread.  I wont do the same to you although I could.  What I will say however is that you seem to have played before RoK expansion - but you did not play a shaman.   <br />
<br />
<br />
We are not whining we are having a debate which gives birth to great ideas.  One good idea is that shaman slows should be above enchanter and bst slows after mitigation.  It also seems popular that they improve our heals.  Thats not whining Sir, thats progression.<br />
