<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slowd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi<br />
<br />
I figure since right now we have a lot on our minds that we would like upgraded for the shaman class why not a bone that could be thrown our way to increase our want and desire in a group.  While we wait!<br />
<br />
My idea:<br />
(Since we are supposes to be the masters of buffs and stat increases.)<br />
<br />
Why not a single buff that increases the two things many classes look for: <br />
Attack and Spell damage.<br />
<br />
We all know how FA and Avatar work.<br />
This would be along the same lines of FA but would last 10 to 15 mins and would up Attack more than any other buff (making ideal to melees) and ups Spell damage like a focus effect (apealing to casters).<br />
<br />
And I don't see why this Attack and spell damage increase buff could not be given to us since we are the masters of buffs.<br />
<br />
They can even call it Spirit Enhancement, Spirit In Tune or Spirit Focus.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?  This would be just for now while they tweak shamans.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No thank you. Nice idea, but I'd rather have changes that will stay with us, not ones that are just &quot;bones&quot; or things that will &quot;be just for now while they tweak us&quot; so they can be taken away once/if we are fixed. It has long been SOE's idea that bandaid fixes are &quot;good enough&quot; ... so long as that artery isn't spurting blood everywhere, all is well. It doesn't matter if blood is still running rivers out from beneath the bandage. No more bandaids, even if they ARE Clifford ones. Give me real, solid changes, please.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ive always thought since shaman are no longer the king of melee buffing that it would be nice for them to give us a bit of caster buffing to compensate.  Something along the lines of the cleric spell haste and the bard spell damage.  Thinking that if they turned the mana press potions in to shaman spells it would be a nice unique change.  And they cant argue it is overpowering because well it already exists in the form of potions...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Budana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I dont think this would be a bad idea at all.  The one big problem I see with it would be havening to keep it up on your complete group.  Maybe I'm lazy but I cant take FA as it is and I really dout that they would make it last long enough to be worth while.  If they make it last 15 mins or more with a short recast I wouldnt mind it abit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hail,<br />

I'd prefer it to be a group 'medicine chant'.  Have it act like Rizlona's Call of Flame &amp; Jonathan's Inspiration combined.  Call it Talisman of the Ikaav or something and PUT IT IN THE SONG WINDOW.  Have it not stack with the bard songs of course, and make it be able to cast only in the same group as the shaman is in.<br />
<br />
Bards might have a cow over it though... :D <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll agree with the one posted crap, though it's pretty innocuous and nothing to get upset about, but as to the other two statements, you should have more accurately translated as, &quot;One didn't say anything I particularly disagreed with, and one response upset me, so what he said should be immediately completely discarded as worthless without even really acknowledging or addressing it at all -- and referring to the poster in an insulting manner is just a freebie that it's always a good idea to throw in whenever possible.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just make FA a group buff that lasts as long as our other group buffs. That we have to cast it every minute to keep it up on the melees is ... simply ... stupid.<br />
<br />
As a group buff, so what if it lands on the wizard and druid also ... how much of an effect is it going to cause in the tide of a battle with them having FA.<br />
<br />
That we are casting it ~every minute (assuming it is kept up on 4/5 melee) does nothing except raise the level of irratation at SOE developer decisions. SOE needs to walk away from this type of silliness and just change the spell for both group and duration.<br />
<br />
Of course, I don't suggest this as a bone that fixes anything ... just something that makes things less mindnumbingly stupid.</div></div><hr />

I like that idea Frekkels.  It appeals to me on both an in-game function level and a role-play level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tragik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ha, spells like FA are a part of the reason I finally gave up EQ (playing it anyway).<br />
<br />
All the suggested changes could simply be rerolled into FA, PA and Avatar.  The buff should be made to have at least the duration of single target haste and a group version would be a boon.<br />
<br />
I'd even settle for a slightly gimped group version that's equal to avatar's stat bonuses.<br />
<br />
Personally, I am becoming extremely sick of SOE answering spell power/balance problems with yet another damn spell.  We have several existing ones that could simply be improved upon and last I checked, I'm still using 8 spell slots.  Reserve new spells for completely new abilities or as serious upgrades, not as a bandage.<br />

Just count the number of Gates spells you currently have and wonder how many years of playing it will take to get you 5 more full levels of spells with current drop rates.<br />
<br />
SOE can crap out spells like there is no tommorow, but if they are still not showing up in regular play, it doesn't really matter what you dig up on Lucy.~</div></div><hr />

I have to say I love this Idea.  It just made me smile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">An interesting idea, but that is no bone, that (particularly spell damage increase) is a new class ability for us that will invite an incredible amount of &quot;we want one too&quot; from every other class in EQ.<br />
<br />
Avatar required a reagent at 60, and the non reagent ones either are ancient or drop in sleeper.  At 65 you finally get a normal non reagent one.  The Avatar line is our attack buff, love it or hate it.  We cannot expect to get a better one thrown to us from the sky that lasts twice as long and ups spell damage as well.  That would be, given the current class model, overpowering.<br />
<br />
I believe it would be better to start small, or, even better, fix the underlying mechanics that are hurting shaman more now than ever before, like the skill cap and &quot;mudflation.&quot;<br />
<br />
A level 30 shaman buddy i've made (after he sent me a tell askin for help, guess he did a /who hehe) was telling me about how he got in a group in OT, and was told by both tanks in the group to stop buffing STR and DEX (str on one and dex on the other, i believe it was) because they were maxed.  Level 30!  Come on now...<br />
<br />
It's not the fact that we don't get good buffs, it's that the buffs that we get no longer DO anything.  The distribution of usefulness among numerical values is awful... compare the usefulness of ATK and AGI.<br />
<br />
And repeating portions of what the manual says our class is will no longer work, as the &quot;Vision&quot; seems to have died with Verant.  The master of buffs is clerics for melee (most HP, as well as included AC), and enchanter for casters (KEI/VoQ, sick mana regen).  Druids strike a nice balance in between (Good amount of HP and decent Mana Regen).  Shaman's main buffs are ... uh... stats (Lower End HP Increase and Included Stats)... but at least it will stack with the core buffs and has a fair HP increase, thank goodness for small favors! =D<br />
<br />
You want to throw me a bone, you give me my winged courier, gosh darnit.  I've been waiting on that one to work since beta!!!<br />
<br />
EDITED P.S. : &quot;SOE can crap out spells like there is no tommorow, but if they are still not showing up in regular play, it doesn't really matter what you dig up on Lucy.&quot;<br />
<br />
THANK YOU!  I hate seeing people saying &quot;Wow, look at these great spells they going to give us in omens!&quot;  <br />
<br />
HELLO, they don't GIVE you anything.  They give you something with a few bells and whistles on it that you have to spend months of work or a ton of cash to yantis (even on FV server, if spells are no drop elsewhere) to attain the spells... and ones that are actually important?  HAH, good luck!  <br />
<br />
I mean, look at the history.  First they were buyable, then dropped off of seb, then off higher end random mobs, then they required PLANAR ingredients, some of which required flagging or cash out the butt to get enough to ensure you get the spells you need, and then finally in gates, they out and out gave spells only to those who are EP or Time equipped... or somehow manage to do Trials as a Shaman in Bazaar gear.<br />
<br />
I don't want them to increase the level cap anymore.  Why?  Because all my stories about how I got my better spells... are horror stories.  <br />
<br />
P.S.S... it should also be noted that implementing something new and unique for a single class is very, very rare these days.  Expect a statistical upgrade to your current 4 or 5 lines of spells with fancier, incredibly longer names.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ha, spells like FA are a part of the reason I finally gave up EQ (playing it anyway). <br />
<br />
Spells like FA?  What about it?  Duration, effect?  If you are talking about how you have to cast it almost continuously/time it, I would almost agree, but have you ever played a bard, or any other class?  Every class has its repetiveness and annoying aspects.  If you are saying you think its repetitive and that is the reason you gave up EQ then you would have given up EQ no matter what since the whole EQ experience is repetitive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">No more short duration spells please, make it an hour minimum.<br />
<br />
I will never see a Gates spell, no one want to take their guilds shaman let alone invite others outside theier guilds. My guild isn't up anywhere near doing gates content so I can write off all of GoD spells.<br />
<br />
Quit whining then and make your own group.  Ive been spending a bunch of time in Ferubi recently (trying to get DM).  The other night I asked in guild for anyone that wanted to join me, 3 other shaman replied (makes 4 with me) and a bunch of others so we did a small raid, got a few nice augments, a couple of really nice trash mob drops AND a copy of Daluda's Mending.<br />
<br />
We had one bard for CC, but Ive been there plenty of times with a root class as the only CC and even poorly equipped paladins/sk can tank there since the retuning.  There is something there for everyone and in a single group, the xps are arent bad, got 3 AAs that night.  Its fun and challenging for a single group, if you want to get comfortable with it though, bring a couple or three.<br />
<br />
I also spent some time farming the fly (sorry, I know its more difficult now) and got a copy of BoN, saw 2 of them drop actually, as well as a couple of the cleric heals and some other class spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Shorter duration extremely useful buffs help us get experience groups. I would like to see base durations of about 30 minutes for at least one of our best buffs in the future. Ferine Avatar is too short and is a nuisance. If it were a group spell and 30 minutes in base duration it would be great. <br />
<br />
One hour plus great 'must have' buffs lead to buff bots. A couple of shaman could then spend their time as buff bots in POK and the rest can retire, unless shaman add significant healing &amp; mitigation or better dps or both to a group. <br />
<br />
IMHO top buffers are in order: 1. Clerics (HP/AC) 2. Enchanters (Mana/Mana Regen/Haste) 3. Druids (HP/Mana Regen) 4. Beastlords (Mana Regen/Attack) 5. Shaman (HP) and 6. Paladins (HP).  As we all know, shaman are near the end of the road now in buffing.  No one ever says I am going to POK before adventure to get FOS, wait for me.<br />
<br />
Personally, I would like to see all priests be able to buff hps/ac about the same for a group, all intelligence casters buff mana pool/regen/haste about the same for a group, and each class have some sort of stackable buff that adds a little to the group or raid so you would like to have every class in on every raid. For pure melee put it in a discipline that helps everyone in raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Clerics Best HP Buff. Best AC buff. Guess what 10 plat and a trip to pok and you have it for 3+ hours. <br />
<br />
Druids Best combonation HP AC Manaregen buff. Same thing.<br />
<br />
Enchanters. Best Mana regen buff. Best haste That will drop middle of the LDoN run. <br />
<br />
Best stat buff. + stackable Hp buff. Except. People are mostly capped on Stats. Or the stats themselves are very very marginally useful. When you parse to see if there is anything different and still have trouble telling.. Well. Guess what it aint something to break the bank over. <br />
<br />
Oh and the Druid you have in the group can give you a str buff that is close. and the Meele BP can get you close in HPS and Give you MR and AC as well. Or hte beastlord that is doing double your DPS and bringing yet more Mana regen can be in the group instead and you will never notice.<br />
<br />
Buffs are conveniance. They do not get you groups in the buff vendor world of PoK.<br />
<br />
If you want a bone I say Get a DoT changed to mana cost per tick. Get healing crit and boost AA added to heal over time spells.  And make All stat buffs in the game (Not just new ones) Have an effect on the attributable combat numbers. Like Strikethrough and such. Just take the Number of the stat increased devide by ten and Make that the Percentage increase.<br />
<br />
Strength increases Damage Bonus.<br />
<br />
Dex increases Strikethrough<br />
<br />
Agil increases Avoidance<br />
<br />
Stamina increases regen<br />
<br />
Charisma increases Chance to get laid or something. <br />
<br />
Want to throw us a bone. Do that. Make those changes and see what happens as people Want the damn Shaman buffs as a meele. <br />
