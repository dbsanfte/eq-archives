<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lo guys, i need some advice. Ive keeled all for pof access, bar saryrn and solro. However, that should at least get me to Po earth, water and air right?<br />
<br />
when i do unlock memories i get the following text: <br />
<br />
for a moment you pauise, sticking a hand in your pocket. Inside you find the small ward that was lying near grummus body, perhaps you should bring this to milyk.<br />
You have received a character flag!<br />
Your heart beat speeds as you recall the warlords flaming axe, behind the dark sockets of his helm you sens darker intentions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Who is Milyk? And what have i missed? anyone got any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks guys</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You need Saryrn to get elementals, and sol ro to get fire</div></div><hr />

I posted this earlier, Mystical Order must be commended for putting together one of the best, most comprehensive Pop flag guides.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Looks very nice, but I see why you only put the cropped version in your sig :)<br />
<br />
edit:  He still doesn't know how shamans hold a spear, though =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">To the best of my knowledge you need everything short of sol ro to get in to the elemental planes other than fire. And then Sol Ro to get into plane of fire.<br />
<br />
As far as your specific issue it sounds like you didn't compleate the flag after your grummus kill. You need to go back and hail the guy outside PoD. He should then recognize you killed grummus and tell you to go visit his brother. Go visit the brother in the sick house and follow the prompts and you should get another flag. You'll then probably need to tell one of the other people in the sick house that you will go to torment and unlock a bunch more flags.</div></div><hr />
