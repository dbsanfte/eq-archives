<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cubman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello brother and sister shaman!<br />
<br />
I have recently inherited a fungi staff from one of my older guild brothers and am wondering how to stack it's regen effects with regrowth.  I had read about it awhile back, but can't seem to recall the trick to actually getting it accomplished.<br />
<br />
Any help would be most appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Step 1:  Cast your regen spell<br />
Step 2:  Cast SoW<br />
Step 3:  Click staff - it will overwrite SoW instead of your regen spell.<br />
<br />
Of course, this means the stacking it will only work outdoors.  You can stack them, then run indoors.   :)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Paerlith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I believe the order of buffs matter.<br />
<br />
In order for fungal regrowth to properly overwrite sow, and not try to overwrite (and not take hold) over regen, SoW must be before regen in your bufflist.<br />
<br />
So,<br />
<br />
1. Cast SoW.<br />
2. Cast Regen spell<br />
3. Click fungi staff.<br />
<br />
fungal regrowth will overwrite sow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>WhiteandBlack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I found the staff's regen to be very short and thus a hastle to use.  Then again, I was 60 pre SoL and didn't need to experiance for AA.  Now that I am starting over with a BST and SHM I would love to have it back;).</div></div><hr />
