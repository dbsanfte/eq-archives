<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im about to ding 39, and want some money for things like a JBB and iksar BP, but also want xp, so was thinking of going to RM.  I was there from 35 to 36 and found that it wasnt worth it to need to be in a nearly full group to get a good rate of killing going.  But now im gonna be 39, new pet, new slow, new poison dot, and was wondering if HG soloing was possible.  I was having trouble with MR on HGs, but they used to be yellow-red, and now i figure that slow/root should stick, if not, malisement always sticked on them.  Should i go there and try to solo one or just get a partner right off the bat.  Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>thorvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Probably be a bit slow killin em yet and would be more viable for you to root dot them than tank as they do hit pretty hard. Never hurts to try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">at 41 I soloed exactly *one* HG.  Fully buffed myself and pet, 100m and health.  He chewed through my pet, started beatin on me, I finally killed him with 1 red bubble left and OOM.  I had to cannibalize to get the mana for my last DoT that finally got him.<br />
<br />
You may have better luck, but it wasn't worth the 30pp I looted.  I'm gonna try again at 44.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I didn't try soloing them until 44, but I can tell you that I can't imagine it being worth the effort before that.  At 44, an add meant a run for the zone.  Even without an add, I would often end at &lt; 50% health and &lt; 50% mana.  Too much downtime.<br />
Now, if you could find a good tank to duo with, it would likely work well before then.<br />
<br />
I did Tundra Yetis in DL from 39 - 44.  Great exp.  Good melee skill work.  Not that great loot.  Then at 44 I went to Rathe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You should be able to handle a HG decently well at 44. I didn't try until then, so I can't say for sure how they would've been at 39, but like the others mentioned, the HGs hit hard. If I were you, I'd wait until 44 to try to solo them. At 44 you get several good upgrades in the spell department and they will make life much easier for you. Incapacitate is a noticeable improvement to Listless Power (may have the name wrong) and Blizzard Blast is almost twice as powerful as Winter's Roar for only 50mana more, although I preferred the dots over the nukes for spell damage. The new pet will be a big help and SLOWS ARE VITAL. At 44, I didn't have any problems with magic resistance from the HGs. You get the occasional resist, but it was very rare. To make a long story short, I would suggest you wait until you are 44 to go to RM and slay giants. If you group, go ahead there now. Even at 44, you may want to consider grouping there. There will probably be less down-time in a group, but depending on your schedule, playing style, etc., soloing may be preferable. I like soloing these days as I play at odd times, so I never know when I'll play or for how long. heehee And when I am ready to run to the bank, I can just get up and go. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I soloed giants in RM as a 43 shaman a few weeks ago.  There is not much danger using root rot followed by self/pet melee for the last half of the giant's miserable life.  Still a fair amount of down time.  You need to be very careful to pull to a place where you will not get adds.<br />
<br />
It seemed to me that the PP drop from HG there had been nerfed if you solo.  I would never get more than 5pp or so out of a solo effort.  Yet when I duo with melee, my split was often 12-20pp.  Maybe designed to discourage solo pp farming, or just bad luck run.<br />
<br />
Best time was 3 hours of partnering with 48 melee, earned 400 pp that session as my split.  That is definately the most efficient way to go here at this level is partner with a higher level melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have found that the drops still vary widely.  I was soloing them this morning on Xegony and I got a couple in the 30pp range and even one with 40pp.<br />
<br />
I'm still there now paying off the rest of my JBB loan.  My kill rate with the JBB has gone through the roof compared to pre-JBB.  I should have the last 5k paid off in no time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">/cheer Tarelan<br />
<br />
LOL -- It's nice to see I'm not the only one who's killing HGs to pay off a loan to get a JBB. I was fortunate enough to have a good friend float me a loan to get one the other day. Like Tarelan noticed, the kill rate has increased dramatically. I am still in RM trying to round up the cash to pay my friend back and at the rate things are going so far, it shouldn't be too long before I get her the money back and then some. This thing has exceeded my expectations. In response to the plat drops when soloing, I go through spurts where you only get 2-5pp and alot of gold, silver, copper, but I get plenty of drops exceeding 30pp with the additional gold/silver/copper, so I don't think the drops have been nerfed for soloers. You just probably had a string of bad luck. Keep killing those giants. Your luck will turn around. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sarita Icestryke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You can kill HGs starting at 34.  I know, that is when I started.  Now, I'm not going to tell you that it is worth it till around 40, but at 34 with dogdog we have the capacity to solo the giant wonders.  At 34 I didn't have great gear or anything, just tactics.  Never be afraid to zone if the fight starts off bad (a couple resists, etc). <br />
<br />
Here is what I did to solo. <br />
1.  Buff and park pet with taunt turned off.  You want him setting off out of the way as you don't want him to come running if you do get hit right away.<br />
2.  Go find a HG and I always started with root.<br />
3.  debuff the HG.  Malise spell (can't remember which one was available at 34.)  you may want to cast your smallest one as they aren't THAT overly resistant and you can't afford the lost mana.<br />
4.  poison, disease if root is still sticking.  <br />
5.  basically go into kite mode until you have enough aggro that you have the aggro.<br />
6.  run by your dog and sick him on the giant.  <br />
7.  canabalize/med all you can as you stay away from the giant and refresh dot's as necessary.  if you need to, root the giant to cast those spells.<br />
8.  I don't care just how well you've done up towards the end, but at some point you will be out of mana and won't have a really good chance to make up enough mana to cast more spells.  This is the point that you have to judge the situation.  If you are still holding aggro, you can continue to let the dog nip away at the HGs heals, otherwise, you will need to go into melee mode.  Having decent melee abilities is crucial as when you finish, odds are you will be out of mana and down to a bubble of health.<br />
<br />
At 34, it took me 10 times before I ever got the hang of this.  Then I was only about 50% until I hit 35.  At 35 the ease went up as did my success rate.  Went to about 75%.  By 40% I might have to zone 1 in 20.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Agendon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i dont think that camping HGs for money is worth it! Not even at 49 when you should solo em easy.<br />
<br />
Just get to 50 get to Sebilis or another High lvl Dungeon and youll get tons of money. Friend made the first time he was at one of those Dungons Stuff that he sold for 7k and got a lvl. Im still 47 so ill need a bit till i can get there.<br />
<br />
If you use your time to lvl you'll have more from it than sitting in Rm and killing HGs imho!<br />
<br />
Agendon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm still getting Ok exp from soloing them at 47.  Some are turning light blue, but most are dark blue still.  I can guarantee though that as soon as I have my loan paid off, I'm getting the heck out of there.  I'm pretty sick of seeing them.<br />
Once I'm out of there, leveling becomes my priority.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">With a JBB and dogdog, canni/regen to keep mana in you, split tanking between you and poor little Jobaber.  I make 350pp an hour constantly.  <br />
<br />
Seb is good, but unless you get a item drop that you win, it's not as good as the HG's<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Like it was atated above,  you can do it but it just takes too damn long and the exp sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I started HGs in Rathe off and on at 39 when I got VoS and a decent pet. Its expensive to do solo so I really try to group or partner with another class if possible.<br />
<br />
My tactic:<br />
<br />
- Summon high conning pet (max hit 35)<br />
- Buff myself and pet <br />
- load 125mana slow, scourge, VoS, EB, root, greater heal<br />
- quickness on pet<br />
- pull with slow<br />
- let pet tank for 10-15 seconds while i stack DoTs<br />
- Reapply VoS when it fades<br />
- finish with EB<br />
<br />
Sometimes I have to root, back up and heal, but most of the time I end up 40% health and 40% mana. Each kill is 1-2 slows depending on resists, 1 scourge, 2 VoS, and 1 EB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">some people camp Gornit in OOT - he's a lone pirate giant spawning on the south shore of the seafury island with a 6 min respawn time. he's about lvl 35 hits for ~85 and doesn't have a lot of hp. normal HG loot, ie lots o' plat and fine steel.<br />
<br />
i highly recommend NOT doing this though....wait until you are 49 then go kill seafuries in general, and if you want, camp Gornit as well. they're great money AND great xp. i'd say i get about 1k in money and cash items per 5 hours or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">/agree Orakul<br />
<br />
When yooz get to 49 yooz can do Gornit &amp; Seafuries.   If yooz have JBB yoo can start at a younger age.<br />
<br />
HG in Rath Mnts are nice cash but on mez server it gets very old dealing with all da droods kiting them.  Da life expectance of HG is very short.<br />

While I was hunting Frost Giants at the GD, one Druid tied up the spawning of new Giants with his quad kiting. Took the creep forever to kill them off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well at 41 I have successfully soloed 4 Hill Giants. They are not that bad, take plenty of mana but with the new pet changes they are even easier. (Can't solo without pet because I'll run out of mana). I pull with Mailsement (very important), then Root, cast Scourge and VoS. Re-root if it breaks (which it usually does) and wait...reapply VoS when it fades, then pet kite until dead. I found a small corner in the zone where roamers are few and far between. Haven't had any close calls except when my Strength faded and I was encumbered he could catch me with SoW, barely. But I had Chloro and Talisman on at all times. <br />
Made 100+ in plat and 170+ gold coins, plus a few FS weapons and HG toes in 4 kills. Destroyed gold though made me encumbered. Being Iksar is the real challenge as I have no where to bank in the &quot;Old World&quot;. But HG's are doable at 41 if played smart.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">39 it was doable but a pain to solo and imo not worth it...I did it about 6 times, some long fights, mainly using pet as a dot, running around with pet on giants heels a few times because i couldn't take the hits, hehe<br />
44 was still a pain, but much easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I have a bit of a dilema, I'm currently soloing HG's in Rathe Mountains for cash and exp (exp kinda sucks but the loot makes up for it). (I'm saving for an Ikky BP) Being an Iksar I can't bank anywhere in the &quot;Old World&quot;. Gonna have to soon as I get encumbered pretty quick. <br />
You can't drop money anymore so, making an Ogre mule to hold my cash and bank it in Ogguk is not an option. And I don't have a second machine so dual comping is not an option either. I'm unguilded also. <br />
The only other thing I could think of is running to S. Karana take the Spires to Luclin, bank in the Bazaar and gate back to Rathe. Can anyone think of something a little quicker I can try ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tear44</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hey, can't you bank in runneye as an evil pc. If you are high enough level and have no faction hits against the gobbos? And if you a killing giants you should be highe enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I can bank in Runnyeye but I'd have to run thru 5 zones to get there. As opposed to 3 if I just took the spires in S. Karana. Much shorter trip I'd say.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 - Whenever you get encumbered from cash, run over to the huts near Lake zone, and buy peridots. With Cha buff, you should be able to buy them for ~10-11pp. Best price you can sell back for later (assuming you pick a merchant with good faction/cha, which you should) is 9.2pp or so. So you lose 10%, but you'll EASILY make that up by not having to do bank runs anywhere near as often.</div></div><hr />

Good advice, IF the merchant will sell to you.  Since stormrazor is a Lizzerd I doubt he will get much more than a 'There's the door!' response from the merchant.</div></div><hr />

Gem merchant in RM sells to my iksar monk. There are some merchants that seem to be indifferent to everyone (beta neutral, im assuming), and he be one of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Tried it this weekend, and the Gnome gem merchant is indifferent to me. So needless to say I have about 65 or so Peridots. Cost me 10pp but I can sell them back to him for 9pp, no big lose considering the time I'm saving from making a bank run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I tried soloing hill giants multiple times and here's how they went basicly:<br />
<br />
Level 35: I had a very hard time killing them. Definitly not worth soloing them at that time. Waaaay too much risk for me :(<br />
<br />
Level 39: I could solo more HG's easier than I could at 35, but not enough to make it worth the time spent.<br />
<br />
Level 44: I just turned level 44 and I'm really surprised at how well I can solo them. I don't even use all my buffs. Just hp, chloro and bear form, summon a good pet and cast alacrity on him. <br />
Run out and pull one with slow, then run to the dog. I'd just melee them down pretty easily, and maybe throw in a VoS if things got bad. And just think, if I had a rune etched icewurm fang, and ceremonial iksar chestplate and JBB (could use soon :( ) I could solo them incredibly easy. Only problem is I'm very very poor right now, lol. And I don't know anyone that could loan me some money on Tholuxe Paells. So I'm going to stay here, probably play late at night so those damn druids and mages would stop killing the giants :( <br />
<br />
lol I tried it today and it started off good(Good=I killed a giant, w00t.) But they only droped a couple plat and a bunch of other coin the first couple times, 40ish plat the third giant. And then there was a long period when there was nothing..Every time I actually found a giant it was getting killed, but then when I find a giant not getting killed,  a giant skeleton aggros on me, so I gotta run back to my dog and med while he opens up a can :(<br />
<br />
Ugh. And then there was the time right after I had a hard time finding them I soloed three in a row, barely any medding time. I really hope this gets easier lol :)<br />
