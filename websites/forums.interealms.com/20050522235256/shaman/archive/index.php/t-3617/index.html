<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How do you pronounce &quot;pwned&quot;?<br />
<br />
At first I thought it'd be PEE OWNED, but I think it could also be POONED. Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I always pronouced it &quot;I am retarded&quot;, but perhaps I confused it with &quot;PST&quot; which has a similar meaning.  It seems to be a bastardized form of 'ownd', 'phat', and 'f*ck'.  As in 'phucking owns'.  It's dumb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lynnara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I believe it's a bastardization of &quot;power owned&quot; ... if someone not only got owned but POWER owned... they got pwned... <br />
<br />
I always read it as &quot;powned&quot;<br />
<br />
Although I have absolutely no clue where the original saying came from in the first place... never made much sense to me...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's pronounced &quot;OWNED&quot;.<br />
<br />
Its just the 'o' key and the 'p' key are close together on the keyboard.<br />
<br />
It's another JeffK-ism.<br />
<br />
OMG yuo are teh winnar!!!!11<br />
<br />
bleh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I always thought it was a joke off of d00dz typing so fast that instead of &quot;owned&quot; they accidently hit the &quot;p&quot; button, so instead it came out &quot;pwned.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ye Gods, I am debating the origins of d00d speak!  Sad . . . :/<br />
<br />
And &quot;pwned&quot; is pronounced: &quot;pudding&quot; ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">:)  &quot;I'm l33t leik Jeffk.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I use pwned alot in place of owned!  Really, I just did it in mockery of d00d speak, but now its become a habit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">j00 4|23 4|_|_ |&gt;|-|33|2 |)4 |_33-|-/\/355!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah, it's a rip of &quot;owned.&quot; If I remember right it started way back as a Quake thing. A nice young man named Fargo (who at the time ran PlanetQuake.com) pimped it for a while. I always figured it was &quot;pweened.&quot; More often than not I end up hitting &quot;pwnt&quot; instead. Bad habit I guess.<br />
<br />
And FYI, the REALLY r33t people say &quot;r33t&quot; instead of &quot;l33t&quot; because if you're that good you're Korean (because they damn near win everything) and can't pronounce your L's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As an avid CS player, i can assure you thats its merely a typo gone primetime.  <br />
<br />
Other examples would be liek and teh, both of which are often found in your average IRC chatroom.  <br />
<br />
Pwned its pronounce powned.  Basicly owned, only w/ a p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaytan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I always pronounced it &quot;powned&quot; like owned with a p as in pie vs the noun &quot;I&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes it was fargo who started the pwned thing which came from a match against lowtax  at planetquake HQ where he would hit the p instead of the o in the mad rush for tauntage.<br />
It was decided that it was to be pronounced pweened.<br />
Of course the people using pwned have no idea of this and are simple hip cool sexy or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">When we're taking the piss my friends and I usually pronounce it &quot;prawned&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Haha, &quot;I prawned the AOW&quot; :) Amusing image.<br />
<br />
The uber guild on my server is called Blades of Wrath, or BOW. They talk about &quot;bowning&quot; mobs - which is probably as sad, but at least it's a little witty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Heh, we're got a few unique sayings as a guild, many of which have come from typos. I'd link to a thread of them but its rather sweary :)</div></div><hr />
