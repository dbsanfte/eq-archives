<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Greldon Silverhand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We're a euro based guild on Kane Bayle server, on the last push towards elemental planes. We raid everyday, and we have a blast doing it. We are the only guild that clears vex thal, and we farm it uncontested weekly, aswell as luclin/POP mobs. Due to the extremely low population on kane bayle, we are forced to base most of our recruitment on server xfers.<br />
<br />
Kane bayle is very underpopulated, hence there is much to do for those who play here. We are currently considering players of any class, and actively seeking clerics, a warrior, 2-3 wizards, and 2-3 shamans. VT key is a bonus, and the more flags/aa you have the better.<br />
<br />
For those who might be interested, our website is at www.kane-bayle.com and my email is salvatore.cognetti@fastwebnet.it - Feel free to email me or throw a tell to kane.greldon for more info. If your application is accepted, we will make a solid effort to gear you back up.<br />
<br />
For those who are NOT interested, my apologies for this post. It is not meant to spam your (and other boards) forums with useless info, but rather to give an opportunity to someone who might take advantage from it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Man, what's up with all the KB recruiting lately?  You guys have like the cyber equivalent of the Black Plague or something? (Shadowbane?)<br />
<br />
Guilds are great, I guess one reason I never did as much in EQ (Litgruvs &quot;Frustrated Powergamer&quot;) was I always adhered to Groucho Marx's dogman:<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't join any club that would have me as a member.&quot;<br />
<br />
Good luck to ya tho :)</div></div><hr />
