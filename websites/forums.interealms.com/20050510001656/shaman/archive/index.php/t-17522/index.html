<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not another best class post, just wondering: I am debating which combo to go with, as I have the ability to run both, but am not sure if I want to keep running 3 accounts. I am thinking of either leveling up my mage and 2boxing with him for aa / farming, or keeping the third account and leveling up my cleric / warrior to do the same stuff with the shammy. <br />
<br />
My problem is I like hunting both ways, but I want to focus on one or the other so I can get them to 65 and guilded with my shaman main. Just wondering if anyone has any experience with a team like this, and what they have been able to do, not able to do at higher levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">65 Shaman + 65 Mage = damned near unstoppable.<br />
<br />
65 Shaman + 65 Warrior + 65 Cleric = nowhere near as fast kills, but more stayability than a Mage.<br />
<br />
65 Shaman + 65 mage + 65 Cleric = the win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I play a 65 shaman, and have a shadowknight on a 2nd box I'm leveling. <br />
<br />
My fiance` is moving in with me soon and setting up her 2 computers with her 65 mage and 65 cleric.<br />
<br />
Between the 4 accounts, I'm curious what we can accomplish - especially once the SK gets 65 and a few AAs ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">personally, I'd go shm war cleric. You could theoretically do most pop 1 groupable named with that combo - while with a mage you would be limited to exp mobs - if that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Reysa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I duo a shaman and mage (see sig). If the shaman can slow it, I'm confident I can handle anything that hits for less than 600. I haven't tried anything that hits for more. The mage has the pet cleric AAs and I usually have both pets active, fully equipped. (That is, I'm not chaining mage pets.)<br />
<br />
In theory, BoT ought to be an excellent zone for this duo. In practice, I spend more time looking for rez's than killing stuff. I'm fairly sure that is due to my personal limitations, and not indicative of what another might accomplish.</div></div><hr />
