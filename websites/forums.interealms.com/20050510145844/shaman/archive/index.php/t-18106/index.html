<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was on an LDoN in MM today (which seemed to be rather buggy in a few respects ex :- Fot7 wearing off halfway through).<br />
Anyway Bards pulling and says &quot;FA down&quot; so stick FA on him just as hes running by me with mob on his tail.<br />
Mob then turns round and whacks me a few times till Pally pulls him off me.<br />
Thought this was strange as never got aggro off of FA before.<br />
So we tried it again and same thing happened.<br />
Not had FA for long so dont know if this should happen.<br />
Always thought buffs didnt attract aggro ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If bard is pulling, most of the time you only have to fart in the general direction of the mob to get agro.<br />
<br />
This was the main complaint of swarm kiting, and the ensuing death mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">try standing behind the Pally. Bard was probably Aggro pulling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Casting anything on someone pulling is asking for agro. It doesn't matter if it is a heal, or a buff. MGB'ing while a puller is splitting can be annoying if they are in range of the MGB. It doesn't take much to get the attention of a mob that has something like proximity agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I group regularly with a bard and apparently pulling with occlusion is one of the easier things, and it adds so little aggro that you &quot;only have to fart in the general direction of the mob to get agro.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Focus draws a lot of attention, too, when proximity aggro or occlusion is being used for pulling.  Or when the arrow misses, lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Getting shrink aggro was always my favorite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Getting shrink aggro was always my favorite.<br />
<br />
LOL yes!  Nothing like hitting umbra orb after a rez and getting pasted to the floor, after a gindan flayer split.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Canni4 aggro is my personal favorite.  Particularly when I'm cann'ing next to the mob, haven't done anything to it OR any group members, and he slaps me, interrupting my cast.<br />
<br />
So... you're hitting me to keep me from hurting myself.  *shakes head*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mohadeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The reason you got agro was because you just casted a spell on him while pulling.  Just like a monk when he is not FDed and you heal him.. that will bring the agro to you.  So it could of been any spell and you/bard would of gotten agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Also as far as the mob is concerned his aggro list is bard then a looong way away is shaman (but shm next in line cause he cast avatar).. then the bard faded and only person on his list was you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Actually I have seen something similar to this a few times over ~100 odd adventures I have done......most of the time its when I am grouped with several melee types and a I am the one providing haste....I also tend to group with quite a few clerics that like to melee so I use group haste to save time (I HATE single target buffs)...<br />
Anyway, there have been a few times that I cast Tal of Alacrity during an inc pull and its landed on the melees just as the mob engages, and boom I am getting beat on. I have also seen this with tells of Stamina dispelled, need Agility plz etc and when I comply, bam I get wacked on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">it's very simple;<br />
<br />
If you cast a Beneficial spell on a person on a monsters hate list that generates some hate.  If you cast a group buff, that's helping 6 people on the monsters hate list and generates 6 ammounts of hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Actually, I thought of this thread in an adventure last weekend.  Mob was already to us, and had been engaged a couple of seconds when I got slapped upside the head for FA'ing the MT.  I'm starting to get the feeling that aggro is being tweaked.</div></div><hr />

I am not sure how long you been around, but I have been landing buffs on tanks with INC mobs for 3 years and have never been pounded on. Heck I landed haste on tanks in TOV, Avatar on a tank just as he engaged Vindi and never got any aggro....lucky? maybe..... aggro being tweaked in light of the new melee abilites? more likely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Best LDoN aggro was in beta. Dunno if it's still in (it scared me so bad I would never do it...)<br />
<br />
Basting torrent / tears, and getting a damage hit for every mob in the dungeon. And it wasn't a text glitch. Imagine the ever so fun results.</div></div><hr />
