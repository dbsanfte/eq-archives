<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently joined a guild from the shattered remnants of a few old school guilds...<br />
<br />
My question....<br />
<br />
We are all 55+ about 25 online at a time and 45 members.<br />
<br />
What would you see as our raid progression... I.e.... where should we be raiding?<br />
<br />
57th level shaman...<br />
Why do I never see any 57th level shaman... its a pain.... but am I the only one that has problems with level 57....<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help... I feel like a newb again... all new guild....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hit up Kael if it is stull upgrades for you all.  If not then carefully start into Halls of Testing (East ToV).<br />
<br />
  Get PoV/PoS flagged, then work on BoT keys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Exp is reasonly still attainable up to 61 in the PoN/PoD/PoI areas.  Once you are past that, you should get as many people as possible into PoV/PoS area.  Once there, BoT keys should be a good priority cause BoT will give those people that advance a bit quicker than others a chance to get some decent drops, with the named popping every 8 hours or so, and with spectrals and sometimes runes also coming from those as well.  BoT also is about the best exp outside of PoTactics Pit area/Elementals.  <br />
<br />
Once your guild has some HoT gear, you can move on to other areas such as the other ends of ToV including WToV/NToV.<br />
<br />
I have never personally fought in those areas, nor do I have a VP/ST key so I do not know where to go from there or the difficulty of the mobs.  But, I know that once you finish with ST, you can move on to Ssra...but I would suggest having a good percentage of those people in your guild around level 65.  Although not required, it will make things a lot easier.<br />
<br />
Also, I would not personally group with anyone in PoV/PoS under level 60.  And not anyone in BoT under level 62 or so.  Reasons is because although they may be the best twinked person on the server, I have met too many people that are in way over their head and got there cause of some friends, whether or not they deserved it.  This will become apparent also when you get to BoT.  The mobs there start hitting you alot harder and unless you like to get trained every two min, you will want some people that know how to play a bit.  Also, be careful in BoT cause it is really now known as KC v2.0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What we did:<br />
<br />
Kael Arena/plate cycle<br />
<br />
HoT (Halls of Testing in Temple of Veeshan)<br />
<br />
West Temple of Veeshan to get Kael armor<br />
<br />
North Temple of Veeshan to get lots of good stuff.  <br />
<br />
You'll want average level 60 before you get this far.<br />
<br />
At this point you should be capable of doing Sontalak, Lendinaria and other first broods, so as soon as you can, start killing these guys for the Sleepers' Tomb key pieces.  Gear up your melee with the Avatar-proccing weapons.<br />
<br />
The old-school path from here was Ssra temple and Vex Thal in Luclin.   This is a huge timesink and will be a major investment if you go there.<br />
<br />
The POP path is an alternate path that overlaps with TOV and Ssra/VT - killing Aerin'Dar, Xanamech, doing the PoN maze, minibosses in PoI/PoN/BoT, etc.  We kind of did these out of order so I can't give much advice there.</div></div><hr />
