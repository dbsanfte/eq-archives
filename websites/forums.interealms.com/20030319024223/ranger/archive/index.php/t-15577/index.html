<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Celadreal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just started a new char on Sullon Zek  to play on a more interesting server. However there is something that didnt really come through as the big problem it is, random pk'ing. I knew there would be these people on the pvp server but i didnt think there were this many. Now im just looking for some advice on precautions i can take to avoid, not necessarily evil people just the kind of people who would kill you when you are 25 lvls lower than them for fun. I am not a fan of getting twinked so i know this will be a trying time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>tocsin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Cela, I feel your pain. I just recently moved over to Sullon Zek too after two years on a blue server and boy what an experience....or wake-up call might be a better way of putting it. But I must say, even with the pkers i have had more fun in the past month on SZ than in the previous two years combined. The reason----because it's such a challenge! I truly feel that this is the way EQ world was meant to be. On the blue servers dark elves and wood elves unite for the good of the group and all is well with the world. Heck, they even marry. But aren't the two races bitter enemys? They are in the world of SZ. When I go out in the woods I freeze when i meet a passer by! If it's a Dark Elf I either hide, run, or attack instantly and without thought! The very site of a Dark Elf, or Ogre, or Troll makes me wary. They arent my buddies as is the case with the blue servers. On the blue servers peeps dread taking on caster npcs. On SZ it is a constant happening---and the casters in PVP are better at it! Recently Kelethin fell under seige of some DE pkers. They were all over the lifts and trying to move into the city. Crushbone was a blood bath of littered bodies--yes mine was one of em--but in the end the goods won the day. They outnumbered and ran off the evils. I guess the point is, don't get discouraged, have fun and try to outsmart em. I love it when I train a pker or am able to escape. Yes, it is intense, but what a blast it is. And whenever you need a break from the heat, do like I do and go back to the blue server where you can relax and unwind. Just have fun and laugh a little. Personally, I never knew there were so many ways I could die...hehe. But in the end, stay the course and you will have your day!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A &quot;more interesting&quot; server, eh?  Yes, it certainly is that... I would argue that random PKing (AKA &quot;ganking&quot;) is the rule, more than the fun kind of fights against even /cons that you'd expect.<br />
<br />
Let's see what we can do to make you a bit more survivable until you get EQ and AM3. (Hah, like I'll ever make it that far...)<br />
<br />
1) Know your guilds and the most frequent gankers.  This comes with time, of course, but you can get a head start by looking at the  Sullon Zek Scoreboard. (http://everquest.station.sony.com/stats/sz_summary.jsp)  It has the daily points leaders, and guilds - and their alignments.  Know your friends, too - now that you're hitting your 20s, you should think about getting in a good Good guild.  I'd recommend mine (Wolves of Retribution) but we're still kind of small, sort of starting over after some folks decided to stay behind while the rest of the guild merged with another.  Black Crown and Black Prophecy are two of the larger, raiding guilds; Sanctus Lumen accepts good-quality lower-level folk, I hear.  Flowers of Happiness is just a strange outfit.  Don't know much about Fatalus Invictus, but see a lot of them.  Oh, yeah, and Legendary Warlords is another Good guild that seems to have attracted a lot of folks lately.<br />
<br />
2) Know when those folk are in the zone. Do a /who every couple of minutes, if not more.  I just do a '/' without even thinking about it.  Remember the 'hiccup' - that weird little hitch when you're running or fighting, that means that someone just entered the zone.  Newest folk will be at the top of the list. <br />
<br />
Remember that there's a bug that will let you know someone's guildstatus, even if they're anon and too far away to target.  Just do /guildst Aethien, and it will tell you if they're in a guild, etc. <br />
<br />
3) Know which zones tend not to be frequented by PKers.  This may have changed with PoP - for example, I've been in Everfrost since just after it was released.  It used to be deserted, with only rare PKers.  With time, as more and more people get PoP, more and more PKers have started coming to the zone.  Steamfont is nice and empty, a lot of times, despite the Druid ring there; Lesser Fay, too. I'll let you know about Stonebrunt in a couple of days... Playing at odd times helps, too.  Parts of Luclin are still probably pretty abandoned.<br />
<br />
4) Try to play as much as possible in 3rd person view.  I rarely move too far through a zone in 1st person, except for city zones. I go to one of the views where you can pan around - hit autorun through the Karanas, for example, go to 3rd person view, elevate the camera, and pan around with ALT + cursor arrows. (Or is is CTRL?  Dang, I can never remember; my fingers just go to those keys automatically.)  This will at least give you warning, along with Track, of PKers around you.<br />
<br />
Use that view while fighting, too.  Lots of folks like to sneak up on you while you're occupied and down on health. <br />
<br />
5) Depending on how much time you think you'll be spending before hitting 39, get a See Invis item.  Of course, depends how much plat you have, too; cheapest one I've seen in the Bazaar is Majdd's Choker for something like 1500, I think.  Or, just beg it off of passing casters, I suppose (along with SoW, of course).<br />
<br />
6) Keep checking /who.<br />
<br />
7) Don't turn off /shout, /ooc, etc. - most warnings of PKers will be in OOC, I have found.  The annoying chatter in GFay makes me want to pull my ears off, but it's a tradeoff for learning when and where the PKers are hanging out.<br />
<br />
8) Let's see... Remember to Hide often and Camo yourself.  Most folks will have a See Invis item or spell, but not all do, and it can save you every once in a while. I camo'd myself to run through Freeport while doing the Trueshot quest - I zoned into NFP, and there's a Troll sitting there... who evidently didn't have See Invis, as I ran right by her.  Remember the /target &lt;self&gt; trick to see if Hide was successful.<br />
<br />
9) Check /who again.<br />
<br />
10) Hate to say it, but don't be shy about starting an alt if you find that you hunt at popular spots in popular times for PKers.  Of course, this will slow you down in your quest to get EQ and AM3...<br />
<br />
Don't know if this is what you were looking for, but there ya go. Have to run. Drop me a tell if you see me online.<br />
<br />
Edit: Just thought of another one; it's probably obvious, but, hey.  If you're soloing, med and heal up after fighting in out of the way places. In Steamfont, I would always go up this one hill and hide behind a tree. Keep in mind that on the Evil team, only Bards will have track - and that only after 30th level, right?  Neut Druids and Rangers will, of course, but at least you can minimize the number of people who can find you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ginzu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aethien has some good advice.  The only thing he left out was to just avoid them.<br />
<br />
Plenty of zones to level up in that are relatively gank free.  Problem is the zones that have the POP book access.  Or ones near other popular zones.  Those zones are easy for the gankers to get in and out of quickly.<br />
<br />
Go a little out of your way to find obscure xp spots, and you'll have a much more enjoyable levelling experience.<br />
<br />
I also play on sullon zek =)  and am a Tunare worshipping ranger.<br />
<br />
If you'd like some zone advice for levelling up on sullon zek, send me a tell.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hey, Ginzu - I think I saw you in &lt;some deserted zone&gt; last night, didn't I?  Good to know you're on my side... Folks that are too far away to /con and aren't in a guild bug me!<br />
<br />
And yes, avoiding people is the best strategy if you're in the gankable levels. Don't think you're ever &quot;ungankable,&quot; unfortunately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tancred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just though id say hi to the sullon crowd, I am Tancred lvl 59 ranger on sullon zek, the best server on EQ :p  anyway, keep it u guys, it can be hard at times but just stick with it. You will learn very fast hwo to play and what to do. It all boils down to knowledge, of your class, of other classes, zones, and the people behuind the charachter. In time you will know all this and more. Oh and one more thing GO GO GOOD TEAM !<br />

<br />
Odd that a Junior Ranger should bonk you, but there you go.  Welcome - I've seen you on /who a few times. Thanks for the encouragement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My, my, ... now the goodies are handing out pk advice! :p<br />
<br />
I wanted to clarify a few terms:<br />
<br />
gank ... To suddenly attack an opponent in a decisive manner, where the opponent is ALREADY engaged and weakened by another mob or player.<br />
<br />
cc ... Corpse Camped ... Your corpse is being monitored by one or more opponents who refuse to offer LnS.<br />
<br />
LnS ... Loot and Scoot ... The act of recovering your corpse and leaving the contested zone.<br />
<br />
griefing ... The act of continuously pk'n an opponent until they log or leave the contested zone.<br />
<br />
And I have three pieces of advice for you:<br />
<br />
Play two EQ characters as described in the above post.  SZ can be extremely frustrating at times.<br />
<br />
Don't ignore the skill aspect of pk'n, if you want to be a better pk'r then practice pk'n. <br />
<br />
Reroll a newt ranger, we're better anyway!   :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zelgadis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don't like Sullon Zek.  Reason being there's already a Zelgadis on the server, and they bugged the name Chamzel upon my creating it (It was created, but poofed through name filter check).  I can't log in anywhere without one of those names.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tuvan Truearrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You still playing on Sullon, Tancred?<br />

I gave up.  Everyone levelled to fast for me, and I picked a gimp class.  Shoulda been a Rainja.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yep, I saw Tancred the other night, in fact.  Didn't recognize you as being from the Glade, however; would have said hello, otherwise.  <br />
<br />
But yes, folks do level fast there and leave you behind if you're not careful.  Even if you are a Ranger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Admire Tipt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hail Hail!!!<br />
<br />
Yesh, I do notice that there have been a bunch of ganking going on recently with the release of PoP, and I gotta tell you, it gets downright annoying.<br />
<br />
First of all, I'm from the Vale and that little book that's outside and to the left of the entrance can literally be spammed with corpses and cause a great deal of lag, which in all cases, just press /hidecorpse all (or just /hidec all    for short)<br />
<br />
Again, as mentioned above, not everyone has see invis, so HIDE CAMO HIDE CAMO... Nothing beats getting out of a particularly fatal situation with just a simple skill. <br />
<br />
Oh, and track?? omg knp sire aye thanx for teh BEST SKILL EVAR. Track is god in pvp. Some fool feels like making a run for it when you're blinded or rooted? Track his arse down!!!<br />
<br />
The bow is also very helpful particularly with AM3 + EQ, but lets not go there. In the lower lvls, most tiny hits could interrupt a caster, so for those lowbies out there, there you go, get a decent ranged bow and viola! You got yourself some cast interruption, at least for a while.. Then when you hit 20 or so, the casters get harder to interrupt imho.. much harder.<br />
<br />
Oh and one thing, don't forget to practice Conjuration when you get Dance of the fireflies, the DoT's you get at a higer lvl (i.e. Stinging Swarm line) use this skill, my friend made that mistake, and he paid for it dearly with a bunch of these messages &quot;Your spell fizzles!&quot;<br />
<br />
But don't be ashamed of avoiding PvP, after all what chance does a 20 or so ranger have against a 65 necro? NONE. But when you see that uncommon even con, GO FOR IT. The only way to get better is through practice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">First, /bonk!  Welcome to the friendliest PvP discussion this side of.... well, almost everything. <br />
<br />
Conjuration skill is a definite 'aye' - and keep going at it until it gets maxed.  I thought, sure, I'll get to 70 or so, that should be fine.  Nope - many fizzles, still.<br />
<br />
When you hit your 30s, you do stand a chance of at least surviving many encounters. Earlier if you're a caster, with Gate.  Some neut Druid was in Crushbone the other night, and thought he could melee me because I was green.  Oops, wrong answer. I'm still standing.  He had me snared, so I would have died eventually to a DoT or something, but even higher levels came along and chased him from the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>sz_howlur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hey Celadreal, welcome to SZ.  Best answer I could give you would be to read these two sites and understand that when you play a red server, this is what you're up against.<br />
<br />
pvp 101: http://www.geocities.com/neferaza/pvp101.html<br />
pvp 102: http://www.geocities.com/neferaza/pvp102.html<br />
<br />
Other than that, all I can tell you is to stick with it and level up.  It can be rough at times, but it gets much much better as you get higher levels.  Join a lower level guild like some of the other guys here have suggested.  Scrounge and save your money so you can get some resist gear (magic resist &gt; 150!).  Just keep at it</div></div><hr />
