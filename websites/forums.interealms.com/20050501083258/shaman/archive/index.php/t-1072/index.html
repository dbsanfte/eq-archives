<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was hanging around in Trak's teeth last week with my 46 Shaman, a 50 Ranger, a 53 Wizard, and a 55 Magician, doing the Forager cycle for a couple hours.  We had pretty bad luck getting named to pop, but we did get a &quot;hangman's noose&quot;, which we of course defaulted to the ranger.  The ranger already had a swiftclaw sash, which I currently have on loan until I can hand it off to the ranger's rogue alt.<br />
<br />
So, I gave up the 8 ac I had on my belt slot (yes, I have crappy gear) for the 2 ac + haste on the sash.<br />
<br />
I swing my hammer more frequently, which should up my somewhat dubious melee damage a bit when I'm tanking for the dog (or at full mana when fighting red mobs in a group).  Seems like when soloing, a haste item makes some sense.  if you're gonna fight the mob anyhow, why not do 20 percent more melee damage?  <br />
<br />
But when I see these &quot;AC vs WIS vs HP vs REGEN vs resists vs whatever&quot; debates, I rarely see haste items listed.  <br />
<br />
So, to make a very long question short, in situations when you are actually meleeing, where do you put a haste item in the AC/WIS/HP/etc hierarchy?<br />
<br />
I'm hoping for something akin to the formulae people have posted for the other stats.  Something like:<br />
<br />
5AC = 1 WIS = 10HP = 4MANA = 5% HASTE = ....<br />
<br />
You get the idea, though I'm sure my numbers are completely wrong (they were intended as illustration, rather than my actual opinion of value)<br />
<br />
Thanks for your insights!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know I have never melee'd enough to justify using a haste belt for haste alone all the time.   <br />
<br />
Since I was level 55 or so, I carried an FBSS in my bag for when I felt like swinging at things, but I never wore it when I wasn't meleeing.  I have to be pretty bored in an exp group to get in and melee and practice weapon skills.  <br />
<br />
Currently I wear a spider fur belt for the hps, or <br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics15/silverybeltofcontention.jpg<br />
<br />
That belt has decent stats and haste.  I vote you get one of those!   They drop in Kael off random mobs.  It's 21% haste, same as FBSS.  It is rare though.<br />
<br />
I think it would be hard to put it into a heirarchy as everyone has different equipment goals.  My equipment goals revolve around   HPs.   I can't even say I have a definitive &quot;&gt;&quot; type scale for evaluating my own gear.<br />
<br />
Trying to keep unbuffed AC over 1000, while maximizing HPs and STA.  I can honestly tell you haste fits at about the same level as other &quot;unimportant&quot; stats such as dex for me.<br />
<br />
Yeah, so in conclusion to my rambling.  If you have a crappy belt and can get a better belt that happens to have haste, then go for it.  Does your 6ac drop push you below a 50/100ac threshold?  If not probably not a huge deal.  If you have fun swinging your hammer, go for it.<br />
<br />
Some other reasonable belts you could look into would be the Spider Fur Belt, ac/hp or Smiters Girdle, lotsa stats.<br />

<br />
To answer the question asked, no, switching to haste belt does not bring me below a 50/100 point AC boundary.  Self buffed, AC is generally hovering at around 860 or so with the haste belt, 870 with my old ac8 belt.</div></div><hr />

20 percent haste does not equal a 20 percent increase in damage</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Why not?  Seems like if you swing 20 percent more often at the same success rate, your damage will on average be 20 percent higher.  Does 20 percent haste not make you swing 20 percent more often?<br />
<br />
 The various haste belts people are wearing is interesting, but I'm really more interested in people's opinions of what's worth giving up (ac, hp, wis, etc) in order to wear one.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

31% haste and thus supirior to a RBG:<br />

Somewhat weak AC but the stats and haste more than make up for it.  Drops in Chardok Bank area.<br />

Shissar Arcanist Sash, 36% haste. I got one, its probably the nicest piece of gear I have next to my epic. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">How nice an item like FBSS all depends on lvl and how you play your shaman.  I wore an FBSS from lvl 1 to 46 when I started blasting with the JBB.  The only time I took it off is when I was grouping.  Now the FBSS is on lone to a rogue friend and will remain so untill he gets somthing better.<br />
<br />
I found that the FBSS was a great item for lvling up and provided a noticible improvement in damage output and because fights where shorter I took less damage and had less down time.  The haste effect was only 21% but the overall impact on exp grinding was somewhat larger becuase of the redued down time.<br />

For me  lvl 1 to JBB<br />

<br />
In two sessions in Trak's Teeth, we've had the hangman pop twice.  Hangman's noose is no drop, so if you get it, by definition it would be free.  Chances are, all the melees you'll have with you will already have better.   Even the low level SK I had with me last night already had SCHW and didn't want hangman's noose, so it defaulted to me.  <br />
<br />
Another questable haste item is Swiftclaw Sash.  Just have to get a tracker to help you kill stuff for a few days in Stonebrunt.<br />
