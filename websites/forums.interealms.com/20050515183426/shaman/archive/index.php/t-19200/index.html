<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sowfor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering what people thought of Innate Defense. Is it worth doing? What sort of percentage does it give?<br />
<br />
I have CA3, LR5 and CS3 and am just wondering if its really worth throwing 15 aa's into ID5. At the moment theres others I see as more useful.<br />
<br />
Help me obiwan!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I got it basically because it was one of the last AAs to get. When stuff is hitting you for 500+ 10% off that or whatever doesn't mean a whole lot. Every little thing helps I guess but don't expect it to make you able to tank Gods or anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's well worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/agree Shinerbokk....definitely well worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I haven't picked it up yet (only ~170 aa) but it will be the next thing I get after I finish my healing AA's.<br />
<br />
I found LR5 to be well worth it and while I think this helps less than LR it's still better than anything else I have to get yet. Really depends on where you are in AA progression.<br />

When your slow is resisted in that crappy pick up group and the cleric seems to have nfc you exist - you will be thanking your AAs when you see the mob<br />

It's great :D  I did notice a difference once I had it maxxed out - a LOT fewer max hits, and I dunno if it's just me, but I seem to get pushed less as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Working on it now at about 170 aa, I haven't noticed anything huge like LR5 does, but when I get the last 2 levels I'll hopefully see a little more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From this (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2259) thread:<br />
<br />
 going from ID0 to ID5 (on Valorian Guards in HoH) will net you an average 15hp/hit mitigation - which is roughly 15/2.87 = 5.2% decrease in damage taken. Given the linearity of ID cost, I'd wager a round of beer that it's intended to give you ~1% of damage per skill level (or ~4% for an increase from DI1 to DI5, for comparison).<br />
<br />
Going from LR1 to LR5 will increase your avoidance by 3%, from 32% misses to 35% misses. Miss+Hit at LR1 is 85.6% of the swings, while Miss+Hit at LR5 is 85.8% of swings. 32% of 85.6% is 37.4% of damage avoided while 35% of 85.8% is 40.8% of damage avoided - or about a 4%-point increase in damage avoided.<br />
<br />
From this little test, I would hypothesise that ID and LR are about the same efficiency in reducing total damage taken - however, LR will make you get hit less which can affect any innate proc related additional damage/stuns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Understand that Combat Stability does NOT reduce the amount of damage taken directly by X%.  If a mob hits for 900 max, you can still by hit for 900 whether you have no CS or max CS/ID.  What CS/ID does  is it allows for more minimum hits and less maximum hits (according to my understanding of this  (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?threadid=5224)  Steel Warrior post).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yup, that is right.  Mitigation shifts hit distribution towards lower hits, while higher attack shifts hit distribution towards higher hits.  Formula for hits is DB + (n * DI), DB being damage bonus(in this case being a base damage), DI is Damage interval, and n is a random number between 1 and 20.  All mobs have a set DB and DI, an example being Vindi, who has a DB of 200, and a DI of 25, resulting in a min hit if 200 + (1 * 25) = 225 and a max hit of 200 + (20 * 25) = 700.  These numbers do not change(outside of shielding mods and warrior innate mitigation bonus), only the distribution of the hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">From what I've heard (as I haven't gotten around to getting CS or ID yet)  ID is more useful for exp groups rather than raids.  If you're getting hit by some boss that hits for 1800 getting hit for a bit less on average won't help you stay alive.  Just looking at your magelo (not sure if your AA's on there are up to date) I would say that scm3 (unless you never ever have mana problems) would be a good thing to pick up next.  I'd also recommend the healing AA's as with both ahg and aha maxed our heals become somewhat decent (especially if you raid a lot these are good to have, or if you end up being main healer in a lot of groups).  If you, on the other hand, exp mostly and never have mana problems during exp groups but do pull a lot of aggro then I'd recommend getting ID next.  Just really depends on your playstyle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was working for SCM3 but ended up getting Channeling Focus while on a plane of water raid - that place sucks btw.<br />
<br />
Looks like I'm gonna finish of SCM then go for ID.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I like ID more than LR because it's more fun to get quadded for min dmg than missed once and hit for full 3 times :/</div></div><hr />
