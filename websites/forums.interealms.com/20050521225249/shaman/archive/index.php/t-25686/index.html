Xegony is fun, on our last kill our warrior practically soloed her to 30% :/. Coirnav is mainly about luck, gear plays its part but not so much. <br />
<br />
Btw, I also got my TA, 5th Saryrn kill and our first one dropped, yay!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Congratulations to you!  Our guild is nearing entering Time also.  TRC down twice, not too bad once you understand how the whole encounter works.  Xegony down twice, same as TRC, once you understand how the encounter goes, it's fairly easy.  Fennin is just gimp.  Our last obstacle - Coirnav. Our last attempt we got him down to 38% then ran out of time and got escorted out *cry*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mixelplux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Be prepared to go week after week of waiting on your particular drop. All of our shamans have TA's, but 22+ weeks of no DBoW and we had a stretch of 24 weeks with no Songblade. The oh so random randomness can be quite vexing at times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">We had 1 DBoW in our first clearing then 2 off RZ in the second</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Grats on the kill. I remember working our way there. Rathe corniav, xegony are all hard to compare because they are all different fights.<br />
<br />
Rathe was a pain just because you needed so much healing and so many tanks and at the time that was a challenge. On the bright side we could camp there and try every night and sometimes even get multiple tries in one night to work on strats. Going back to do it now would probably be a joke. I think this event is the most gear sensitive of the 3 because of all the split tanking and healing needed.<br />
<br />
Corniav on the other hand was a royal pain for us because a euro guild was working on him around the same time and it was really hard for us to even get a shot at him.<br />
<br />
Quickened curing for Rathe is definitely handy.<br />
<br />
Tordail Farstryder I'd be impressed if your guild can manage that. 6 weeks is a pretty good pace for learning those 3 encounters. Altho alot of it is dependant on competition for the mobs.<br />
<br />
As far as specific drops goes it's pretty random. There are 12 drops on each of the gods so the odds of any specific one are pretty low. We saw 1 DB on our second or third clear and then didn't see anymore for several months till we just rescently got 1 more each of last 2 kills. Also haven't gotten a bard weapon in about the same amount of time. On the other hand I think we've still got more plate bps than RZ kills. The guy seems to love giving us plate bps but we still need quite a few so I'm not gonna complain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I still shiver at the thought of doing TRC again.  I think we did that event 3 successful times, plus I'd say another 3 times before we even won it the first time.<br />
<br />
The last few times I didn't mind as much because I was on the pull team, and that's actually kind of entertaining.<br />
<br />
Definitely go with Remove Curse as opposed to RGC.  You can cast two RCs very quickly and it takes no mana.</div></div><hr />

I'm baffled already ... Our guild has only been around since Dec. 8. The trip has been interesting and exciting. I'm beginning to wonder if &quot;halcyon&quot; shouldn't mean &quot;ambition.&quot; :)<br />

<br />
Tordail it sounds like ambition to me :) You guys have done great so far, GL to you! Don't let F.Ro lull you into a false sense of security however. He's barely tougher than the mini's there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Farming Time is amazing.  No where else in EQ can you get 40+ drops in a single night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">VT has more I reckon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">VT has more if you clear it, I think, but you can't clear in a night.  Even one-night plows to AHR take 6-7 hours, assuming no wipes, and still leave out both TVXs and DXX/DXV, since they're out of the way.  Time is 5 hours, and you get every loot available.<br />
<br />
VT clear, off the top of my head, is KTXAD(blob1), DXXT, TVK, DXVT, TXD (not required), VXAHR (mini aten), KTXAHRx2 (aten blobs, second not required), AHR.  Nine mobs, two of which could be skipped but usually weren't.  Three loots each, plus a Soul Essence, for a total of 37 loots.  You could get a dozen more by doing TVXs and DXX/DXV, but that would add three hours to the clear, which already takes seven.<br />
<br />
There's also the issue of quality =)<br />
<br />
I stand by my statement.  At this stage of EQ, PoTime is by far the lootiest five hours a guild can do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Well the thing is, Time and VT are in different places in the progression. No one would go back to VT once you get into the EPs full time, much less when you are farming Time itself. <br />
<br />
For its &quot;point of progression&quot; though, which is probably killing T1-T3 PoP bosses, maybe some smaller OoW bosses, Ssra stuff, and VT, you cant beat the loot. Killing bosses like Saryrn and RZ and Bert (the non-Time versions, I mean) are a PITA because of the loot/hour ratio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Brohg is right.  If you have to capability to slam through VT to get all loots, you don't need half those loots.  <br />
<br />
When we were clearing VT effectively, in 6-7 hours or so, we'd get like 26 drops or something.  That's pretty durn good compared to POP raids where you might get 4 -8 drops.  <br />
<br />
I just got time flagged, and our first raid is tonight.  This guild is a former uber guild that is rebuilding, and merged with my guild.  So some folks are very experienced at it, but for most of us it's new.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Speaking of Time, has anyone else noticed a problem with Tier 1 lately?<br />
<br />
It seems that half of our raid is unable to zone into Tier 1, and we end up with between 8 and 12 people in each trial with the rest waiting outside, trying to click in and being unable to do so.<br />
<br />
I've seen the problem before, but never as bad -- usually it's a small, very few number of people who can't click in, but after a minute or two, they are able to get in.<br />
<br />
Currently, we're having 50% of the raid unable to click in and it lasts for quite some time -- say, 3/4 the way through the trial before they are finally able to enter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Noticed Phase 5 adds warping onto the phase 4 area once the final P4 god is killed. Can be solved by not using any mounts whwn killing it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">We had some problems with that but now here near that bad I'd say maybe 3 or 4 per team max.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Yeah, the other night we had around mid-to-high 60s in the raid, and in Tier 1 a few minutes in, a /who was only showing 32 people.  It was pretty annoying, especially when warriors and clerics were the ones that didn't get in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">ever since they implemented zoning pets, there have been problems with people in groups zoning when there are pets up.<br />
<br />
first time I encountered this problem was during a hedge event in PoNightmare. a couple of people left pets up during the port, and the result was that I, and two other people were left behind.<br />
<br />
the tier 1 problem isn't so severe as hedge, people are just delayed from entering the event by 1-3 mins. before we enter the dials, we are typically asked to drop all pets and/or mounts before clicking in. this keeps the &quot;zone-in&quot; clear for the people who need to be with the events.<br />
<br />
this is, at least, the way I percieve what problems I've seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">We used to have issues with people getting stuck outside T1 also, so we implemented a few rules: <br />
<br />
First, no pets. Summon inside. <br />
Second, only 1 trial at a time zones in. Lets say you have 3 teams of 16 per team. Send in the Undead team, and NO ONE from the other teams can zone in to their trials until ALL of Undead is in. <br />
Third, Tanks and healers FIRST, DPS classes count to 10 after the call to zone, then start clicking in. <br />
<br />
Works pretty well. Very few problems with people geting stuck outside spam-clicking anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">The thing I love about the Quarm event is that Shaman are goddly there. We put a shaman in a group with 4 rogues and a bard. This group alone probably accounts for 3/4 of the total damage to Quarm. A few HoTs, a few  fast heals, and just spam Blood of Nadox to keep the slow-poison AE off the rogues. Stick another shaman in with a few Wizards, and have him spam Blood of Nadox and RGC on the wizards, to keep them alive and mana-fat without the slow-casting crap. Quarm is one event where shaman stack VERY VERY well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Is the Xegony encounter still broken?

It's waaaay too slow to cast, and it doesn't remove anything unless you cast twice.<br />
If you are removing disease, just use abolish disease to get rid of the diseases with single casts.<br />
If you are removing poisons, use the fast casting single target whatever it's name is.  It still takes 2 casts, but it removes it in about a third the time Nadox needs.<br />
If I was using Nadox, I wouldn't have time to do anything else the whole fight like heal or whatever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Imo this shouldn't have to be a rule, it should be common sense to everyone, but alas it seems most people want to be the first one in the trial, and I still can't figure out why.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I haven't memmed Blood of Nadox since the first time we ever tried Quarm, about 8-12 months ago.<br />

<br />
<br />
Well, seeing how 2 casts are required to move either poison or disease spells.<br />
And how qarm casts,oh, uhm 2 spells that have poison or disease counters.<br />
<br />
And 2 casts of nadox will cure both those spells, as opposed to 2 casts each of abolish disease and the fast casting poison cure.<br />
If your entire group gets hit wiht it(very likely if you are a new guild breaking into Time) nadox will win hands down.<br />
<br />
And I have managed to decently heal my grup and guildmates on qarm raids, despite the sufferance of casting nadox. Or perchance because of it? ;)<br />
<br />
For that matter, nadox has won hands down in all the qarm fights I've been on, and I've felt like a idiot for waiting to get it. Got it,, mm, mid december. And yah know, it's much easier loading 1 slot wiht nadox instead of 2 slots with faster casting single target.  Most of the raid leaders on Eci agree that it is pretty much da bomb, and have been known to privatly and publicly remind the slackers on the raid to go and get it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Really, it's up to you wether you want to cure the group or a single person. All depends on your play style.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I haven't memmed Blood of Nadox since the first time we ever tried Quarm, about 8-12 months ago.<br />
It's waaaay too slow to cast, and it doesn't remove anything unless you cast twice.<br />
<br />
<br />
Casting Naxdox twice cures the whole group - all 6 people.  <br />
Casting the individual cure disease/poison takes about three times as long to cure the whole group.  <br />
Nadox occupies only 1 slot instead of 2.  <br />
<br />
I couldn't imagine trying to cure my group using single cast spells.  Seems like the path of folly to even attempt to do so.  Are you just cureing yourself and letting the others suck up the DoT's or something Juujuu?<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's the math.  It'e pretty self explanatory.  <br />
<br />
Abolish Disease = 6 seconds cast + 2.25 delay.  Total time to cure group = 47.25 seconds<br />
<br />
Disinfecting Aura = 2.5 seconds cast + 2.25 delay.  needs 2 casts = 9.5 seconds.  total time to cure group = 54.5 seconds.  <br />
<br />
Nadox = 7.5 seconds cast + 2.25 delay.  Total time to cure group = 17.25 seconds<br />
<br />
Adding in any spell haste simply makes Nadox even better compared to the others, because spell haste does not affect the recast time, the Nadox cure route has 1 lot of spell recast delay, the others have 5 or 11 in order to do a full group cure.  <br />
<br />
Lets add in 15% beneficial spell haste and see what we get....<br />
<br />
Abolish Disease = 5.1 seconds cast + 2.25 delay.  Total time to cure group = 41.85 seconds<br />
<br />
Disinfecting Aura = 2.125 seconds cast + 2.25 delay.  needs 2 casts = 8.7 seconds.  total time to cure group = 50.25 seconds.  <br />
<br />
Nadox = 6.375 seconds cast + 2.25 delay.  Total time to cure group = 15 seconds<br />
<br />
Add in network lag - and you favour nadox even more, as you only have ther lag twice, as opposed to six or twelve times.  <br />
<br />
If I thought any shaman in my guild was trying to keep their group Curede using Abolish/Disinfecting he would be spoken to in the shaman channel quite sternly about him being crap.</div></div><hr />

As we go back through TRC with fewer in the raid in order to back-flag some more peeps, I'll be sure to try this. As it was, with a big raid, my mana wasn't taxed at all. Could keep up with my group's cures &amp; heals, in addition to a few OOG cures. If I have to OOG cure &amp; heal more people in the future due to there being fewer shaman, this could be quite handy.<br />

Well, thats basically how it works. I put 4 rogues and a bard in my group, and just chain Blood of NAdox. Cures everyone, they dont have to tell me they got hit, nothing. An Epic click, Anc Aid, and the Druids casting SotW is plenty of healing. What else is there to do on Quarm? <br />
<br />
One note to remember about my personal Situation though, we have 6 VERY VERY strong, active shaman raiders. There is no need for me to malos, slow, or otherwise debuff. In fact, I dont even keep malos memmed on raids, I stick Putrid Decay and Cripple Spasm in my normal FA slot instead. Nothing more wasteful IMHO than 5 shaman casting Malos then all clicking TAs, and we have a shaman buffer who is assigned Champ (note for those who dont know, but FA overwrites Champ, and vice versa. Kinda lame). Decay, /assist, heal. Shrug, its a living.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Our pullers are the nuts.  We never had to wait for councilmen at all, and they came in pre-debuffed with Tash Sinia Turgur Cripple Ro, whole deal.<br />
<br />
oh, and we made a magician sit around casting Sinia on mezzes, obviously because he has rods! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Yeah we used a mage for malosinia. A shaman, with the ability to heal (even well enough to pick up slack for a short while should a cleric LD, so that they can be replaced), plus debuffs, cures, etc...is quite a valuable tool in this event.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">well, JPGs distort rather easily when compressed, so dark text becomes near-unreadable on dark backgrounds. the pic there is standard BMP, slightly larger file, but doesn't distort.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wrote on Jan. 31 that my guild leader had put together a plan that put us in Time in six weeks. As of Feb. 27 at around 1:30 a.m., the only thing left on the list is The Rathe Council. Coirnav fell to us on Feb. 25, and Xegony fell to us a couple hours ago. Needless to say, we're about beside ourselves with excitement. <br />
<br />
Thanks for all the encouragement guys!  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">That's really awesome.  How far out does your ambitious leader timeline you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">SWEET Tord, gratz!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Toofas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Grats man, My guild just finsished TRC last night. Was our last encounter to get into PoTime!!! Then SoE has to bug it so we can't zone into time. Maybe later this week to sometime next week is the rumor to when the bug will be fixed and I will finally be able to see PoTime!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Not real sure Brohg, seems as though he takes it in two month increments or thereabouts. <br />
<br />
Coirnav took us three tries. We got the SOB to 25% on the first and then wiped to adds, lol. The second was perfect strat-wise, but we died at around 60%. Xegony took us two tries -- we got her to 53% on the first and then a silence mob got to the clerics. I'm not sure TRC will be that fast for us; I read a strat my leader posted on our raid boards (all four posts) and was amazed by it. Death is the worst that can happen, right?  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Honestly, TRC has two difficult things you have to conquer to beat it. <br />
<br />
The first is the pulls.  That's worked out by your pull team without the raid even being present, generally, but it takes a mix of skilled skilled debuffers &amp; taggers, and often a cleric out there rezzing them as they go.  I've seen a magician/shaman/druid three man team pull the whole thing, but they're not normal guys; it usually takes bard shenanegans and some necros snaring &amp; feigning.<br />
<br />
The second challenge is the time involved.  If everyone on a large raid, like 72 PoP-style large, knows what their part is, then the event can be done in about a hour.  A *hour.*  Your enchanters basically don't get to afk at all for that time unless you have extras that can cover the slack, and the clerics don't get much rest either.  I think most raids beating TRC for the first time take more like *2* hours.  It's a pretty long time to not-****-up.<br />
<br />
Good luck, take it to those twiggy bastards!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Took a stab at The Tiki Squad tonight with 60 ... got the first six where they were supposed to be ... got 7 and 8 taken care of ... had problems in the cave, enchanters went down, and that was that. Great attempt for our first, though. We're going again later this week. It was an absolute thrill.  :cool: Thanks for all the PM's and cross-server tells of support guys!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Numgrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Gratz on the progress Tordail, you guys are progressing real well  :) <br />
Ig and Dany are great leaders and wish you guys the best. Give her a hello for me and I'm sure the Rathe will drop for you in no time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Grats to MC on a job well done...Mutley is my bi...err buddy and I can't believe he missed the win.  /rude</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">well, congratulations.<br />
<br />
you'll enjoy Time, as I find it to be a fun raid, you'll find yourself getting tons of upgrades after your first clearing of time. the subsequent farming will net you a good number of pieces, GL on a TA.<br />
<br />
my guild is just starting Uqua, which, I suspect we'll be at for a while, because it is a VERY big challenge for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Uqua isn't really that hard of a zone. After you know how to work the trap with 6 mobs, you'll complete Uqua within a week or 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Uqua is a blast after doing all the Ikkinz runs.  When PoTime has stopped being dangerous for the turgur squad, there's always Uqua &lt;3.  I was so excited to find a place where slowing really matters, and the mobs were dangerous enough to make slowing a challenge.<br />
<br />
What our guild ended up doing was pairing off shamans and tanks, like the clerics usually do.  We'd Malos asap, but not even attempt to slow until HoTT showed the tank you were assigned to.  <br />
<br />
Really have to recognise though that whatever else anyone does, Uqua up to the mez room is all about how skilled your monks are.  Barring major ****ups, that's the skill tested in there.  Not tanking, or healing, or dps, but whether or not your monks can split the traps down to 2-3 mobs per pull.  Yes/no, win/lose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really enjoyed Uqua myself... and yes pulling is key.  Luckily we have a great pulling team.<br />
<br />
We had one huge boondoggle, people started dying, mobs started popping; it was looking like a total wipe.  SOMEHOW, we managed to get things under control... our main tanks and clerics who died were shocked we avoided a total wipe.<br />
<br />
Killing Barxt is a real rush tho!<br />
<br />
BTW, it took our guild 3 tries to beat uqua, so it's not THAT bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Woot gratz on your Quarm kill..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Took us months to figure out the twins, we beat Barxt on the first attempt - go figure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
get familiar with the drops you want right away.<br />
<br />
try not blow any of your DKPs/loot rights before P4.<br />
<br />
you'll see some interesting drops, but the Gods are where you want to get your gear from, obviously the TA from Saryrn, Pusling Onyx Ring from Bert, and a number of other small drops.<br />
<br />
I'm very happy I picked up the &quot;Mantle of Pure Spirit&quot; from inny this past run. one of two shaman usable items with &quot;Marr's Blessing&quot; on it. the other is the Quarm shield (Whorl of Unnatural Forces). Quarm bracer is also a nice investment.<br />
<br />
just sit down on Alla's and run through the loot lists of the named mobs/gods in time and set some priorities, you'll be glad you did..</div></div><hr />
