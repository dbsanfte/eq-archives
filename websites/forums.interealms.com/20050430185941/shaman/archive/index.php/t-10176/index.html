<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I could be a day late on this one, but PoH has changed.  Instead of the yahoo's on the seconnd floor claiming their love for Inoruukk in 19 lines of spam, there are various sporadic paragraphs (not sure from who) with Evangelists talking about killing Paladins, unbelievers etc.<br />
<br />
The kicker is in all or almost all of the text they mention Marr. I assume they mean Mith Marr and this has something to do with upcoming expansion.<br />
<br />
Level 65 MOB - the Dreadlord or something like that on first floor. Looks like a 10'tall DE SK with a 1151 HT. (Hits for 271 max iirc).<br />
<br />
Aggro is still crazy there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">iirc Dreadlord has been there for a couple of months at least.  I believe we killed him in Nov or Dec.<br />
<br />
I have never seen him before on the 20 or so raids I have done there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Drops some crappy quest piece I think.  We killed him once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You must mean The Deathrot Knight. He is one of those mobs added in various zones for the silly Karana only diety quests out of Jaggedpine.<br />
<br />
This guy is a nuisance for Hate breaks, because he has a HUGE assist aggro radius.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The Evangelist of Hate waffling on about how he smote a follower of Marr isn't that new ... I'd guess it's been in for around 6 months. But I don't go to Hate that often so I'm not sure.</div></div><hr />
