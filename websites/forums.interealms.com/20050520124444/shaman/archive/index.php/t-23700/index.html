<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Meleeing away in Cazic-Thule after dinging 66:<br />
<br />
You have become better at 1H Blunt! (201).<br />
<br />
Ten minutes later 1H Blunt was at 203 and Offense has risen to 202, although defense remained pegged at 200.<br />
<br />
I gated back to PoK and tested Dodge at a trainer, which went to 76.<br />
<br />
Okay, so I know most people won't be meleeing much - but assuming the cap on Defense has also risen, I wouldn't say no to a small, free avoidance boost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">sucks you have to ding 66 to get a skill increase after lvl 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Weee, Defense!!!<br />
<br />
Expansions are so nice, I'm so mad I'm stuck at work!<br />
<br />
I need a hug!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/hugs Gloriana :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Pah, my lovely dialup connection went LD in Cazic Thule, came back to PoK with a nice 14% hole in my L65 bar....<br />
<br />
One rez later and I can confirm that the melee caps are as follows at L66:<br />
<br />
* 1H Blunt, 2H Blunt, Piercing - 203<br />
* Offense, Defence - 203 <br />
* Hand to Hand, Dodge - 76<br />
<br />
Assuming it stays the same through to 70, that'll give caps of 215 to our core melee skills and 80 to dodge and H2H. I'd imagine the silks classes and other priests also have raised caps.<br />
<br />
(Oh, and 4% of AA equivalent exp into L66 didn't even give a pixel of exp - apparently it was taking 5 kills in Earth to get 1% in a full group, from what I heard. Then the servers came down for a patch....   :p )<br />
<br />
They've also taken alchemy back to 200 (was 202 for me) and Spec Alt is also 200 (down from 213 before patch from the last round of bugs) - no refund on the training points though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You are not the only one stuck at work.  It is sad when I read my guild MBs how they are already at 66 and working hard towards 67 :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They are not,  servers went down 30-40 mins after being up or so. I heared PoD's didnt work.  :D  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Setanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not stuck at work but all the European servers are down (everything else up) - small problem of the Priests of Discord saying there is this great new place to go and not letting anyone go...<br />
<br />
But I love how the water looks.</div></div><hr />
