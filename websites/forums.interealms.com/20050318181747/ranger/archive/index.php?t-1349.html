<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buntar</div><div class="date">04-15-2002, 11:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, I'm curious about something.  Two things actually. <br />
<br />
1)  What do you all do when you have no desire to login?  I hit 60 Saturday and honestly don't feel like playing anymore.  Think I logged in 45 minutes Sunday and none today.<br />
<br />
I've played the crap out of my guitars, went over my band's new material, took a nap, I hung out with friends for a while, and I went out with a girl.  Is this what normal people do? I'm bored now and have nothing to do until I have to sleep!<br />
<br />
2)  Why in the hell are girls so confusing?  This girl has liked me forever and I've liked her.  Saturday night we had a chance meeting at a concert and we ditched our friends and hung out together.  It was fun. I meant to call her Sunday but had to work a double shift when someone didn't show up.  <br />
<br />
She's usually all over me, but tonight we just went and hung out at a restaurant for a while. Don't get me wrong, it was fun. She didn't seem to hang all over me like she usually does (not that I did that lame begging for some action thing)  She told me to call her and gave me her number. I still feel weird about the fact that at the end of the night there was just a  goodbye and she left.  So is that good or bad?  Me being a nerd and not dating much, I wouldn't know.:)<br />
<br />
Screw dating, I want to be asexual.  It would be so much easier.  <br />
<br />
Edited: Spelling, unclear sentences, I'm dumb.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amdee</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 12:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How old are you, Buntar? This would be helpful information :)<br />
<br />
Why in the hell are girls so confusing?<br />
<br />
Because they are confused. As confused as you are. I'm sure you are the king of logic and rationality when confronted with a social situation with a girl you like (hehe). Guess what? We feel the same awkwardness. A lot of times when you like someone, you get defensive. Don't ask me why. Survival instinct?<br />
<br />
You're not dumb :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buntar</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 12:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm 18-senior in H.S., graduation in a month- and damn, you just about summed that up in one paragraph.  My dad's not around and I'm not about to ask my mom for dating advice. Thanks a ton.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Emer</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 01:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dating and high school. Oh the memories. :)<br />
<br />
Try not to have too many expectations on what's going to happen when you are together, and your dissapointments will be far less.  Yes it is confusing trying to figure out what someone else is thinking.  It helps to ask sometimes.  You may not get the answer that you want, or they may not even know but it helps you out and keeps the conversation going.<br />
<br />
As far as what to do when you are bored well, I don't think I've been bored since I was 5 and I said that.  My dad put me to work and I haven't quit yet.  Try taking a walk, reading a book, calling on a friend you've been thinking about.  Look up a subject that has had you curious but you've not spent time to find out.  A million things to do when you are bored.  Knowledge is power absolute.<br />
<br />
and no, you're not dumb.  Don't be in such a hurry to kick your own ass.  There will be plenty of people in line to do that for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buntar</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 09:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't worry, I don't think I'm dumb, I just say that sometimes.  Instead of saying &quot;My bad&quot; I say &quot;Ah, I'm dumb&quot;.  It's just my saying.<br />
<br />
And I have no expectations. I wasn't 'disappointed', just confused. <br />
<br />
My dad put me to work, too, when I was young, but I guess it didn't stick with me.  I'm just so used to playing EQ now that when I don't log in -even if I don't want to-  I feel like I've wasted something, but I can not express what.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 09:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Anything - go for a walk, read a book, learn to cook a new meal, see a play, go to a game, take in the activities at your local church or temple. Do something real. I bet you'll find that the more of those things you do, the less you feel like logging in to EQ. It's a self-perpetuating cycle.<br />
<br />
2) One word: hormones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amdee</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm 18-senior in H.S., graduation in a month<br />
<br />
Yup, 100% normal ;) Assuming I have a clue what normal is, of course, lol. You might want to get a summer job or something to fill out your schedule, but since school is still on, you sound normal to me. Except that you aren't playing D&amp;D :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drexel</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Get a fake ID ;)<br />
<br />
2) Get used to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rounlin Starwolf</div><div class="date">04-17-2002, 02:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. I play other games or just take a small break like 1-2 days off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buntar</div><div class="date">04-17-2002, 08:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I've managed to keep my boredom at bay. I haven't played any games, though.  I mostly just do nothing.:) <br />
<br />
I haven't logged in except about 35 minutes on Sunday.  EQ is just so bland atm.  Blah.</div></div><hr />
