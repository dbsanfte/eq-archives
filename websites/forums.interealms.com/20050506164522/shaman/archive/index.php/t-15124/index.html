this thread seemed famaliar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Voyid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm I must have looked over that thread I am sorry thought I looked at all the others that might have been what I was looking for....guess I missed that one :D Thank you again for the replys though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In all honesty, don't bother w/ this channel. If your looking for advise you'll get often flamed by bigheaded level 65 'ubah' shamans. <br />
<br />
e.g. i asked if 2k was a good price for a reinforced dragonwing cloak. I basically got flamed for choosing that as it had no HP. Clearly HP is very important but other back slot items with HP in are usually up to 500pp then the rest 4k+ and nothing in my price range. Anyway i argued that okay it has no HP but the AC and Wis were still very nice and i'm not gonna downgrade to a cotiere Genral Cape (at that point i wasn't in PoP hunting so AC still meant lots to me). They then said i was a Druman (presuming i was WIS orientated and cuz i didn't chose HP every time over AC/WIS). Then the final straw was when they comapred that to a Hiero cloak (15kpp) to my 2k item of choice. THESE PEOPLE ARE IDIOTS (mostly) and they rarely give you the answer to your question......then again the main person i was arguing with was Redspeed (yes that dumbass who posts sh!te and talks out his arse).<br />
<br />
Edit: I jsut like to say i used the money on other upgrades and am currently working on cloak of the wise quest and trying to get people help me take out Lodi, my back slot is easily my worst one :s)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/ignore karana.redspeed...or whatever server he most recently transfered to in order to outrun his obviously horrific reputation. I have him ignored on 3 different ones, I believe.<br />
<br />
Makes the channel much more bearable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i bet you miss me being on the crucible arri xD <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">People bitching about this channel makes me laugh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bilgoba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Last time I went into the crucible channel it was 15 seperate people in like 3 minute intervals asking about the coldain military wristguard quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">thats because people are too stupid to look up quest how-to's on here to print out, so they go to the crucible and then bitch when theyre not responded to right away</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The channel is what you make of it. If you find talk of the coldain wristguard quest boring, then don't talk about it. Start a subject that you DO think is interesting.<br />
<br />
Ignore about 4 or 5 of the worst idiots, and all is well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Also, if you stay in the channel permanently, you will normally see the answers to any questions you have months before you know you need the answer.   Make a name for yourself in channel by being helpful and friendly and you will find that your questions DO get fast answers, because you have friends now.<br />
<br />
   If you just...<br />
 /join serverwid.crucible:crucible<br />
 /chat #crucible &quot;What should I sell my rusty dagger for?&quot;<br />
 /pause 50<br />
 /leave #crucible<br />
<br />
 ....well, that won't get you answers very fast at all, especially if someone else had logged into the channel in the same way not even 5 minutes ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">while i dont think newblets should have to make friends in crucible chat to get their questions answered, i do think that people should /sit for 5 minutes, alt tab, and check if there are any indepth how-to's on your subject\question, no need to thoroughly search the forums for it, but when a how to is stickied and it answers your question, theres no need to complain about not getting answered.<br />
<br />
Bilgoba: RTFM = Read Too ****ing Much? only thing i could think of heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bilgoba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Generally I follow the RTFM approach to anything.  The only time I ask questions in the crucible is if it's an opinion question or there is nothing on the net concerning it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>EQ_Shammie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well, I must say that I will not be a member on that channel anymore.  Got mass spammed by a bunch of ****tards. :|  Not everyone's like this of course but the handful that are I can do without.</div></div><hr />
