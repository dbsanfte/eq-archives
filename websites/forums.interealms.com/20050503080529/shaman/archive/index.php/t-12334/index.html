<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hope I can make some sense here without too much blabbering :) I've taken several breaks from EQ but they were usually because I was flat out tired of the game. As it stands now I love the game and love the shaman class but I feel I'm missing something here and not sure what to do being the casual gamer that I am. I'm in a relatively small guild with a dozen or so peeps at 60+ but it's not a hardcore raiding guild. The best we can lay claim to conquering something is the chardok royals. We've yet to step inside ToV, I've been patiently waiting for the moment to happen but I just don't think it will for many months.<br />
<br />
I really get jealous reading about people raiding ToV and then moving on to ssra and then ST and VT and the tier2+ zones. It's not so much the drops that I'm jealous of as it is the challenge of conquering a zone and taking down bosses and minibosses. I'd love to have that experience and be able to talk about it to others. There's no better feeling than struggling with a zone/boss and then finally overcoming it and making it look easy. The chardok royals were an absolute blast but our guild hasn't done anything interesting since then.  <br />
<br />
However at the same time when I look at the uber guilds they seem almost too hard core. I'm not even sure how a casual gamer survives in those guilds. Plus it seems most of them are members 65 and have already done ToV/ssra/ST and are way beyond that point in the tier3 PoP zones. So I feel sort of stuck right now. I log in and can't find a way to get past tier1 for AAing so I'm stuck with PoD/PoN which bore me to tears. I'd love to have a PoI factory key and CoD key but I'm not in a guild capable of getting those. I'd like to be in a guild capable of doing ToV but not looked down upon if you can't raid for a couple weeks at a time.<br />
<br />
Guilds like the one I'm in have too much turnover. You start getting a decent amount of peeps and they get bored like me because we don't raid so they move on to the uber guilds. I'm not sure if an uber guild is what I need or not. I have suspect it is but then I'm not sure at other times :)<br />
<br />
Looking for some advice :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My suggestion is to get people together and do what you can to get flagged for pov/pos, you can make 65 relatively easy in those zones.  After that you can more than easily do HoT/West wing with a dozen or so people, even 1 group is enough.  If you get brave enough you could do some NToV too after you get some HoT/WW gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hail,<br />
<br />
Here's my advice.<br />
<br />
Post some of what you have stated here on your guild boards.<br />
The part about wanting to do more and so forth (w/o any whining).<br />
<br />
Then make a polling post to check CoV faction for your members that are level 55+.  If the majority of your 55+ membership is non-kos to CoV, then make a Raid post calling for all 55+ to show up for a HoT raid in ToV.  Even with under 2 full groups this is possible.  You won't be killing Dozekar yet, but you can take the down the regular mobs.  You will wipeout multiple times. ;)  My former guild killed Dozekar w/ only 3 groups before it disbanded (after much practice and death.  That takedown was a big rush for us!<br />
<br />
If the majority of your 55+ is still KOS to CoV faction, then make a Kael raid post.  You can set the lower level limit on this raid at 45+, and still have fun while preparing to raid HoT.  After several Kael raids, your membership should be non-KoS to CoV.  Then you can start having small HoT raids.<br />
<br />
HoT raids are the first baby steps into the fun raids in my opinion.  This should satisfy your desire for experiencing more active  &amp; difficult content for a few months, after which time you'll have a better idea of what you want to do in addition to the raiding experience you'll want to have before moving on to anything harder.<br />
<br />
An uber guild is frankly more than likely beyond you right now.  On my server (E. Marr), you don't meet the minimum requirements for any of the top 10 guilds.  Without a Tier2 flag, you won't be able to get to a point that  would qualify to send in an uberguild application easily.<br />
<br />
I recommend you do the following:<br />
STAY in your present guild for now.  I'm sure there are others in a similar predicament to yourself.  Share your feelings and see if you can't try your hand at leading some small raids or getting a good friend to do so with your help.  Leading a successful raid is a rush in and of itself, but it isn't for everyone.  Anything beyond 3-4 groups for leading a raid gets to be a real headache for me personally.  I can do it, but my enjoyment factor goes way down with 5 or more groups.<br />
<br />
Work hard at figuring out a way to get flagged for Tier2 any way you can.  Seek out some shaman that are older than you for mentoring.  Call on any powerful friends you have &amp; discuss your situation (inability to get flagged) honestly with them.  See if there isn't some arrangement that can be made at their convenience to assist you.  If it comes down to it, bribe or buy your way into getting flagged PoV/PoS.  I can't stress enough how much easier the exp comes in Tier2.  Once you are flagged you can decide whether to stay 61 and continue to work AA's or level up.<br />
<br />
Good luck,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Spot on Frekkels, good advice. Another thing to consider is some form of alliance with another guild.<br />
<br />
On my server we've a cross-guild organisation named SCARAB (Society for Cooperative Allied Raids on Antonius Bayle). Everyone 46+ is welcome to come along on raids, we have a RP system, but there is no pressure to attend raids you aren't interested in or can't make. Some people attend 4 or 5 raids a week, some come once a month. Over the last few months we've progressed from struggling to get a few groups to do Kael Arena to moving into HoT, and having 6 full groups turn up for old-planes raids.<br />
<br />
I've no idea if Karana has something similar but it might be worth asking around; and if not, then a simple alliance with a similar guild can work wonders.</div></div><hr />
