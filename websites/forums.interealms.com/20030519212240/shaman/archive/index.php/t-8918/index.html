<br />
Has anyone been able to confirm that doing the Neck quest does in fact increase you faction with the banker?  Or if there is any quest that increases your rogue faction when your are threatning currently?<br />
<br />
Finding it annoying to try and do culturial smithing and not be able to bank in Halas.<br />
<br />
<br />
(For those of you that may not know years ago every quest in Halas had negitive faction for the rogues and the banker just happened to be a rogue.  Was very easy to trash your faction but there wasn't any real ways of getting it back.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Panou Balou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">did you check the quest with gnoll fangs (the ones dropped in BB)with the npc in the arena of Halas ?<br />
not sure but i think it gives + faction with rogues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Last I looked they took out all the rogue faction hits for most, if not all, the old quests and put in the newer Rogue quests that you have to be non-kos to start.  But I'll check again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Can't seem to do the rogue quests at dubious.  Will have to check again, but tried 'em a few months ago, my stuff got eaten.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>StirekEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Used to get a positive faction hit for turning in the head at the end of the Langseax quest.  Haven't done that in years so not sure if it changed.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, that changed.  All the negitive and positive faction hits were removed from all the Halas non-rogue quests when they put in the new rogue quests.  Which now leaves many without a way to increase their faction.  There is the &quot;banker&quot; faction but have yet to see or hear of anyone actually increasing their Halas banker faction by doing the necklace quest.<br />
<br />
I have tried illusions but nothing worked.  Thatwas quite some time ago so maybe some of the new ones work.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Panou Balou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I ve a friend who raised his faction with the banker lately but dunno if it was before the changes you re talking about,anyway you can try to contact him about that to get some informations :<br />
/tell Janaman  (the tribunal server).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks, I'll give him a try.  These changes were done about a year+ or so ago.  So either he had non-kos faction with him to start or was able to actually restore his faction.  Thanks again for the name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Try the langsuex quest. It's all warrior related but with the new faction adjustments it could raise rogue. The Barb rogues also are at war with all the other rogue guilds, maybe killing some of them might raise halas faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">That was one of the first quests I tried a while ago actually.  That was the only way to increase your rogue faction as you would get one positive hit (despite the 2 or 3 neg hits).  That changed when they took out the rogue faction hits, when I retried it.<br />
<br />
I've tried the necklace quest 20 times to date and still in Threatning.  So if you can do this to increase your faction looks like small hits.  =/</div></div><hr />
