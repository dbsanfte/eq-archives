<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I hear people use the term &quot;Time Raid&quot; a lot when they're talking about LDoN raids.  I assume this is because the hardest raid possible is on the same par as PoTime.  <br />
<br />
My question is, are there other difficulties available for LDoN raids?  And what is the scale like?<br />
<br />
I'm in what many would consider a casual guild with no set raid schedule, but still with the strength to take out NToV / Ssra type mobs.  So is there something, raid wise, that we can do in LDoN?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The easiest raids were designed for 36 people in full VT gear. They were all designed to be complete ass kickers and very very painful.</div></div><hr />
