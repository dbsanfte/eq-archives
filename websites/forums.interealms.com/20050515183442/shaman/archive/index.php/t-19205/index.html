<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For a long time now I've been calling all of my slows in group chat with a little hotkey that says X has been slowed.  However I was grouping with some friends the other day, and they said they didn't really want the spam, which made me wonder if people appreciated knowing when the mob got slowed, or if they just considered the messages annoying.  So my question is, do you call slows in groups?   I never group with other shaman, so I figured asking here was the only way I could find out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Depends on the group.  Lately I have not been calling my slows, and heard no arguements.  I just call out if I get more than 2 resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Everyone in your group gets the &quot;mob yawns&quot; message, so you don't realy have to call it.  I do call it on bosses, e.g. named in LDoN, so that the cleric knows he can back off fast heals.<br />
In raids we call slows in the shaman channel so every important person on the raid knows when to stop gaining aggro ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I tend to call slows if I'm with strangers as then they know exactly what the score is. If I'm with friends then I don't bother, unless there are multiple mobs in camp then they know which mob to take out next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I usually just let the group know I will be slowing at the start. If in doubt ask the group if they want you to announce slows. Usually if an add has been mezzed for awhile when tank moves to it I'll /g my message to let him know it is pre-slowed and to go ahead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I normally call slows for the first few minutes, then I tell my groups &quot;I'm lazy and hate spam, so I'm gonna stop calling slows. Assume I'm being productive. :)&quot;<br />

Haven't had a complaint thus far.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I ask if they want the spam or not. Very rarely does anyone ask for the message. On multi pulls where things are mezzed or parked I'll let the group know that they're all slowed but that's about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Only when it's important (mob hit hard) . So for named or ldon hard</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah I only call if asked to do so by a Cleric.<br />
<br />
My standard MO is about what Azzikai describes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I call slows,<br />
- for raid targets (duh)<br />
- when requested by cleric (happened maybe once in the last 4 months)<br />
- when mobs are hard hitting (depends on tank/group a bit)<br />
<br />
For multiples in camp i normally /g a message 'n slow' with n = number of mobs, just to help healer and evaccer to judge the situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I only call my slows if it is a raid boss (makes me feel special to be the one to land slow first!) or there is somehow another shaman in the group and we need to coordinate (happens once a month tops).<br />
<br />
I've found that people's knowledge of whether or not a mob is slowed has little to no impact on their behavior.  Example:  If there are two mezzed mobs and you've only got one of them slowed, I'd say you have about a 90% chance of the tank disregarding your slow messages and just using F8 to get a target instead.  Clerics are going to CH at whatever % they have always CHed at, regardless of whether or not the mob is slowed.  This is because after thousands of lines of nearly identical spam (you and every other shaman, ench, and druid that announces debuffs) people just tune it out and don't really read it.<br />
<br />
The only announcement I use or encourage people to use is &quot;/gs BLAST HEAL on %T&quot;.  People need to know if there is a heal inc, and if the cleric or ench is concentrating on something else, the blast heal message can draw their attention to another problem spot.  Also, if you can get a blast heal announcement in but the person dies anyways, it at least looks like you tried :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hotbutton 7 for me is my &quot;~ %T ~has been slowed! ~&quot; button the button is set to call in both raid and group. I always have Turgurs in spellslot 7 so i usually go alt-7 then 7 when it lands.<br />
<br />
I call everything. I have never heard anyone complaining about it.<br />
<br />
Usually on raids we decide wich shaman is going to be main slower, and if im not main slower i just hang back unless there are many adds.<br />
<br />
Sometimes when i group with friends who know me i might forgo calling slows. They know me well enough to know i slow everything i see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">In group settings I dont call slows.<br />
In raid settings I used to call slows on every mob.  I don't anymore because whether or not I call slow on all the trash, 3 other shaman call slow as well, and a beastlord and bard might chime in too.  Whats fun is changing out grummus for turgurs and seeing people call that turg has landed, but somehow magically your grummus spell is still holding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have a very long and annoying SLOW hotkey which I used on hard multi-pulls, or on named (that aren't pansy) so people can rest assured that it's slowed.<br />
<br />
In normal xp situations... I'm often with people I know... I know my job, and I think I do it well... they don't need me to tell them the mob will be or is slowed... if the mob isn't slowed quickly, it's dead quickly anyhow (ie: if I got 4 resists in a row, the mob is basically dead).<br />
<br />
I didn't call mezzes with my enchanter after awhile too... once I got to the point where I considered myself good at my job... and had a tank who wasn't stupid... people just depend on you to do your job, and as long as you do it well, who needs spam.<br />
<br />
I do call my heals though... people get more paniced about hp dropping than they do about a mob who might not be slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Alluring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">In exp group situations, I'll ask the cleric / MT if they want me to call the slows.  Usually, they tell me not to worry about it, which is fine by me. :p   In multi pull situations, I'll usually let them know when I've gotten everything slowed, usually after I've helped root park one or two while the MT goes to work.  This seems to work pretty well for me, both in guild groups and in the random pickup group scenarios.<br />
<br />
On raids, the shaman team communicates in a guild shaman channel to coordinate the &quot;who is doing what&quot; type stuff.  We usually call the slows and malos in /rsay, along with any immunities that we happen to come across.  Overall, it seems to work well for us.<br />
<br />
I do have one question for debate though...  How do the rest of you handle calling out mitigated slows?  Do you make the distinguishment between how effective the slow was, or do you just call it slowed or not? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I call everything. <br />
<br />
Hotbutton 3 is my &quot;[ %T ] has been SLOWED by 75%&quot; button, and I've never had a complaint about spam. I'm getting into the habit of only calling slow on a LDON mass pull (&quot;The mobs near [ %T ] have been SLOWED by 50%&quot; on button 4), since we usually go pretty fast pull-wise, and calling a slow on every mob just gets spammish. If I'm dealing with a tank that I've not worked with before, I macro every time, regardless. I also always macro both the malo-x on the named, and also macro the slow when it lands.<br />
<br />
I am always main slow on raids, and I *always* macro the malo-x and the slow on every mob I cast them on.<br />
<br />
I think one of the keys to avoiding spam on a slow message is to keep it simple. Just bloody say such-and-such a mob has been slowed and be done with it. There's no need to say &quot;+~+~+~+~ %T ~+~+~+~+ has been SLOWED *@*#$%*!!!!&quot;  or some such. The fewer symbols and crap you use, the better off you are, IMO. <br />
<br />
I also always keep the mob name toward the front of all my macros and what I'm doing to it in caps (SLOWED or MALOS-ED) so folks can just glance down, catch the name, and know what's been done to it. There is no hunting for the mob name or deciphering symbols.<br />
<br />
When it comes to mitigated slows, I forego the hotbuttons and simply type &quot;PARTIAL SLOW ON %T&quot; or &quot;%T IS MOSTLY SLOWED&quot; and leave it at that ... that lets folks know they're not dealing with a full 75% slowed mob. I've never gotten a complaint, though a few have asked if there's any way to estimate the slow % on a partially or mostly slow mitigated mob.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I call slow on raids, on hard ldon, in EP, or on any named. On normal mobs, I won't call slow, it's not worth the effort of me hitting that hotkey ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I never call slows in groups anymore, except on the harder then average mob. (named hard ldon). Hell I don't even call INC's in LDON anymore. Just tag em and train em.<br />
<br />
In a raid we call slows in a specific channel, but even then I only bother on the final raid boss.<br />
<br />
People should just know your doing your job. Melee's don't need to be saying &quot;---I'm Autoattacking!---&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Thlexian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I stopped calling slows about the time that I began to get annoyed at long and pointless melee assist messages.  &quot;Tank_02 assists MainTank_01 in opening another can of whup-a** on Mob_01.&quot;  I realized that everyone in group knew that I was slowing too, they didn't need more pointless text scrolling by on their screens.<br />
<br />
I now use similar tactics to those described by the others.  I considered what information the team would really need and changed my announcements to fit those circumstances:<br />
<br />
<br />
 Resisted slows, usually after the second resist<br />
 Slows on parked mobs<br />
 Slows on a boss mob in a raid setting<br />
 <br />
<br />
I also announce heals so that any other healers in the group can concentrate on another group member if needed.<br />
<br />
I was grouped with a beastlord the other day in Tactics who had an assist message that drove me crazy.  She was Vah Shir and used a lot of cutesy claws and fangs talk to announce that she was assisting.  Fortunately she was bright enough to recognize the spare messages the rest of us were using only when it was necessary to inform the group and she stopped spamming us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Only on hard mobs/named/bosses do I call it to help the healers know they can slow down or whatever, I usually type in how much they were slowed (partial, mostly, etc) if that is an issue.<br />
<br />
Since I play a rogue, I infrequently get to group with other shaman, nothing irritates me more than someone who has a hotkey for everything they do, heals, slows, anything.  It is useless spam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I only call slow on bosses and in P3 (mostly to let the other shamans know what mob is slowed).<br />
<br />
From time to time I target random_gnome_corpse_01 and spam all debuff messages with a final message &quot;Wow, I killed &lt;random_gnome_01&gt; using only debuffs!!!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I used to call slows all the time before I  realized how many people cant tell when a mob is slowed or not in an exp group situation. I cant stand the spam. Then again I hate those messages...May the blessings of Tunare blah blah blah on every heal that is cast. Raid targets I call slows tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">In our raids the shaman call their malos/slows in the shaman channel and keep it out of the raid channel. The only thing our guild keeps in the raid channel are instructions, MT assist calls, and Mezzes. Heals go in another channel (complete heal cycle only) and all other debuff type messages go into other class channels.<br />
<br />
In groups, it depends. If we are doing something difficult then I will call slows, if its something we can do blindfolded I do not. I usually group with the same group of people and they know the stuff is getting slowed so no need. If its strangers I may or may not call depending on how the group turns out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Fibonacci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">With a 75% slow the group knows when it lands.  It's pretty obvious.<br />
<br />
In goups I rarely call slow.  I call resists.  With a new chanter I call slows on his mezzed mobs the first few times.<br />
<br />
Calling slow on every pull is annoying to me.  It's my job.  It's what is expected of me.  It like druids calling their dots or wizards calling their nukes.  Annoying and usless information. They don't need to know every time that %t is slowed.  They do need to know when it is not or when it mitagates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I call slow consistantly for the first 30 minutes, especially with a familiar group, then I cut it figureing they got a chance to learn my style and if the MA doesn't know a mob is slowed yet then the MoB is mitigating.  Most clerics I know are smart enough to figure out when a MA is losing health fast or slowly.<br />
<br />
I always call bebuffs in raids in at least 3 channels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Aikoiko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I always call slows.  I set my macro to:<br />
<br />
/assist<br />
/pause3<br />
/cast 6<br />
/pet attack<br />
/gsay %t has been slowed... Have your way with it.<br />
<br />
If someone gripes about the spam, I'll turn it off, but htat has never happened.<br />
<br />
I especially announce slows and roots on bad/multiple pulls.  Casters and melee alike usually appreciate the fact they know that their next target is prepped and ready when they are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">In grps, I usually call out slows on 3 or more mobs in camp.  <br />
<br />
If I bounce a slow 2x I'll call out a resist, I just type it real quick, I think the misspellings add to the urgency :)  (thanks to a poster here on the Crucible for that idea).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">On raids I do. If I go down before I yell that I slowed it then the other slower(s) know they got a job to do.<br />
<br />
Groups, no, it's obvious what I'm there for.<br />
<br />
I announce resists after the second bounce and mitigations so Healers and the MT have a heads up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">guild groups - onkly announce on multiple pulls.  use the # slowed when there are duplicate names on the mobs.<br />
<br />
pickup groups - anonoune once or twice, then ask healer (in tell) if he/she cares.  they always say they do not need the message from me, they are used to spotting the yawn.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
side note - it is like seeing/recognizing your own name now.  &quot;yawns&quot; sticks out in the text scrolling by, I guess the healers learn to spot it to.<br />
<br />
pps - first stopped announcing slows when grouped with tank/cleric 2-boxers.  they knew when the slow was in, did not need my announcement 8)'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Amarusia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Basically I always call slows and debuffs in the groups and raids that I am in.  Yes, everyone knows including myself what my job is.  However, I have the slow and cast on my hotkey( something simple &quot; %T is SLOWED!&quot;).  In some zones, depending on lag, it takes a lot of time to target the add, then use the mouse and hit the button to cast; therefore the message and cast in my hotkey....much easier for me.<br />
<br />
The same goes for any mobs that have been mezzed by our friendly group enchanter. I have a hotkey set up for that to notify them that the mezzed add was slowed (requirement in my groups) - therefore the cleric doesn't have to be near as worried about the enchanter dying when the mezz breaks before he can cast the heal.<br />
<br />
The other reason I do call them is that in the groups that I regularly play in, the multiple pull mobs are continually being split and off-tanked by the pets (min, beasty, and many times mag) and then 3rd or 4th mob by myself or the beasty as well.  The group knowing that any and all mobs are slowed is necessary for them; and quite frankly for my piece of mind as well.<br />
<br />
I would agree that all parties can see the &quot;target yawns&quot; message.  However some do not see it and prefer the group &quot;spam&quot;. It seems that it takes less effort to see the grp messages.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Jorgan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">In considering whether to spam or not, ask yourself whether anyone in either the group or the raid would do anything differently if they knew that the mob was slowed or malos'd or tashed, or whatever.<br />
<br />
If the answer is yes, then either spam, or spam in the appropriate channel (i.e. if you have a debuffer's or shammy channel).<br />
<br />
Spam, for what you would think are obvious reasons, is very, very bad on raids and just annoying in groups.<br />
<br />
We have a druid who ac/fr debuffs seemingly every mob on a raid and insists on spamming /rsay with this fact.  I'm glad that she's feeling useful when she debuffs--and maybe it is a useful debuff, but seriously, who the hell cares to know, every time, that she is debuffing ac/fr?</div></div><hr />

Only other message I have is for Tnarg's to let people know that, once again, the shaman is saving the day.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Michael J. Kaspar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I call slows on raids, but not in group.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I tried calling slows for a while when I was a noobie and the spam drove ME insane so I stopped.<br />
<br />
(as a side note: I don't spam for my heals either.  I accept that my heals aren't that strong and don't see the need to spam when I'm backup healing (since I usually only do touch ups, heal the cleric, and burst heal weaklings in emergencies).  If I'm primary healing and there's no other healer I don't see the need to spam either - since either I'm healing you or you're dead and I don't let people get very low anyways since I don't have a big CHeal - so you don't have the same urgency/terror factor that clerics have when they let people get down to 50% or less before a CHeal.)<br />
<br />
I figure that I'm going to slow all critters as fast as shamanly possible so there's no need to spam (my friends know this and strangers learn it quickly)...although like some mentioned I will let my group know when a particularly tough single mob is slowed or after I have all critters on a juicy overpull slowed.  I find it helps to reduce the panic factor when folks know that potential disaster has been reduced to xp fodder.<br />
<br />
Another factor is that at 65 and thereabouts it's very obvious when a critter is slowed vs non slowed.  The new slow graphic is also extremely obvious - but not all people play with effects on and the graphic shows on resisted slows too (somewhat annoying).<br />
<br />
The only spam I really like to see is:<br />
- Pull messages - I'm usually paying attention but could be in canniland or whatever and it's nice to know exactly when combat is about to happen.<br />
- Mez messages - I could argue that a disciplined group will be assisting and that adds will be routinely mezzed - but it's good to know the enchanter is awake and taking care of business!<br />
- CHeal messages - Saves other healers from wasting mana and lets tanks know they're not on death's door and to stay in range til the casting time is met.  <br />
<br />
The spam that really gets on my nerves:<br />
- I'm not sure it's necessary for clerics to spam every single heal they do other than CHeals.  I guess it can save some mana loss from backup healers.  I don't spam my heals so I often get a Q overwritten by an overzealous cleric...but since 200m for Q is trivial to me I don't worry about it...and any cleric that pays attention or groups with me often knows what a Q message and graphic look like.<br />
- Necros spamming every time they do a health/mana tap (duh, I can see the icons)<br />
- SKs spamming every time they do their health/mana thing every 60s - although from what I've seen it's novelty spam - they do it when they first get the spell out of joy then stop spamming once they realize they'll be casting that spell for the rest of their existence<br />
- I could say the same about paragon but paragon is so nifty that you want to be sure you have a slot for it to land in...so I guess paragon spam isn't so bad<br />
- Assist messages or pet assist messages.  I know some classes have nothing important to spam but come on, you don't don't have to spam this nonsense just to get in on the spamming!<br />
- DoT messages - I don't see this that often but it does amaze me when someone spams the group every time they land a DoT.  Do they want a cookie or something?</div></div><hr />

And no, everyone doesn't get the 'yawn' message. I keep spam down by optioning 'other spells off' and 'other combat off', so I ONLY see my own spell spam and melee damage. In separate windows.<br />
<br />
And, for entertainment:<br />
<br />
I use numpad movement; that takes 2,4,6,8. And looking takes 3,5,9.<br />
<br />
1 = emote about slowing, slow, pause, slow, pause, slow, pause, slow<br />
Atl-1 = /g %T is slowed or /rs %T is slowed (based on raid or group keyset)<br />
<br />
7 and alt-7 are same, only for malos<br />
. and alt-. are same, only for cripple<br />
0 = target nearest npc.<br />
<br />
So, until initial debuffs are done, I'm on the numpad.</div></div><hr />

As others have pointed out, most folks can tell whether the mob is slowed or not, and few chage their tactics due to it.<br />
<br />
I may give a call if I am having a particularly hard time slowing a mob, ussualy about the time I give up slowing it and start nuking it instead, just so the melee types who are expecting me to slow the mob know whats up.</div></div><hr />

Yes.<br />

It's kind of pointless on xp or trash mobs (great, you slowed one of the 7 identical mobs in camp, how is anyone else suppossed to know which one?), plus on raids theres usually at least 2 other shaman spam slowing everything in sight, too.

People that call every spell they cast in exp groups are annoying as hell.  If you were invited to the group as the slower, I think everyone can safely assume that that is what you're doing.  If you call nukes and dots, you'll get kicked out of my group.<br />
<br />
If it's something you do on every single mob, then don't call it unless there is a critical reason to - such as the MOB has very high dps and the cleric needs to know he can switch from fast heals to CHs.<br />

I just tell them.<br />

Even on raids I dont bother calling it, because usually it's a guild raid and I'm leading. My guild knows I'm slowing, or I've designated somebody else to do so. They dont need to hear it in chat.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">I don't even bother calling my slows anymore.  Even on hard ldon adventures it's just not worth it for me to spam the group with a message.  I do like the see the cleric's heals though so i know if I need to heal someone real quickly if they are busy.  I also tend to mostly group with people thought that have been around alot ofs shamans, so they know that I'm going to slow the stuff as soon as it gets to camp.  Besides, if others are like me, they can tell when something looks slowed and when it isn't. <br />
<br />
I used to call my slows but I don't feel I need to anymore.  While PLing my beastlord using a friends shaman and in a group, I called a few of them, but I found out that it didn't matter if i called them or not, since the shaman was the main tank i knew what mob I wanted to target, and theonly message that I usually told them was when I was canniining or not<br />
<br />
I suggest calling out canni messages unless you are in a place where there is nothing to fear from doing it, or the people that you are with know your style a bit.  There is nothing like canniing at full health and having a cleric quick heal you thinking that something is hitting you.<br />
<br />
I have had the chance to group with a bunch of other kinda of players lately while PLing the beastlord.  I haven't spent much time in Valor or BoT in a long time, simply cause the exp wasn't as great as elementals or as fun as ldon is for me.  That and I don't need to exp that much anymore.  What I did notice though, is that I hated when people in my group would have a cute message for everything that they did, or have to announce every spell.  I had a wizard the other day that decided that they needed to justify that they were doing alot of dmg, so they proceeded to tell us every spell that they cast and how much dmg it did.  That's way too much.  I can tell that you are casting by seeing the text and can tell by the mobs hps moving in bunches.<br />
<br />
As a rule, I should be showing everyone a healing message, but I tend to spend more time searching for the stupid hoykey to cast it, than just hitting my cast button (i use numerical pad for my spells).<br />
<br />
Oh, and I suggest to you young shaman out there just learning out raiding techniques, create a shaman channel.  In this channel call out all malos and slow messages in here.  The way we do it, is we have a hotbutton that says this &quot;Casting MALOS on %t in 3.4 secs&quot;.  This tells the rest of the shamans what mob you are casting on, and how long it will take for you to land the spell.  That way, you can effectively have soeone else sinia the mob, and another person slow it in a very quick and efficient manner (assuming no resists of course).  We do it this way, and it saves the shamans alot of hassle figuring out what mob is being malosed instead of waiting for you to call malos on a mob after you've cast it.  The only time that we call out slows in the raid channel is on something big where getting the mob slowed asap matters alot.</div></div><hr />

They basically beat me into submission there, lol.<br />
<br />
In all seriousness, I announce my canni's and always tell the cleric (if it's not a guild cleric or someone I've worked with before) to wait for my Q to cast and check my HP before wasting mana healing me. <br />

So now I only do it in raids and on named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">On raids I do announce slow, since it's an indicator to clerics regarding their tactics. There's plenty of mobs which require different CHC cycle times pre-slow and after slow, and the slow message let's the clerics know.<br />
<br />
On usual yardtrash mobs on adventures or when raid is moving to the target through some area, I do not announce it, as it's not needed - I'm slowing the mobs which are worth slowing anyway, rest I just ignore. What's the point to waste the effort and try to slow a mob, which is killed by the raid 2-3 times faster then is the slow casting time? :)<br />
<br />
I do announce the slows during the adventure or XP'ing, when we get, say, multiple pulls. Happens at times, I slow them all and announce what's slowed, makes life easier for CC people if we have those and for the healer. So, as I see it, announcing the slow is needed in certain situations, but not in every situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">In new groups, I tell everyone that &quot;I am only calling resisted slows&quot;.  After months and months, nobody has ever complained about this.  In fact, I don't think anyone has even even offered a comment about it. I manually type out &quot;mitigated slow&quot; without a percentage if it seems relevant at the time, which is almost never.<br />
<br />
On bigger mobs (basically anything that will live longer than one cast or where slow is likely to bounce a couple times even with debuffs), I will call it, so that the cleric knows whats up, but I don't think it really matters.  Clerics tend to base their healing decisions on the tank's current HPs and not much else.<br />
<br />
The only hot-keys that people really care about are &quot;%t is mezzed&quot; and &quot;CHeal on %t&quot;.  Snare, slow, tash, etc., are all spells that people will assume are being cast if that class is in the party, so there is no point in announcing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Clerics will usually use their HoT spell for these situations, which overwrites Q, so I just click it off and run around at 1/2 health for a while.  Inevitably, they will cast it again and again, and then eventually ask why I'm not getting healed.  Then I tell them I kept clicking it off. That is usually the last time they waste mana on me instead of nuking like they should.<br />
<br />
Mean, I know, but its far more effective then having to tell them not to heal 3 or 4 times.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And thanks to everyone else for posting, from now on I'm changing my &quot;%t slowed&quot; button to &quot;%t resisted slow.&quot;  And I'm also going to make a Cann5 warning as well: keeping the cleric happy is always a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Here is what i do :<br />

in groups : NOTHING well maybe a heal msg once in a while, if there is no good cyber going on.<br />
And if the healer heals me when i canni hell i couldnt care more, its not like they would go oom after tossing me a SR or a HOT, then i just do some more DDing/doting.<br />
<br />
on raids: since i cant really get my slow in without a tash and a sinia we have a debuff channel and that is very useful to see when to cast the spells, here i never spam any other channel then the debuff channel since i dont wanna mess with the RL.<br />
we dont even call the slows of the boss mobs in /rsay since its our main job so that is also only in the debuff channel....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Gabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">As a paladin MT... I often like to see the message &quot;SLOWING %T&quot; as opposed to seeing the &quot;Slowed %T&quot; message. The point was well made that I am not going to be doing anything different if the mob is slowed or unslowed. BUT, if I know the slow is being cast, I will know to pop a disarm/taunt, then a stun (5 secs) to completely step on any aggro from a slow being landed. <br />
<br />
This works beautifully, and last night in a Guk adv I was complimented by a shammy who debuffed, resisted slow, slowed, and then sat down, and the mob didnt even blink in his direction. All because I knew what spells were incomming, and how to counter the aggro as it was happening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">I call everything that is important. (Slows, debuffs, CC, heals)<br />

macro2 is /cast 6 (malosinia); /say Malosinia inc to &gt;&gt; %T &lt;&lt;<br />
macro3 is /cast 3 (q); /g Quiescence to &gt;&gt; %T &lt;&lt;<br />
macro4 is /cast 8 (slow); /g &gt;&gt; %T &lt;&lt; Has been slowed 75%<br />

macro6 is /cast 7 (ae); /g AE slow around &gt;&gt; %T &lt;&lt;<br />

Then I have other assorted things I toss in.  On ldon, i usually put my 1300 macro in macro2 and move the debuff macro that way i have a easily reachable quick heal.  It is such a bad habit to pull with slow, and by hitting macro1 then macro4 (pet atk, then slow/slow msg) that when I play other classes, i do all sorts of stupidly crazy things.<br />
<br />
Example of stupidly crazy things:  My necro was hunting boglings in Echo caverns...he pulled with macro4... BAD idea.  My necro has darkness and fear on that macro.  Darkness resisted and then that bastard went running away, bringing like 10-15 of the bastards (mostly yella/red) back to me...glad FD worked. heh.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Thorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">I am of the opinion it is a waste of time and space to call slows.<br />
<br />
You are a shaman, you are going to be casting slow. Period. If there is a case where there are two shaman and you are resisted and want help on a hard hitting mob so you do not have to wait for the spell to come available again, that's cool. Set up a hot key for him.<br />
<br />
I  think calling every slow really makes no sense, calling fails that is another thing then back up people can provide help to you, or other non slowers can adjust accordingly. That is a good practice and one I personally use.<br />
<br />
In groups with strangers  I will say at the start that I do not call slows, and at what percentage I will be slowing on average.  I let them know I will call fails only.<br />
<br />
So for me.<br />
<br />
Reasons to NOT call slow:<br />
1) There is already a slow message.<br />
2) Tanks know when slow has landed, any tank that can't is in my opinion a poor tank.<br />
3) Back up slowers know when slow has landed if they are watching damage out put and mob animations. If they do not, send them a tell, why clog up group chat with your I have slowed message?<br />
4)There is never an action that is waiting to occur until after I have landed a slow. It is not like a main tank calling the it is okay to attack. People want me to slow. They want me to do it as soon as possible, they want me to do it without stealing aggro. They are not waiting for me to do it BEFORE they do something. SO no one needs to hear it.<br />
5) In cases where multiple mobs are pulled I slow ALL the mobs. I don't wait for people to break mez/engage the add, so an enchanter can die because I didn't slow when I had the chance. I slow. I am a shaman it is what I do, I slow things down. So I make sure everyone knows I am slowing all adds. However if you are a shaman and you are NOT slowing all adds you might want to start.<br />
6) Healers know when you have cast slow, they can tell by the tanks health bar I am sure. I know I can when I play my cleric.<br />
<br />
Reasons TO call slow:<br />
....<br />
<br />
I can't think of a single one other than maybe point of interest, or piece of mind. But if your a good shaman piece of mind comes with you doing your job right consistently.<br />
<br />
<br />
In closing however it is a matter of opinion, and preference. If you want to call it I say call it. If your group wants you to stop. Stop. Or debate with them why you think it is a required action.<br />
<br />
I will never call slows unless requested to do so specifically, and in raid situations where that is the current instruction.</div></div><hr />

I had one cleric buddy of mine that basically said I am Fm, suck it up and accept the heal, so I did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Jooneau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">As an Enchanter, I prefer if the Shaman called his Slows before he cast it, not after.<br />

That way, I can time my Tash to land just before his Slow does.  Tash casts quickly enough so I can cast it right after he casts Slow and have it land (and help his Slow land) before his Slow does.  It also helps me avoid Tash aggro.<br />
<br />
If a Shaman isn't calling his Slows though, I usually just wait for the &quot;Shaman begins casting a spell.&quot; message on incoming and then cast Tash at that point.</div></div><hr />

On raid level boss mobs we still call slow in our channel as /rsay is reserved for life/death orders.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Khang Runningwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">I call slows when I'm with a pick up group, once I've tested the waters for a few mobs if they're all on the ball I stop. Other than that I call it in the raid/shaman channel when raiding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">If its a pickup group, I don't actually slow mobs, so I rarely call slows.  <br />
<br />
Unfortuatnly my guild has learned I don't slow anymore, so everyone once in a while I'll slow something and call it to keep them off my back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry for the newbishness, but why dont you slow?<br />
<br />
Do you have a nother player with slow you always play with? Do you do some kind of non-tanking group like AE or kiting?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">As long as people aren't dying, and the healers aren't running out of mana, slowing doesn't serve me much purpose.  That pretty much describes all Ldon normal, and depending on the group, hard adventures.<br />
<br />
Exping before elementlas I exculsively charmed for exp mostly with 2 charmers in the group, so mobs often died before slow really made much of a difference.  <br />
<br />
In the Ele planes, things are a bit differnent, but I've only recently gained access to those areas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Gilly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">I call slows in raids because some have it in their head that us shaman don't do our job of slowing...so I do call in raids to keep myself covered.  <br />
<br />
However, in exp groups, I don't call it.  A single exp group can tell when slow is landing so they don't need me to tell them.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>boddinton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">As a player of both shaman (lvl 61 so far) and a cleric (lvl 56). If I'm playing my cleric I would like to know that it is slowed or not to change how I am healing with so in turn when I play my shaman I tell the grp/raid if its slowed or not.<br />
<br />
 So if you put a message in it covers the cleric if they want to know and if you put a message in and the grp/raid dont want the spam , hell its only one line to say if its slowed or not , not the end of the world, tell them to live with it, because one day the mob wont be slowed and the tank will ask the cleric why he died and the cleric will ask the shaman why it wasnt slowed  :D</div></div><hr />
