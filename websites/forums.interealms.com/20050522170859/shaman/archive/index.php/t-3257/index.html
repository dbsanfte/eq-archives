<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moonmist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ive got a sentry maul in the bank and wanna work on 2hb. its probably a little above 51, cause i threw in a couple points and it says average now. i'm level 47, so i know this might be hard, but how could i raise it quickly?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Setantha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not sure if this still works....nor if it works for Offense / Weapon skills....BUT it used to work for raising Defense skills. <br />
If you know a friendly chanter,  /duel them and attack their pet. The pet is considered a npc by Everquest and you should get skill increases from it as opposed to attacking the chanter where you would see no increases as he is a PC. <br />
<br />
Failing this, I've found most groups are happy to let Shaman bash away at a mob if he can still fulfil his role in the group.<br />
<br />
Only other way is to grit your teeth, solo for a bit and prepare to slow up on the experience grind as you hammer away for 10mins per mob :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would invest in a good hast item and a big hammer and then use them all the time while tanking for the pet.  The damage output is not as great as the JBB but it is not trivial either and can add significatly to your overall efficiancy.<br />
