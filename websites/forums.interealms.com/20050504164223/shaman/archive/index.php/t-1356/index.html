<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Draznar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since the forum will not allow me to reply I am trying to post a new thread. Now that I have my Iskar Shammy with Sta and wisdom boosted...<br />
<br />
What should I train in? I have a Screaming Mace, how much should I devote to the others?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Now that you have your starting stats right, go out and have some fun!!<br />
<br />
Don't worry too much about training points.  I think I have 170 of them left in my training points bank now hehe and nothing to spend them on.  :)<br />
<br />
Keep up all 3 weapon skills if you can.  1hb, 2hb and piercing.<br />
Our epic is piercing, but Iksar have the cudgel quests which are 1hb.   2hb is fun for putting some smack down.<br />
<br />
Personally I stopped using my weapons mostly after my 20s.  I was always busy cannibalizing.  I have played *a lot* of main-healer and  I am almost exclusively a grouping-only shaman(soloing makes me sleepy), and I always find myself too busy to melee.  Lots of other shaman choose to use their weapons their entire career.  So go with what your playstyle suggests.<br />
<br />
It's kinda fun to have something to do now in boring AAexp grinds.  I finished with piercing and I am now up to skill 60 in 1hb.  :p  lol, I pour money down the drain and give myself avatar, whee.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As far as training points go, you don't want to use them on weapon skills if you can help it.  While Henora is right (that at the upper levels you'll find you have a ton of unused points) - at the lower levels it often seems like there are never enough points to go around.  I might drop one point in each weapon skill (1hb, piercing, 2hb) to get them going.<br />
<br />
As for weapon priorities:<br />
<br />
Conventional wisdom says piercing shuld come first.  Your epic is a spear, and many of the commonly used mid-range weapons are piercers (slime harpoon, spine chill spear, jade prod, rune etched icewurm fang, etc.)  You could have a long and happy career using nothing but piercers.<br />
<br />
Two hand blunt definitely has it's uses (maximum melee damage, great for swings between casts, jousting in PvP, etc.) - and it's considered to be the second most important weapon skill to train.<br />
<br />
One hand blunt is the &quot;red headed stepchild&quot; or shaman weapon skills- it doesn't get the respect it should.  There are planty of nice one handers- even at the end-game level.  Most people will tell you, though, that this is the least important weapon skill to train.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
