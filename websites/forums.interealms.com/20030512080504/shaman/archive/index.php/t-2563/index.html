<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just go through the steps and you will be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ive heard that it is now possible to have to much faction for the turn in, which REALLY would screw you up, so just go through the steps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>fudorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just finished epic tonight.  Literally, tonight.  Started out with Neh Ashiir, who initially conned warmly.  Turned in her diary to the spirit, and went to Ally Truespirit.  Had tear from a prior PoF raid, so, with a little fear, from all the people saying they were bugged, did the turn in to Rak with what I thought may be only Allie faction... got the message that my truespirit faction could not get any better, and then got creamed =)  But we had a good, well used, time tested strategy (3 mages, and a lot of druids/shaman/mid level casters, with 1 cleric) and Rak went down.<br />
<br />
FWIW, I did ALL the steps only once.  I did them all in order (obviously) except for the tear, which gives no faction for killing the broodling.  And I am happy to say that it does work as intended.  For a change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kakkaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thx that means it must be max ally.<br />
If ya didn't have info on the faction then don't post its as easy as that, because thats what the subject stated.<br />
