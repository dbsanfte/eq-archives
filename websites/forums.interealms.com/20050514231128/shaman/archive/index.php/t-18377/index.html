All I can say is thank god for dye.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd look patently awful...black vindi BP, urine-yellow kael legs, dark blue-grey arms, undyed chain bracers, undyed leather boots (which are kind of blueish).<br />

Don't scare me like this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The helm (vampiric coif of the grave) drops in hard mistemoore missions.  I took it off for the second pic but it normally has the plate graphic.  The mainhander (mithril battle hammer) drops off an SRT mini, I think dresolik.  The BP is incorporeal chain of the spectre, and comes from everfrost for 1492 points.  Click link in my sig for stats on all.<br />

edit: magelo is down, so:<br />
<br />
helm - 28ac 85hp 85mana 15svdisease 10wis 12cha 9dex<br />
bp - 61ac 100hp 100mana 12fire/cold/poison 10wis 11dex 13strength, and I have a BA4 aug on it<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Perhaps this is just me having what my guild has dubbed a Barbarian Moment and missing something incredibly obvious ... but I have to ask anyways. How did you get your dye to dye only the armor? I've tried nearly everything I can think of (please keep in mind I'm a Barbarian) and no matter what I do, I end up dye-ing my skin as well, the entire &quot;armor slot.&quot; My armor is dyed white currently, so I look about like Jinheim does in the first picture (without the helm graphic, black gloves and shoulders) and of course, I'm a redhead ... but I'd love to try black or grey.<br />
<br />
Dye-ing my skin could also just be the result of a clumsy Barbarian with thick fingers playing with vials of dye. *grin*</div></div><hr />

Nah it just looks like your wearing a pyjamas (sp?) Ganga ;P <br />
but your TA makes up for it tho $<br />
<br />
Going totally undyed myself</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Havent dyed anything.<br />
I just cant understand that people can care so much about their look in a game. <br />
Thats just me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My armor would look so hideous without my dye.  Between the dark dark green Tae Ew pants, the disgusting brown/yellow of my dusty rusted vambs, and that god-awful pink of crypt robber's BP, my base colors are a friggin' mess.  But, I actually get compliments on my light blue and green chain and my purple scale armor colors. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I haven't been undyed since LoY but it'd be a pretty hideous sight.  Most of me would be okay: light blue (mithril) helm, blue (windessence) boots, grey (stormrider) gloves, black (vindi) bp.  But the untinted green leather (windriders trinket) bracer, orange (inferno) arms and pale pink (veteran's chain) legs?  *shudders*<br />
<br />
Instead I'm dyed all blue, light at my head and gradually darker down to my feet.  Much better :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I gave up on using dye since everytime I upgraded the dye looked bad with the new item. Maybe it's just me but you would think that the better gear you get the cooler you sould look. It seems to be the opposite to me IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm dyed all dark green.  No matter what I put on, I always look damn segsy.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>KeiriV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I had the skin dye problem as well and tried doing the /dopropertinting, logout, login thing and it didn't work.  Course this was way back when dying was first introduced and it may work now, but I had to load the new models and up my quality to get me to look normal.<br />
<br />
I think dying armor is fun.  It may just be the girly me wanting a virtual barbie, but hey ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grackal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have the crypt robbers BP and if it werent for dye, I wouldnt be wearing it. Because its regular color is HOT PINK!<br />
=/<br />
Who in the hell thought that was a good idea?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">we almost have a guild fashion officer.  and as a high elf female chanter, she looks pretty decent in a purple catwoman kinda way.<br />
<br />
but, officially (of course don't believe it) guild uses tints to disguish between players in relatively the same gear for targeting people outside of your group on small events.<br />
<br />
myself, 90% of the time i am a white bear, and everything goes with white.</div></div><hr />

*shrug* I think dyed armor looks 10x better than mix and match massacre.  I died my armor slots as soon as I could reasonably afford it.  It puts your appearance in your hands rather than in the hands of random drop colors (which are often terrible).  I group a lot and want people to remember me.  People remember the bald headed shaman with the wierd name in all blue that runs around shrunk everywhere.<br />
<br />
Before dye - looked like a Rocky Horros Show reject - I completely despise barbarian kilts - especially the mesh neglige look.  The fishnet armor look really looks horrific too (chest piece) - how can you be a big, bad, manly unwashed barbarian in fishnet looking armor.  EEEK!<br />
<br />
After dye - may not be realistic to be all dark blue (but who's to say what's realistic in a fantasy game) but at least it's consistent, looks 100x better, and the damn kilt doesn't look so damn....less than masculine.<br />
<br />
I would love a /wearnokilt or /burnkilttocinders option.<br />
<br />
I was grouped with a rogue from a particular guild yesterday...and noticed a few of his guildies nearby...and they all had the same green and red color scheme.  So I asked him if his guild had a dress code...and he said no, they'd all decided to change colors for the holidays.  We were all laughing quite a bit at that one and thought it was both funny and cool.</div></div><hr />
