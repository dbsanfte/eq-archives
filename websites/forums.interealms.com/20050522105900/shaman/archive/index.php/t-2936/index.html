<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A while ago I got my shaman a Beetle Stigner (picked it up for 400pp) and I've been extremely happy with it.  Especially when I dinged 29.  It's pretty fast already and even though the dmg isn't great, it has some nice stats as well.  It's 8dmg 23dly +4Dex, +4Agi, +4Wis and can go in the range slot as well.  When I got quickness at 29 it was amazing.  While I don't do more than 19dmg per hit I hit very quickly with quickness on (even better with chanter speed buffs obviously).  I may not do as much damage as the tanks, but I think I help.  ANd now that I've dinged 30, it's started to proc which is a nice strength debuff for the mob and buff for me.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering how far this weapon should take me before I need to think about replacing it?  And did I get a good deal or did I get ripped off paying 400 for it?  I'm on the vazaelle server.  Thanks<br />

<br />
400pp for the stinger sounds about right, a spine chill spear would probably cost around 600pp.</div></div><hr />
