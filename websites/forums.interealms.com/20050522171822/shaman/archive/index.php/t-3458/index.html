<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wampaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I got one of these in OS last night and was wondering just how good the mana preservation 3 effect was. I was thinking about selling it, it seems to sell for alot. I heard up to 20k since the focus effect was added, but that sounds pretty high. I sure could use the money to buy other needed equipment since I have chokidai shoulders which are pretty good 6ac 8wis 5 svd svm svp I believe. Would it be better to sell it or keep it? Is it really uber? I didnt have time to play around with it last night. I looted last thing before bed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">definitely keep it, it saves you 10% mana on ALL spells cast, i think i remember reports saying that it was equivalent to ~FT2 or 3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Put it on &amp; try it out.   I was tempted to sell mine when the price spiked but I enjoy it too much.  It is both a 10% increase in your mana pool size and an (effective) 10% mana regen increase (because you still go from OOM to FM in the same time period) so I am happy with mine.  I run low wisdom (138 wis with greater bear form up) and it helps when I have to slow 2 or 3 adds.  I would usually be close to OOM if I had a resist or two but it gives a nice buffer (5 castings of slow, 250 mana per slow, 10% = 25 x5 = 125 mana saved)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So, I know we kinda figured out how the Quickbuff AA skill stacks with Enhancement haste...how does Mana Preservation stack with Spell Casting Mastery?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">20k on ODS now... oh good lord how pitiful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Keep it. Very useful. I'd like to ditch mine for something with better stats (WW dragon mantle) but I guess i'll just wait to get some uber gear with the same effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">how does Mana Preservation stack with Spell Casting Mastery? <br />
<br />
Copied from a post on the Cleric board here (http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/008776.html) :<br />
Spec 200 = 11% saving on every single cast.<br />
Spec 50 = 3% saving on every single cast.<br />
SCM3 = 10% saving on every single cast.<br />
<br />
(Ladimor - &quot;SCM3 works on alteration if that is your specialization&quot; ... Well, it works on all spells - not just those in your main spec.)<br />
<br />
Spec and SCM are additive effects - so:<br />
Spec 200 + SCM3 = 21% saving on every cast<br />
Spec 50 + SCM3 = 13% saving on every cast.<br />
<br />
Now - and this is the new info in this thread - MP3. This gives a 1% to 10% saving - on every single cast *except* CH. This effect is also additive with spec and scm - so:<br />
<br />
Spec200 + SCM3 + MP3 = 22% to 31% saving on all but CH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Boraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I bought one for 6k last week on Terris Thule, that was after a small bidding war that started at 5k. Generally they go for 6-8k<br />
<br />
Its a great item IMO, the more you cast the more you save.  I calculated for me during a typical solo session in FG it works out to at least FT3.  Thats not counting buffs just counting Ebolt, BoN and Slow every 2-3minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">6-8kpp on Fennin too. Not that uncommon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i think 20k is ridiculous for one of these. they were going on bristlebane for around 500 - 1500p when it had the original focus enhanced healing 3, now the minimum is 20k. that ONE focus effect is NOT worth that sort of price increase, and it certainly doesn't drop off anything fancy. the amount of greed that people have makes me sick. maybe i'm the only one who wouldn't price gouge if i had the chance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Price on Solusek Ro is around 8-11k I think.   I've pondered selling it but I keep passing it back &amp; forth between my shaman and my cleric too much.  It doesn't help with CHeal but all the divine lights, HP buffs, etc... it adds up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">keep it till you get better, then sell.... like any item you get in this game</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Wampaa, what your total mana pool and your average mana regen rate ? <br />
<br />
I have 2800mana and like 50m/tick when Torporing. so mana preservation 3 is actually same effect of &lt;b&gt;+280mana, FT5&lt;/b&gt; to me, which is one of best shouder in the game<br />
<br />
your mana pool and regen rate may not same, so mana preservation 3 may give difference meaning to everyone<br />
<br />
just remember mana preservation 3 virtually increase your mana pool without take time to regen it, so it like 10% increase to both mana pool and 10% to regen rate. take a simple compare you will see it is true</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Buy a crystalline torque, which seems to be a lot cheaper for some reason.  <br />
<br />
Then sell the ODS and pocket the difference.<br />
<br />
Then use the extra plat and buy an IGS, or a Deathwatcher Shroud or something.<br />
<br />
12 AC Mana Preservation III on the neck slot, which is pretty good<br />
and a better chance to get better gear on your shoulders.  <br />
<br />
But don't sell the ODS until you can get the Cyrstalline Torque.  I got mine for 4k.  Torque drops in Velks, btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Gotta agree with Gart, get a crystaline torque.  Same effect but on neck, and neck items are a lot harder to upgrade. 12ac flat and the mana pres effect, no other stats.  Cost me 3k for mine.  That'd net you a good 15k pp, while keeping the focus effect, and let you get some nice upgrades.  It's a nice shoulder, but for the price you could get out of it, I'd go with upgrading 3-4 other slots over keeping that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Someone (think theri posting name started with an 'H') did a quick comparison on FT 3 vs ODS.<br />
<br />
IIRC FT3 = 3 extra regen / 6 seconds = 30 mana per minute<br />
<br />
ODS = 10% less on any spell.<br />
<br />
Question you ask youself is in 3 minutes will you use more than 900 mana every 3 minutes?<br />
<br />
Well between slowing, canning, healing, doting, tashing, rooting, hasting, I think you would. <br />
<br />
Therefore ODS &gt; a single FT3 item.<br />
<br />
Correct me if I am wrong here, posting late at night after a beer or 12.</div></div><hr />
