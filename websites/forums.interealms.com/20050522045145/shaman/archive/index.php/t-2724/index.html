<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Busstah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know many of you run multiple computers like I do, so here is a question for ye all:  I have currently a 46 Druid that I group up with a 45 Beastlord.  I'm having 2nd thoughts about this Druid thing so I'm thinking of making a Shammie to complement my Beastlord.<br />
<br />
Would you do this?  Do you think a Shaman makes more of a partner than a Druid?  (I realize I'm asking this on a Shaman board, so opinions will be varied with respect to this question hehe!)<br />
<br />
My only problem would be it might be hard to PL my shammie up to my Bst's level with only my bst to use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is interesting...don't BLs buff and slow (not completely familiar with the BL spell line up)?  It seems that a shaman + BL would be a bit redundant if you're going for some sort of ideal team (but fine if you're hanging out with friends or whatever).<br />
<br />
A druid would bring some new stuff to the table: snare, ports, damage shields.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They're going to crucify me buuuut...<br />
<br />
Stick with the Druid.<br />
<br />
For one its about 10 times easier to dual box a Druid than it is to dual box a Shaman. No Canni buttons to push every 6 seconds. Plus with a druid you get snare/root (which I'd imagine is a god send for a Beastlord) and ports.<br />
<br />
Plus, you're not making yourself redundant. If you've got a Shaman then why do you need the Beastlord spells? They're all just watered down versions of what a Shaman would have at the same level<br />
<br />
You wouldn't dual box a Druid with a Ranger would you? Then why do it with a Shaman and a Beastlord?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Geoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">From my experience (not a two box situation mind you) a Druid / Shaman team isn't as good as a Shaman / Melee team.<br />
<br />
I leveled up to around 50 on my Shaman with a Druid partner and it was painful.  Using mana for damage = lots o downtime.<br />
<br />
Then my friend got tired of his Druid and started a Monk (which I know isn't a BL but kinda close) and everything changed.  Having the Shaman support a melee class cannot be beat IMO.<br />
<br />
Of course, your mileage may vary...<br />
<br />
Geoid<br />
Ay Ro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, that's the problem, at lower levels, druids serve more purpose because of ds.  However, as you progress in levels, druid ds alone will be of less and less importance.  Let's say at level 5 it's a necessity, well at around your level, it's like a 50 cent snack.  <br />
<br />
That's where shamans come in.  They can't ds at lower levels (without the use of alchemy), and although they do have nice buffs and decent heals, a druid would make for a much more efficient partner.  Except you wanna think about the long run where slows will be 100 times more important than ds.  <br />
<br />
Your beastlord is level 45 now, I'm guessing you're starting to have second doubts about the druid, and if you manage to get a shaman up that high, yes, bst/shm would be a good combo.  They have some monk melee abilities and their pets are pretty decent.  I'd say go for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Druid/Shammy isn't bad, per se, but your tactics have to be altered.<br />
<br />
Slow diminishes the power of a DS.<br />
<br />
Regen applies to bother.<br />
<br />
Skin like X isn't all that.<br />
<br />
Your dots break the root so rooting and shooting isn't all that.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Upside though is:<br />
<br />
Ds's which stack (if your a potion junkie like me)<br />
It's ok to be summoned :)<br />
dot's overlap<br />
JBB + ES armor<br />
Epics stack<br />
<br />
<br />
Really although I prefer Melee partners, I can see a druid/shammy duo doing ok.  Prefer necros but Druids would work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shaman/Beastlord is comparison to Druid/Ranger, eventually some of the BL spells will be irrelevant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think he was referring the either bst/druid or shm/bst combo, both of which involve the beastlord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Druid + Beastlord sounds like it'd be pretty fun to play.  If you're going to re-roll the healer as a shaman, you might as well re-roll the beastlord as a melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Busstah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hehe, these are all the exact responses I figured I'd get, because they are all of the same thoughts that I've had!  Early on I tore through stuff, though admittedly I still do, but now my Druid is wearing thin.  I keep thinking, wow, I wish I had a haste buff.  If Druid's had a haste buff this wouldn't be an issue at all.  Plus, Druid's just don't add much to the damage party, at least not in the way Shammies do.  Sure, I can port myself around, but with so many porters and with PoP coming soon, that is becoming less of a necessity than it used to be.<br />
<br />
Damage shields are nice, my current one is 16 dmg per hit, and i've parsed it out with EQCompanion and I get nearly the same dps with my dmg shield as my beastlord!  Makes my overall dps look very nice for my level to say the least (my bst doesn't have the best of weapons, 8/19 mainhand 15/32 off, 22% haste).<br />
<br />
Several of you mention the overlapping of my buffs and such, and I've thought of this as well.  It's not really that big a deal, though, imho.  I keep Spirit of Monkey, Spirit of Ox, and Turtle Skin on me at my level, and that's it (not including druid buffs).  I think having a shammie would just give me upgrades to them quicker.  The only problem I see is that I would lack in spell skills, but that's easily remedied.<br />
<br />
Another concern I have is getting a shaman up to near 45 rather quickly.  I'd want to do it myself, and I'm not sure how well I could PL a shaman with a beastlord.  Early on it would be cake, I have a 90 point heal and some buffs, but later it might be a pain.  Then of course my shaman would be more powerful by that time, so who knows.<br />
<br />
I guess the long and short of it is, do I really want to start something new when I got my duo this far?  Who knows, maybe I'll snag some equipment and mess around with a shaman and see what I think.<br />
<br />
Anymore advice would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks for your input all of you.  I may not post here much, but I lurk constantly :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would probably stick with the druid/beastlord pair over a shaman/beastlord pair.<br />
<br />
Like Gloriana said, druid brings snare, ports, ds, dmg, tracking, etc to the table, later they also have a mana regen buff too.  They can also charm animals and buff the hell out of them in places like chardok and ME.<br />
<br />
Replace druid with shaman gives you:<br />
Same healing until 60, I still think druid/shaman healing is comparable at 60.<br />
<br />
Better slow.<br />
I thought BST got Togors or Targar Insects a long time ago, but now I see the list shows their best slow is Sha's Lethargy at level 50.   At level 50, a shaman can slow at like ~66%, at level 60, a shaman can slow at ~75%.  BST can slow at 30% at level 50.<br />
<br />
The lower slow speed of BST slow complements a druid DS well, IMO.<br />
<br />
Better Buffs.<br />
Focus and better stat buffs.  BST gets Altuna, stacks with druid HP buff, druids get decent STR buff, BST gets a dex buff.<br />
<br />
Slightly better haste for the BST.<br />
Alacrity (40%) vs Celerity(50%).<br />
Shaman get alacrity at 44, BST at 60.<br />
BST don't get the buff called &quot;quickness&quot;?<br />
<br />
Druid easier to 2box without canni.<br />
Druid has better nukes.<br />
Druid dots less resisted, dont break root.<br />
<br />
I dunno, variety is good.  Seems like Shaman+BST would be a bit redundant. <br />
<br />
But shaman are good, you can play one anyways, we can team with ANY class out there and make it work well.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Busstah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Wow Henora, very very good points you make there.  Looking at it the way you do it doesn't  seem to bad.  Looks like maybe if I get to 60 with my beast a lot of my qualms will be squashed hehe.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, we beastlords do get another slow post 50, we get Sha's Advantage at 60 which is a 50% slow.  However, this spell has never been confirmed to drop in the game by anyone.  Some people claim it has, and either can't produce proof or come to find out they thought it was Advantage and was instead Sha's Ferocity.  So until Verant decides to fix the drop rate of this spell (i.e. - up it to more than 0% chance) I'm stuck with Sha's Lethargy at 50.  The problem with Lethargy is that it's only slightly better than Drowsy, but has a huge fizzle rate, which causes most bsts to just stick with Drowsy.  Oh well.<br />
<br />
Yeah, bizarre that we don't get Quickness eh?  I think this is something they might fix for beastlords.  The class is a pure joy to play (I retired my 52 necro after trying out a beastlord just as a joke), but they are unfinished in the extreme (admitted by Verant on more than one occassion).  Evidence of this can be seen in just looking at our spell lineup, which includes the dubious Strength of Stone buff at 54, which is a Druid-line buff not Shaman, and is WORSE than our lower level 39 strength buff Raging Strength!!<br />
<br />
After reading these posts maybe I will just stick it out with my Druid.  His 270 point Greater Healing is starting to not be very effective, but I think I might have a different outlook at 51 when I get Superior Healing.  By then my beast will have a few new toys (not the least of which Frenzy at 49, woot!) and a pet that tears sh*t up big time.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the responses, be sure and add anything you might think is relevant.  I appreciate your opinions very much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Bah, use the druid to get the shaman up to 34 and your pet. At that point use the druid just as a port mule. Even better, work the shammy up the old, slow painful way and have all of your skills maxed.<br />
<br />
As for the druid at least take him to 51 and get superior heal. I have a 51 druid I no longer play, but even in crap ghetto gear he solos more efficiently than my shaman: esnare, root, DoT, sit and med. Stand to refresh root and dot when needed. I end up most fights with 80% mana. tunare druids even get a root necklace similar to the innorruuk snare necklace for shammies. <br />
<br />
That said,  I can find much more stuff for my shaman to do. Wanna group? I get snapped up fast. Wanna solo? its doable. Wanna raid? All raids need a high AC slower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Goodbrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">methinks the best duo in the game would be a ranger and a shaman.  hands down.  just my 2cp<br />
<br />
shaman dots and slow + ranger's mad melee (after shammy buffs/haste) = pure ownage.<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Shm/bst *might* seem redundant, but it's not really.  A shaman post 50 would make a better partner for beastlord than a druid would just because of turgurs.  A beastlord's slow is really not all that great if you compare it to a shaman's of the same level.  Drowsy is better than nothing when you're soloing, but turgurs is 10 times better.<br />
<br />
I was concentrating more on the melee aspect of the combo.  Stick a shaman with any melee, and they can duo pretty easily, even for rogues, if you use the root trick.  It's less feasible with a druid/melee combo if you plan on partnering up post 50.  They would spend too much mana healing if the melee was tanking, and that's where slow makes an enormous difference. <br />
<br />
As for the lack of snare, shamans still have root, I even have it hotkeyed.  With enough practice, keeping a mob from running becomes routine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Goodbrew, how about a shaman and a monk?  Insane melee and mend!  (although ranger snare/tracking is very nice too)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It is best to have 2 classes have don't overlap too much, or only overlap in areas that stack.<br />
<br />
You can only have one of any line of buff up at once. Heals stack. DDs stack. You can only have one of any particular dot up, etc.<br />
<br />
The BST is giving up melee skills to be able to cast spells and have a pet. The pet won't become redundant, but the spells would if you used a shaman.<br />
<br />
The synergy of a druid and BST isn't the best in the game, but I think it is better than SHM/BST.<br />
<br />
Or you could start over with another combo. ;)<br />
<br />
PAL/SHM combo has got to be the toughest combo in the game. When me and my wife die, it is because we had more than 4 mobs and/or were OOM with 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think the melee capabilities alone of a beastlord would complement a shaman pretty well and vice versa.  You might see it as redundancy, but I see it as more mana saved and faster pulls :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Drumrolll please.......... <br />
<br />
You should dual your Beastie with an Enchanter. You get better slows, Mana regen, mezzes, crowd control, better haste, some nukes, charms and debuffs. Beastie pets from what I understand are quite formidable, along with the BL himself. Use the BL as the primary healer if one is even needed while tanking. I might be wrong about this but, from what I hear lvl 51 BL pet can solo HG's. Sounds pretty tough as a pet to me. <br />
Dualing a BL with a Shammy will be redundant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">What's more redundant?  Playing a shm/bst combo or killing 23892374 frogloks for exp? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well, my feeling is that shaman eventually brings more to the table, but you don't have one now.  You might as well just hit 60 ASAP with at least ONE class before you mess around creating alts, even if they're great alts.<br />
<br />
Torpor and turgurs(75% slow) are godly, and once a shaman has torpor, he can get his mana back extremely quickly -- unlike a druid.  There's also focus, a huge buff to your melee stats and hit points, and primal essence, and haste, blah blah.<br />
<br />
Druid has nice buffs too, but they don't compare with a shaman's buffs, and nothing he has compares with torpor or slow.  Snare and tracking are very nice, though, and evac is okay, but nothing to write home about.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, velious quest armor for druids and BL's are both leather, so you'll have to get everything twice.  Shaman velious quest armor is chain, so you can profit from more drops.<br />
<br />
Additionally, a shaman is almost always wanted in groups, raids, and guilds more than a druid is.  Druids often sit so idle they become little more than port machines.<br />
<br />
If I were you, I'd get the druid on CoV faction after he has all the quest armor he needs, so he can port your BL around.<br />
<br />
And...I'd start a second druid so you can port  your shaman around too.  Just use him as a port mule.  Sounds crazy, eh, two druids?  Well, porting is a huge benefit.  <br />
<br />
Btw, I'm a 54 druid and 60 shaman(now 52 monk also), and have a bit of personal experience on some of this.  I've fought with a level 58 BL many times, and I can contribute tremendously to him.  My slow makes his irrelevant, he loves my buffs and heals and haste.  A shaman/BL pair is extremely durable and useful.  You'd be very happy with it, I'm sure.<br />
<br />
But ... I'd get at least one of your characters to 60 first.  You might find you like your druid or BL so much at 60, or are so darn busy doing great raids at 60, that you only play one character anyway, and whether or not to replace your druid becomes a non-issue.<br />
<br />
P.S.:  Being 60 when new expansions come out is godly too. ;)  You get first crack at all the new undiscovered loot, much of which gets nerfed within the first month or even first week of a release.  Better to be running around with a 60 or two at that time than have three 50's.  (And a druid is a DARN good new-release exploiter, too!)</div></div><hr />
