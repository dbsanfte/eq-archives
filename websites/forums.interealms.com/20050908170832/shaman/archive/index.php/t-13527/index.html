I have grouped in the DL and have determined group or solo'ing is dangerous for litlle reward. I know the guide on 30-40 worked great is there a link for non super twink shaman. I was think tofs (fifth floor once I have the keys) CC but not sure when it starts to turn green or extreme red. <br />
I have toyed with hunting spiroc wanders with dog but i remeber they hit hard.<br />
PL is not an option</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think Geo's in Crystal Caverns are nice experience.<br />
<br />
I did lvl42 up to lvl48 in Echo Caverns working the lower Taskmaster Room over solo.  With a partner (normally a paladin), did both the Taskmaster Room and the lower room without too much difficulty.<br />
<br />
At lvl48, I went to LoY can haven't looked back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Linanae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hi<br />
Thank you I will try that out. Are the geos soloable at 41</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did the beach in gunthak until 44.  Very good xp and constant pulls.  I prefer the Mokon camp on the far left shore because he may spawn and you can get a charm or possibly the Bow (which I did not get).  At 44, I searched around a bit and found a few nice, very uncamped area in Gunthak again.  If you follow the tunnel all way to the town, but before you get to the Dulak zone, you can take a left and find yourself in an &quot;open&quot; area with mushrooms and drogmoors.  This is heading towards the luggald castle.  On the right side (pretty much anywhere) you can set up camp and pull.  Sometimes you will get two, but these guys are not hard at all.  I rarely get resisted, that don't have many HPs for stuff that is still DB, and they are all still DB at 46.  No coin loot at all here, BUT, you can get some kinda rare, interesting, drops in the form of 'edible mushrooms' (potions basically).  So far I've found there types, too bad they are Lore:<br />
Penecillan spores http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3652<br />
Clarifying spores (will cast clarity on target)<br />
Inigorating spores (will cast Fortitude on target)<br />
<br />
I get 1% per kill here at 46 and it's a cake walk.  No aego, no kei . . . no problem here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Linanae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thank you. I will have to check out and see if perma camped on E, Marr sever. I was invited to goto GUK lowwer (undead side) and had great exp. We held the Assain and up (he always said during camp check assup) and it was better than DL exp. It was a Necro 46 and shaman 41 (me). But yours sounds easier to get to since I have access to a druid to port me. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Qeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I just wanted to confirm that Gunthak is a great place to solo. I'm getting about 1% per kill at 42, the mobs have a really low argo range so you can basically get singles all the time, and you don't have to worry about keeping up the spawns. I would go afk at the mokon camp for about an hour come back and just start pulling again. Pulling from any place on the wall works fine. It's very nice and relaxing solo'ing experience. <br />
At 42 the mobs can hit sorta hard, I find myself casing an ac debuff on nearly every mob I pull, it helps me thake them down a bit faster. And some of the mobs have lots of HPs, or at least they seem too.<br />

<br />
I'm also on Emarr and I did most of my 40's in echo.  If you can afford it, get the summoned mage belt, muzzle, and fists for your pet - makes a big difference!  (but costs 60 to 100 plat for all of it, so you'll want to keep fido alive)<br />
<br />
The other places I did in the 40's are Solb (pool room - but only grp'd with someone else...never tried it solo), and Dulak (around 44+.)<br />
<br />
Good luck, and feel free to send me a tell in game if you have any questions.<br />

Note:  my shammy is a semi-twink (fungi, about 900 ac and 1700 hp at 51 unbuffed)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've been in and out of the LoY zones from 40 onward. Here's my 2cp.<br />
<br />
The beach is a great starting point, plenty of mobs. If that gets boring then try and make a stop at the pirate fort on the way to dulak. In front of the fort is a wide open space you can pull pirates, drogmors and lotus' to with ease. There are only 1 or 2 huts that you can single pull the pirates from btw. You can also solo the drunks in Dulaks at 42 or so. I'm planning on doing mokon now that i'm 43.<br />
<br />
I've avoided solB cause I dont like fighting those kobold shamans without a tank.<br />
<br />
I love lower guk when I can find a group in there.<br />
<br />
I loathe the DL, DSP and Karnors.<br />
<br />
Wish I could find a good dungeon to solo in. Cant wait to hit Nadox.</div></div><hr />

All this talk about LoY!  :)<br />
Is there any faction to worry about if fighting there?  I haven't been there yet and am seriously considering it!</div></div><hr />

None that I know of. It's worth it for 40-44 at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">There's a faction hit with Nadox residents in Dulaks for killing pirates, and I think also with  the Torigans mines plece as well. Nothing besides those 2 that I know of.<br />
<br />
One thing to note though, is the drogmors have an *awesome aggro range*. If you can see them, then they are running at you.<br />
<br />
When I get done with the LoY zones I'm going to have to make a hunting guide for dulaks and gunthak. These 2 have become some of my favorite places to hunt.</div></div><hr />

Mages get the ability to summon haste belts and wpns that our pets can use.  The girdles give haste and 250/500 hp's depending on which one you buy, and they stack with our haste spells.  The sword and fists are wpns with procs.  The sword proc doesn't work on lower lvl pets (think you need to get the 55 pet, but not 100% certain), but the fists proc for all of our pets.  I'm only 52 so I use the fists - think it's about a 75 pt fire proc.<br />
<br />
Lots of times people leave these on vendors in the bazaar.  Just do a search on &quot;summoned&quot; and look for &quot;girdle of&quot; and &quot;sword of&quot; and &quot;fist of&quot;.  I may be a bit off on the actual name, but they all have &quot;summoned&quot; in the title.  They are also no rent and can only be used by pets - forget exactly how they say pet only...think it's something in the 'who can use' part of an item popup.  They usually sell for 10 to 20 plat each.<br />
<br />
If you can afford it, it's well worth the plat.<br />

in Dulak, the only faction hits i've taken are Nadox Initiates, and i've killed evry kind of pirate there...i've done the Stoic quest pirates, Dandy and Lady D (boats), the armory, one of the warehouses, and even the first 2 Windscorn pulls (with help of course...Windscorn Templar is a Cleric and has gate, so if u try to take him, kill him fast b4 he has a chance to gate)<br />

how about directions ? when u zone in, go to the lighthouse in the middle of the &quot;town&quot; and face the door. turn right, and u should see an Erudite chick. go past her (lev is nice unless u have high swimming cause the ocean is quite long and takes a while to cross) and just keep going straight. u should get to the beach and the left side is undead (see thru normal Inviso) and the rite side is the &quot;living side&quot; with scorpions, Nifliks (?), and human outcast/scavengers.<br />
<br />
hope this helps</div></div><hr />

Actually, on my server, no one sells the haste belts.<br />
<br />
What they DO sell is:<br />
Hand of Ixi'Bat (sp?)<br />
Girdle of ??? (forget, +15 to all melee stats, 500hp)<br />
Mask of ??? (has haste on it, very nice)<br />
<br />
And all are usually sold at 5-10pp, and there are a few mages competing.<br />
<br />
The Hands are great, +3 fire damage and a 75dd proc - that means give dogdog dex buff. The girdle was great as well, I could just sic dogdog and watch him tear **** up. The mask is also great. Increases dogdog's DPS greatly.<br />
<br />
Well, I'm stuck at 40 and am going to head to the Gulf of Gunthank tonight, hopefully to get some XP. I was on for 8 hours or so yesterday, and only made 20-30% XP :mad: Just couldn't find a place to level.<br />
<br />
Hope my info on pet items helps you out. 30pp is nothing when you go to farm cash or go to hunt, makes it go so much smoother and quicker. I reccommend them to everyone. Just a quick stop in the bazaar then gate back ;)</div></div><hr />
