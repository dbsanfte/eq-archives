EQ Killed My Marriage (http://www.techtv.com/news/culture/story/0,24195,3372376,00.html)<br />

YAY FOR EVERQUEST!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you don't have enough control over your damn life that you let a game dictate your moods, etc,  then you obviously have other issues you need to address before you immerse yourself into RPG's, especially EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">NOt Vi's fault they made the game. <br />
They never made anyone pay for the CD we bought it and installed it willingly.<br />

There is your problem right there...its not EQ its the 16 HOURS A DAY THAT WILL KILL YOUR MARRIAGE!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Being someone who used to play a ton(back when I was 18-19, 20 now) I can totally understand how you can get sucked in easily.  But these people need to realize that the outside world has an infinite more amount of things to offer than some gimp game that dosent even work right half the time(bards? hello?).  Anyways, not really trying to diss everquest, but people need to put it into perspective most times and not let it control them.</div></div><hr />

You can be addicted to anything.  You choose to do one thing over another every minute of every day.  Part of the reason this even gets airtime is because EQ's 450000 subscribers shows up on the radar as stealing viewers from other media outlets.  The newspeople would rather you be addicted to TV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bazoom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If it hadnt been eq it would have been something else, like &quot;cable tv killed my marriage&quot;.<br />

Some people get easily addicted, basically to anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Anythign that is fun is addctive.<br />
As logn as it keeps u focused on a soem kind of target. Think of tetris. U play and the moment the game starts u know it will eventually go really really fast and u won't be able to keep up. But u will fight for the score.<br />
<br />
As long as it gives u a target and some time away from RL it's fun and therefore it's addictive. Eq cannot end and has too many targets: Spells guilds gear etc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hoekus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&quot;It was kind of like smoking, in a way,&quot; Chow said. <br />
<br />
Yeah, except smoking is both a psychological and a chemical addiction. EQ is purely psychological. It's hard for anyone to end a marriage for any reasons, but any reasonable person knows that it's the guys fault, not the games fault.</div></div><hr />

People in these stories are so pathetic. Never understood, will understand or even want to understand such weak people. I play EQ myself for a long time, but it never  interfered with my personal life. Never had an issue of logging off and do something else, or not logging on at all. It's just a damn game, nothing more. The weak ones who mess up their personal life with the game will understand later, how stupid they were, and there's no one else to blame then themselves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mickey D's had been making their coffee hot like that for years.  It was because of that fact, that their coffee was so popular.  The process of passing almost steam through the coffee beans made the coffee maximum flavor, minimum bitterness.  It's not nearly as good now.<br />
<br />
The fact that she suffered scalding burns to her genetalia is very unfortunate, but ultimately, why should Mc Donald's have to pay for that?  Is it negligant to not remind a grown adult that coffee is hot?  Are we going to see beer manufacterers named as co-defendants in paternity suits, now?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I highly recommend the free &quot;Stella Awards&quot; newsletter at http://www.stellaawards.com, btw.  As well as Randy Cassingham's other publications, http://www.thisistrue.com and http://www.heroicstories.com.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As to the coffee incident, thats a bunch of crap, it is the old lady's fault, pure and simple. If you are too stinkin old to hold your coffee, you sure shouldn't be driving through a drive through. How hot can coffee get anway? Water alone is 100 degrees  C before becomes steam, the dissolved coffee raises the boiling point sure, but how much? 3rd degree burns? bah.<br />
<br />
Big tobacco, another crock of crap. I think they should be able to market to anyone, sell to anyone, and not be overly taxed, and the lawsuit was utter crap. I cried the day big tobbaco lost, and I don't even smoke.<br />
<br />
How many people can honestly say they didn't know smoking was bad for you? 0?<br />
<br />
Fat kids sueing McD's, hello mcfly? Jee timmy, stuffing your disgusto fat body with grease all day long isn't your fault, or the fault of your parents eh? Where the fat bastage get his money to eat there? Why didn't his parents smack him and put him to bed without his supper?<br />

<br />
Don't know where you got that.  The reason she spilled the coffee is because it was between her legs in the car when she opened it to try to put some creamer in it.<br />
<br />
I had a long discussion about this case on the court tv forum and there was a lot of information about the case that most people don't know about.  It's really not a good case to use as an example when talking about frivolous lawsuits.  <br />
<br />
The coffee was kept at about 30 degrees hotter than it needs to be.  At his temp it is considered hazardous.<br />
<br />
Over 700 other people had been burned by the coffee, many of them children. McDonalds had settled those cases.<br />
<br />
The Shriners Burn Center had asked them to turn down the temp-telling them that it was dangerous.<br />
<br />
The woman received 3rd degree burns and had to get skin grafts and was in the hospital for a week<br />
<br />
The woman only sued originally to recover medical costs.  McDonalds only offered $800<br />
<br />
The jury overwhelmingly agreed that McDonalds was negligent but the judge reduced the award to around $400,000 because he said the woman was partially responsible.<br />
<br />
A much better case to cite, would be the people who are attemting to sue McDonalds because the food made their children fat.  They claim they didn't know that McDonalds food was bad for them.  Go figger.<br />
<br />
And, back to the original post, I've read a lot of stories on EQ Widows (I find it fascinating).  Some of the situations described are just terrible, but I just don't see the problems as being EQ's fault.  Most of the people described sound depressed and seem to have some emotional problems that for whatever reason EQ eases or makes them forget for a time.  <br />
<br />
It's already been said, and I agree that ANYTHING can be addictive and it's just a need to pass blame (which addicts and those that &quot;enable&quot; them are good at) instead of dealing with the real problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Over 700 other people had been burned by the coffee, many of them children.<br />
700 people over 10 years.  Do you know how many people were completely successful in consuming their McDonalds coffee over the same period without spilling a beverage known and advertised to be HOT on themselves?<br />
<br />
Children burned by coffee?  How many children drink coffee?  So if the children were burned by the coffee, is it the coffee maker or the coffee spiller's fault?  Do you sue the maker of the spaghetti, the maker of the pot, the local electric/gas company, or the water company if you spill boiling water on your child at home?<br />
<br />
Punative 'damages' are stupid, unless you are the lawyer winning the judicial lottery.</div></div><hr />

The bottom line, quoted on the last line of the article is:<br />
<br />
&quot;I would tell the widow it's not 'EverQuest,'&quot; she said. &quot;It's something else in the relationship that's not working.&quot; <br />
<br />
This completely contradicts the title, but most journalists assume people will never read that far.</div></div><hr />

sorry bud, YOU killed YOUR marrage, if your not smart enough to know when to call it quits and spend some time with things/people that REALLY matter then, for the love of God PEASE dont procreate! <br />

i dont want my children learning this crap from yours lol <br />

anyway, thats funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Just a thought.<br />
<br />
I have spilled coffee on my fingers before now. Yes, it was hot. Yes, it hurt. Yes, my fingers hurt. A lot. I ran cold water on them for 5 mins and they were tender, but ok. I didn't need skin grafts. That must have been damn hot coffee!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">the robber that sued the family he was robbing cause he hurt himself when he fell in there house and won! That is pure BS.<br />
<br />
<br />
The way to prevent this is to shoot the robber dead. He can't sue. His family might try, but I know in North Carolina all I have to do is present &quot;I felt my life was threatened&quot; defense and I'm winning.<br />
<br />
As an aside, if you are alone, get mugged and successfully defend yourself with a handgun and nobody is around? <br />
<br />
WALK THE FEK AWAY.<br />
<br />
The second you &quot; try and do the right thing &quot; by sticking around - you are opening yourself up to a lawsuit that is straight out of fantasy land.<br />
<br />
Oh as an aside, in areas where concealed weapons are allowed, violent crime has gone down. Meanwhile in Britain crime is up in many areas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off, if EQ killed your marriage, then you obviously married a true geek.  Who's fault was that?  I mean come on...if your hubby/wife spends 16 hours playing a video game in one day, your worries should not be the game, it should be the slab of DORK you are married to.<br />
<br />
Like an above poster stated, everything fun is addictive.  In fact, some things that aren't fun at all are addictive.  Life is not about dodging addictions, its about picking and choosing which addictions serve you the best.<br />
<br />
In a way, living is an addiction.  You wake up, go to work, make money, spend money, sleep, eat, breathe, deficate, shower, shave.....rinse, repeat.  So to all of those people out there that just cant stand the thought of being &lt;shudder&gt; ADDICTED to anything, put a bullet in your head &amp; let me have the oxygen that you are too stupid to need.  End your miserable addiction to Life.<br />
<br />
P.S.  If you read this, and then go shoot yourself, so be it.  I will not feel sorry for writing this, not one bit.</div></div><hr />
