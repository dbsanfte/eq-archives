<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone here play more than one Shaman on the same server ? I have an Iksar Shaman (38) and I like him alot but, I have a fondness for the Troll Shaman as well. I just wanted to see the differences..is it worth playing both ? I'm not dual comping either so it would be one at a time. Any thoughts ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Back when I was 35, I quit playing EQ for a long time.  When I came back, I saw a Vah Shir in plate armor for the first time and just drooled all over myself.  I had to have one!  I started my vah shir shammy and gave him all of my gear (my gear sucked then even more so than now).  I used a friend's druid to powerlevel him (playing 2 at once) and got him up to 25 before I just got bored with it and went back to my main.  I couldn't stand to do all those newbie levels again when I'd already done them.  If I was to start a new class, I wouldn't mind leveling up again.  Another shammy though... its just so boring, especially when you aren't a good soloer yet and have to group with newbies :(  If you've got the patience for it then I highly recommend doing it now.  The higher you get, the more painful the lower levels become.  I would really like to be a troll or ogre shaman, but I don't think I can't stand to go through levels 1-45 again.  Even powerleveling myself I had to give up at 25 :(  (i'm weak, I know).</div></div><hr />

All have their pros and cons, Regen, Faction +/-. I did the Iksar more for the looks than the stats, heh, but no matter how much I liked the others I kept going back to the Barbarian as it is so hard going back to lower levels..)</div></div><hr />
