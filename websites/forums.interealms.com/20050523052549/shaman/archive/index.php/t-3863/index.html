<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, maybe it is just me and bad luck with the number generators last night.  EVERY Skeleton (being a Nercro pet or one just wandering) resisted the JBB and one even resisted a Blizard Blast.  Didn't matter how many times I casted they just resisted it.<br />
<br />
Me or not me? (and the resist thing got out of wack when they modified the pets?)<br />
<br />
I really hope it wasn't me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KalSeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">&quot;Casted&quot; IS NOT A WORD PEOPLE! <br />
<br />
<br />
No matter how many times I cast it.<br />
Cast the Dice.<br />
Cast away.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please let this be the first and only time I need to castigate you.<br />
<br />
Peace out.<br />
<br />
Yes the servers are down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">NPC pets are definately more resistant after the patch.  It's an OK tradeoff, the pets are usually not that tough to melee down.<br />
<br />
Idunno why regular skeletons would be harder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>DarkPhase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I haven't landed a JBB blast on a NPC skellie pet after the pet resist patch. But I hit it's master for full damage most of the time. (Tried in chardok)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Resists have always been a pain, and on a bad night can be a real pain.<br />
<br />
I remember that when I first got malise (the level 19 spell), and tried using, it took 3 casts to get it to stick, and then my next spell was resisted anyway.  I'd just restarted playing my shammie after having played a chanter to 30 and was so struck by the difference between malise and my chanter's tash spell that I never used any of the malo line again untill I was level 50+.<br />
<br />
Nowadays I always start with malise (yes still the level 19 spell) before slowing and then dotting/jbbing the mob.  That seems to help considerably.  I wonder do other shamen at level 59 use a different resist debuff tactic?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Emporer Chottal's pet fully resisted all JBB nukes last night.  I have never even had a partial resist on the pet before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well I just Casted and Casted and Casted and it didn't hold.  I couldn't figure out why when I Casted it never would hold.  <br />
<br />
Have you ever found yourself when you Casted a spell things just kind of slowed down a bit.  Even when you just have Casted your JBB maybe it is lag generated by people who just complain about the server being down, and have nothing better to do than pick on the less edjucated :).<br />
<br />
(Have I hit your ignore list yet KalSeth?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">patrolling grammar police....every board has a few....they just need the 'Un-tighten panties' spell  casted on them ;)</div></div><hr />
