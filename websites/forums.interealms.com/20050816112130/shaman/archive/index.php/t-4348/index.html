How did you do it in the first place?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The system name (ubah_mob01) came from a specific eq_type in the ui.  It *was* eq_type 28, so what VI probably did was to make the eq_type 28 the same as the mob name type (forget what the id is)<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, unless theres another eqtype which refers to the system name, there will probably not be any more numbered targeting :(<br />
<br />
Shamans and chanters mourn...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Verant probably nerfed it because in zones like Tower of Frozen Shadows, the random mobs that spawn the keygiver, have # infront of their name.

Does your target window still show the a_mob_01 after this last patch or is that just an older screen shot?<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW for your read me my inventory window is based off of Slim-line Inventory by Alderian Stormguard - Warlord of Druzzil Ro on http://newui.technosapien.net site.<br />
<br />
I modified it to move the done button down to the bottom left where I always look for it.  reordered the inventory slots so they made a little more sense to me and added the class animation stacked on the autoequipe. Since you've copied it i've also redid the stats on the right side so they where in a smaller font and moved them up which allowed me to label the exp and alt exp too.<br />
<br />
You can see my current one at http://www.cohort.cc/~taraddar/TaraddarUI.jpg<br />

and download it at www.cohort.cc/~taraddar/TaraddarUI.zip</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Even if we can't have the a_mob_00 part of the target window, I still liked the extra long one with the casting bar that Geddine had created.  He is no longer supporting it as a standalone and only part of his whole UI.  Is there anyone that would be interested in re-creating that functionality post Aug 14 patch?<br />
I miss my target window. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You can just use the targetwindow.xml file (or whatever its called) from his zipfile, you don't have to use all of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Reesa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ok now what part of this can I copy into my animations file so that it works?  I tried just replacing the whole file but that messes up the skin i'm using.  Can you narrow down the specific section of the file that allows the target file to work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Nadia_brell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Sounds like you are using more than just the buff and target window<br />
(those are the only mods I retrofitted for -- as the readme file says)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
heres what you need to do<br />
<br />
1.  use a text editor     (I personally use http://www.textpad.com)<br />
<br />
2. make a NEW COPY of EQ_animation.xml from the default folder<br />
<br />
3. compare both versions of EQ_animation.xml<br />
- the new copy from the default folder<br />
- the one in your skin folder<br />
<br />
4. Retrofit your skin changes to the NEW COPY of  EQ_animation.xml<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I looked for all references to the name &quot;target&quot;<br />
(the original file never mentions the word)<br />
<br />
PS.<br />
updated readme with some added links to more UI forums<br />
-- and giving credit for inventory</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not sure which post you were responding to here.  If it was my question about Geddine's long target bar with the added cast bar, your suggestion won't work unfortunately.<br />
<br />
He has multiple mods that change the Animations file, so without manually editing the Animations file, there is no way to extract just the target bar.  I may have to modify the Animations file though, since I can't find a version the way that I want it.  I have tried once to edit the xml, but was unsuccessful.  I just haven't had time to sink into it.<br />
<br />
Question about Patito's big target bar:  does it have the casting bar in it?  I will give it a try when I get home from work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Nadia_brell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Patito's target window is just huge )<br />
<br />
it doesnt have mana cast bar<br />

please take note,<br />
creature# IDs are no longer supported in the UI<br />
(since the 8/14 patch)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you think it was deliberate or just an accident of the patch?  I don't see the harm in it, really, from a roleplaying perspective (minor eye roll) if I were fighting multiples of the same creature type, I would be able to discern the differences between different creatures: bigger, smaller, scars, etc.<br />
<br />
It was my absolute favorite part of the new UI and I hope it was just an accident!!</div></div><hr />
