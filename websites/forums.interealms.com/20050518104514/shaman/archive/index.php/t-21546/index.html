<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As I advance, I am carrying around more junk, clickies, potions, stalking probes, et cetera. I tried an off hand parrying dagger for pet, which drop in Everfrost. but those do not force dual wield as far as I can tell--just a weak shield. The dog merely bites, and does not pierce. Do you have any recommendations on off-hand weapons that force dual wield, and are not too heavy or expensive? Would be nice to carry 10 dual wielding items in a bag, instead of 5 pair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I farm mining picks in CC for my supply.  Usually get 4 BPs that will get me thru for a bit.  Rusty weaps work fine too, but at least CC mobs drop some cash/velium while you are there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just fill a weight reducing bag with forging hammers -- sold in many city zones including PoK.  Primary and secondary 1HB.  Cost 1 silver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">best one's i've found are the masters eitchatka or what ever they are called. Reason they are nice is you can usually port to shar vall from pok and hit the 2 vendors in shadewavers thicket there and buy tons of em from them for a couple gp each. Otherwise any eitchatka in the bazaar or the chill dagger works too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't know of any off hand weapons unfort.. :(<br />
for the singles I always hit the pok fisherman vendor, after a patch I make sure he has at least 1 rusty eventually people will sell to him, then whenever I need to restock I normally have an unlimited supply.</div></div><hr />
