<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wisey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have gotten all raiding AA since I spent most of my online time raiding and I still picked up AAs pretty fast.<br />
<br />
Now..where should I put my AA next?<br />
<br />
For raiding, I would maybe put them into resists AA.<br />
<br />
Or should I consider the following?<br />
<br />
(1) Spirit call<br />
<br />
(2) Virulent Paralysis<br />
<br />
(3) Spell casting fury<br />
<br />
(4) Rabid bear<br />
<br />
(5) Improved metabolism<br />
<br />
Any ideas and feedbacks from shamans with the above AA skills are welcome.<br />
<br />
You can take a closer look at my AA skills in my magelo but otherwise, u can assume I have all other important AA skills )<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Serbitar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would get VP1 then do FoM3, if you raid I know you spend a lot of time nuking.  VP is great and cheap even to get the first level, Spirit Call I wouldn't even bother with until you do resists (as a raiding shaman)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1) Spirit Call - very fun, nice for offtanking a multi pull<br />
<br />
2) VP - I found this very useful, one of my favorite AAs, wonderful for CCing in LDON<br />
<br />
3) SCF - looks like fun, but a lot of AAs to max out<br />
<br />
4) Rabid Bear - as I approach 200 AAs I am re-thinking Rabid Bear which I used to be rabidly against, could be fun<br />
<br />
5) IM - I love this, the less time I have to spend buying food, the better</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i would avoid spirit call, unless you REALLY want a pack of dogs.  The use is  pretty minimal IMO, and if you want to see what they can do..just send your pet at something unbuffed, and then take that times 3...<br />
<br />
Spell casting fury is nice, but level 1 is a joke as far as chance to crit goes.  If you want this you better plan on getting 6 levels of it.  I went for one whole hour of constant nuking before i got a crit the other day with level 1 of this.<br />
<br />
VP is nice, its on my list, but not sure if just level 1 is worth the 3 points quite yet.  I'm not sure about the knockback either..the times i would use it (mostly solo) its usually pretty cramped and this might not be very helpful...<br />
<br />
rabid bear..6? minutes of melee every 2? hours...this is a joke of an aa--avoid it unless you want to melee for 6 minutes every 2 hours &gt;&lt;  I'll get rabid bear right after i get innate charisma...<br />
<br />
innate metabolism is probably worth it, especially if you use stat food and a horse (especially if you are vah shir).  I'm debating getting at least a level of this myself just for the convenience.  I make my own stat food, and farming the components and spending several hours combining isnt very fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">1. VP to level 3.<br />
2. Spirit Call<br />
<br />
The others in whichever order you want</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">(1) Spirit call = A useful spell that doesnt take a spell gem = $$<br />
<br />
(2) Virulent Paralysis = See above + putting mobs in time-out is the bomb.<br />
<br />
(3) Spell casting fury = As stated above, more or less totally pointless unless you're going all the way.<br />
<br />
(4) Rabid bear = Don't have<br />
<br />
(5) Improved metabolism = The most bang for your buck, especially if you use stat food.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd stay away from resists for a long long time myself.  Lots better stuff to spend precious AAs on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have max rank of all of the AA's you are considering buying, as well as all the AA you currently possess, so I am speaking from experience here :).  I did spirit call a little earlier in my career, in the mid 100's.  Besides that, though, these are pretty much the last AA's that I trained.  Out of all of them, Virulent Paralysis is without doubt the best of them all, and I really wish I had gotten it sooner.  Here is a thread that gives a much more in depth analysis on the power of VP and my opinions on it:  http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=16806  I didn't train it until around my 270-280th AA, and I seriously regret waiting so long.  I should have gotten it in my first 100.  So, I'd advise you to train that first.<br />
<br />
After that, I'd rank them in this order (from first you should train to last):<br />
<br />
1 - Spirit Call.  It is a handy AA, and only costs a total of 9 AA points.  It is pretty handy for pulling purposes, and it has a very dramatic effect when dueling casters.  A little extra DPS never hurts, as well.  I don't really consider this to be all that great of an AA, but you've already got practically everything so might as well go for it, it is only 9 points<br />
<br />
2 - SCF3 and FOM3.  This is a lot more useful than spirit call, but the downside is that you're going to have to spent 30 freaking points on it.  I have this trained as well and it is pretty cool to get a string of crits when I am chain nuking.  Not a serious upgrade in DPS, but like I said, at this point you just don't have much to pick from.<br />
<br />
3 - Rabid Bear.  The +50CR is nice against offossa and some other places.  The actual melee damage can be pretty effective if you're dueling a caster.  Against real mobs, your damage is laughable compared to what you can do with dots and nukes.  Besides that, rabid bear is really only a novelty.  I didn't train it until around 290AA and I don't regret waiting that long at all.<br />
<br />
4 - Innate Metabolism.  This is really pretty worthless.  You're an uber shaman with lots of AA, you should have no trouble scrounging up 1k a month to buy yourself some food.  The total time I spent exping in order to train IM 3 is probably about 10x greater than the total time I have spent buying food, so the &quot;convenience&quot; argument doesn't really hold water.<br />
<br />
As for resist AA's, you don't really need them.  Judging from your magelo your guild is probably right where mine is:  Farming EPs, trying to gear up to kill the gods.  I've killed everything in the EP's except xegony, rathe, and coirnav.  I've never found myself in need of more resists, and your resists are quite a bit better than mine.  Especially your CR, sheesh.<br />
<br />
Another option (which I would place above rabid bear on my list) is Suspended Minion.  It is nice to have in LDoN, because if your pet dies you just pull another out of your pocket.  Also cool for whenever you need to do something that requires invis, and definately very good for dueling.  Nothing like dueling someone and them working very hard to kill your pet, only to bring out another one.  This AA makes using a pet a lot more convenient, and I've actually started summoning them again since I got it.<br />
<br />
Enjoy, and good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wisey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As usual, I can expect good reply from Jinheim.<br />
<br />
And also thanks for all the replies.  VP next then )<br />
<br />
One question for Jinheim, with SCF3 and FOM3, what is the supposedly crit rate?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not sure but I would estimate around 15-20%</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't consider Innate Metabolism a priority AA, but it is far from worthless for how cheap the AA is. Yes, it is a convenient AA.<br />
<br />
Use Bristlebane's Party Platter for food and you will understand. It takes a good amount of time to get the components together and do the various combines. The longer the food lasts the better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Consider the first three, definitely.  I'd order them as follows:<br />
<br />
1) Fury of Magic 3<br />
2) Spirit Call 3<br />
3) VP3<br />
<br />
My reasoning is thus--SC and VP are very situational on raids.  SC can be very useful on boss mobs to aid in positioning--they have huge push, but seldom last long in mob AEs, reposts, or enrages.  However, they do fairly little damage, all things considered.  You can search for parses, but even if they did 10,000hp damage over 2 minutes (they don't), that will barely scratch a boss mob.  As I mentioned, I find their main use is as a push tool--3 shaman with this skill can push the hell out of a mob, or pin it on a wall for a tank.<br />
<br />
VP is also conditionally useful.  Few boss mobs are ever rootable, but many of them come with adds, guards, or spawn help at some point in the encounter.  Not a lot of mobs have high DR, so VP can really help CC on some encounters by pushing the mob out of the clerics and tying it up for a few moments.  Unfortunately, there aren't very many of those encounters--offhand, I can think of about three for which I would consider it very useful.  You can adapt it to be marginally useful in a few more.<br />
<br />
Fury of Magic, though, is nice.  When you need dps, you NEED dps.  Let's face it, shaman aren't designed for quick high dps--it's just not our forte.  If we DoT on raids and nuke, we're gonna get summoned and rapidly dead.  However, when we need high dps and your raid leader calls for a full burn, alternating velium strike with tears of saryrn when both have a decent chance of critting--well that's more than conditionally useful.  Extra damage is always nice.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents!  :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oh, one more thing on spirit call--depending on how you want to use it for positioning, the dogs that you summon come out one at a time.  Once the ability is used, you can move.  The dogs go straight for the target, absent poor pathing in the area.  Thus, if you want massive push from behind, just stand there and let all 5 dogs push from one direction.  If you want to help pin a mob against a wall, strafe around a bit right after you finish the cast time on your ability--you can have dogs pushing from all directions to help stabilize the mob.<br />

Actually, I use VP on raids quite a bit.  While moving to a boss, my guild excels at walling mobs.  Since VP will push a mob the direction you are facing, I've found it very useful in pulling mobs out of walls.  But generally, I find it most useful in exp groups :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you are a raiding shaman you might want to inquire with your raid leader regarding the use of SC and VP.  I know that in my guild SC pets are mostly off limits (unless a massive corner push is specificall required) and fine positioning of mobs in pally job.<br />
I like SCF and will finish it once I catch up on the healing AAs.  Was on a quick Cahrdok royals run this weekend AoEing the castle guards/kingroom/queenroom, and seeing all those critical rains is plain fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wisey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Nod.<br />
<br />
Going to finish VP and then will be doing SCF and FOM.<br />
<br />
It's good to know that there are some useful AA skills yet to be trained.</div></div><hr />
