<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In a couple other threads it's been hinted at that effective resists are capped below 255.  Does anyone have any additional information on this?<br />
<br />
I'm finally getting to the point in my gear upgrades (thanks, Bazaar!) where this might actually matter for me.  :)<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Biggus, there used to be a bug whereby resists over 255 rolled over.  Thus, a resist rate of 256 was equal to a resist rate of 1.  Needless to say, when this came to light, they changed it pretty quickly.<br />
<br />
You do get to a point of dimishing returns on resists, though.  In my experience, most resists over 250 work about as well as they are going to work.  I haven't noticed myself resisting anything more around 300 that I didn't already resist at 255, though, of course, this is very hard to check and I'm only operating on my observations.<br />
<br />
The bad news is that most big mobs (heck, even yard trash in ubermob zones) tends to be higher level than we are anyway.  Between that, and the fact that VI has a tendency to code a lot of their AoEs at lure resist levels makes even obscene resist levels less effective.  Annoying, but there it is.<br />
<br />
Pardon my morning rambling!  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">resists will naturally cap per mob lvl vs your lvl. so effective cap might be lower. say around 200 for kunark mobs, /cough</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ideal range to be buffed for resists is 180-190.  I personally avoid going over 200 because with my experience ya resist less at 200+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmmmmm... 180-190 fully buffed.  That's definitely a lower target than the &quot;as high as you can get them&quot; I was working against before.<br />
<br />
Anyone else agree/disagree that 180-190 buffed is the place to be?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree, that's a pretty decent place to be at resist-wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am usually over 255 in Cold, Fire and Magic during HoT raids.<br />
I resist or take low partial damage almost every time.  Others who meet the 'bare mins' and end up with around 150 buffed get healed alot.<br />
So it definately makes a difference there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">120 is the cap for fire damage from lava like in Lavastorm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">/agree with Wildaar<br />
<br />
Anytime i've had resists go over 200, i get frigging mulched.  Mulched bad.  Keep em 180ish and i'm fine.  It happens way too often to be coincidental.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">In PvP FR and CR are hella broken.  Anything over 135 in either is detrimental - test it sometime with a druid and wildfire, you'll notice you take more damage as your resists break that point.<br />
<br />
MR/PR/DR all work as expected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hp is also important for ae. I don't even bother switching into resist gear anymore. Waste of time. Get hp, get levels, get buffs(circle of seasons+bardae=resistluv), fogettaboutit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well your lvl seems to play a HUGE part in resists as well. The difference between 58 and 60 were incredible, with pretty much the same gear and buffs my resists were about 50 percent better at lvl 60. <br />
<br />
I have also noticed the over 200 thing where you seem to get less resists over 200 than in the 180 - 190 range. I have seen countless times where my wife is tanking in one of the bard groups while Im outside the range of the bard resist song and she gets totally eaten with 100 more resist than I have...... maybe proximity comes into it to......... some shaman instinctivly go for the &quot;belly cast&quot; Im not one of em, I prefer to be around max melee if I even have to be that close.</div></div><hr />
