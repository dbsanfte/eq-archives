Zun'Muram's Spear of Doom<br />

It drops in the north wing from a Zun.  I forget which one.  It's total crap though.</div></div><hr />

The stats are nice, but the click effect is Tnarg's and has a 15 minute recast delay on it. No focus on it either. If you're guild is doing Tacvi, they can certainly get you Epic 1.5. Better to go for that, I would think.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tacvi poker right click from inventory? that'd be a big factor. and if our epic clicks from inventory, you could in theory have TA in hand for clicky slows, and epic and tacvi poker in inventory for clicky effects. the extra tnarg's may not seem like much, but the cast time is 2.0 and it's one extra fast-casting mana free heal not too bad of a parachute heal item.</div></div><hr />

My epic 1.5 clicks from inventory just fine...</div></div><hr />

That's because it isn't much. :P<br />
<br />
If you want a clicky heal, better to get the Aged Hammer of the Dragonborn from the new VP, which at least has clicky 2 second Kragg's. <br />
