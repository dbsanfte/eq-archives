<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, all trials done with aprox 2 groups and we go up to 7th hammer to try him out.. Like ***! I know they upped him from a 1 group mob, but seriously.. Anyone taken him down after they upped him? Feels like a raid is needed now.. And btw, his aggro is screwed beyond recognition.. I casted a spell when I was the last man standing and he didnt move.. I walked closer to see and the guy kicked my ass instantly :(<br />
<br />
well, anyone taken him down recently?</div></div><hr />
