<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm looking for a map for Greig's End.  A good map showing spawn information.  At least where Greig is anyways.  :)<br />
<br />
I tried EQ Atlas and they don't have one yet.<br />
I tried EQMaps.com and their 2 maps suck.<br />
There is another that I found once, but can't find again.  They had tons of maps and even links to the other site's maps (like EQ Atlas).<br />
<br />
Anyone have a good map, or know where to find one?  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

nothing great but anlther 2 places to look :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks Kaison.  The first is the one that I was thinking of.  Unfortunately it has the same maps I have seen before.  :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">honestly i've found the maps of griegs on eq maps very helpful. sure there are no landmarks but you easily got out of a nasty situation with them. is there something specific you're looking for? we got in pretty far and i can tell you where a couple things live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hey, Glasya, if you're familiar with Griegs, perhaps you could answer a question.<br />
<br />
We went to take out Grieg the other day and got stuck at Prast Ianitor. We entered a room - alas, I cannot explain where - that had only one door. In it we could hear Prast talking about his key, how he cleans it, how he hopes nobody will take it. But we could not target him, or get him to attack. We eventually had to leave due to the internet attack, which caused half our guild to go LD.... all the melees, which was funny. Lots of clerics running around healing while I'm tanking on some green dark sendings.... mages running around screaming Peel! Peel!.... anyway.... <br />
<br />
How do you get the key guy to be targetable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">here's another map place.<br />
<br />
I find it useful for getting outlines when making my own maps.<br />
