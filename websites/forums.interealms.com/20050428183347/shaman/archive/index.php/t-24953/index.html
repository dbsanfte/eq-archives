<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,<br />
<br />
I read the Blizzard FAQ on their PvP, but it didn't really tell me much.  I am looking for some finer details.<br />
<br />
I know that there are red and blue servers, but not sure the real difference.<br />
<br />
I am pretty sure there is some PvP on a blue server, but is it totally consensual or can I run to the undead area and just start killing other players?  <br />
<br />
On a red server, if I am playing a Night Elf, do I have to worry about other Night Elves hunting me?<br />
<br />
I have read that there is not much of a penalty for PvP death, but what penalty is there?<br />
<br />
So, basically, I guess I am looking for an overall view of the PvP system.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well I play on a blue server and this is what I know. PVP is always consential I believe on a blue servers. Red servers you cannot kill people of your side, only people of the other team. <br />
<br />
Not sure on the penalty, but the death penalty in general is gear degredation which can get a bit expensive. <br />
<br />
Someone on a red server would have to give you more of that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The reason I am even more confused is because my wife called me into the room because she said a few Horde people came to the Night Elf area and got slaughtered.  <br />
I am pretty sure that they didn't engage in consensual duels or anything.  She said they ran in, elves swarmed, and Horde died.<br />
<br />
I know that their is 10% item degredation when you die, but from what I have read, it sounds like that might not even exist in PvP.<br />
<br />
People in WoW forums are calling it carebear PvP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have not pvpd and never will but I would like to mention that they are removing the durability penalty on PVP death ONLY.<br />
<br />
So now people can have at each other without worrying about that. Item usage still causes durability loss over time tho (if i understand it correctly).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Soulstorm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">From what I've read on the PvP servers, anyone can attack anyone, though I seem to remember something about how in Alliance zones Horde are unable to initiate PvP and in Horde zones Alliance are unable to initiate PvP but in any non controlled zone PvP can be initiated by either side.<br />
<br />
On the PvE servers, I think you can choose to enter PvP state for yourself only, however if you kill a PvP flagged Npc you become PvP enabled for 5 minutes (I think thats correct time) or if you heal or buff anyone with a PvP flag active you also become PvP active for 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
They are attempting to have no downside to PvP just rewards in various forms including boosting your faction with your side to reduce costs get extra quests. Also they have mentioned the possiblity of rewarding the top PvP'ers further.<br />
<br />
One thing that could be seen as a detriment is that Horde and Alliance have seperate GY's and therefore if you die in the middle of your opposite factions area you will likely end up with a long CR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">PVP server - any horde can attack any alliance, and vice versa. People of the same side cannot attack each other unless it is via a consentual duel. This keeps the focus on faction vs faction<br />
<br />
I didn't play too long on non-pvp server but this is my understanding.<br />
<br />
Non PVP server - You can flag yourself for pvp, which is your way of giving consent for pvp competition. If you flag yourself for pvp or if you attack someone who is flagged for pvp, then you are able to be attacked as well. Attacking NPCs of the opposite faction (any NPC that you can attack) will flag you for PvP, even if you didn't attack a Player Character. You can also be swarmed by guards of any opposing faction if your reputation is bad enough with them (check character sheet)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You type in /pvp to turn on pvp mode on a carebear server.<br />
It lasts for about 5 mins.<br />
A little symbol appears on your character window on the top left side.<br />
If you click on any guard as your target, you'll see the same symbol up (indicating they are constantly set up for PvP).<br />
So basicly, if anyone decides it's cool to try and slaughter the opposing side's guards and shopkeepers, the people of that home town and jump them and defend their home town, regardless of the server type.<br />
I think I'll actually try playing on a PvP server this time around with WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You can attack anyone on the opposing faction at any time on a PvP server.  A level 20 human mage jumped my level 18 shaman today in the barrens (horde territory).  Luckily I still kicked his ass, well okay I beat him with 20 hp left!  Shamans rule at PvP.<br />
<br />
Anyways the penalty for dying is the same as a on PvP death at this point, not sure if they are changing it.  You lose 10% of your items durability per death.  100% if you need to use the spirit healer person.<br />
<br />
Im Walruss on Test 32 btw, if anyone plays there, hit me up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What kind of level limit is there on pvp?<br />
Like, can a level 20 beat on a level 5 or something stupid like that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kykha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">On the PVP servers you have 3 kinds of territories:<br />
<br />
1. Your own faction territory, Alliance territory or Horde Territory, depending which side you are on you cannot be attacked by the other faction UNLESS you attack them first.  These territories are mostly the newbie territories. I noticed on Alliance side you can easily level up to 20 without leaving Alliance territory.<br />
<br />
This is how I encountered it anyway, I had 5 trolls surrounding me in Auberdine and all I did was /dance and /laugh because they couldn't attack me (I'm on test 4 ET pvp).  <br />
<br />
<br />
2. Contested territory:  Horde can attack Alliance, Alliance can attack Horde.<br />
<br />
3. Opposite faction territory: As an Alliance you cannot attack a Horde char when you are in Horde Territory.  <br />
I am not sure what happened to you there Walruss if you didn't attack him first.<br />
<br />
EDIT: regarding the durability loss during PVP, I also thought they removed that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I had my first PvP experience yesterday.  I play a lvl 14 troll warrior on Test 38 (mountain zone, pvp).<br />
<br />
From what I've seen.  If an Alliance player wants to come to Horde lands and dodge NPC guards, etc., they can.  In fact they can hang out unmolested in the newbie area and they can't kill anyone unless they are attacked first.  <br />
<br />
What happened was, a level 18 dwarf hunter went to the troll/orc newbie zone and /duel'd the newbies and then promptly waxed them when they accepted.  We all ran there, and if we engaged him, then the fight was on.  Otherwise you sit and stare at each other.  He couldn't attack until he was attacked.<br />
<br />
So we all ran to defend our town, I tanked his pet while my wife kept me healed.  The pet itself was a tough fight.  He was shooting at some other folks and then came to fight me when he saw his pet going down.  We had a mob that finally chased him down and killed him.  Next time, he came back with a 19 pallie.  I thought the 19 said '14&quot; so I attacked the pallie and got promptly slaughtered by him after he stunned me.<br />
<br />
It was fun though, but I doubt I'll pvp when it goes live.  I am on this server just for the low population lol.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah sorry guys there is some misinformation about PVP in this thread so far, but Kykha got it heading in the right direction.<br />
<br />
Each zone has a name and color code for faction:<br />
friendly/green.  contested/yellow.  hostile/red.<br />
<br />
While in a green zone you are safe and cannot be attacked first.  If you attack an enemy here you will now be flagged for PVP however.<br />
<br />
Yellow/contested all enemies should appear red and that means fair game/open combat for all opposing factions.<br />
<br />
Red/Hostile you cannot attack the enemy - basically you are on their turf and the idea with this is these zones are primarily nebie zones so your lvl 60 can't go freely gank lvl 5s.  However if they attack you then they are PVP flagged and fair game.<br />
<br />
There is no PVP among your own faction unless you /duel or go to the arena which is open combat for all.<br />
<br />
Even if you aren't into PVP I highly recommend at least duelling some =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hahahah On TEST 20 last night an &quot;Army&quot; of nightelves led by a pally were attacking shi.t left and right in the barrens. Pally was 26 rest were in their teens. Funny thing is since it's a non vpvp server nobody cared they just watched them go by and nobody tried to stop them cause it just doesn't matter lol some ppl don't get it. Some ppl don't wanna pvp at all that's why they play on blue servers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Uh how did the mage attack me then?  Maybe it was because I had a fire searing totem up and it attacked him?  I wasnt aware I had to initiate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">For the &quot;Simple&quot; explanation:<br />
<br />
PvP is exactly the same on all servers.  You can ONLY fight members of the opposite team.  You can ONLY PvP when both you and your opponent are PvP flagged. <br />
<br />
Now heres the gotcha:<br />
<br />
There are two sets of rules that will flag you for PvP, one for each server type.<br />
<br />
On a NON-PvP  server, you only get flagged for PvP if you do the following:<br />
<br />
a)  attacking an NPC of the opposing faction<br />
b)  attacking a player who attacked an NPC<br />
c)  aiding a player engaged in PvP. <br />
d)  typing /pvp<br />
<br />
On a PvP   server, you get flagged for PvP if you do the following:<br />
<br />
a) attacking an NPC of the opposing faction<br />
b) attacking another player<br />
c) aiding a player engaged in PvP.<br />
d) entering or being in an enemy territory<br />
e) entering or being in a contested territory<br />
<br />
Basically, any zone you want to quest/xp in past lvl 20 is a contested territory (on PvP servers).  Any newbie zone or city zone is a friendly/enemy territory (on PvP servers). <br />
<br />
So on PvP servers, you can be attacked in most zones where you will be adventuring, but your own cities and newb areas are safe.  Instanced zones are also safe, obviously.<br />
<br />
Examples:<br />
<br />
Orc and human groups come across each other in a lvl 40 zone. <br />
PvP server:  they can attack each other on sight.<br />
nonPvP:  they can only attack each other if somebody from both sides 'turns on' their pvp flag (by typing /pvp).  <br />
<br />
Orc and human group come across each other in the human newb land.<br />
PvP server:  Orcs can't do anything, Humans can attack on sight.<br />
nonPvP:  Orcs can't do anything, Humans can't do anything unless the orcs attack a Human NPC.<br />
<br />
Note:  There are quests that require you to kill NPCs on the opposite team, thus turning you PvP.  It is also quite common to raid an enemy city and kill the bankers and quest NPCs (again, turning you PvP).  Even on 'blue' servers you will be PvPing...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ok, I've read all those links and still not sure.  Let's make a chart because I'm a visual learner. =)<br />
<br />
  Alliance vs. Horde in an  Alliance  area  <br />
   Blue server:    What could happen? <br />
  Red server:    What could happen? <br />
<br />
 Alliance vs. Horde in a  Contested  area  <br />
   Blue server:    What could happen? <br />
  Red server:    What could happen? <br />
 <br />
 Alliance vs. Horde in a  Horde  area  <br />
   Blue server:    What could happen? <br />
  Red server:    What could happen? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kykha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Uh how did the mage attack me then?  Maybe it was because I had a fire searing totem up and it attacked him?  I wasnt aware I had to initiate.<br />
<br />
Well that could be one reason, another one could be that you still had a PVP tag from a previous fight.<br />
<br />
When you pvp the tag doesn't dissapear immediatly after you killed the one you were fighting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Oh that's probably it.</div></div><hr />

[PASTE]<br />
Choosing a Server<br />
<br />
If you want the thrill of fighting other players, and prefer the challenge of player-controlled opponents over computer-controlled ones, then the PvP server is for you. However, if you choose this server, be aware that in most areas of the world you risk getting attacked by higher-level enemy players when you least expect it. Not only might they be too powerful for you, but they'll also strike when you are at your most vulnerable. For example, they might attack you while you are in the middle of a quest or a monster fight. Interference by opposing players is a constant reality you must accept on a PvP server.<br />
<br />
If you want to restrict your gameplay to computer-controlled challenges, and want the freedom to enter PvP mode only at your own choosing, then the PvE server is for you.  Factions can attack each other and continue the race war between Horde and Alliance through their in-game skirmishes.<br />
<br />
Normal Server<br />
<br />
On the normal server, PvP mode is disabled by default. You have to turn it on through your own actions. When you enable PvP mode, you turn on a flag that other players can see. On your own character portrait, you will see a PvP flag next to your face that looks like a shield belonging to your faction. Other players will also see this, and they will be able to attack you at will. You can enable this flag by doing any of the following:<br />
<br />
- Attacking an NPC of an opposing faction, such as the opposing faction's aerial mount master, guards, quest giver, vendor, or similar NPC.<br />
- Attacking an opposing player that attacked a friendly NPC. By counterattacking the first player, you enable PvP mode, and opposing players can begin attacking you.<br />
- Aiding a player engaged in PvP combat.<br />
- Entering an enemy capital city.<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds are a special type of zone where unique player versus player challenges can be found. They exist on both PvE and PvP servers, and provide a level of competitive inter-faction play that can't be found anywhere else.<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds are special areas distinguished by a red instance portal. The first time you encounter a battleground, you must walk through this red portal to enter it, although later, you can journey there via flying mount if you unlock the flight path there.<br />
<br />
In a battleground, player versus player combat is always enabled, regardless of server type. This gives players on the PvE server who want a taste of PvP gameplay the ability to do so on more manageable terms.<br />
<br />
While in a battlegrounds area, you can team up with friendly players while you embark on quests designed to pit you against players of the opposing faction. You can easily leave a battlegrounds area and return to the normal world by speaking to another friendly battleground NPC.<br />
<br />
Turning Off PvP Mode<br />
<br />
On the normal server, PvP mode lasts five minutes. At that time, you revert back to your default non-PvP mode. However, if you engage in any of the above PvP-enabling actions, this timer will reset to five minutes.<br />
<br />
Player Versus Player Server<br />
<br />
On a player versus player server, there are additional conditions that enable PvP mode. You can enable PvP mode by doing the following:<br />
<br />
- Entering an enemy territory.<br />
- Entering a contested territory.<br />
- Attacking another player.<br />
- Attacking an opposing NPC.<br />
- Aiding a player engaged in PvP combat.<br />
<br />
Territory Control<br />
<br />
On a PvP server, all zones are divided into three categories: friendly, contested, and enemy. The concept of territory control allows low-level players a measure of security in their home zones, but also heightens the risk and danger of venturing into farther-reaching areas beyond the protection of their faction guards.<br />
<br />
Friendly Territories: You are safe from opposing players while you are in friendly territory unless you attack those players. While the territory is friendly for you, remember that the same territory is considered enemy territory for the opposing player.<br />
<br />
Based on the PvP rules, you can attack enemy players who come into your friendly zones, but doing so can be unwise because they can only attack you if you attack them first.<br />
<br />
Contested Territories: Contested territories are neutral ground, and thus any player in these areas can be attacked by any opposing players. By definition, contested territories are dangerous, and all players are fair game as long as they remain here.<br />
<br />
Enemy Territories: In enemy territories, opposing players can attack you at will, but you cannot attack them unless they attack first or enable PvP in some other way.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Guys it really is simple. On a pvp server, the same exact rules apply in your home territories, you cannot be ganked unless you attack first.<br />
<br />
If you are in contested territory(vast majority of level 20-60 zones), anyone can attack anyone of the opposing faction.<br />
<br />
If you are in enemy territory, anyone can attack you.<br />
<br />
it is not &quot;free for all&quot;, you cannot be killed in the barrens unless you attack somone first, and you cannot be slaughtered as a newbie, period.<br />
