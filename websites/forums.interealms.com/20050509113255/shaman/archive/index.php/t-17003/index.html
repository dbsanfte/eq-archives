<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gotz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I cancelled my account 3 years ago and gave everything I owned away.  Started my account back yesterday and logged in with my lvl 34 shaman with nada thing, no plat, no weps and no armor.<br />
<br />
Can ya'll give me some advice of where to go and solo for items and what items to look for.  I just want to find some ok weps armor so I can start my way again.  Any ideas would be great.  I only have Kunark and SoV tho.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
Once you have some basic stuff, farm Ry'Gorr armor in Eastern Wastes (Velious).</div></div><hr />

Where is Marus Seru and what is  the bazaar, apparently Im WAY behind the power curve.  As I found out when I tried to goto Grobb last night...oops.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Really consider getting Luclin and PoP. The travel time alone will make EQ a lot better. You might want to even consider starting over with a new account out of the EQ Evolution boxed set, since that would be cheaper.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is really good advice!  Don't worry about deleting your 34 shaman - the levels go quickly and you can get back in the swing of things on the easy mobs.  Also, you will have the luxury of picking exactly what class and race you want.  Oh, BTW welcome back and (at least in my opinion) EQ is a ton better than it used to be.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gotz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't know bout starting over...ouch.  My play time is limited to about 8-10 hours a week, I don't see it going fast.  Im gonna go get Luclin today and that way I can visit the Bazaar.  I also noticed all the websites are pay now...damn EQ has gone crazy.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You don't need to start over because you buy a new boxed set.  Those guys are confusing me too.<br />
<br />
You just need to buy the software of the new expansions to install on your existing account.  <br />
<br />
Don't delete your toon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As the other posters said, you should probably start over with a fresh account using the Everquest:  Evolutions.  It will be less expensive, and will let you start from scratch more easily and get back into the swing of things.  The total time to get to level 34 is very low these days, and much has changed about the game that you will want to learn of first-hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would just buy evolutions to get the licenses for the later releases and load them. Then kit yourself out as you play. Don't delete your toon, levels 29-34 are quite painful and at 34 you at least have a pet (finally) that you can use to help farm greenies. Just spend a little while acquainting yourself with pok and the books. visit www.eqatlas.com to review maps of the zones including pok. It might be worth your while hunting areas where you can remain close to a pok book or zoneline for escape as you level up. Possibly hunt for spider silks as these are worth good coin. While you gear up you can re-learn the things you forgot.<br />
Good luck to you. What server do you play on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gotz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks guys, looks like I'll get evoluation and just update.  Xegony is the server I'm on and it seems kinda dead nowadays.<br />
<br />
Chris</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thats the other argument for starting fresh - you could start on the Stromm server with your new character, and you might enjoy that more (its the newby server, meaning your not going to be playing with people that are twinking out their 15th alt using plane of tactics drops -- you'll play with people that are more likely at the same level as you game-progression wise).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gotz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hey ya'll, well im on my way.  Talked to Sony and you can upgrade your existing EQ wiht Evolution.  The tech guys are emailing the instructions on how to do it.  Thanks again.<br />
<br />
Chris</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Evolutions won't have LDoN included.  If you have the cash, I would definitely pick it up.  (Lost Dungeons of Norrath)  Most people will be grouping in it these days and it may be tough finding a group otherwise.  (Grouping is much faster experience now than it was 3 years ago, much much faster)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just one little bit of Advice (assuming you are NOT deleting you 34 Shaman {I sure as heck wouldn't}). Farm silks (get about 100), and sell them in the bazaar for about 5pp each.  500pp will set you up quite nicely in a full suit of Ry'gorr Armor, with some Giant Scalemail Armor thrown in.  The only reason I am saying this is because you can easily farm the silks Nekid, and go right to the Ry'gorr stuff.<br />
<br />
One of the other poster mentioned something about Farming Ry'gorr, well at 34, it ain't gonna happen!!  Do not go there thinking that you'll be able walk out with Ry'gorr Battle Mail.  It drops off the chief, who usually comes with 3 guards. They are light blue to me at 57, so I need to assume they would be red to you at 34 (or yellow at the very least).   I think the Chief may still be Dark Blue to me (not 100% sure though).  You CAN do the entrance guards, and inner guards (prolly).  They can drop Ry'gorr Arms, Legs, and Coif, as well as Orc Fang Earrings.<br />
All in all, that will get you started.  <br />
<br />
And BTW.....WELCOME BACK!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Game is a whole lot more fun now, I quit a few times, last time for two years? And with pop/luclin game is just alot more friendly.<br />

Go for it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Which server is your Shaman on?  If it's Tunare I can give you some bits and pieces to get you back on your feet.<br />
<br />
Edit &gt; Oh and you can probably solo the forest giants in warsliks woods fort, to get a no drop hammer and forest loop earrings, at your level.  Root, DoT and let the dog tank.  As long as you don't let them hit you you should be ok, and come away with cash to boot.<br />
<br />
Another idea would be to head to Karnor's Castle. Camp the zone in and politely request permission to loot Jarsath Scale armour... It's no drop and most of the people hunting there wouldn't use it so it often rots.  I wore a full suit all through my 30's.</div></div><hr />

if you still on xegony Look me up i am mostly on the the weekends I am a lvl 59 shaman i will be glad to help you out if you need any thing</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If you buy evololutions you will get a new CD key with which you can start a second account, but you by no means have to use it.  Just buy it for the cheap/easy access to the expansions and log your old account in.<br />
<br />
Where to gear up nekkid at 34?  Hmmm. That is a toughie, but the leather padding idea is very good.  Everfrost is a nice spot for the supplies for those.  You could butcher kobolds in the Warrens, I think they drop some basic armor pieces to keep the breeze off, but by and large your best source is the happily mudflated bazaar.  You can get stuff that was once uber for pennies nowadays.  So farm silks or leather padding or anything for cash and go on a shoppin spree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>dams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">once you get some coin saved up I have some recommendations that might make your shopping more efficient in the bazaar.  i assume that you might still be under the impression that wisdom is &gt; than all for a shaman.  the general thought now is that hps &gt; all.  i am a firm believer in this myself.  when you get to the bazaar you can filter your gear searches in a number of ways.  what i would recommend doing is filtering it like this.  <br />
<br />
pick and item slot<br />
select hps from the tab below the item slot<br />
select your race<br />
select shaman <br />
<br />
then put in a maximum of 50 or 100 plat or what ever you want.  then the items that are available to you that add hps will show up.  if you search from the giant list it can be overwhelming.  you can of course do it anyway you choose but i think you find if you can increase your hps substantial your survivability will increase greatly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gotz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Wow!  HPs are better then WIS, well glad I learned that!  Im stilling farming silks for money, thanks tho!<br />
<br />
Chris</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Riaz Whitepaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I also recently found that out honestly I look for gear now with Hp and manna the HP helps you more for when you use CANNI a great spell to get you mana back i might have a few peices of armor you can have man just give me a tell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Get friends. Farm easy plat and check bazaar.<br />
<br />
Or dont make the same mistake twice, and get yourself another game :)</div></div><hr />
