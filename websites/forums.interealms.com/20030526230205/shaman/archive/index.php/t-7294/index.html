<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>pollyye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello this is my first post .<br />
<br />
I have read lots of conjecture about the true spirit pet and would like to state some facts.<br />
<br />
1. I am 61 shamaness on SZ and one of my fellow shaman had the true spirit out for killing KD because we were bored. As usual there was a mixture of races classes and levels and we were sitting buffing when the lowest member of the party asked whos the level 59 pet was. This started a great debate and lots of comments about over powering Shaman etc. The really funny thing was , this pet ENRAGES, which again caused allsorts of great comments and had me LMAO.<br />
<br />
2. In 2 days I have seen 9 parchments drop in the groups i have been fighting in, mostly from spiders in PoD and a couple from enforcers in PoJ. I have had 3 spell hand ins and as yet have not gotten my new pet :(.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope this information is useful to u.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Warhealer Strikes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">WOOOT... I love my new Pet..... Best Pet a Shaman could own.. He is a Level 58 Pet. Hits for a Max of 60 so far.. And all you have to do is Buff him Up like you would any tank and he will hold his own in a group  setting quite well. Hooraah for Sony..  And thank you for a well deserved pet.  BTW it no Mage Pet or Necro Pet. But far more impressive than the 55 pet spell<br />
