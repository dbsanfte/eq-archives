<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">how often does this happen?<br />
<br />
last night I am looking for upgrades that I can afford, and to see if someone is selling canni2.<br />
<br />
so while I am going through the list of BPs, I see something listed for 1c and it is a pretty decent item, always being one to spend wizely, and then sell to someone else for a mild profit I didn't think twice and tracked him down.<br />
<br />
Everything he had was for 1c. he also had some so, out of memory (didn't write it all down, but I got about 2 bags worth of goods)<br />
<br />
I got some 20ac 9wis shield, a totemic helm, some hammer that roxors. apparently the guy was a shaman cause there were all shaman items on him. but I can't use the BP since it has a required level on it, I will probably sell it and get something I can use.<br />
<br />
I probably made about 20k pp (estimate).<br />
<br />
I must have been the first person to see it to, there were about 3 other people that showed up, and got maybe 2 or 3 items, but I know I got the bulk of it :)<br />
<br />
and no, this isn't april fools, it really happened. <br />
<br />
so was I lucky or what  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sad thing would be if someone jacked that dudes account and set him up in the bazaar for revenge cause his group got to lodi first or something and you just bought all his hard earned gear.<br />
<br />
That would blow, but unfortunetly the way EQ is these days, its highly possible. If i was in your shoes i would track him down and talk to him and see what was up. My consience wouldnt let me do otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I hadn't thought of that.<br />
<br />
I will look the guy up tonight and see if indeed this is the case.</div></div><hr />

Highly possible?  Apparently you have no idea how secure the Sony webservers are...<br />
<br />
99.99999999999999% of all accounts &quot;hacked&quot; is trusting someone with your password that you shouldn't have, people just refuse to accept that one of your &quot;friends&quot; would do something like that.<br />
<br />
Get a clue, hacking is not nearly as easy as you make it sound.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sorell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What happens when you go into trader mode with items that don't have a price on them yet? I would like to think they wouldn't be purchasable, or even show up in the bazaar list. Just askin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Items that are not priced do not show up.<br />
Additionally he had to take the items and stick them in bags, you can't sell what your wearing.</div></div><hr />
