<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mekil Jueaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wasn't exactly sure where to put this post, but since I'm not sure when I want to try this I'll put it in general just to test the waters and see who will be interested in the weapon.  What I am wanting to do is see if there are a few people that are interested in a decent weapon for their main (or an alt if they camp them near the spot) and get us together to kill the necessary ghost.<br />
The weapon is:<br />
<br />
Onyxbrand   <br />
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP  <br />
Damage: 10<br />
Delay: 24 <br />
Ratio: 2.4 Excellent<br />
Damage Bonus: 0 <br />
AC: +8 Sta: +10 Agi: +3 Fire Resist: +5  <br />
Weight: 5.1 <br />
Weapon Skill: One Hand Slash <br />
Classes: Warrior Rogue Bard Shadowknight Paladin Ranger  <br />
Races: All Races  <br />
Inventory Slot: Either Melee<br />
<br />
or go to http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6045 to see the full discussion that I was checking out.<br />
 <br />
This weapon is better than basically everything I have and I really do need it.  What is the best about this weapon is it comes off a triggered mob in Crystal Caverns which is easy to do and respawns in an hour or so (testing this now to see how feasible it would be to try and get multiples of this weapon for others besides myself) and it only costs 50pp hehe.  To get the necessary component to trigger the ghost all you do is go to Loremaster Sarl in remembrance park (in Thurgadin right across from the Icewell Keep Zone) and say &quot;black&quot; to him. He will despawn and pop up in the library.  Find him in the library and hand him 50pp and he will hand you a book, this is the trigger piece that you will hand to the Historian in Froststone (city in CC).  By doing the quest to trigger the mob you can gain faction with the annoying dwarves down there.  The mob we trigger is a Ghost of Burdael.  Stats on him are lvl 50-52 SK, HT's for 701 and hits 40-60's.  Has low hp for his lvl, which means it will probably be overkill when we go after him.  From what I have read on the mob he's cake to a group of 50+ and a lvl 60 monk and cleric can lay waste to him.  That part is easy and I could probably take him down with Zyhri no prob, but he spawns in the middle of the stalag terror caves so we would have to waste the tunnel before triggering.<br />
<br />
Here is what I propose, since a lot of us have alts that could benefit from the 20% xp benefits and loots in this zone I was thinking we could go in and kill this mob, then log in alts and play them there till the historian repops.  This way we can get quite a few of these, as well as quite a bit of xp (you can easily ding here in 4 hours in the 30-40 range).  ***NOTE***I am in no way trying to replace the younger-gen tues nights raids, but figured that doing it this way would be a lot more fun than high level people hanging out wasting things out of boredom (and also a chance for me and other recruits to meet some more of you all ;) ).  On top of being a probably needed relief from the high end game (as we all need that occasionally), this would also be a good way to farm for velium pieces and silks for trade skill work and thurg gate potions.<br />
 <br />
Aight, let me know what you think about this and who would be interested in this weapon.<br />
<br />
<br />
p.s. Those who are the &quot;questin' &quot; type might want to check out this http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest.html?quest=1277 .  This small quest that I am wanting to do is just a step in MUCH larger quest. Its worth taking a look at and reading as it is a very detailed quest and probably as involved as the 10th ring war.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Venomblood Draconis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A couple of things about this quest.<br />
<br />
I hadn't heard that the ghost dropped anything but the quest weapon required for the Spirit of Garzicor quest out of Skyshrine, but if that has changed, then so much the better. <br />
<br />
Despawning the Historian by giving him the book to spawn the ghost will cause him to be unspawned for an hour, or so I understand, so you can only farm the ghost once an hour.<br />
<br />
As an aside note, I try to hand the book in every time I go down into the caverns to work Froststone faction, and it is not a speedy way to do it. If I'm down in CC, the ghost is probably up.<br />
<br />
Just a couple of things you may want to be aware of.<br />
<br />
Venomblood Draconis<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mekil Jueaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks VB, I knew about the long wait between the repop of the historian, that's why I was proposing to take mid level alts down there to play and level while we wait for the historian to pop back up. The only thing that I know the ghost drops is the Onyxbrand, and this is equipable.  The weapon is a component for the Garzicor quest, but its a good weapon itself, thus my interest in getting one. (Currently the best weapon I have is a jagged long sword which I'm borrowing)<br />
<br />
Let me know anything else I may be missing :)<br />
<br />
<br />
My two lil' uns are parked there and will be parked there till I hit 47 hehe (or go raidin) as this is an awesome xp zone.</div></div><hr />
