<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Variz</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 10:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm currently a level 52 ranger looking for some solo spots to get me to 54 and beyond. I play during the day mostly and finding a group is tough to say the least. I don't like rockhoppers in luclin for some reason so that idea is out. EW seems to have too few blues, and the ones that are there are way to far out. Can anyone help me out? When I can't find a group (which is quite often) I find myself playing an alt character. I'd really love to have a backup plan and be able to solo somewhere. Keep in mind I don't have a tolan's bracer, so arrows are an issue. =) Thanks in advance.<br />

EW not enough blues, I agree totally. And I dunno why you don't do rockhoppers, but I can tell you why I dont....they are the most uber freaking camped mobs on my server for some reason. Even at 5am, I can't do them without some quadding druid dragging his crap all over me, and 2 necros FDing adds near me every 5 minutes. The rockhopper caves on TP are worse than LOIO.....which is saying a lot...</div></div><hr />

Not ideal, but they're always available, and you can pop into KC from time to time looking for a group/VSR.</div></div><hr />

I like to solo but at 52 its tough to say the least, I had some success in Mons Letalis with the shik nar hatchlings-- most are lt blue now but drop very fast as they only have about 1k hp's. plus if you can get a partner the hunting of stonegrabbers, thought leechs, mature hoppers etc... are all blue &amp; good.<br />
<br />
Im with you on the DS hoppers pain in the arse too many hp's and often i get them down too 1 bub and have to zone because some jacka$$ trained me.<br />
<br />
get a partner &amp; hit Mons!! ----the zone not the adult entertainment venue in Tampa, Fl.<br />

<br />
Seriously though, there are some mobs in Burning Woods that are Blue you can do: Verdant Giants (don't mess with Ancients), Sarnak Avengers and Champions, Some of the Skellies, maybe some of the Apes (dont mess with Gullerback solo).<br />
<br />
Haven't tried this, but Katta Guards near the Twilight Sea Zone Out I hear are good xp (if you don't care about faction) and there are some Mobs you can solo in Scarlet Desert too.<br />
<br />
Some of the named Aliens in Tenebrous Mountains are dark blue and not too hard. But I haven't messed with many of them so don't count my word as 100% truth.</div></div><hr />

It is a little hard at times.  Well it can be a big pain in the ass to do.  I do run into trouble alot.  But they rarely resist my spells, which some people said they would.  They have alot of HP.  And if you agro something best bet is to root em all, sit camp.  Since its tough for me at 51 i left there and grped, but if u can get a healer your set, xp is still good.  GL</div></div><hr />

Flew through two levels there. Just pull them to track zone line and fear them along the wall. You will see the bar actually move. :)</div></div><hr />
