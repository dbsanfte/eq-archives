<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moriahh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings!<br />
<br />
I am a fairly new barbie shaman, killing kobolds for ringmail and plat in the Warrens at the moment, and I have a couple of easy questions about slow spells...<br />
<br />
1)  I have seen the percentage of the various slows posted here (and at Caster's Realm), and I'm not sure how to interpret them.  What does a slow of 50% mean?  <br />
<br />
a)  Is the mob's speed reduced by 50%?  (I.e., hitting half as often.)  or<br />
b)  Is it calculated like haste spells:  mobs speed = 100%/(100% + 50%)?  (I.e., mob hits two-thirds as often.)<br />
<br />
2)  What resist is checked on main-line slows?  (Not disease-based ones I've recently read about.)<br />
<br />
Oh, and while I'm at it....<br />
<br />
3)  I traded some level 1 shaman buffs to some high-levels camping the ice giants for a fine steel morning star (lots of fun running through the tundra at level 3 :rolleyes: ), so I've only been maxing out 1HB.  Any recommendations on weapons skills to keep maxed?  I get the vague sense that I should be working on either 2HB or piercing as well... And if so, what's a good cheap weapon to practice with?<br />
<br />
Thanks much in advance for any help!  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I could give you an answer to your first question, but since I'm not absolutely certain as to whether it's correct, I'll leave that for someone else.<br />
<br />
Our normal slows are magic-based, so Magic Resistance is what they are checked against.<br />
<br />
Fine Steel or Velium are fine, cheap options at low levels. A Runed Totem Staff also works for 2H Blunt. Try to keep all three weapon skills as close to maxed as possible. 2H Blunt is useful when soloing, while there are great Piercing weapons (including our epic) for Shaman later in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">House's answers are exactly what I would have said.<br />
<br />
Could you explain this:1) b) Is it calculated like haste spells: mobs speed = 100%/(100% + 50%)? (I.e., mob hits two-thirds as often.) <br />
<br />
Is that really how haste %s work?  They're never actually written on items so people are calculating them...so are you sure that they're really calculating them that way and not the first way?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Moriahh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks Dandi (and House) for the answers!  I'm still looking for an answer to #1...  <br />
<br />
A mob slowed 75% hits:<br />
a) 4 times slower.<br />
b) 1/1.75 = 43% slower.<br />
<br />
Dandi, there's a really good guide to haste on Monkly Business (posted by Xaas Swiftail):<br />
<br />
http://www.monkly-business.com/articles2.asp?ArticleNum=67<br />
<br />
There's also a pretty comprehensive list of haste items and percents on the message boards there...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">75% slow would slow the mob's attack speed by 75%, i.e. they would attack 4 times as slow.<br />
<br />
Your equation is incorrect. 1 - (1/1.75) = .43 is how you actually arrived at that number. The actual equation should be;<br />
<br />
1 - (1 * .75) = .25<br />
<br />
Let's use x as the value of the mob's normal attack speed. If I am slowing the mob with a 75% slow, I first have to find out what is 75% of x, then subtract that value from x. So there are 2 operations here;<br />
<br />
x * y = z<br />
<br />
x - z = s (the new attack speed)<br />
<br />
If x = 1 , as in your example, then 1 * .75 = .75 and 1 - .75 = .25 so the new attack speed is .25 (25% of x). Or, 1 - (1 * .75) = .25<br />
<br />
<br />
You'll have to excuse me now, I think my brain blew a fuse.</div></div><hr />
