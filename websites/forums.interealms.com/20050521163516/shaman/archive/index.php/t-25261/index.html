<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Panspar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I would like to thank all the members of this website, you have been a valuable asset to the game for me over the last 5 years. I never posted much, hehe, actually hardly at all, but I was always listening. <br />
<br />
From the moment Panspar dinged lvl 10, I always referenced this site for pointers on quests, techniques, hunting grounds, equipment etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have now moved on to EQ2 and started a Shaman just recently with the name Panspar, I like to look at this new character as a descendent of a Panspar that lived long ago in a Norrath that once used to exist, keeping in mind the story line that has evolved in EQ2.<br />
<br />
<br />
Like some of the other retired members have posted, and thier sentiments, I like to think of Panspar resting back in a easy chair overlooking the ledge area not far from Bandl where he once hunted and grouped with allies battling the bears, goblins and orcs.<br />

PS: I hope the EQ2 section grows:)</div></div><hr />
