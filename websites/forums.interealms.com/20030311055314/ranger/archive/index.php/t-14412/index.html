I know some people posted info in an earlier thread, but I wanted to get latest data since this seems patch dependent :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Enorme</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i have the exact same dilema, i am a 49 ranger with all pieces for the swifty... id appreciate if anyone can say 100% sure that now, not awhile ago when requirements seem to have been different, I can turn the pieces in and recieve my epic<br />

thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Feniix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i think it's 51, just level to 51 and get it, it won't take too long =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>TalvaranRW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You might be able to get your swifty at 49, but ya know 49 and 50 are not that hard.  I think waiting a week or so, depending on how fast you lvl is worth getting rid of the risk.  Better safe then sorry.  I mean you can live without swifty for 2 lvls can't you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Raltar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm pretty sure it is 51.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Neolore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A week or so to hit 51?  I rarely get to play.  For me to hit 51, we are talking at least a month, but more likely 2-3 months!  An d can I live without swifty for 2 levels.  I guess I could, but I am also the person who would take a ravor blade to the tape on my X-Mas presents just to get an early peek at what was inside!  It's hard when you have everything you need to get the epic, but need to go solo in JF for 2 more levels before you get it :)  Thanks for the info everyone.  I have successfully completed all steps up to the swirling sphere of color.  I may try that this week, as well as the last pasrt in Kaladim.  Will keep everyone updated.  I probably will take Talvaran's advice though and wait on the final turn-in till I hit 51 :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Legenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Funny how this same question comes up every 2 or three weeks, and every time the same (wrong) answers are given :)<br />
<br />
I can say for a fact that Swiftwind can be completed at level 49, because that's the level I completed swifty at about 2 or 3 months ago (it may even have been 48, not completely sure of that). I started the first steps at level 46 and never, ever had any trouble talking to npc's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd like to ask this, then.  Everyone asks whats the lowest level to get the epic.  Holwever, what I'd like to know is, has anyone handed in the stuff and NOT gotten the epic, and if so, what level were you at the time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>TalvaranRW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Whateve ryou decide GL! hope you get your swifty, and god speed on 51 :D oh yea and on the getting 51 in a week i wasn't sure how fast you leveled.  I mean some people it takes a month to get a level and others it takes 4 days to get 5 levels (the people who had 65 within a few days of the PoP release.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tanien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Not 2 minutes ago, I took a level 46 guild ranger to complete the turnins and collect both swiftwind and earthcaller. Both were handed to him with no issues. <br />
<br />
So. If your faction is okay, it can be done at 46. Just watched it happen. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rimril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Theres a ranger on layns that got swifty at 47. Shes 48 atm</div></div><hr />

  I couldn't wait so I did the turn-in and voila, I have Swifty :)  I am currently 49, and had no problems with the quest at all.  I wanted to post this since everyone has said they have seen it done, or thiere is someone who has done it, but no names have been given.  Well, I did do it at 49 on the The Rathe server with Neolore NeverFound.  I even took screenshots if you are still skeptical.  I completed this on 26 Nov 02.  If you want me to email you the pictures, post your email on here.<br />

Thanks,<br />
