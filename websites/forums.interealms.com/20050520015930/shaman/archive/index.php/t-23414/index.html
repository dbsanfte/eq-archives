Never heard anything about this so surprised to find out about a beta on Gamespot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Never heard of that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">IIRC, its being built by a French group.  Its gotten little press, but quite a bit of what i've read has been positive.  I myself played in the beta a bit, and the biggest thing I noticed was that it was very laggy - which I'm told is because most everything is server side.  For example, you'd click on a merchant to talk, and the window would pop up but no text would show up for a few seconds...sometimes after you left him.<br />
<br />
I think everything was skill based (as opposed to level), but I could be wrong.  The graphics were pretty decent, but it really didn't keep my attention for more than a couple of hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I saw an article earlier this year with probably a hundred or so looming MMORPG's.  Gonna be the dotcom crash all over again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Peroxide</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Online games will never crash.  Whats going to happen is companies are going to learn to get the quantity they want, cash, they are going to have to start putting out quality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I got into Beta for Ryzom a long time ago, probably close to a year ago.  So I can't really comment on the current state of the game but I uninstalled it after 2 days when I first got it.  I was not impressed at all and found it quite boring.   Hopefully for them its changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ah this is probably one of the reasons its stayed quite quiet I guess. I am going to try the Beta though, see what original ideas it has.</div></div><hr />
