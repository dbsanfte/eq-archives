<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Before I post what I want to post I'd like to say something. Your first reaction (at least in the past when people have posted things like this) will be to say stuff like &quot;shut up,&quot; &quot;if you dont like it go roll a cleric,&quot; etc etc. I'm not asking to beef shaman or any other class, nor to nerf Clerics, I was just wondering the opinions of people here.<br />
<br />
So just the other day we were going to start a raid. It wasn't during our typical &quot;online, raiding&quot; time so we didn't have too many people online. Regardless we gathered, but in the midst of making groups we hear those dreaded words, &quot;We dont have enough Clerics.&quot; That just got me thinking. Eventually we did get enough clerics, and we did kill our target, but I thought about this for a while afterwards. Each class plays a roll in a raid or even an exp group but Clerics, in my opinion, bring one too many essential things to a raid. <br />
<br />
-Best buffs.<br />
-Unparalleled resurrection ability.<br />
-Best healing ability.<br />
<br />
Anyways this brings me to my point. I am not saying nerf or buff this. But I think Everquest has placed a little too much emphasis on this class. Never has a raid been called off because there weren't enough druids, or rangers, or paladins except for in very very rare cases. <br />
<br />
What are your thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No enchanters can break a raid because you don't have generally necessary clarity or mez.<br />
No warriors can break a raid because you don't have adequate tanking (ie /disc).<br />
No rogues can break a raid because you can't pick a lock.<br />
No shaman can break a raid because you don't have enough debuffing power.<br />
No mages can break a raid because it takes too long to crawl through to the place you are trying to raid since you need coh to get the people up to the raid that may be replacing older people on a raid.<br />
No necros can break a raid because you might need to summon corpses to the raid depending on the situation.<br />
No druids/clerics can break a raid because you don't have proper healing power.<br />
No wizards can break a raid because you just don't have enough DPS for certain key raid targets, and mass xloc is vital to certain encounters (end of emp fight/mid way through RZ script).<br />
No monks can break a raid because you don't have the needed feign pulling for certain encounters.<br />
No bards can break a raid because you need resists or extra mezzing or charming or AE mana or whatever else they are needed for in that particular raid.<br />
No knights can break a raid because you need them and their non-melee based taunting abilities (think TZ spawn in RZ script)<br />
<br />
Null discussion.  Just about every class is a necessary class for a raid to be successful.  About the only class that's not critical to raids is beastlords.  I can't think of a raid that has been or ever will be called because no BST showed up...cept for maybe some BST epic fights....  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Clerics are like warriors. Necessary at raids, but easily replaced in XP-groups and bad at soloing.<br />
<br />
So its only fair that they shine in raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Agreed, clerics are pretty fairly balanced imho.  Although they can go to hell for there melee skills =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think I phrased my post poorly. My point is that there is nothing that comes close to the cleric, thus no amount of any class can make up for an absence of a certain number of clerics. You need maybe 2 or 3 shamans, druids, enchanters, monks, etc etc to perform their roles. But you need over half a dozen clerics for most raids, and there is NO replacement for them. No class has the complete heal, the group heals and heals over time, none of that, nothing close to the rezzing or buffing power.<br />
<br />
I think my post came off as &quot;clerics are too powerful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Instead, I wanted my post to give a more &quot;raids and exp groups should be less dependant on clerics&quot; feel. And I strongly disagree that the cleric is easily replaced in exp groups. 90% of the exp groups I'm in have a cleric for the healer. another 8% have NO healer and are waiting around for a cleric and refuse to have me or a druid heal. The last 2% will accept a shaman or druid healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes, people tend to wait for the ideal group before they do anything, sadly. They miss all the fun that you can have with nonideal groups.</div></div><hr />

<br />
grrr this is my second time attemptin' this post lost the last one somehow grr i hate that lol<br />
<br />
<br />
BUt!<br />
<br />
/agree with ya' bud<br />
<br />
and honestly i find i have a heap more fun experimenting with those non &quot;ideal&quot; groups and what we can do.  My personal fav atm is Shammy, BstLord, Necro, Mage ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
but, to be honest i have been the main healer many many times in my like. . . once in poI oo..OO! wacky i tell ya' lol but fun i was very very busy ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
but to ans you Penny, i think its still all good, and that they already realized that mayhap clerics needed to share some wealth and so gave Druids Cheal at lvl 58 and us Kraggs mending i believe also lvl 58?  To help that sorta thing out.<br />
<br />
heres another way to look at it. . your not gonna have a full on raid without as many or more melee tank classes right? or hmmm as many or more pure casters?  So really its still about the same and i think it dose balance out. . . when you look at it in wider groups instead of specific classes kinda bigs the big picture out a bit better i think.<br />
<br />
okay i'm done tryi'n to think this early in the mornin' :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That's true Juujuu, but in almost all of your cases, 1 is the magic number.  I've never heard of a raid being called because &quot;We only have 2 shaman!&quot;, or &quot;there is only 1 beastlord around today!&quot;.  Clerics, on the other hand, raids are called when there are 3 or 4, and that's deemed not enough.  I think that's what the original poster was more referring to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There are three yardsticks to use when measuring a character class.<br />
<br />
1. How well does it solo?<br />
<br />
2. How well does it fit into grind groups?<br />
<br />
3. How well does it fit into raids?<br />
<br />
Clerics score low on #1 and middle to high on #2.  They score very high on #3.  Shaman scores high on #1, high on #2, and low on #3 (at least after the first shaman).  This seems reasonable to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zillanex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Agree Weiss my clerics soloability is crap, okey he might not have the best items but i self buff to just over 2k hp and 838ac(lvl 49) still lightblue green mobs beat me silly.<br />
<br />
And to get to #3 a cleric needs #2, solo ability is a joke shure the proccing hammer might improve it a bit but that won't help a cleric in the 30's<br />
<br />
As for numbers of cleric needed on raids, guess the amount of dmg the mobs do nowdays require it, but for most xp groups having a cleric is nice but not a must.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure this information is all current as of maybe a month ago... but there is a grand total of 1 good team 65 cleric, 1 64 cleric.  The 65's name is Cirus and he just ebayed, so there is currently NO good team 65 cleric that knows what he is doing =P... and good team ie black prophecy/black crown can still raid and have always raided using a Heal Chain with shamans, druids in it.. and sadly sometimes pallies i hear =P  in group scenarios we end up using pallies for self healing, druids for healing, and i slow/spot heal.  So to say that a raid cannot be done without 5-6 clerics is beyond me... i'd love to have 5-6 high level clerics ON MY TEAM!!  Currently i know a total of 2 50-55 clerics, Rigbit and Chelynn or something like that.  Pallies do the rezzing usually and we eat the xp loss because... hey.. there are no clerics... and even in our 50's we eat exp losses with no rez because no pallies to rez.  On our server we have learned to live without clerics because honestly, they suck nutz at pvp.  the first person people gun for in pvp fights is the cleric.. so its a harsh life to be a cleric.. but hey.. we've learned to live without them.. i'm sure you guys can =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What Juujuu said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It seems to me that the problem isn't so often lack of clerics.  They are boring to play, but can easily be botted, its lack of warriors.<br />
<br />
That has got to be the single most boring class in the game, yet almost all high end encounters are desinged with defensive in mind. We seem to have more problems with warrior burn out then any other class and unlike clerics you can't easily bot a tank. <br />
<br />
As far as healing ability, druids are so close to clerics in the mid range it isn't even funny. You can easily replace a cleric with a druid in a raid for most function and be fine on anything below the top end stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My guild usually calls raids due to lack of Enchanters or tanks. But then we're a nutty bunch who beleive a warrior is at his best when his health bar is purple.<br />
<br />
In exp groups, though, I try to never group without a cleric. Virtue is better than KEI, because KEI won't help me live through aggro longer. Someone handling the heals, when Kragg's heals maybe 1 / 5 of a health bar for a stupid amount of mana, is also very nice. The only problem I have is that it puts another goober on the haste chain. I hate casting haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yeah I hate that, there are sometimes raids that are postphoned for say an hour because there is not enough clerics. The class is very very essential to raids. And for example recruitment, cleric with  say a bad attitude is more likely to get in that a ranger with bad attitude. Its the basic flaw when they did make eq is the balance and can't exactly change much of it now , without one class or other complaining,  or changing the total system around meaning a lot of implications and turmoil. The interdependency of classes is the nice thing but can be too interdependant for certain classes. <br />
<br />
Anyway its the social interaction that keeps people playing, the gameplay is just the side product.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">We have 2 main clerics in a guild of 24 ppl (all 65).  <br />
<br />
One of them asks everytime you invite him for grp if he can bring anyone else but his cleric (he has 2 level 60+ alts on the same account).<br />
<br />
The other also has her original 65 monk main and a 61 mage twink on her account.<br />
<br />
I spend a good deal of my time playing only shaman and boxing 3rd or 4th cleric on raids (which I find to be rather taxing on resistant mobs - coordinating with bards for HOS, making sure meleers are proccing tash - yeah our 3 chanters hardly play either, not missing my turn in chain or ramp heal, not missing slow/sinia resists messages  /cry).<br />
<br />
However, now that my druid is 64 I will probably start bringing him more as he offers a lot more utility than a cleric and can really heal amost as well with his big Karana heal.<br />
<br />
While its true you need clerics for raids and all, they are boring as **** to play.  Try it sometime.  YAWN... when I was levelling the box cleric to 65 and doing SCM3 and such.  Most of the time he sat on the other machine and I pushed the cheal button every few mins.  Rarely did I have to play him main and when I did I about went out of my mind with boredom.   I spend all my time stunning things and playing purple club.  booooring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My main is a cleric, She is 62 atm.  I think the biggest advantage of having a cleric is simply the rez capabilities.  If the party is gonna whipe, having more clerics around to attempt to camp might save alot of downtime (if your into the camp out strat) or having alot of secondary clerics around might save alot of time if the working clerics end up biting it.<br />
<br />
The healing can be mostly done by Druids or Shamans nowadays, so I would put most of my bet on the rez ability.<br />
<br />
Playing a cleric is horribly boring.  I pretty much /horse, /cast 1, wait wait wait, /cast 1, wait wait wait.  I throw a nuke out and its 900 points of dmg for more mana than I care to spend.  I try and melee and end up getting hit when I try and heal.. so most of the time its just sit.. cast 1... cast 1.  It gets very boring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Playing a cleric in the right situation can be fun.  just when there is a lot it gets to be boring.  I remeber having to play a cleric on VT cause we just had nooo healing power and plenty of shamans.  I had fun doing it cause it was a change of pace and wasnt totaly boring since we where lacking healing.<br />
<br />
As for clerics being required.  If you get enouhg of druids and stuff you can do with one cleric.  Its just not as effecient.  Sure it sucks but what do you want to do?  i dont htink there is an easy change</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">To make a cleric fun, have the group multi-pull and OT.  Or load root and run your own CC<br />
<br />
<br />
  As for people who haven't ever grouped without a cleric, find a shaman that is good, and he'll tell you that if a cleric HAS to be in the group, he'd rather they shut up and melee.  At least, I would.   I can outheal a cleric in any exp group I have ever tolerated being in.<br />
<br />
  Top end raids.. they would be REALLY hard without clerics, but there is always another way to skin a cat, and a tight druid rotation with shammies on Tnarg and Q can work just fine.<br />
<br />
  as for rez, I wouldn't mind seeing that on a couple more classes, but the same would go for corpse summoning and clarity in that case.  2 classes can rez, 2 classes can give lasting mana regen (BL and enchie... druid Po9 may fit here, no clue how much it gives), 2 classes can summon corpses.   Other than those abilities, which are in no way vital, but in many ways helpful, everything is pretty well spread out, except pet weapons... I could go for more people that can summon pet gear....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It seems alot of EQ was designed around having a cleric in every group.  That is one in six people when there are 14 more classes.  Im really glad Druids became better healers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Just look at guild rosters. Clerics are like money, you can never have enough. <br />
Of course i can do a year old content with Druids and Shamans and if you think you have an argument there that's fine. There's a handful of encounters where Enchanters and even Warriors are as crucial as Clerics, for the rest, it doesn't really matter. Look, i just mentioned the holy trinity there and obviously it's a coincidence!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Clerics get the short end of the stick in a lot of cases, IMO.<br />
<br />
Think about it: besides the ability to rez, shammies and druids are often 60-70% as effective as a cleric.  Add a druid AND a shammie to a group and the cleric will only get logged when someone dies.<br />
<br />
Consider CHeals: in most cases (read exp groups, minis, etc.), that CHeal is going to land for less than the 4.7k that a druid can heal, and often even less than we can heal for.  Even considering the extra 15% efficiency of cleric heals, a competent druid with one of us as a backup healer should have no problem keeping a plate tank up in all but raid encounters.<br />
<br />
Consider buffs: virtue is about 1500 HPs, while focus + sta is (depending, obviously) usually about 600.  The Druid's Po9 is about the same at 618.  And they stack.  And don't forget about regen, which is a dramatic amount of healing for the mana in an exp group. <br />
<br />
Consider debuffs: shammies reign here with slow/cripple, but druids also get useful debuffs like the Ro's line which cuts a mob's ATK and AC.  These also stack.  Clerics get nothing like this, except for maybe fear (if you consider that a debuff).<br />
<br />
Consider DoTs/Nukes: while modest by necro/wizzy standards, druids and shammies can both add meaningful DPS to a group.  Clerics, on the other hand, cannot realistically nuke unless you are fighting undead, and their undead-only dots are not terribly powerful.<br />
<br />
Consider other utility spells: druids can port, snare, and we can both cast sow.  Clerics don't even get regular invisibility.<br />
<br />
Consider mana regeneration: druids and clerics both get several self-buffs that increase mana regeneration, but the druid's are about twice as good.  Po9, for instance, regens 8 mana per tick.  And of course, we bury them both with what is arguably the best mana regen in the game. <br />
<br />
Consider solo ability: I won't rehash well-known facts about druid and shammie soloing feats since these are both well-documented.  Note however, that clerics are handicapped in both the efficiency of their DPS spells AND their rate of mana regeneration, which should make it pretty obvious that clerics can't solo for ****, unless the mob is undead.  Hell, there isn't even any recognized progression of zones in which clerics to move to as they level up, should they choose to solo.  Druids at least have been fairly successful at petitioning for a couple places here and there (e.g. ME, CS, etc.) where they can quad.<br />
<br />
Consider rez ability: they can do it, and we cannot. (Although Pally rezzes are a mere 6% off at end-game).<br />
<br />
These are all situational factors, and so its hard to reduce them all to a single percentile of efficiency, but I don't think its far-fetched to state that druids and shammies are about 2/3-3/4 as effective at what clerics do, while bringing many, many other benefits to the table.<br />
<br />
Does that seem worth the ability to rez?  Well, in a raid encounter, yes, it does. However, it seems to me that they give up a lot to get that extra 25% in effectiveness.<br />
<br />
Maybe that why, in my experience and guild, we generally only see clerics at events that are going to be a close enough fight that the extra 25% of so in HP buffs and heals is really going to matter.  Other than that, someone usually leaves a cleric camped out somewhere nearby to rez the dead.<br />
<br />
How many cleric bots do you have in your guild?  If its anything like mine, that number will easily be 4-5 times the number of other bots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">As many stated the cleric sacrifices a lot to be so valuable in raid situations.<br />
<br />
Its a one dimensional class that has been passed over and nerfed due to one single thing, Complete Heal.  This is a poorly considered spell.  Clerics had the ability to heal 10,000 hit points at 39, at THIRTY-NINE!  Thus the class has been nerfed on many instances like the Velious and Kunark BP effects, lowering CH to heal 7,500hp and the summoned hammers.  The class has been passed over for upgrades repeatedly and tossed bones (summoned hammers) to apease them while their skills (rez, CH) were handed out to other classes.<br />
<br />
What a cleric has is one overpowered benchmark spell, 96% rez with the ability to make it clicky via epic, buffs, feeble nukes, feeble melee dependant upon one line of items' procs and lack of utility.  Also clerics get the overwhelming responsibility of everyone's lives, the continuing existance of the group and the success of the raid.<br />
<br />
It takes a special type of person to be a cleric.  Not everyone can be one happily.  Ok ok, no one can be one completely happily! We do tend to get bitter after a while.  Clerics burn out, they change mains or make alts.   It is no fair that a raid MUST have X number of X class but please realize that its a huge responsiblity and burden to carry as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">That's true Juujuu, but in almost all of your cases, 1 is the magic number.

Clerics, on the other hand, raids are called when there are 3 or 4, and that's deemed not enough.  I think that's what the original poster was more referring to.<br />
<br />
LOL try raiding w/o a shaman or with only 2.. most of the encounters I am on guild WILL wipe..  ie if you have 2 shaman, then usually they are scrapping what they can get together to rebuff/mgb stuff and everyone mages/chanters/bards are debuffing so he doesn't get a resist.. <br />
<br />
Even on an easy fight we had 4 clerics 4 tanks, 3 shaman, 2+ druids, monk, 2x enchanter.. the mini raid was called off because not enough dps = clerics will go oom.. <br />
<br />
Lots of encounters need druids/shaman healing the clerics so they don't get aggro and lots require druids/shaman healing the mt to help the clerics because clerics can't keep up.. <br />
<br />
I think the problem is people just leveling sooo fast that they want the easy way.. ie vox is duable EASY with 18 maybe with 12 people.. every vox raid I've seen besides the suicide ones don't start until you got 6 clerics + 28 others.. all she does is debuff! :)<br />
<br />
Lots of mobs can't even being w/o a rogue because you can't track the guy! (rogue can go take a peak).. if you have 0 rogues on a raid, forget it, if you wipe you don't know when it's safe if you camped a cleric, and there is no one to drag corpses etc.. <br />
<br />
All clerics can really do is raid.. groups they are worthless except for their virtue, I'll take a druid over cleric any day in an xp group outside of elementals... and I'm sure once I get used to it, won't want a cleric again :)<br />
<br />
IMO clerics are very well balanced.. otoh shaman are waaay too powerful but hey I'm not gonna complain!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Sorry, thats wrong khozik. While its not the most desirable thing to do, one shaman CAN support a whole raid, and two have no problem whatsoever. <br />
<br />
Sure, they may debuff a tad later minimize the risk of dying and holding up the raid, but it is no raidbreaker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Cali I'd encourage you to play your shaman(ette) to a higher level... I visited the cleric boards just out of curiosity and I did notice many people were members of the &quot;BCC&quot; as you put it. <br />
<br />
I'll say it again, my point in this thread was not &quot;so and so is too powerful,&quot; or &quot;this and that needs buffing,&quot; but instead that the game revolves around this class, the cleric, a little too much.<br />
<br />
Unparalelled healing, rezzing and buffing abilities. THE most saught after class for raiding and experience grouping. do I really need to say more?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">You can never have too many clerics on a raid. The Most important thing they contribute is their healing and this is as it shoud be. Their role is to be the Best healer in the game and that is what makes them absolutely essential on raids. Our most important role is to slow and that makes us just as essential in many situations.<br />
<br />
There is a balance, if clerics are scarce enough for this to be a problem, then perhaps their class has issues that need fixing to make it more attractive and less boring to play. You won't fix the problem by making them less essential.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">It would be kinda good if say clerics were more melee as they have been made and another class did get rez. For example you are going into a dungeon, deep in. Someone dies you are buggered. Involving a big time sink.  I see entirely what pennyantics is saying and I agree no nerfs should be done or no classes are overpowered. Its just this fundamental balance.<br />
<br />
I think its interesting looking at DAoC and the balance they have chosen.</div></div><hr />

I know many groups were hard pressed to get a heal from their cleric, cause he was busy melee-ing. There were multiple posts about how much DPS clerics were able to pump out.<br />
<br />
Now the both sides of the coin are coming out.<br />
<br />
What happened to playing the game and having fun?<br />
<br />
Then again, this is the view from someone who got tired of being LFG as a monk after the nerf, and took up 3-boxing, and been having a blast ever since.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Yeah Wastrel, then they nerfed the hammer down and it became relegated to green farming or boredom status.  A few clerics with uber gear (primals and awesome haste) can whoop butt, though it should never (in a group setting) take priority over healing (when the cleric is the only healer).<br />
<br />
Most clerics do love their class and love the game, but hate the current state of &quot;balance&quot;.  Or simply become bitter due to said current state.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Yeah but DAoC has rez for like a quarter of the classes -- you have a healer, you have a rezzer.  And the XP hit is identical, the only difference is how healthy you are when you're brought back.  So given 2-3 minutes to rest, there's virtually no difference between a base class (Shaman, Warder, Friar) rez and one of the nice Cleric/Healer/Druid rezzes.</div></div><hr />

Sure, they may debuff a tad later minimize the risk of dying and holding up the raid, but it is no raidbreaker.<br />
<br />
To us raids might mean different things.. when I raid the mobs quad for 1100.. if the shaman dies.. the guild has to wait (70people?) for a rez and maybe mod rod+canni and slow the next few before you die and we wait.. until you can't mem malos because you deleveled.. now if the puller brings 2 or 3 and the slower dies then most likely all 70 others will die..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Dangrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Consider CHeals: in most cases (read exp groups, minis, etc.), that CHeal is going to land for less than the 4.7k that a druid can heal, and often even less than we can heal for.  Even considering the extra 15% efficiency of cleric heals, a competent druid with one of us as a backup healer should have no problem keeping a plate tank up in all but raid encounters.15% is wrong, it used to be, all classes had a 10% reduction from listed heals on lucy and clerics had a 5% bonus. The reduction was removed for all classes so clericsget 5% on all heals listed on lucy, CH excluded (as always) and no classes get a penalty.<br />
<br />
<br />
Consider DoTs/Nukes: while modest by necro/wizzy standards, druids and shammies can both add meaningful DPS to a group.  Clerics, on the other hand, cannot realistically nuke unless you are fighting undead, and their undead-only dots are not terribly powerful.For comparison:<br />
Destroy undead (64 nuke) 1200 damage / 300m, 4:1<br />
Exile undead (55 nuke) 725 damage / 250m, 2.9:1<br />
Sermon of Penitence (62 dot) 1025 damage / 300m, 3.42:1<br />
Epitath of Life (52 dot) 750 damage / 275m, 2:06:1<br />
<br />
Now this is UNDEAD only, our best &quot;type&quot; to kill. If you to live can you drop the dots and go to Condemnation (62 1100 / 365, 3:01, 7sec recast) and Judgement (56 925 / 325, 2.84, 7 sec recast).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Consider mana regeneration: druids and clerics both get several self-buffs that increase mana regeneration, but the druid's are about twice as good.  Po9, for instance, regens 8 mana per tick.  And of course, we bury them both with what is arguably the best mana regen in the game.Druids get Mask of the forest (4m / tick) over clerics. You could make a case for PoTN as it is 8m / tick and at 63 compared to 65 for clerics version (AoTZ). So Druid is 50% better sitting on a horse, without a horse is cleric ahead through Yalup (9ish mana / tick if you time it exactly and dont have SCR3++). <br />

<br />
I even mentioned debuffing a bit later in that case, because aggro deaths would hold up the raid. Usually tanks there have taunt weapons good enough so that you wont get aggro too easily.<br />
<br />
Yes you have to change your tactics a bit. But you wont have to call the raid off. And that was kinda the whole point of this! :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Tagra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">My point is that there is nothing that comes close to the cleric, thus no amount of any class can make up for an absence of a certain number of clerics. You need maybe 2 or 3 shamans, druids, enchanters, monks, etc etc to perform their roles. But you need over half a dozen clerics for most raids, and there is NO replacement for them. No class has the complete heal, the group heals and heals over time, none of that, nothing close to the rezzing or buffing power.<br />
<br />
<br />
Naw, druids can replace clerics in healing now on raids and in groups.  If you aren't using them in that function, then you're not using your resources well.  Or you need to recruit some druids.  <br />
<br />
Go over to the druid forum and hear them complain that they're getting used just to heal on raids these days instead of nuking.  There's a reason for it.  They're good at it.  Not as good as clerics, but they can definitely serve in the place of clerics.<br />
<br />
And, that's something to think about as a class, before you go asking for big heals.  Ask yourself if that's the role you want to play on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Raiding high end as the only shaman is possible just sucks hard core.

<br />
A few months ago had to do a VT raid as only shaman, again it was done.  it was a pain in the butt lucky for us stuff died so fast if it wasnt slowed it wasnt the end of the world.  But believe me it was not fun.<br />
<br />
When it gets to the PoP its all doable but its never a good idea.  you dont want to be able to lose a class if one person dies.<br />
<br />
that being said said i think its pretty balanced as it is.  Sure the number of clerics is about double of all other classes but thats whats needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Myrriaha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I came from a fun guild to a raiding guild when I hit 55, we were short clerics and had druids in the CH. The guild had 4 full time cleric and keep adding as we when, we never had to many clerics that the druid got to nuke and not play healers. All we ever heard was WooT, I get to nuke this time and not play cleric!!! Yes clerics suck as tanks, we can't solo anything but undead or greens and I have died to greens, and have been LFG for many hours some times. And before you get mad I have a 65 Cleric and was never PL'ed. Started back when Luclin first came out back in Dec 28, 2001. The cleric is not a eazy life, you med, stand, cast heal, get aggro, DA, med, repete all day long. I love getting FA but my dps is so bad most wizzys get better with a dagger. We make alt's just to have fun, (65 nec, 51 war, 39 wizzy, 31 ranger, 28 shammy). I like that some zoned need a cleric in the group else it's a long wait for bodys to pop and then have to get a cleric to come do the rez (LDoN). I log on now and get 1 to 5 group invites before I even put up LFG! Yes clerics do have a hard life and I should put my app in at BBC but it's still fun! Who else is going to look out for the group hp's? The druid is doing the wizzy job of nuking, the shammy is doing slow/haste and doing patch heals. We don't get much but what we do get is gratz. Who else can do a CH for 17400 crit? Ok, back to learking.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">To try and argue that clerics aren't any more critical than any other class is just nuts. They are usually by far the most common AND still most recruited class by any high end guild. The balance for them frankly is that its boring, and the constant pressure they feel from guilds to raid as they are so critical causes them to get burned out very quickly.<br />
<br />
Of course it's over-simplistic to say all other classes are useless while clerics are the only one required, but it's also wrong to say all classes are equally needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">So to summarize what a lot of people are saying, clerics suck at soloing but are key to raids.  They're in high demand for groups but playing one is extremely boring.  Seems to me the best solution would be to do what SOE did when they gave clerics better melee and drudis/shaman better healing; they need to spread things out more.  Give clerics more solo ability (maybe more undead zones?) and something else to do in group besides casting CH every so often, and give shaman better healing abilities so that the third, fourth, etc. shaman can actually be as valuable (or nearly as valuable) as the sventh, eigth, etc. cleric is.  As for rezzing, necros and paladins can also rez, so while I wouldn't object ot another class getting rez abilities, I don't think rezzes are what make clerics so pivotal.</div></div><hr />

the biggest single reason for us to have a cleric is to have them camped incase of wipe. yeah we WANT them but druids and shaman can make up for the lack. of course with us is usually druids cause the 1-2 shaman on the raid are working hard at debuffs and all that shamy stuff we do.<br />
<br />
if you think life is rough with only 2 shaman try being the shaman (note singular) at a seru raid, I have malos/decay/cloud of grumus/FA/and since I am the only one there with it, RGC loaded, factor in a heal, cani, and Q and I am loaded with crap to do, toss in an add or 2 and I am keeping one pinned down with VP because we lost a chanter to a mez break...ah yeah nothing beats boring game play like busting your ass and being THE one,Only slower main debuff (I passed cripple off to the chanters) the ONLY rgc for that Foul dot he proccs. it feels good when you can take that much on yourself and pull it off with no mistakes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I don't think clerics need to get nerfed or ecounters changed or whatever.<br />
It is only natural to need a higher healer/debuffer ratio in a raid enviroment. You want one slow per MOB, no matter if its Rallos Zek or a Guk Knight. But the number of heals needed is vastly different. I have no beef with this. Already encounters are moving more and more towards controlled mayhem, this by itself will make group heals, quick heals, multiple mezzers, multiple debuffers and so on more needed.<br />
<br />
What I don't like is shaman constantly seeing listed as good solo classes. We are great at soloing medium DPS MOBs with not too high magic resist that summon or otherwise cannot be kited in 10 times the amount of time ither classes need to kill that MOB.<br />
We can also decently root/DoT MOBs that for odd reasons do not summon.<br />
<br />
That does not make us a good solo class. Better then clerics maybe but then clerics solo better then warriors and noone ever says clerics are good soloers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">You CAN have too many clerics on a raid.  Nowadays with capping raid sizes, you may only NEED X amount of clerics and it MAY make more sense to fill the remainder with Y amount from another class for DPS or CC or whatever.  I think thats the whole thing with the 36 or the 54 member raids.  Shaman, one of us will do on almost ANY raid and our abilities have been handed out to every other tom, dick and class that we can be replaced to a greater extent.  Ditto for warriors.  The top guild on BB has done some of the toughest melee mobs with SKs, Pallies and even monks as an MA just to say they did it.  About the only class you do cancel a raid for these days is cleric.<br />
<br />
That said, in most grind groups (pre-elemental), I'm a better choice as a healer than a cleric.  Replace that cleric with a DPS class and mobs go down quicker, no one dies.  On LDoN hard, no way I can replace a cleric unless I have a bard puller or a really good monk.  Even so the pull rate slows down as I need to have incoming mobs snared so I have the time to malos and slow before it's engaged.</div></div><hr />

What Caanus really meant is that he can more effeciently heal than a Cleric in an xp group.

No, was reading solo places for my now 28 shammy and seen a thried about clerics solo power and that lead to this one. And I see Shammys who say they can heal better then a cleric, would love to see it. Now I only have 139aa's so a shammy with say 500aa's should be able to but would like to see a say 50 cleric and 50 shammy where the shammy can out heal the cleric.<br />
<br />
I love my shammy cuz I can kill solo with her. What else can you ask for, a class that will work good solo, dual, group or raid! My frog may be little now but she is getting there in off raid hours!<br />

<br />
However if you give the shaman or druid class cleric equivalent heals then you decimate the class with the possibile exception of being a rez-bot. Meanwhile every attempt to give the cleric an alternative role, which would make them remain viable, has ended up stepping on some other classes toes.<br />
<br />
Sort of like shaman in a way. They have one uber ability the class couldn't survive without. And their class progression is stunted on the basis of the importance of that one ability.<br />
<br />
So in essence it is an issue, but there's no easy answers and a lack of interest from SoE in the hard ones.</div></div><hr />

If you want to reduce EQ, its just pushing buttons, all classes are equally &quot;boring&quot;.  There is nothing inherant in playing a Cleric that makes it boring.  Watching health bars?  Way more exciting than pushing auto-attack.  Casting a well timed heal which saves a character?  Quite a rush.  Handling a five mob pull with no crowd control, while having to burn three Divine Auras?  Lots of fun.<br />
