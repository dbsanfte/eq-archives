<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not 100% sure this has been mentioned here, but as I was trolling the boards at work tonight I found this at EQTraders :http://eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q142&amp;menustr=120037000000<br />
Basically, there is a &quot;Quest&quot; in the Abysmal Sea for each tradeskill (including class specific ones) that will get you to a skill of 56 for free, other than just a bit of your time....a worth while investment in time and noteworthy for those working on the Coldain Shawl, PoP gate talisman etc to get a leg up on a skill.<br />
you can only get 20 attempts at a time, and 100 total, but it apparently is a guaranteed skill of 56, which doesnt suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grumpf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">for the shaman its makeing lots of dies for that female alchemy vendor.<br />
you have to make like 100 of each black, blue, red, green dyes.<br />
after that she enables you to filter samples of taelusian sludge.<br />
you start with 2 filtered / combine and get more / combine once you filtered some. no idea what those filtered samples are good for atm tho.</div></div><hr />
