<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know this isn't a shaman specific topic, but I've found this forum so helpful in the past that I figured I might as well ask anyway.  Basically I was just wondering if someone could explain the faction choices of luclin for me briefly.  Is it the same three way thing that Velious has (shadow haven, seru, katta), or is it just katta vs. seru, and either way which side is &quot;better&quot; to be on?   Any help on this would be greatly appreciated, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As far as I am aware Luclin is Katta vs Seru (although I beleive you can get both up with a lot of work).  I would probably rate Katta as better as there are a few decent quests based there and I have yet to find a single worthwhile seru quest (am seru faction myself depressingly)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Seru faction is easier to raise, that's for sure. Kill thought leeches or spire spirits in Mons Letalis, and you'll raise many (but not all I think) Seru factions.<br />
<br />
As far as I know, there are actually 2 opposing factions within Katta itself, and you can possibly raise one by killing the other.<br />
<br />
And Shadowhaven is independant, to raise SH faction you just need to do a delivery quest. This is well worth doing, as you can buy almost anything in SH, especially useful things like fish scales (for trips to the Grey).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are a ton of factions for each city.<br />
<br />
Seru:<br />
Seru<br />
Hand Legionarries<br />
Hand of Seru<br />
Heart of Seru<br />
Eye of Seru<br />
Citizens of Seru<br />
Shoulders of Seru<br />
<br />
<br />
Katta:<br />
Nathyn Illuminious <br />
Katta Castellum Citizens<br />
Validus Custodus <br />
Magus Conlegium <br />
Concilium Universus <br />
<br />
And they are really interwoven.  Ex:<br />
Killing the Seru Guards in Marus Seru and Nether Lair will give you Positive hits with 2 katta factions and 2 Seru factions but Negative hits with 3 Seru factions.<br />
<br />
- Hand Legionnaires <br />
- Hand of Seru <br />
+ Eye of Seru <br />
- Seru <br />
+ Heart of Seru <br />
+ Validus Custodus <br />
+ Magus Conlegium<br />
<br />
There are tons of quests and mobs that give out different faction hits...but without a lot of research you're likely to get jumped by another NPC on a different faction in the same city.</div></div><hr />
