<br />
It's about time we had a forum to keep all our best posts for easy access.  If you have a suggestion for a post that should be moved to The Medicine Cabinet, post to this thread.<br />
<br />
Tired of the what race is best posts?  Who should I duo with?  Which AA should I get now?!!  Write a guide, post it and post a link here to have it moved.<br />
<br />
You should be able to reply to posts in this forum the normal way, by clicking the reply button.  However, you will not be able to post new threads to this forum.  Making a new thread will send your thread into a moderation queue and it just gets deleted, so if you have a thread you would like to have posted into The Medicine Cabinet, post it in the correct forum and then post a link here.</div></div><hr />

It did come in handy last night on a raid :)</div></div><hr />

It currently resides within this (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=20036) thread over on the equipment boards.<br />

Just the link should work, with maybe a description of what it is, not sure if posting all those tables would be a bit much.</div></div><hr />

I still look this one up once in a while for a laugh if nothing else. And I still occasionally do see a &quot;what is project alpha?&quot; posting.</div></div><hr />
