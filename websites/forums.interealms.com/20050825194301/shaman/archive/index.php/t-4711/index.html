<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I guess I must be the only person left on my server that has any ethics at all when it comes to buying and selling.<br />
<br />

<br />
When you auction an item on your server's MB, and someone responds they are interested in buying it, do you...<br />
<br />
A.) Cease auctioning the item and hold on to it for the person to pick up in game?<br />
<br />
B.) Keep auctioning to see if you can get a higher price for the item?<br />
<br />
Personally I do the first.  <br />
<br />
I had planned on meeting someone online today to complete a transaction when I send the guy a tell and ask where I could meet him.  The fool sends me back a tell saying that he was sorry, but he'd already spent the money on something else.<br />
<br />
Granted, that's your right to do so, but damn it, let me know so I can keep auctioning the item and not hold onto it for 2 stinkin days.  I swear some people have no respect for others.<br />
<br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
Sorry, needed to vent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I kinda like B...Um...that's why it's called &quot;auction&quot;. Highest bidder is not a bad way to do things for some items.<br />
<br />
For example...I have something for sale for 100...If 2 folks respond to me when I /auction, then I tell the second guy that I already have a buyer, but if he'd like to increase the offer over 100pp, I'll let the first person know.<br />
<br />
Seems fair to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It depends.  If the guy just wants you to wait 30 minutes while he rounds up some money and comes to meet you, then hold on to it for him.  If he wants you to wait two days, say &quot;sorry, I am going to keep trying to sell.  In two days if I havent sold it, it's all yours.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kariina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am conducting my business differently these days.<br />
<br />
I advertise my prices on the server mb listing<br />
<br />
the items i have<br />
the prices they are set at<br />
and the times that my bazaar mule will be logged on<br />
<br />
first come first server.<br />

<br />
Not me, if I make an agreement to sell something for a certain price to an individual, I stick to my word.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I get a tell from someone when I list a price that is laying down that they purchased said item.  If second person offers more I am sorry to say I already sold said item.    <br />
<br />
Nothing despises me more than when I am enroute to pay an item and the person says well I got a better offer from someone else.  I am with ya on this one a bit Nazgrimn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I go with A. <br />
<br />
But I sell most all of my crappy items (phat lewt) in the bazaar whilst I sleep/work so it's not that big an issue for me anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ditto to what Hroth and Glor said.  Never liked auctioning much anyways, and its easier now to just toss it on my trader mule and forget about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">nod Haleice.<br />
Bazaar takes all the work outta this buying and selling biz.  <br />
For the most part however, I'll keep an item in auctions unless I get a very firm offer with a specific time of delivery stated.  Or until someone comes up with the cash and we do the trade.  If I agree to sell the item at a price, I wont come back asking more later, that's rude.  But I don't tend to believe people who say they want to buy an item from me in a few days or next week or something. <br />
<br />
Buyers are liars, first rule of sales.  <br />
Yah I was in sales in RL for a couple years when I was in college, and I learned that lesson very well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bonegnawa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I personally go for the first option.  When you tell someone you are selling it them it's pretty rude to keep entertaining other offers until the first buyer is beat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Glad to know I'm not alone on this.<br />
<br />
Thing is I wasn't selling an item that was 1k, 2k or even 5k.<br />
<br />
This is 29k we're talking about.  I had already planned on buying some other items with that money and was looking around at different prices.<br />
<br />
Just kinda pisses me off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zaspacer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&quot;Nothing despises me more than when I am enroute to pay an item and the person says well I got a better offer from someone else. I am with ya on this one a bit Nazgrimn.&quot;<br />
<br />
/agree<br />
<br />
I trade A LOT.<br />
<br />
While I do allow for a buyer/seller to back out on some criteria, I generally hold them to any deal that is made.<br />
<br />
Backing out of honest, already agreed upon deals for last minute profit is generally not good for business.<br />
Yours or mine.<br />
Being an unfriendly trader will get you a bad rep.<br />
<br />
I want a happy buyer and a happy seller.<br />
We're here to exchange goods, not con each other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sure...if you're in the bazaar...THAT'S where you SELL an item.<br />
<br />
When you /AUCTION, it's just that...an AUCTION.<br />
<br />
I can understand you getting upset that you got beat out by someone wanting to pay higher...My advice? GO higher! That's exactly what an auction is...You don't like that idea? Go to the bazaar where the traders are AFK and no one will hurt your feelings.<br />
<br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
Seriously though...I have business morals...HOWEVER, I think anyone I speak to would be more than understanding if I said &quot;Hey, that offer for 100 that you made was outbid by someone wanting to pay 900&quot;.<br />
<br />
If the offer was made for 100, and you were outbid by someone wanting to pay more, you gotta realize that I'm not running a charity here...None of us are...Sure, we like to help out, and it feels good when we do. But when we're TRYING to get that last scrap of dough together to get that Slime Coated Harpoon, and we need that extra 75pp...don't get upset!<br />
<br />
Not everyone is a 40+ 2k in the bank, mid to uber gear player.<br />
<br />
I sell to who I can for whatever the highest amount is I can get!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">He asked for our opinion and I gave it to him.  If I tell someone to come to me it is thier item.  Auction is just a channel name in my book.  I understand your opinion I just dont agree with it.  Enough said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If I agree to sell something, then it's sold, unless the buyer backs out.  Doesn't matter if someone comes along &amp; offers me 10 times as much.  One thing that irritates me is when I'm buying someone, and the seller respons &quot;Someone offered me xx more, care to match?&quot; - that makes me think they're just trying to drive up the price, and I pass entirely.<br />
<br />
There's a difference between:<br />
/auc WTS (random junk) 1500p<br />
<br />
and<br />
/auc Selling (random junk), bidding starts at 1500p - highest bidder within 30 minutes gets it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well, I've been holding a copy of arch lich for 3 months now for guy who was supposedly dead-set on buying it, and it's still in my bank.  So I don't like the idea of holding on to items a couple days.  If it's a major item, ok, he wants the item bad and needs to save up, I'm not gunna diss him if he can promise me he'll ante up.  But I'm talking major items here, items that would make my week if I ever manage to sell ie Lodi shield or oiled greaves.  <br />
<br />
But generally speaking, if the item is worth less than 10k, I won't go out of my way to accomodate his needs.  I have my needs too, and as much as I like making 5k, I don't wanna wait a week for it while someone else would gladly give me that in a day.  Different play times, sometimes he'll be busy when I'm not and vice versa, I'm just not gunna pour the extra effort in when I don't need the money that bad.  <br />
<br />
This is assuming I'm dealing with a total stranger.  Nice to have common courtesy for everyone, and maybe my pr skills could use some work, but I see no reason why I should go out of my way to make a total stranger happy.  Doesn't mean I'm gunna start insulting his moma, but I'm not gunna extend 10000 hugs either.  <br />
<br />
However, for true friends, I am much more lenient.  If it significantly betters them, I'll sell them item at a discount or even free depending on my mood and/or level of intoxication.  It's already happened that I spent 100k on whim for a charged locket of escape just so that I could have company in PoM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I despise trading for the reason of having to deal with dumbasses, there is always the guy who tries to lowball you no matter what price you set.  &quot;dumbass wannabe scammer&quot; tells you, ahh 1800 is high i only have 1500 on me and i could maybe only get 200 from my friend who isnt online. when i get that song and dance i immediately dismiss them and continue my auction. its amazing how many &quot;friends&quot; come home so soon after that happens. and you end up getting all that you asked for.<br />
<br />
As to when you get an agreement on a price for an item. i try to be very nice and will give somebody some  time to come up with the cash. After a certain time though, my bullcrap meter reaches overload and i message them, &quot; uh dude, where is my cash. do you have it or not?&quot; the answer will be , uh no dude  i couldnt raise that much bread becuase (insert some sob story about a sick dog who got wounded by a froglok and he has to walk uphill  10 miles both ways every day to take care of him.), thats when i say. ok well im putting the item back for sale. if you can come up with the money before i sell it again its yours. <br />
<br />
You should really give the prospectrive buyer a time limit and this way he knows that if  he waits past 2 days  the chances of him obtaining that item from you are quite slim.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'm perenially broke (still) but when I agree to sell an item to somebody, it's sold, with ONE exception:  The person doesn't have the cash and asks me to &quot;wait.&quot;  I'll remove the item from auction tell them to confirm the purchase within 30 mins.  I'll give them 40 mins to get back to me with &quot;I have the money&quot; or &quot;I'll have it in about 15 more mins.&quot;  As long as they're letting me know they're working on getting the funds (and I don't sell uber items, I never seem to have any, outside my epic) I'll be content. <br />
<br />
If I get a 2nd buyer, I'll let the 1st one know they've got to hurry to come up with the cash, and that I have a cash buyer waiting for it.  And I'll let the 2nd buyer know I have a guy trying to scrape up funds; if he can't, than the item's all #2's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ganzon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">&quot;When you /AUCTION, it's just that...an AUCTION. <br />

<br />
<br />
Gotta remember also, when someone else makes a higher bid in an &quot;auction,&quot; that you aren't always notified that someone is going to pay more until it's too late. I believe that is what most of the auction rants are about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>lomotil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Here are my thoughts on how /auction etc should work....that is, if everyone had a shred of conscious, integrity, and/or courtesy for their fellow player :<br />
<br />
First &gt; Pay attention to what is being auctioned, do your research, and likewise to the auctioneer...don't list something unless you can answer questions about it. This works both ways.<br />
<br />
Second &gt; Even though this IS /auction, everyon knows it isn't REALLY an auction. Try actually &quot;auctioning&quot; something sometime...most people get flamed and/or ridiculed. All this really is is a sales board..you post your item and perhaps it's price. Haggling of  course is very welcome (I rarely post a price on anything unless I'm tired of it sitting in my bank and I'm offering it really cheap) and encouraged.<br />
<br />
Third &gt; Some commen courtesy ethics here...in my manner of doing things, the first person who sends me a tell on an item has priority. I usually have a set price on an item, I tell them what it is. As long as they can get to me within a reasonable amount of time, it's theirs. Also, if you're interested in buying something, you should darn well make sure you're going to be able to get to the person selling it within a few minutes...I don't care what I'm selling...making someone wait is rude and just plain self assuming that everyone else has time on their hands.<br />
   &gt; One other thing....you see someone auctioning something for a ridiculous price and it really bothers you, send them tells. Don't try to make them feel stupid in a public channel. If you feel you need to publically humiliate people, then you obviously have some personal problem...like and inadequacy issue. Just in case you didn't know...you really just get laughed at except by others with inadequacy problems.<br />
<br />
Lastly &gt; Imo, it all boils down to respect. Treat others how you would want to be treated, and eventually things might actually work out for you.<br />
<br />
To answer the first question on the thread, I go with A.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Maybe it's just me, but I like the give and take of a good haggle. That goes both ways, buying and selling. Like the other guy above, I stay broke it seems, almost all my monye these days goes to buying 55+ spells in bazaar at the cheapest prices around. I've never had much luck in selling even before the bazaar;)<br />
<br />
I miss being about to haggle down a price with someone or even do cash+trades. I found some nifty gear for alts that way that I never would have looked for or known about. Can't do it much anymore, but before, if someone sold something at 1.5k...yeah I'd start around 1k or so and work him down as best I could. It feels good to get a deal.. I did the same with people buying from me. I didn't intentionally overprice, but I'd leave a little leeway...<br />
<br />
As for the priority issue, if someone sends a tell on an item, they get first dibs on it. They also get an hour unless an specfici time is set up. I tried selling a red dragon scale for a week. Kept getting those &quot;I'll have the money and be on at noon tomorrow&quot; types that never seemed to show up:( I was asking 10k, would have went as low at 8k. I was trying to get enough to buy an Ikky bp, so had to get at least 6 out of it. I sold it to a bard finally for 5k and 2k worth of items, most of which got tossed ot my warriors bank for when he gets bigger. I don't feel I got screwed. I got everything I wanted out of it ..as did he. Apparently after 52, people don't wanna fight big red dragons heheh...<br />
<br />
HAggling is good, bidding and auctions...I'll pass. Too much work and unfair to potential buyers in my book...</div></div><hr />
