<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>RizzWulfgard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">KOE Trades Fair:<br />
<br />
Hail and well met,<br />
<br />
The Trades men and women of KOE will be hosting an event for KOE members and our friends on the Veeshan server.<br />
<br />
Are you in need of a new bow?   Do you need a piece of banded armor?   Can't live without that new ring you have been dreaming about?  Perhaps you have a Bear pelt you would like made into a backpack. <br />
<br />
Come to the Trades Fair, see what is offered, get the items you need made, meet new people.<br />
<br />
Time will be 8:00 pm EST - 9:30 pm EST on Friday September 21st.<br />
<br />
Location will be Thurgadin.  *Note* I'm looking for a place in Thurgadin that is safe for KOS people to freely be visible as well.<br />
<br />
If you are searching for a specific piece of equipment or item, post what you need here so the craftsmen can plan ahead, come with cash in hand to cover the costs of the trades.  <br />
<br />
No guarantees of success with high difficulty items.  If you are looking for some specific items made with rare components, bring them with you.<br />
<br />
I am looking for volunteers in the various Trades:<br />
<br />
Smithing<br />
Fletching<br />
Tailoring<br />
Jeweller<br />
Pottery<br />
Alchemy<br />
<br />
At 9:30 pm EST, a drawing will be held for a Velium Platinum ring (no cost to you)<br />
<br />
Restrictions are: you can and will use that item on your main character.  Everyone is welcome to enter.  You must be present to win.<br />
<br />
Note:  I recommend anyone that plans to fight Trakanon order an Anti-Venom potion as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Maybe this isn't the right type of request- it's not something that you make, it's a drop- but I'm looking for one anyway.  I'm looking around for a Froglok Bonecaster's Robe, but if you guys are just ordering trade-skill made items, then forget about this post :D<br />
See you guys there, even if it's just to meet some of you</div></div><hr />

I currently have alot of interesting baked goods. Some that not many have seen. I would like to distribute some of these to any who wish to partake of them. Among the delicacies I have are many cannibalistic treats, giant steaks, pickled wurm, siren, and wyvern, wedding cakes and birthday cakes, cookies, and many other things. If you have a request for something made, let me know here so I can gather the supplies. Currently, I have 3 ten slot bags filled with baking supplies and finished product sitting in my bank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will be looking you up to do a few combines.  I have finally bought my first BD for a resist earring, and I need two set of AC/Hp rings as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Vhela and/or Venomblood,<br />
<br />
I can see now I will go broke talking to the two of you.  )<br />
<br />
<br />
I need to pick up SOW potions ( for at least three alts ) and want to bank a five shot each of MR, PR, CR and FR potions.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I haven't pursued trade skills all that much, except for baking, which is ridiculously easy to master.  I'm more than happy to support our craftsmen with commissions and supplies, however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aneron Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have a 200 skill in alcohol tolerance!!!!! Is that good for anything :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Blumgan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This Master Tradeskiller will be there if i am not working :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>mishlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Falamil,<br />
<br />
should be no problem at all bud. Just bring your BD and bar of electrum for the earring. <br />
<br />
The AC/HP rings require a fire opal which can be gained in the temple near sola and solb or are common drops in seb. The best ring of this type will require a bar of vel. so just bring these to me and I will do my best</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Khallim Khallash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I can try to be there if needed, my guild's raiding early on the 22nd so I might have to leave early though :(<br />
<br />
Tailoring - 101 and rising (I hope to be Steelsilk-able soon!)<br />
Brewing - 135<br />
Smithing - 136 (but kos in Thurg so prolly won't help much :( )<br />
<br />
As for a spot where KOS people can be too, the tunnel leading to Icewell is out of aggro range of all wanderers I know about in that area and still accessable to the rest of the city...  could be a good spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Helek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">to have talent.. <br />
<br />
:)<br />
<br />
i will be there.. exercising my wallet i can tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Falamil Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Mishlan,<br />
<br />
<br />
I researched what I need and will be bringing you components for a set of BD earrings and AC/HP rings.  Here's hoping the combines go well.  :) <br />
<br />
<br />
Also, I did some scouting the other night and found a spot for our less-than-popular brethren to sit in Thurgadin safely.  It's a bit away from the trade shops, so we will have to bring them supplies, but at least it's in the zone.  I will run thourgh it again tongiht and post directions to the safe spot.  If any of you know where the zone tunnel to Icewell is on the main level, that's the place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>mishlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ok,<br />
<br />
Finally got around to putting together my shopping list. As I may not be able to walk around freely in thrug I'll need to have people either post or PM me with the prices so I can make sure I have the PP on me when I go to sneak into the city and setup my booth.<br />
<br />
1) 10-shot sow potion (mish has the urge to try something COMPLETELY stupid and wants to make sure he can run away quickly)<br />
<br />
2) As many looted,foraged eggs as I can get my hands on<br />
<br />
3) foraged berries<br />
<br />
4) HQ cat pelts<br />
<br />
5) stackable crystalin spider silks<br />
<br />
6) othmir fur</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grinric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have 201 in Fletching I also have 140 some in Smithing on my Druid Sarrick if ya need him.<br />
<br />
also I could try to add Tinkering to the fair.  I know that telescopes are a good thing to have on raids that involve mobs that cast an AE dispell.  I have 128 skill in tinkering and would need a druid at my disposal for runs to Steamfont for supplies, but I think this would be a good addition.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I will be there regaurdless. and willing to lend my skills as needed<br />
<br />
Note:  My alt has an INSANE amount of cat pets on him from his traves in Stonebrunt.  Also if anyone needs to hunt for pelts GO TO STONEBRUNT!  The cats there will drop at least 1 pelt 95% of the time and 2 pelts about 50%  And I have never seen them drop a ruined pelt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Falamil Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ok,<br />
<br />
<br />
I may be a little late to the trades fair, due to home repairs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So here is a safe spot in Thurgadin for Mishlan and any others who have faction problems.  <br />
<br />
<br />
When you zone into Thurgadin, cross the ice bridge as if you were heading to the bank.  When you hit the intersection, take a right instead of a left.  Follow the main path until you see another intersection with the chunk of ice in the center of it and take another right.  This will lead you to the zone tunnel for the upper level of Icewell Keep.  There are no wandering guards closer than the intersection, so this should be perfectly safe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>mishlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Grinric,<br />
<br />
If your alt has HQ cat pelts on it let me know how many and how much you want for them!!<br />
<br />
Mish</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Windigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Well I don't have much skill at the moment, fletching, fishing and pottery are all around 150.  AT is at 200 so I would be happy to demonstrate the effects of your homemade brew to anyone interesting in seeing how powerful the drinks are.  The best I can do is offer my services to run errands in town if anyone needs supplies and doesn't want to be wandering around collecting them.<br />
<br />
On a buying note, I am in need of some resist gear for raids and such, so if anyone has time and would like to inspect me and tell me what I should pick up, I would be happy to buy some jewelry or o ther crafted resist gear.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to being there -- it all sounds like fun with the potential of turning into a party later :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Meiamour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">My RL is so busy having a teenage daughter that is involved with stuff at school. I will not be able to get to this tonight unless it is still going on around 10:30 or 11pm.<br />
<br />
I do need some resist jewelry though for the raids but I can get that at a later date I am sure.<br />
<br />
Have fun everyone and I will be thinking about you as I am working myself to death selling hotdogs and such in the concession stand hehe<br />
<br />
