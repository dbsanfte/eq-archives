<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hopefully, I won't cause a crapstorm ala what happened when the druids asked for mana burn, but I'd really like it if shamans had some mediocre to crappy pbaoe spells in our spellbooks.<br />
<br />
I was babysitting/PL'ing a druid and cleric in MSeru the other day and we decided that doing it the regular way was too slow, so we sent the puller out to grab about a dozen mobs.  Puller brings them back.  Druid and Cleric start chain-casting pbaoe spells, managing to channel one through every so often.   I heal whichever of the druid or cleric needs it (generally don't have trouble channeling heals through green mobs).  Eventually, I get enough heal agro that the druid and cleric an get their aoes through.  Mobs die with both cleric and druid oom.  (Their pbaoe are not super efficient.) <br />
<br />
I'd have loved it if I could use a pbaoe spell to finish off the mobs after the cleric and druid had gotten them down to half life.  That would have almost doubled our pull rate.  Druid/Cleric were getting about 2-3 blue each per pull.  Was kind of fun.  <br />
<br />
Some kind of crappy pbaoe with a garbage ratio, something that wizards, druid, magicians, etc couldn't possibly be threatened by would be cool.<br />
<br />
While I'm suggesting things I probably won't get, I'd also like:<br />
 - cheaper alchemy components<br />
 - stat buffs to be less useless<br />
 - a mediocre group heal for use in aoe fights<br />
 - that crappy level 50 pet buff to be improved to the point of usefullness<br />
 - HoS and Rage to stack<br />
 - slight improvement to melee skills to make combat a valid option<br />
 - group shrink spell<br />
<br />
There, maybe my post will be cross posted to every class specific message board entitled &quot;look what those greedy shamans want now&quot;  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe we have a pbae dot or two...but those are *really* crappy and like level 19 or 24 heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1. Nah... that'll never happen<br />
<br />
- Nope..<br />
- They're useful enough<br />
- Group heals are fer pallies!<br />
- Hos and votb dont stack unless you cast hos 1st.. Rage stacks with nothing<br />
- Probably never going to happen although it would be nice<br />
- That will probably happen<br />
<br />
Edit: Sorry for being a naysayer :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I believe the ones your thinking of are regular aoe spells.  One is a targetted aoe and the others are rain spells.<br />
<br />
Doesn't seem to be too much to ask for a junky pbaoe.  Both of the other priest classes get one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hos and votb dont stack unless you cast hos 1st.. Rage stacks with nothing <br />
<br />
<br />
Which is f**kin stoopid if you ask me - it really gets me wound up too.  It is the most ridiculous thing and means I have not cast rage ONCE since they nerfed the HoS and Rage stack.  The fact I cannot cast it with FoS/HoS is just pure lunacy and makes it a total waste of space in my spell book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree on the rage BS.  When my shaman hit 60, I didn't have VoB yet, so I LOST AC dinging 60 because i couldn't use focus with Rage.  How long has this been in the game now?<br />
<br />
Someone come up with an exploit for not having Focus and the rage line stack so they fix it this week...because they obviously don't care if it's broken and we don't benefit.</div></div><hr />
