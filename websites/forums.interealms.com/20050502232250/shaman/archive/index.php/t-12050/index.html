<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It increases your melee dps.  I've read that you do about 30 dps in RB; for comparison's sake, a hasted alpha True Spirit pet does 30-40 dps.  It lasts around 5 minutes, and the general consensus is that, while 'fun', it is not worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>touk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">when in it will the added stats nerf any other buffs?\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jorgan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Touk!!   :p <br />
<br />
DON'T DO IT!! <br />
<br />
And update your sig you segsy Barbie.   :D <br />
<br />
Traditional advice is to get your Mental Clarity 1,2,3 out of the way and then Cann 5.  MC1/2/3 isn't that helpful, but they're prereqs for Cann 5.<br />
<br />
And Cann 5 rocks.  Just got it yesterday.   :D <br />
<br />
A more fun skill than rabid bear is spirit call at 61.  It refreshes every 12 minutes.   Rabid bear refreshes every 2 hours IIRC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did Rabid Bear before PoP came out. I wish I could get those aa points back, I hardly ever use it. So many better aa skills to spend those points on with PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">RB is kinda fun... mainly for teaching those pesky clerics a lesson on who can out melee whom--for 6 min at least.<br />
<br />
33 DPS was reached during Velius with a Facesmasher. Nowadays you should be able to hit ~40 DPS pre procs with a good weapon. Factoring procs, you may hit 45-50 dps, IF you have a good weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Rabid bear will overwrite any of the avatar series, Talisman of the Diaku, and maybe voice (I don't use it much, though I believe its overwritten as well).<br />
<br />
Its nice for dps, but the two hour recast is insanely stupid.  The 30 - 40 dps is more like versus boss type mobs or something similar, I've pulled better off regular exp mobs before, particularly since straight meleeing I can go in at 50dps without rabid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, on exp mobs our melee isn't nearly as bad as you might think when fully hasted.<br />
<br />
33 dps was velius I think on Lord K (red dragon in NToV) with a facesmasher--I personally got around 33 with a primal brawlstick too.<br />
<br />
Hmm now I'm curious, have to go parse my melee dps now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vulash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">50dps on an xp mob without rabid?<br />
<br />
In PoV at level 63 with SoV, RBG, 33/30 staff I am only 17dps.  I had max str, NDT, only 185ish skill.<br />
<br />
Add in ranger/bst atk buffs, max my skill, and I guess find a better weapon and you could crest into the 20s.  You are melee'ing like a paladin somehow only without the skills.  What are you using?<br />
<br />
Clerics got their melee upgraded?  (sorry I took a LONG break and have only been back a short while).  ***?  Sorry I just liked being the priest with minor tanking and fighting abilities making up for other things.  It fits the role of &quot;shaman&quot;.  I mean we are the barbs and ogre and trolls.  Clerics?  Not trying to start a rant page, just felt like a kick in the gut when I read that.  What is upgraded about them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i think yall are overlooking a piece of the RB buff<br />
<br />
THE 50+ COLD RESIST <br />
<br />
i used to use to use it all the time to boost myself up to the 500 cap</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I normally use my mace of dark thought, souls, ferine and typically Vallon whatever haste, grim aura and generally ranger or bst buffs.  I also have 41% haste on shoulders /shrug.  This was in COD on puslings and others there, when we did exp there frequently.<br />
<br />
I don't parse my fights, these were all from the mage in the group who was parsing each fight for the group when we did exp.  One thing to note, as soon as I cast even one or two spells beyond turgurs, my dps went kablooey. So its not like I'm going into a fight meleeing like a paladin and maintaining spells at the same time heh.  Still was fun watching the necro pull out 2dps every fight when he tried meleeing  :cool:<br />
<br />
edit* I avoid POV like the plague, worst zone ever.  Although, I did spend some time there in the beginning of pop exping for eth parchments, and I don't seem to remember doing extraordinarily well vs them either, whether their ac was too high or whether it was my imagination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vulash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ok thanks for the response.  I really enjoy melee'ing even when I know I'm not good at it ;P  You obviously have me way outdone gear wise.  I guess FA will help too and maxing my skill.  I'll have my pally parser do some more in another zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Rabid bear is a waste unless you do things &quot;just for fun&quot; cuz believe me bucko, it sure as snot ain't useful for much if anything.  <br />
<br />
And I have Rabid Bear.  And I've had it a long ass time and I've used it in many ways.  And it's still not worth the points I spent.  Most of the time it's like MGB . . it sits there unused and forgotten.  I'd use it in a group but it would lower my DPS a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Barelil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have Rabid Bear and I have fun with it.  To me it comes in handy when I am not needed to heal and my other spells are not having an affect on the mob.  I have found myself using a Smoldering Cudgel, 18/34 with 295dd (393dd crit), when I melee.  It does stack with VoB and Primal Essence.</div></div><hr />
