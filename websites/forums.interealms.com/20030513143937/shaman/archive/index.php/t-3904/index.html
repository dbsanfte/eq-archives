<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I turn to the collective intellect of the crucible for this --<br />
<br />
My shaman is organizing a CoM raid to help get his epic, get some Jade Reavers for guild rangers and druids, help some enchanters get their epic mob, help the mage get a torch, and solve the problem of world hunger and hair loss.<br />
<br />
My question: &lt;b&gt;Where exactly can we find Neh Ashiir?&lt;/b&gt;<br />
Eqatlas and allakhazams imply its in room 9 (on the eqatlas map -- http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/cityofmistmap.html ), but I seem to recall upon an earlier visit having the battle in room 8.<br />
<br />
If the sources are right, how best can I get the mob from building 9 to building 8 (with pullers), or should I have the group charge building 9.  In either case, how do I get folks over the broken pathway?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If I understand the question, we lev the monks and they bring Neh's reaver to us in building 8.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What Glor said!  :)<br />
<br />
However, I think we normally use a rogue to pull, as I think that door is locked.  Not positive though, as it's been a while.  You can also pull with AE on the door guards, or use sit agro at the door if you're feeling scrappy<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh yeah, our monk is constantly shouting, DOOR!  (ie rogue unlock door) Forgot about that part, thanks Chutoi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks folks... thats what I needed.  Sorry the question was confusing.  I had originally thought there was some trick to the big break before the door that prevented lev'ing across it.  Good to see that it is that simple.<br />
<br />
I had already planned on/bribed the rogue (you know how those folks are =)), and the monk is quite knowledgable of the zone.  I just wanted to have a clue on each step in case something happens.  I hate asking friends for help without knowing what they'll be getting into.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So Neh's black reaver in the final hut will cross the break in the pathway to your waiting party, behind the levitated puller?</div></div><hr />
