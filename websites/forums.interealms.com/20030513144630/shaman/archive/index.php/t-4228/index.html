<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>skulript</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
Just a quick question about Paw...on Cazic Thule, the place is darn near empty every day. I can't understand why, and was wondering if it is the same on other servers. I mean, the exp bonus makes for fun lvls, the spawns are spaced out so there are few trains, and the loot is more than decent....<br />
<br />
It seems like a great place for a group to kill... and it's rare to find enough people to make a good group. Is there something I'm missing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cerum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The problem is that you said &quot;fun levels&quot;. From what I've seen (read that again. From what I'VE seen) people dont want fun levels. They want FAST levels... never been to Paw myself so... I dunno if it's fast... /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Silvergun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Agreed- speed kills.  The game of EQ is now played by most people at 51+... levels and skill building are just obstacles between players and where the action's at.  Kinda too bad, but that's what happens when the vast majority of players are finally at or near the level cap.  /cheer to people who can still enjoy the ride up- somehow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seefar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes Paw is fast exp and it's fun too, but it is pretty rough.  There are a few rooms near the zone that might be soloable (I've never tried it) but it gets a lot tougher when you get to the big room.  Some of the mobs that spawn there have regen (full) and some can charm.  This means that even with a group of aprx 35th level players things can sometimes get out of hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>engelica</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I took a trip there the other day just to past the time ;)<br />
and at 60, solo with puppy, most of the zone is easy, but<br />
some rooms have like 4+ clerics in them and then others heal from all over the place.<br />
I have seen a gnoll running from my dog get healed near back to full, from mobs i never see.<br />
<br />
for most people, the 2 of the main things you don't want to exp on is clerics and casters. so i think that is a big reason it isn't camped that much.<br />
now a mob that only melees is worth xxx exp<br />
a mob that can melee the same, same hps, nuke and heal etc <br />
should get an exp bonus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kenlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've been hunting the spires and inside for a bit now, and I must say, the casters are annoying. Expecially when chanters decide they don't like stunning....<br />
<br />
There also seem to be many pathing issues. If I pull one from behind those doors, another will come, but he certainly doesn't take the shortest route. Oh no, he runs around, probably all the way down to the jail, and the all come back in one fell swoop. Painful stuff....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Heya,<br />
My Guildmates and I have been having alot of fun there (in Paw)!!  The loot is decent (FS weapons), plus varied change, and exp is good for low 30's.  Your right about the casters, and large adds to the pulls, but that makes it fun. Sure I have died twice in a month, but its a great place to learn good group tactics.  I went from 30-33 there, and we now alternate between there and in Rathe killing the Giants (Rathe can get a little too crowded at times to be worth it).  I hate not getting loot for kills, thats why I am staying away from some moon zones.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Paw is great, its like a not so crowded version of HHK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">paw has the worst pathing in the game.<br />
<br />
I do not recomend soloing this dungeon for xp unless you do not go past the double doors. the casters are close to overwhelming.<br />
<br />
that said, it is empty and you can gain massive xp through the early 30s before the double doors. these days, there is no one at the once highly popular claws.<br />
<br />
I only encountered one 'problem' between 24 and 31 when I was leveling my warrior here. on the last kill I pulled the static spawn that doesn't stand next to a spire, and this druid came to me and said that it was her camp. I let her know how long I had been there, and that no one informed me until now that it was a camp already claimed, and that as soon as I dinged 31 I would be gone. she got all huffy cause I stole her spawn, I dinged 31 on that kill and told her to have a good time and always check to see if anyone is camping a spawn before you claim it for your own.<br />
<br />
anyway, the drops are the same as inside, random FS, whips, gloves, tunics. can sell the whips for 30pp in bazaar usually and not sure on the gloves and tunics, probably 10pp per.<br />
<br />
anyway, I highly recomend it, and if you see anyone else pling, hopefully you can come to some sort of understanding on a split of the camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I gave Paw a shot with my shammy and cleric duo (the cleric is 57)  The first 10 or so spawns from zone to double doors are good xp and pretty fast spawns.  Also easy to solo and the loot is ok.  Past those doors it gets scary and I wouldnt recommend it (just as though above me have posted.)  Even with my cleric in tow she had a hard time keeping herself alive due to the mass number of mobs that come out of the wood work (breaking up the spell casts).  Its also a pain to CR to if you do not bind yourself to the zone or nearby.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mikoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well I went to paw one day with LFG on. Somone came along and I joined their group. This was with my 33 ranger on the veeshan server. a full group and we were able to go to the heart of paw in the center room. There was one door left, we decided to med a bit and go for it. Just as we decided to the room began to respawn everything, which we thought no problem we will just do it again and go for the door. as we got our second pull the Gnoll decides to skirt the whole room and then thru the center and pull it all to us. There was a quick message of gather to evac. But alas we lost somone in the evac for she was not close enough. all in all it was a great group many of us leveled inthe  short 2 hr time and most important we had fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I went to Paw for the first time last weekend.  I was in a group with 3, sometimes 4, other people.  I couldn't hardly stand it.  The xps there were horrible.  Everything was dark blue or higher to me and I was getting less than 1% per kill.  I don't know if it is because I have been spoiled by other levels or what.<br />
<br />
levels 15-23 in PC.  23-26 soloing in Marus Seru.  26-32 in HHK.<br />

Please tell me if it was a fluke or that is normal.</div></div><hr />
