<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slqmdooley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was it an absolute no brainer to choose the soloing answers for both questions?  I figure that if enough people put that then Verant may decide to add some features to make soloing more practical.  They have already increased the advantages to grouping anyway.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I picked grouping...  While I do like to solo on occasion, I usually end up grouping with friends, so I might as well have the best group experience possible.  And actually my soloing is usually 2-boxing, so I guess that's grouping too.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i picked quests :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I picked soloing for experience the first time and working on tradeskills and quests the second time.<br />
<br />
Only reason I solo at all is quest rewards suck at risk/time vs reward and my tradeskills are getting to the point where I need tons of cash to learn any more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aikoiko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Solo all the way, baby....<br />
<br />
Although I like to group with my guild and friends, I find it's just hit and miss with pick-up groups.  Never know what your gunna get.  Not to say I haven't grouped with some great peeps in pick-ups, but for the most part I like to avoid the hassle.  I prolly spend 75% of my time solo, but I'm sure that will change when I decide to hit the planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Solo for both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Picking solo is a good way to get soloing nerfed.  Sony knows that in order to keep EQ alive, you have to get people to group.  Grouping is what separates EQ from the herd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kamm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Solo for both. No way should this make more them more likely to Nerf soloing. I've been doing it for almost 4 years now. I doubt they would want to lose me, because thats what I enjoy doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I picked raiding for both because I raid a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">IMHO questing should be a viable path to exp. With players finding loopholes in questing like MQing and purchasing quest items, it would be very difficult to implement this. But I think that groups AND solo players should be able to quest all over norrath for exp returns that equal grouping. For instance, complete a quest that takes about 4 hours on average, get maybe 150% aa exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Solo for both. Can't see any reason for them to nerf it. My money is as good as anyone's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I picked raiding for both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Solo for first, grouping for second. I just can't find any damn groups because of the swarm of Shambots. The last four groups I've had had a Beastlord or Chanter slowing and slapped me on heals</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Said raiding for both, because thats what I do and what I enjoy doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Grouping for both.  My main is a warrior, so has to group, and while soloing is fun with my shaman, I still prefer grouping with the shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Agendon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Picked Raiding for both...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I prefer raiding and questing. I answered socializing on the first, raiding on the second.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I picked raiding on both. Thats pretty much the only reason I log on now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I prefer actually being able to log in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I would have liked to pick 2 options, but I chose raiding for both. Would prolly have chosen grouping as 2nd option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Raiding for both....although when I'm not raiding...i tend to just socialize.<br />
<br />
Raiding is one of the only reasons that I log in now.  Basically, I felt that once I got to a certain level, i just don't feel like exping much.  I'll do it once in a while, but it's just not the same as it once was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I don't understand why they put questing and tradeskilling as the same option???<br />
<br />
For me questing is by far the most fun part. I don't dislike tradeskilling, but I'm sure a lot of poeple who like one of them does not like the other.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I wish they would have a poll that asks &quot;what would you like to be able to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Then, I would have chosen solo. As it was, I had to choose raiding for both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I picked grouping, even though I dou almost all the time and send tells to people for socializing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Why didn't they give us an option to sit in the chat rooms while your whole server is 1017? Because that's what I spend most nights doing so I must like it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>blakhomer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Raiding as first answer, grouping for 2nd.<br />
<br />
I get groups with guild and if there are no openings, 15 minutes max in the lfg tool will get me invited to a tier 2 or better group.<br />
<br />
If my playing time is short, I reply upon invite that I have X amount of time to play but will gladly fill in until they find another slower or my time expires...whichever comes first.<br />
