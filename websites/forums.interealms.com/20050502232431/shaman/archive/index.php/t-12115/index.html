<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am more than a bit frustrated with spell research.  Spells are not 'trickling down', and we are no clearer on where parts drop than we were 5 weeks ago.<br />
<br />
My local uberguild has informed me that Yaeth's 108 and words of Retention for Malo combine drop only in VT, which I'm far from ever seeing.<br />
<br />
I'm told by trusted friends that this is cruel propaganda and not at all true.<br />
<br />
What IS the truth? Does anyone have a researched Malo? Are the parts available to us mere mortals?  Anyone know where I can buy parts?<br />
<br />
Still looking for Malo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've been auctioning for Words of Retention for 2 weeks now, nobody's seen it.  I did get lucky and buy Yaeth's 108 for 3.8k on a mule.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yaeth 108 has been seen in Ssra and ToV acording to EQTraders. So far, the only sighting of Words of Retention they have listed is VT.<br />
<br />
That doesn't mean that it definitely is the only spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gnarishal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, I have been having the same problem with retention, and the people who do VT keep saying they haven't seen them either. Have the other three pieces, and a researcher aat 200 skill, so sorta frustrating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Smokejaguar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Seems like the research components are more rare than the spells themselves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would agree.<br />
<br />
The new spell research was just tossing a bone.  Turns out the bone ended up being the short end of a wishbone.  Really not a viable way to depend on getting spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Redspeed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Seems like the research components are more rare than the spells themselves.<br />
<br />
<br />
What, you were expecting them to drop off orcs in crushbone?<br />
<br />
Give me a break.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What, you were expecting them to drop off orcs in crushbone?<br />
<br />
Nope, but it was expected to be able to find them.  Which after a month, some still havent even been found.  And then the rare ones only being found in VT is silly.  Obviously you haven't tried to find the research parts for some of the level 60 spells, have you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">no but we expected that to get the components for the spell, it'd be a bit easier than the actual spell itself!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Should be challenging..even a 2-group+ raid to get em..but not impossible.<br />
<br />
This is a fraud then indeed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tappion Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I can't even find a freakin dew clover or sliver of moonstone for Levitation and Everlasting Breath. It's freaking retarded, i've had the words for them for like a month or somethin now (before the stuff went live).<br />
<br />
I can't imagine the higher level spells which require 4 parts, it's so retarded. Tack on the fact that a 51/52 Shaman couldn't really do many of the zones where the stuff drops without some higher level support (IE Cazic).<br />
<br />
Then you have stuff like GRC and Primal Essense sharing components. *** is that crap. Two of the rarer spells and they link them together? I don't really care about GRC yet cause I dont do cursing mobs, but I know I'd be dumb to waste the word on PE (which is a choice I shouldn't have to make).<br />
<br />
Gah so dumb =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So, malo components drop out of VT?<br />
<br />
Isn't that kinda like, say, a mage having to kill in the Hole for his level 24 pet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Heh, the first and only dew clover I have seen dropped in VT last night. =/<br />
<br />
From what I have seen, spell research is not a viable way to actually get most rare high-end spells, but it provides one more possible path for those spells to enter the world.  Your best bet is still to go after spells the traditional way.<br />
<br />
It is a pity that melee disciplines don't drop off of mobs in VP to provide a little incentive to actually use that zone and outfit everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I am actually getting a few components. I've been picking up any of the new pages for about 100pp whenever I'm in bazaar, then I use them to trade for other pages I need.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I saw 1 Dew Clover drop in VT yesterday.<br />
Our entire guild was oohing and aawing at that, at least those that knew what it was for knew.<br />
It's pretty lame as it is.<br />
Take a look at how many spells need Dew Clover to make them.<br />
Now consider that 1 Dew Clover has dropped for our guild EVER.<br />
Hmmmmm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">There was a small time period, when some traders panicked  :D and sold their malo/torpor for like 50% of the 'normal' (retarded) price. Now bazaar just seems to get back to old situation.<br />
<br />
Dew clover dropping in VT?<br />
Cool, let's get guild to VT quick and grab some (uhm maybe not).<br />
<br />
At least when situation stays as it seems to be (still a bit hope),<br />
we can complain about spell AND spell research drops /sigh.<br />
<br />
Can only agree with Fuudce here: when you need several components for a spell, each component itself should be easier to get than the original spell itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bolthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If I remember correctly, Words of Retention dropped off of Grieg last time we killed him.</div></div><hr />

Dew clover:  Several off of bats and inkies in Kithicor the other night while doing the general.  Yes, I said several.<br />
<br />
Sliver of moonstone:  One in Fungus off shrooms, and one in PoJ basement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jenina Icemyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">They seem to have picked zones where most people don't play a lot anymore.  Maybe they are trying to encourage people out of PoP and back into less used zones?</div></div><hr />

Needless to say, i'm highly ticked off. With as rare as these drops are and the zones they drop in, these combines should be no fail. Or at least a much lower trivial.<br />
<br />
&lt;----  Hates sony more than ever now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I would have expected to see more rare shaman spells for sale by now.<br />
<br />
I am pretty sure I have seen an increase in the number of level 51 Lev/EB (componentless versions). I even purchased componentless Lev for 7kpp.<br />
<br />
I did however pick up a copy of Torpor for sale for 10k last night for a friend. No idea if this was researched or not.<br />
<br />
Oh well my guild will be in VT shortly and I'll have to hope the bits for Malo drop so I can make a copy for my 56 shaman buddy....</div></div><hr />

I won't mention I also picked up Quiesance yesterday for 45kpp and O M F G it totally rocks (damn swearfilter!).<br />
Now I just need to find a FoT7.<br />
<br />
Seriously. Mind you, pre-research patch people were trying to flog off their Torpor's for 30k then 25k then 20k as they all thought they were gonna have a hard time selling post-patch....!</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I agree.  The rarer ones seem to drop in places that aren't as crowded.  Sacrifice xp and/or solid loot for a chance at getting a bit for a spell you need?  Makes perfect sense to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Just for information, got a dew clover drop in CT yesterday. From a normal lizard in the CY I think.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I saw Malo on Karana for 32k over the weekend.  That's the first time I've ever seen it for under 100k.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't forget to keep an eye out for the OTHER classes components for overlapping spells!  I got the parts to make WIZARD Levitation, found a wizard, and scribed that puppy.<br />
<br />
It's been great so far.  Use eqtraders to find a spot, then hunker down and farm.  I'm at the very least not looking for fricking lvl 51 spells anymore.  This probably isn't going to get me group acumen, GRC, or primal avatar... but I'll cope without those somehow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">If 10 extra copies of a given spell come into the server per month, it's still an increase and thus a bonus SoE put in.  I'd be sorely disappointed if SoE made the components for these spells common personally.  I wouldn't expect the components to be harder to get than the scrolls themselves, but I would expect them to be more rare.<br />
<br />
Research is an extra way to get spells, not a complete replacement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">My guess about this is that Sony followed their pop model that spell components will drop for spells off of mobs of the same level or higher as the spell.  If you are looking for a spell component for a level 60 spell find level 60 mobs.  <br />
<br />
Personally I think this is good.  But I do understand how frustrating it is to not have the spells.  I was 64 before I got malo.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Galamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">This is what I have got so far:<br />

Sliver of Moonstone - Goos in CT<br />

Yaeths 107 for Torpor - ToV<br />
Yaeths 70 for levitation - Trials in PoJ<br />
Dew Clover - CY mobs in CT.<br />
<br />
Trials are a good way to get a lot of components - seems some dropped every attempt. I would then say get some friends and camp CT for awhile.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">unfortunatly, the spells seem to be more common then the research components.  researching the spells is just a hoax to get the pissed off, spell lacking people out there( i.e most high level shaman) even more reason to keep playing and throwing money at the everquest empire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">So far I have;<br />

All purchased in the bazaar, except the staff was given to me by a guildmate. Have seen some other components in the bazaar, but didnt buy them because people are trying to sell them for thousands of plats. No thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>thevolcanogod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I'm getting very close on a few spells - only need the Flake of Lodestone for Pox, Words of Retention for Malo and I have all I need (supposedly) for Primal Avatar. Got all of these from friends or in the bazaar - but believe me, I've been searching hard at all times of the day for pieces I need.<br />
<br />
No clue where Words of Retention drop - EQ traders lists them as VT only - Curst, are you sure you saw them drop in CT or were those Words of Revenant (which are listed as dropping in CT)?<br />
<br />
I think certain creatures like Lodizal are a catch-all for research components - it has dropped all kinds of components for various spells from talking to the people that kill it regularly.<br />
<br />
Primal Avatar research appears to be broken ATM which really sucks because I have all I (supposedly) need. I can't get it to combine (see my post in the &quot;Spells&quot; secion for more details on my frustration).<br />
<br />
So far I haven't seen any change in spell prices on FV - Primal Avatar still at 40K (not no drop on FV), only Malo I ever saw was for 80K, never seen Torpor or Pox.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Had a friendly necromancer research me up a copy of Primal Essence last night, which was nice to finally have in the book.  I had two Yaeth's 73 R, so I still have one left for whenever I can find the other bit for GRC.  I don't grind in Ssra and don't have a 2nd floor key, so the new research got me a spell I had no other way of getting.  Negatives aside that's a good thing.<br />
<br />
I'm one or two components away from most of the rest of my missing spells - Torpor I have nothing for, I saw my first Words of Sapience in the bazaar this morning for 2500pp and decided to pass on it.  Eeep.<br />
<br />
Did get a Rune of Alternation for group acumen, first time I'd seen it in the bazaar at all and the guy had 3 on him.<br />
<br />
I think there's a massive backlog of people finally getting some of their rare spells - once that dies down things will get more sane.<br />
<br />
We DO have some issues with components that we need being used for high end and rare necro spells - Dead Men Floating and Funeral Pyre both overlap with components used for shaman spells, I don't know if there are the same issues with high end enchanter spells but I would suspect as much.  This is a little frustrating for both classes :(  I wish they'd put in seperate components for priest spells.</div></div><hr />

Close. Choosing between Apples OR Oranges. I can EITHER get decent<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Jenina Icemyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">I don't really understand people complaining about this.  Even if it is hard to get a spell this way, nothing stops you from getting it the way you would have if research hadn't been added.  This is an extra way for spells to enter the game.  Will rare spells still be rare?  Probably for quite a while.  Will they be entering the game faster then they were before?  Maybe not much faster but even a very few extra copies mean that much less competition for the few that drop.  <br />
<br />
Even if some things only drop in VT (which I'm thinking that not all drop locs have been found yet due to a lot of people not hunting in old world zones anymore and not all people knowing what these are for yet) that means uber_guild_01 will get all the spells they need a bit faster and not be competing with you in the bazaar when one goes for sale.  <br />
<br />
Would I like them to drop more?  Yes.  <br />
Do I think we should be complaining about getting something additional that wasn't available before? No.</div></div><hr />

/bazaar :(  Unfortunately that's where I've had to go for most of my research supplies.  I did get a Yaeth's 50L off a Blizzard Hunter in velks yesterday, was verrah happy to see that drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Words of Revenant (used in Torpor and Talis of Raptor)<br />
<br />
And I got Mist of Povar (2 of them now), from yard trash in PoD (Goos', rats, larvae, etc)<br />
<br />
Still looking...<br />
<br />
Slow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Slavage909</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">After kiling around 1746 shrooms in FG I now have enought pages for 2-3 combines each for lev and everlasting breath for a enchanter.<br />

Go Canni 5 :)<br />

Slavage 60 shaman povar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Well, I was pretty skeptical about the whole research thing, but slowly but surely I acquired all the parts for Pox, and a wizzy friend combined them for me last night, so I guess I can't complain any more - there's pretty much no way I'd have the spell any other way at this point. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">I know I started this thread..but I have to admit that through constant bazaar monitoring, and /auc'ingfor the parts I now have a home-made copy of Malo in my book thanks to a necro researching friend of mine.<br />
<br />
Yaeth 108 and words of retention are still kinda rare though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">I have yet to see a single research drop hunting in PoD CY or zone trash in PoN, maybe just my bad luck.  To make matters worse, at least on A Ro, the valuable shaman research items are never for sale in the bazaar.  I've yet to see a Yaet's 73R or any malo, torpor, pox, primal avatar, group acumen, etc... etc... pieces.  Parts for lev/EB are occasionally for sale at 3k or so each, then you still have the combine. :(<br />
<br />
Awesome, I'd love to drop 5k+ so I didn't have to carry a stack of those expensive bat wings/fish scales.  I just hope it's my bad luck and eventually I'll start to fill out my spellbook- L59 and I have Unfailing Reverence and Focus of Spirit (banked). Yahoo!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Gooshemz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">I've been hunting in high level zones and the shaman words are just too hard to get.<br />
<br />
You probably would have more luck finding a partner and duoing guardian wurms to get the spells you need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Smackish Smackdaddy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">doubt this is due to reseach stuff's but malo is down to 20-30k on tunare and i got a copy for 15.5k yesterday , WOOT!!!<br />
still no torpor tho  :mad: .  Alternatley my wizard has made 3 levitation spells and chanter friend has made 1 and i got pages for another so whole guild should have no bat wings soon heh.  Still need the yaeth pages and werds of sapience for torpor tho , never seen em for sale either.<br />
