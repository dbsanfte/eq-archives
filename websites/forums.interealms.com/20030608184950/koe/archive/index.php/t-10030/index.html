I want one of these for my Iksar Cudgel quests. Unfortunately there are a lot of itmes in these quest that involve items that are named and &quot;look&quot; exactly the same, yet are different items. I also just want one so I can do my own identification of stuff, because I'm a wierdo like that. I wanna identify everything in my inventory and bank and see what it says :-D.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, getting to the point, anyone know what the going price of these are in the bazaar, was going to pick one up tonight maybe.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Kilorn, I'm not going to wear it, it's only a clicker item I want for identifying quest items. And accourding to people's posts on alakazam's, it's clickable from the inventory, so I can use it. Likewise, if someone DOES have one of the above items laying around and they don't need it or want it anymore, that would be fine too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Silvery Mask is about 50pp or so in bazaar... it is common reward from turning in kobold paws from Velks....<br />
<br />
If that helps any. I was unaware the Beads were usable by other classes..my mistake. Just tryin to help</div></div><hr />
