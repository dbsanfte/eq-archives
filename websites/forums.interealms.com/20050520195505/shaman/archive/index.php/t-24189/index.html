<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tassie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Apparently there is a patch for the 13th Oct and one of the things going live is from the test server.<br />
<br />
Mages, Necro's, and Beastlords will be able to cast invis on themselves without the pet dying. This isn't an AA ability it will be a passive ability.<br />
<br />
My question is...<br />
<br />
Why doesn't the shaman get this ability as well???<br />

Whoever our new correspondant becomes, I would also push for Spirit of Might and champion being cumulative, as well as them finally fixing Talisman of Alacrity. Lastly, Pure Spirit is currently pretty lame. For 350 mana, 6 sec cast time and 12.0 recast time, it should have a fair chance of curing stuff, but with remove detrimental (1) that's not going to happen. The spell is just plain broken and needs to be re-evaluated, badly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The word on the boards is that the pet is neutral to mobs and therefore does not need to be invis, as all invis does is change you to 'indifferent' with the locals.<br />
<br />
<br />
The change does NOT work with DC or charmed pets.<br />

<br />
Pets that are attacking mobs become kos to anything that is social with the mob being attacked but are indifferent to anything when they do not have agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Is this how SK's are able to single pull using their pets? Maybe it's a combo of pet and AA, but I have known GOOD SK's who will send their pet into a room of four and bring back one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">People don't seem to realise that shaman can single pull using pet too - and indeed, can single pull a little bit better than SKs. <br />
<br />
<br />
The secret of pet pulling single pulls is to use a pet that /cons green to the mobs that you are hoping to avoid aggro-ing. i.e usually not the level 61 spell pet. Usually the &quot;Spirit of the Howler&quot; pet is fine for this.<br />
<br />
1. Summon relevant pet<br />
2. Buff pet with as many hp as you can and best SoW you can give him - indoors, even Spirit of Shrew is better than nothing<br />
3. Immediately before sending pet, cast Quiesence on pet<br />
4. Send pet to attack desired mob<br />
5. As soon as puppy engages mob, start mashing the &quot;back off&quot; key repeatedly and hope that puppy is listening.<br />
<br />
If the pet dies before it gets back to you, you will get aggro of any mob that is in aggro range, hence the need to Q the pet before pulling</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">SKs do &quot;pet pulling&quot; by feigning, then sending in thier 64 pet, and hitting pet hold for (usually) an automatic single.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks Nodakk!<br />
<br />
I only saw the topic on a mage site and a SOE correspondant stated it only effected Mage,Necro,Beastlord. So that is good news. More to the point when you get classes that can cast aoe invis without asking and you loose your pet.<br />
<br />
As for the suspended minion AA that some think we should get a refund, all I can say is I have full AA's in that ability and I love having a pet when I log on each day without the need to summon, give weapons, buffs etc... that alone is well worth the AA's.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Here is a little more info on pet pulling.<br />
<br />
as a shaman if your pet dies when pet pulling you automatically get aggro. <br />
<br />
When Sk`s or Necro`s pet pull if thier pet dies there is nobody for the mob to aggro because of FD<br />
<br />
The question that I have is what happens if fluffy dies while your are pet pulling with invis...Do you get aggro? If not all pet classes will be able to pet pull singles as well as sk`s &amp; Necros</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>birdsafari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Just checked the eqlive site and boards...no info there.  Where else are you supposed to look?</div></div><hr />

Or, does the mob your pet attacks suddenly see through your invis?<br />
<br />
I mean, depending on how this gets handled, the possibility exists for you to invis deep into a dungeon and pet-pull a mob all the way back to the entrance without agroing any other mobs along the way. So I'm surprised they're adding this feature unless they figured out some way to deal with the exploit potential. No one knows?</div></div><hr />

I would have to agree, as much as I love pet storage 3, the primary reason I bought it was so I could invis and zone witout lossing doggie. Being able to invis and not kill him for free would push pet storage way down on the list.</div></div><hr />

This actually wouldn't work, because the very second your pet is sent on the mob it becomes KoS not only to the mob it attacked, but everything in assist range. <br />
And if the pet died and you'd still be invis then the mob wouldn't follow you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">And if the pet died and you'd still be invis then the mob wouldn't follow you.<br />
<br />
I don't think that invis would prevent you from getting aggro.  I think that in that circumstance, it would be the same as you not being in aggro range of the mob when your pet attacks it.  Once your pet attacks the mob, you are added to the mobs hate list, whether you are invis or out of aggro radius.  Now, the only reason more than one mob shouldn't attack is that the mobs aren't social, or your pet is too low (the green pet tactic), and you manage to get him back to you without dying.<br />
<br />
I may be wrong though :)  This is just how I see Sony implementing it.  Sortof like when you get aggro, root the mob, step aside and invis yourself and run.  That one mob is still mad at you, and doesn't stop being mad at you or forget about you because you are invis :)<br />
<br />
I just hope this change goes live because I hate it when I have a pet all loaded up with weapons and buffs and a druid casts group invis to run through a zone like Dranik's Scar :/  I run through that zone without invis all of the time, and the only time it is dangerous is when one of the epic mobs are up.  With the reliability of the druid's group invis, I'd rather risk being visible and ready to fight :P</div></div><hr />

This is not always true.<br />

How do you think SK's pet pull?  Partailly mentioned in this thread, though a wrong procedure is printed in this thread as well.<br />
<br />
As for suspend minion aa's if you could get it through your head to use a proper per to pet pull, let it die then pull up uber puppy and go to town you'd realize that there is still value in that aa, just not for those who can't think outside the box on their own.</div></div><hr />

I relize it still has value, but it definately won't have 15 AA value at least to me.</div></div><hr />

I'd say it's neither...  It is higher level than the 61 pet, so it's not the same, but other than that, I really can't tell any difference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm going to dissagree here.  Not sure if you've tried this and it works... or if you are just speculating.  I'm going to go with speculating.<br />
<br />
Here's a list of facts with pet pulling.<br />
<br />
1- Reason why Necro and SK pet pull so well is that they have low level pets with more hp than our higher level pets.  The pet has to be green (or light blue I guess, very hard for me to know exactly the con of the pet to the mob) to the mob you are pulling for it to work correctly.<br />
<br />
2- You can send a pet in and spam heal it right next to the other mobs and you will draw zero agro.  Throw on Q and spam heal someone elses pet and you will not get any agro...... unless that pet dies.<br />
<br />
3- If pet dies during pull, any mystery agro that you should have gained but didnt by healing or by the pet proxy agroing a mob right next to another mob, auto agros everything that should have been agroed to begin with.... hard to explain.  Let me give an example.  <br />
<br />
If you are in LDoN and there are 4 mobs in a room, you sick pet on a mob and spam /pet back off (or use /pet hold, if you have the AA).<br />
<br />
A- If the pet comes all the way back, you drew no agro and everything is good with the world.  <br />
B- If the pet runs in, gets one rounded and dies.  It's the same as if you had invis on yourself, stood next to these mobs and attacked.  They will All come charging.  Any mob that has Proxy agro will come charging you and anyone else that healed the pet.<br />
C- Pet runs in, gets beat to 2% as a heal lands, pet lives keeps running back to you but pet dies 3' in front of you.  Somehow the mobs 50' back in the next room that you pulled from will charge you same as if you drew agro on them.  Even though you are well outside their agro range.<br />
<br />
By necros and SK using FD then pet pulling all they are doing differently is they are putting zero risk in the pet dying.  If it dies, they are FD and the mobs agro wipes and it goes back to it's spawn point.<br />
<br />
If I made a mistake please correct me, but I have a lot of experience with pet pulling... my bro is a SK/Necro and we do it all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Bril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">When you spend your pet after a mob, I believe you are added indirectly to the aggro list.  This is why SKs and Necromancers FD when using the pet pull method, so if the pet does die you are not aggro'ed upon next.  So being invis'ed should not matter, because once a mob is aggro'ed upon you it basically can see thru invis anyways.<br />
<br />
- Bril</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">So as long as:<br />
<br />
1. Your companion is green to the mob being pulled<br />
2. The pet lives on the pull (even healing it) after using /pet back off or /pet hold<br />
<br />
You won't get adds. If I understand all the information in this thread.<br />
<br />
Just wanted to get some of the info clarified for others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">As a Test Server Shaman, I can tell you that the new invis update DOES work with our 'companion'.  It is a very pleasant feature, especially as I do not have the suspended minion AA.<br />

<br />
<br />
You are correct in that you shouldn't need the SM AA if all you are doing is trying to invis and not lose your pet (assumming, of course, that the news from the test server is accurate and goes live in this next patch).  However, if you are using the pet pulling technique described above, you will need SM2.  Additionally, if you want the new pet AA (Persistent Minion, IIRC) that allows a pet to remain even after logging, you will need SM2 as it is a pre-requisite.<br />

<br />
I disagree with this statement.  I commonly kill (or let die) the pull pet once mob reaches me in order to bring out the real pet.  I have never seen this behavior occur, unless the pet died from a nuke that the mob casted from near its friends.<br />
<br />
The things i have learned that will cause aggro to be transferred to you during pet pull (while the prey is still near friends):<br />
-If you sit to mem a spell<br />
-If your pet gets feared<br />
-If pet dies <br />
-If you inadvertantly are made to duck or duck on purpose<br />
<br />
Things that will not transfer aggro:<br />
-Healing pet (anything beneficial presumably)<br />
-Healing self (anything beneficial presumably)<br />
-Mob can cast spell on you, still no aggro<br />
<br />
Currently unkown by me, but theory:<br />
-If you get in between pet and prey, you may or may not get aggro.  I haven't proved to myself how this works yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">1- Reason why Necro and SK pet pull so well is that they have low level pets with more hp than our higher level pets.

Then this makes the Suspended Minion AA still valuable for pulling. You can summon, buff and equip your best pet, then summon a lower one for pulling. <br />
<br />
Questions: <br />
Does Summon Companion remove aggro on the pet? <br />
Will invis work like FD when pull-pet dies?</div></div><hr />

You can't summon your companion when it has aggro, so no go there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since I don't know when, but it is the only way I can explain some unexpected aggro on some pulls I have made where I ended up being forced to duck becaue of the space I was jamming myself into.<br />
<br />
Feel free to run your own tests.  I have never tested it explicitly, only posting about my experiences.  Guess it wouldn't take much to test, but somehow I doubt I will remember to.</div></div><hr />
