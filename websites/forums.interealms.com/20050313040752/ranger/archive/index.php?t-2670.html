<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draeven</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 06:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe it's time to, as a class, start pestering VI not so much about balancing our class against other classes, but our class as a whole, within itself.  As a Half Elven ranger of Karana, I'm getting pretty disparaged here.  All over the place I'm seeing things that favor Wood elves, and, or, followers of Tunare specifically.<br />
<br />
Cultural trade skills:  Half elves get NONE, and now, Wood elves get the best fletching, while non-Wood-elf rangers get jack squat.  Half elves as a race have been left out of all the nifty cultural things.  Yes, I know, because we have no culture, but I don't feel that exscuse is good enough anymore.<br />
<br />
Deity restricted items:  Helm of the Tracker, need anyone say more?  Followers of Tunare are blessed with items that followers of Karana can only dream of, and have no equal that is as easy to obtain.<br />
<br />
With such things now known, what reason is there to be a Half elf, or ranger of Karana, let alone a Half elven Ranger of Karana.  It has yet to be seen if Humans have cultural fletching, and I doubt Halflings do, since they have never had fletching vendors, although that may have changed quite recently.<br />
<br />
What does everyone else think?  Is it time Verant did something to address the issue of Race/Deity balance?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elured</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 07:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As to half elfs ever getting a &quot;cultural&quot; tradeset, I certainly hope not.  That's along the old Rolemaster lines of them getting a completely different set of development from either racial background they actually would have been raised in.  I think half elfs should get cultural tradesets based on where they started.  Kelethin, Felwithe, Qeynos or Freeport.<br />
<br />
As for the good old Helm of the Tracker dead horse.  To be *really* fair, they should have a really nice &lt;deity&gt;-only helm for *every* deity.  Or, maybe, since this is the real world, not everything will get done at once.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Something I've posted to Verant as a suggestion before and got no response, so I'd take that as a no.<br />
<br />
An alternative would be to allow half elves to take more than one skill over 200. Meaning that although you can't do any of the cultural stuff due to racial biases (perhaps they chase us away from the special forges for example) but our racial flexability allows us to master more things than the more culturally specialized races.</div></div><hr />

Sooner or later they will realize their mistake, and totally overcompensate, giving Karana rangers 10 class only items that can be quested by one ranger half asleep at his keyboard wearing banded at level 50, and blow the Helm of the Tracker out of the water...<br />
<br />
Verant doesn't balance, they just imbalance stuff in the other direction occasionally :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aluaden</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What?  I cant hear you, my Helm of the Tracker has no earholes.  Hmm, you must want a Mithril arrow!  Okay here ya go!  .....Why the hell did you throw it at me?<br />
<br />
I can agree the Half-elf people should have some kind of cultural skill ... BUT the advantage half elves have over everyone else is that while the dont have their own cultural armor, they can wear several different types of other races cultural armor.  I do believe that was specifically addressed when the cultural armors came out.  Half elves didnt get one, but they get to use more than any other class.<br />
<br />
What they need is some ranger only fletching.  I just doubt youll see a Cultural Half elven anything, because the whole point behind halfelves is that they are caught between cultures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shiphro</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Although I am a Half Elf, I agree with the way cultural crafts work now.  To my knowledge, HEFs can wear stuff made by HIE, ELF and HUM... they just can't make it themselves.  If I'm wrong, then that needs to be changed.  However, most of the cultural tailored gear is only created by tailors in order to raise their skill to Velious/Luclin levels.  As far as I know, there isn't much worth wearing so I don't feel too left out.<br />
<br />
The problem isn't that HEFs should be able to do cultural crafts.  The problem is that Fier'dal Fletching should be Ranger Fletching.  I've only seen one archery range in Norrath and it's pretty far from Kelethin.  In giving one race the ability to create new bows and arrows, they snubbed the other 3.<br />
<br />
To put it another way: &quot;This patch is a slap in the face of all HFL/HEF/HUM Rangers!&quot;:rolleyes: <br />
<br />
The Helm of the Tracker issue should have been addressed a long time ago.  I don't think they should create an entire Karana quest.  Simply make HoT Karana equipable (because all Rangers help Tunare, regardless of the 'chosen' diety).<br />
<br />
Fier'dal Fletching is just garbage.  They CAN create class-specific crafts (Alchemy, Poison?) and they've mentioned Ranger Fletching before.  Why would they sell us out now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rajalon</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The cool thing about class skills is that they don't count toward your &quot;only one tradeskill over 250&quot; cap.  But my fletching is 202 anyway, so I (and I'm sure others) would receive no benefit there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draeven</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure, we have more crafted items to select from, but all in all, they are all mostly pretty lame.<br />
Everywhere I look I see people getting new and nifty things that I can't use.  New arrows that are Tunare only, and I have no doubt the bows will be WEF or Tunare only.  *Laughs* I bet when they fix those arrows, they'll put Halflings on them, and leave it as Tunare.  There's new smithing recipes that cater to Plate wearers and int casters, and so far all I've seen of that is Tunare stuff.<br />
<br />
So, maybe when the dust settles and all the new recipes are found, I'll see something of use to me, but so far, the prospects aren't looking good. =(</div></div><hr />
