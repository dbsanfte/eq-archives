<br />
Advice watch out for the Iskar hermit, easy to avoid after you know where he is. ;)<br />
<br />
Also FYI daggers are NO DROP so you can say go buy them with druid and give them to shaman. Found that out and now my druid has 30 stacks of daggers on him ;)</div></div><hr />

As it stands, anyone can get nonkos in cabilis in an hour for 5pp.  The point of the iksar race was to be isolationists and against all the other races.  We should not have people just walking into Cabilis willy nilly for 5 minutes of work.  At least the bone chip quest proved your loyalty to the various factions of cabilis, why not just hail a mob and say &quot;Yes, I would like to fix my cabilis factions.&quot;  /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ghanimaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">it's glaringly obvious that it's a bug. I wouldn't doubt that it will be fixed in the next patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just bring a friend with invis, go in to the room with the quest npc, he wont aggro, give NPC wine, BUT when trade window is up ask friend to invis BEFORE clicking ok.<br />
<br />
Merchant faction raisies fast, guards going to take a bit longer. But i  looks like there is only one lowlevel guard near the merchant with the daggers so im not sure you need to get guard faction up before buying daggers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">This quest is a bit harder to do for the good races so here is what you need to do:<br />
<br />
1.  Buy some Red wine, I used 40 bottles - could take less, could take more for you.  To do this quest hand him 4 bottles then have a friend invis you...hit trade, boom: faction.<br />
<br />
2.  Buy 5 bags of Explorer knives from the troll in Rathe Mtn.<br />
<br />
3.  Get a druid to help you with the next part.  Have the druid cast Harmony on the trooper, stand as far away as you can from the trooper,  yet still be able to trade with him.  Hand him 4 stacks of 4 daggers.  Druid friend of yours casts invis on you, then hit trade.  (have him re-harmony every now and then)<br />
<br />
4.  When you have faction enough with him just start handing in the daggers 16 at a time.<br />
<br />
5.  Enjoy your new-found scally friends.<br />
<br />
6.  Next step is to do the proper quests to get necro faction.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sthaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Bah, this makes me so mad.  It's obviously a bug (I hope), but this guy only recently got put in at almost (if not exactly) the same time as the last 2 cudgels and is more or less only there for faction that I can tell.  <br />
<br />
Originally, his faction hits were the same as those for killing Drixies in FV I think (this was the the same time that faction messages were bugged put working properly).  That is: -FV, -Emerald Warrriors -(I forgot), +Legion of Cab +Pirates of Guthnak.  He was an alternative to farming bone chips, at the cost of dropping FV faction.  <br />
<br />
Considering how hard it is for Iksar to raise old world faction, this is a slap in the face.  Enjoy it while it lasts, assuming they bother to fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kieran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">&gt; Considering how hard it is for Iksar to raise old world faction, this is a slap in the face.<br />
<br />
Except it isn't that hard, as plenty of posts in the referenced thread make abundantly clear. Certainly it's about a hundred times easier for an Iksar to raise faction in FP/Erudin/Qeynos than raising Cabilis faction through bonechips. The only think here worthy of a nerf is the XP gain, that *is* exploitable.<br />
<br />
As for this &quot;slap in the face&quot;, I for one don't agree with you or anyone else who thinks that making things FUN for other people is somehow &quot;insulting&quot;. If you think this is nerf-worthy, why not also /petition to make metal sheets unstackable and to disable buying stacks of items on behalf of all the old school smiths, because jeez people who do it nowadays have it too easy. Or /petition to get the 55+ spell drop rate lowered, it's the same principle.</div></div><hr />

- Wrong. Chips raise all factions, knives all but necro, killing drixies raises only Troopers. Heck, killing for days in Sebilis will max out your Trooper faction so you can skip killing drixies.<br />
<br />

- Funny, I didn't hear non Iksar evils bitch whine and moan while everyone and his mother over rolled their VS faction (including Iksar) and got a free gate hammer (PS: I know 3 barbarian shamans with a gate hammer). Why is it that every race complaint ends up with Iksar being the one complaining? And if you thought raising Cabilis faction is PITA ... try VS. I also didn't hear elves complain after people mass slaughtering in PoG suddenly over rolled their faction to max all (yours truly included). Of course in the Iksar faction quest's case it's not even a bug. It's a stupid QA mishap of leaving quest knives on a vendor or simply selling same item as the FV explorers drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Getting necro faction for those of us who want to wander the city unmolested still requires slaying 1 meeeellion +brood of Kotiz mobs, so don't get too huffy about the ease of the Explorer knife quest.  The necro mobs are quite liberally placed throughout Cabilis to ensure that there must be at least several hours of droll faction work.<br />
<br />
Without this quest I never would have bothered with Cab, but it is nice to be able to finally go after a cudgel.  If this was a similar situation involving Grobb you would not catch me complaining about other people creeping into &quot;my&quot; city.  Thought the point of the game was to do as many quests as possible anyhoo? :p</div></div><hr />

Bone chips do not raise necro faction, same as the knife quest.

<br />
Jenoe's right about the outcast iksars.  i did my faction work in Warsliks Woods.  There's a few camps of the iksars(bandits, brigands, pariahs, manslayers, etc.), and in the hours that it took me to kill 2000 of them to max my Brood of Kotiz faction, I never once saw another person hunting them.  They are low level mobs, seems to be 7 or 8 minute respawn time, and dogdog loves to kill them. :) <br />
<br />
In East Cabilis, there is only 1 NPC on Brood of Kotiz faction. His name is Grype, and he spawns on the 2nd floor of the Tink &amp; Babble at night in game.  Bad thing is this is on the path from the Shaman Guild to the bank, good thing is that it is easily avoided, and he does not wander. <br />
<br />
In West Cabilis, I'm not sure how many of the NPC's are on Brood of Kotiz faction, but it seemed like most of the vendors were, including the alchemy herb vendors.  It was worth it to me to go ahead and max out this faction at indifferent since it's the only place in Kunark that sells both sets of herbs.  Of course now that we have the herb vendors conveniently located in Shadowhaven, you mau not want to take the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Well, this does seem a little too easy to me, though the bone chips quest might have been a little too hard.<br />
<br />
I can see this as being a bit unbalanced.  After all, if you just compare how hard the bone chip quest is to what an iksar might have to do to get faction with some city, you can't fairly skip over the fact that goody-goodies only have to work faction for very few places, and those places don't matter much at all, whereas iksar have to do it pretty much everywhere.  Comparing the difficulty of getting faction for non-iksar versus iksar is really pretty silly.  Not that it should necessarily be any easier for iksar, either.  But if iksar faction is so far out of whack with the other races, it makes sense that it works both ways -- other races shouldn't be able to get faction with iksars in half an hour.<br />
<br />
That said, I don't really mind that it's vastly easier now to get cabilis faction(probably only temporarily anyway).  I think this &quot;warring factions&quot; stuff is pretty stupid really, and the harder they make faction work, the stupider it is.  It just leads to mind-numbing, trivial faction work and takes the fun out of the game.  Luclin just made it even worse, with evils welcome nowhere at all and the faction quests far harder still.  The game is very unbalanced in the first place, there being no significant equivalent for goodies of being KOS to a &quot;darker side&quot; throughout the world; goodies are only KOS to a very few places compared to evils.  There is no balance between light and darkness.<br />
<br />
A little note about the major place of the first three expansions that iksar need faction with, here.  I have a 45 iksar monk twink who has never killed anything that would give or take away any freeport faction.<br />
<br />
Two days ago I asked in our /market channel on my server if anyone was doing a raid on Sir Lucan, the guy for the pally soulfire quests who gives a huge boost to North Freeport faction and gigantic negative hit to West/East Freeport faction and guards.  <br />
<br />
A few people said, heck, let's kill Lucan, if he's up.  (8-hour timer)  So with like 4 people, we killed him -- my 45 monk, a 60 rogue, and two paladins.  Nice faction boost, but still KOS in NFP to guards, though not to banker.  I did assist on someone who was not KOS to find out about banker's con.<br />
<br />
Yesterday I bumped into a bunch of strangers who were going to kill Sir Lucan again, and I asked to tag along just to land a faction hit.  So now after only two Lucan killings and about a half hour of total work, I can walk through North Freeport just fine.<br />
<br />
All you need to do is just tag Sir Lucan once during a killing, actually.  Theoretically, a level 1 iksar can walk through freeport after two killings.<br />
<br />
So while evil faction is unbalanced, and the explorer knife quest is unbalanced too, Verant did leave an easy work-around in the game for evils at the most important place to get faction in the game on most servers, since NFP is generally where people have been trading.<br />
<br />
Further, with market channels, you don't even really need Freeport faction, or Faydark faction, wherever your server's market is, nearly so much at all.<br />
<br />
With Planes of Power making it easier to get around, faction will probably come to matter even less.</div></div><hr />
