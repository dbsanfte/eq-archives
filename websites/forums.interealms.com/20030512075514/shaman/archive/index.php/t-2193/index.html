<br />
The first of course is the gremling caves in Tenebrous Mountains.  They provide a steady stream of blue mobs and the loot isn't too bad either.  The respawn time on the mobs is fairly quick, so that by the time you are done with the last mobs in the cave the entry mobs have respawned.  Loot includes: gems of all types value ranging from 2pp - 12pp, small bricks of acrylia, small pieces of acrylia.  The latter pieces being one of the main reasons that these caves are usually being farmed.<br />
<br />
The second place and it is an absolute gold mine is the tribal guys in Dawnshroud.  The tribals were easy enough in the mid 30's, but at 40 they are cheese.  Very hard to get a decent split on the pull, but once you break the main camp located at the Maidens Eye zoneline it is smooth sailing.  Again loot varies here as well: polished steel ulaks, acrylia pieces, acrylia bricks, and the occasional gem although rare.<br />
<br />
All in all 2 decent hunting spots that will keep you out of Dreadlands or the Overthere.</div></div><hr />
