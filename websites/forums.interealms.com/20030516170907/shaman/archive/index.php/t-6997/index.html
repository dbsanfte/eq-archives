<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>celebel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did the quest today and when handing the items to rolandal, he gave me back 2 talismans:<br />
<br />
1) an imbued talisman: item to give to Ralgynn to receive the circlet<br />
<br />
2) an old worn talisman: I read somewhere that if you give it to Ralgynn, he says that we should give this item to karkador for him to identify it...<br />
<br />
is it another quest that follows the circlet???<br />
<br />
Didn t try it yet, wanted to have your advice first.<br />
<br />

The strange thing is that you keep the old worn talisman and if you give it to ralgynn, he says you should bring it back to Karkador...<br />
<br />
here is a post from a player:<br />
&quot;I finished this quest last night. A weird thing that happened is, when you give Rolandal your Worn Talisman with your Teachings, Fang, and Head, you get the Worn Talisman back AND the Imbued Talisman. I handed the worn talisman to Ralgyn first, not knowing I even had an Imbued Talisman, and he said something like &quot;This resembles my son's talisman but I can't be sure, take it back to Kardakor so he can guide you in identifying it.&quot; At this point I thought the quest was broken, and I petitioned.. Later, I checked in my inventory and noticed ANOTHER talisman (the Imbued one). I turned that one in and it worked! &quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sinjuneq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The old worn Talisman can be used to  help a friend do the quest and bypass the Taskmaster. That is the only thing I can figure it's used for since you do receive the circlet.</div></div><hr />
