<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I just made 43 in DSP killing the large zels and now alot of em have l.blued to me :( I tried JPF and the bloody trees make it hard to see and the lag, even with cable modem and min. settings it still hurts abit (wait 3 sec b4 casting to avoid interrupts :( ) right now I am in a guild that occationally cna come to group with me but not always and I am looking for some new places to go.<br />
<br />
I can also 2box w/ my  friends 30 druid for an 11pt ds and 350pt heals (book of obulus + 300pter) and I am looking to semi-solo some dungeons. As for my gear, I think it is v.good for my level (my magelo is working as of the Magelo update, I have fixed it so click on my name for it!)<br />
<br />
anyways, any suggestions? I have scoured the forum's search feature and LGuk, SolB, EJ (yes fearkiting but CoM is next door), CoM, ToFS, and DL/KC all look ok. Just some notes bout each:<br />
<br />
LGuk - going to try now that I got tons o time to play (vacation), only problem is for some reason I decided to trash live frog faction in my mid 20's (dont know why)<br />
SolB - went there at 35 and 40 and got decent XP but I got some adds and decided to leave. I am thinking bout going backt there solo but just want to know where I really should be setting up camp in there. Also gonna bring the druid this time.<br />
EJ/CoM - info please? never been there before<br />
ToFS - been here with a pre-CH cleric and things went OK on floor 3, again any/all advice is wanted!<br />
DL/KC - went to DL and got a group, got 1/2 a blue in 20 min and decided that it was wayyy to slow (DSP got me the last 1/2 yellow of 42 in 30 min) just wondering if XP is better than that, also how bout KC?<br />
<br />
thanks for any help you can offer also another side question:<br />
Would it be to me benefit to get the druid to 34 and regen or should I just go all XP to Artican and hold out for getting my own regen spell at 49 or is Fungi enough?<br />
<br />
also my goal is 45 by the end of the week so I can get swifty by Jan 5th (end of vacation) guild is going to help me get mine along with another guild ranger so VSR, PoS (SoCC name?) and Jade Reaver will be gotten by end of the 2 weeks (hopefully) and my guild cna easily offer ppl for the mini-battles of it (we are 40-60 guild mostly 45-55)<br />
<br />
again any and all help is wanted and thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Panteroo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">CoM will be wonder experience for you... at 43 you should be able to keep the front 5 spawns as well as the 2 spawns on each balcony cleared solo using only your own buffs/heals (get a KEI before you go to minimize downtime).<br />
<br />
do CoM until 45-46 (after entrance do the stables) then around level 45/46 get a some fish scales or an eb item and head directly to LoIO and kill bloodgill goblins. They are very easy with around 1000-1100 hp approx, harmony works underwater as does wolf form (lupine dagger) and LoIO is classified as a newbie zone (for iksars) so has a very favorable exp modifier.. Again get a KEI before you go. With KEI I was able to go from 10% into 48 to 35% into 49 in the 2.5 hours it lasted... at 45/46 it should be even better exp and it don't hurt to get ur swimming maxed easily either (don't pull to shore.. takes way too much time)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if bloodgills have only 1000-1100 hp then could I try em now? Large Zels are at the 1500 mark and take me &gt;60 sec to kill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jalim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You could most likely handle Bloodgills, if not solo with your 2 box druid. There are a bunch of posts about how to do them so I won't go into it here.  Obviously if you are fear-kiting the Zels, you won't be doing that with bloodgills so don't expect them to be that easy. <br />
<br />
~Jalim~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">actually now I can fear-kite or just strait tank large zels so I am not really worred. IMO if I can tank a luclin XP mob I can prolly tank Kunark XP mobs (DBlues that is)<br />
<br />
edit: just looked at the srat on the bloodgills and the druid I am gonna have with me (think I get 17pt DS total and my BASE ac unbuffed is 907) also this<br />
LoIO is classified as a newbie zone (for iksars) so has a very favorable exp modifier.. Again get a KEI before you go. With KEI I was able to go from 10% into 48 to 35% into 49 in the 2.5 hours it lasted<br />
makes bloodgills look v.nice, I am drooling of the XP potential at lvl 44 :) prolly gonna try CoM first though but PoK makes travel easy.<br />
<br />
again, thank you all :)<br />
<br />
and just somethinking out loud, Panteroo got 125% XP in 2.5 hours or 50%/hour avg. If I am playing for 3 hours/night at lower lvls I could possibly pull 150-175% XP in 1 session :D and by the end of the weekend I could be (150*3=450) 48 w/ 50% XP.<br />
<br />
and boy does that look good :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ok, update here:<br />
<br />
tried CoM, result = a few kills for decent XP, nothing really better than JPF and its a pain to get to and i got 4 trains on 6 pulls :(<br />
LOIO, bloodgills = same XP as everywhere else :(<br />
<br />
in conlusion I am gonna try SolB 2boxing a druid healer and if that doesnt work then its off to JPF</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jalim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Exp is really going to slow down the higher you get no matter what you do, unless you are hunting in PoP zones. If bloodgill goblins are not even decent exp solo for you at 44 then you might be out of luck for what you consider fast exp? I dunno.<br />
<br />
~Jalim~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">IMO fast XP = 1% per kill and being able to get about 2 yellows/hour</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jalim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The only other thing I can think of to off the top of my head would be the front 6 spawns at the entrance to The Hole, but I tend to question if you could handle it. Reason I say this is that at your level I don't think you could single pull there, and that leaves you with root parking the add(s), which even with 2 boxing a druid might get you killed. If you had the spawn already broken, I bet you could do ok here, the zone exp modifier there is really nice, and I think it would be the kind of exp you seek. You may want to wait a level or 3 before trying The Hole, even then I am not sure about the single pulling thing. There are a bunch of threads on how to do it, and once you hit the magic level (51?) you can single pull with ease. <br />
<br />
~Jalim~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">OK, thanks Jalim :)<br />
<br />
I could also probably get a lvl 51+ person from my guild to come with me there (hole ent.) or a few mid 40's. ATM though I have found that DSP can carry me the rest of the way through 44 (only 2 yellows left) and also I struck gold in DL (duoed with a shaman for sic XP)<br />
<br />
So it looks like I am gonna finish up 44 in DSP then go to JPF (maybe) until 47 or 51 (depending upon weather or not I can get a Hole partner). Also I am hoping to have Swifty by end of these 2 vacation weeks so I might be 51 from JPF or other assorted places by then w/ swity which should make the whole process much easier.<br />
<br />
Thank you all BTW<br />
<br />
edit: reason I dont like the gobbys in LOIO is that by the time I see em they both have argoed on me + my swim skill is only 44 so I am sooooooo slow :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">In mid-40s, he'd get slaughtered by the elementals in the Hole. No single pulls, and they have over 3khp.<br />
<br />
Dude, no way you're going to maintain a 2 yellows an hour. If that's your expectation, you're just going to be disappointed. Just pick a spot and hunt, you'll get the levels in time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yea, i noticed the Xp thing Kensei. figured I would finish off the XP left to 45 in DSP then look at JPF for solo, Kaesora or SolB for some solo dungeon crawl, and DL for group/duo<br />
<br />
ATM though looks like I am gonna go for DL till 49 then JPF till 55, figure that taking a few lvls off from fear-kiting will keep the process funm :) also at 52 I might be able to get some guild groups in PoP as most all of the 50+ ppl in my guild are getting groups there I think they can get me one :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">update #2: Lvl 45 now, did 44 in DL and it took about 4 hours :( XP seemed to flow and it was fun but I am looking elsewhere (again). Right now I am going to try JPF with my Lupine Dagger and see how that goes.<br />
<br />
BTW, could I get some info on what ranger hunt in these zones?<br />
<br />
Kaesora (can have tolans helm for cameo and IVU potions)<br />
Tower of Frozen Shadows</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ok, some more now:<br />
<br />
Went to CC and killed 5 geos in 7 min for 5% XP (1.25 blues), XP here seems very good and I plan on staying (easy mobs, low hp, good XP, chance at loot).<br />
<br />
Also I learned I can solo anything dblue in DL with certain mobs (Doggy gasher type(sp?), certain chickens and tundra yetis. PLan to go there with my friends druid as a heal bot or my in-game friends cleric as a duo, that was also 1% per kill with many, many mobs.<br />
<br />
Also I have been reading up on the Icefang camp in EW and plan to check it out and let you all know bout it (as this has turned into, my expereince in these zones)<br />
<br />
In short:<br />
<br />
JPF - lag lag lag :( got 1-2% per kill with several griffs to kill but I got some adds and haven't been back since I got my Lupine Dagger<br />
~ going to try again at 51 when XP elswhere wears out<br />
DL - grouped, 1 yellow / 1-2 hours // duoed with shaman 1 yellow in 45-50 min // solo 1/2 a yellow in 20 min :)<br />
~ gonna check out the Yeti caves solo (easiest mob) and might try it with bot druid<br />
CC - 1/4 a yellow in 7 min :) (had to log after getting there, will see what XP is like down the stretch)<br />
~like I said, gonna see XP down the strech, also might bring the druid<br />
SolB - add on 1st try everytime<br />
~gonna try exeploring with Tolan's helm invis indoors, maybe<br />
<br />
Places Left to Try:<br />
~ToFS, dunno what to exepect from this place, keys look like problems<br />
~LGuk, only heard good things, will see..<br />
~EW, also heard great things bout this place<br />
~Kaesora, have to try with helm invis + IVU potions<br />
<br />
Again any/all info on these places is wanted greatly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zypheir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I did DSP until 45 (when all the wolves turned light blue) And then I found out about the wonderful exp known as the TM room in Echo. Me and my BL friend (he was 47 or 48 at the time) partnered the room (Don't even think we had KEI most of the time either). The slaves are all single pullable, indifferent con, and easy to solo at like 48 - 49 (even easier with your druid bot). The TM is a little tougher, I can melee tank him with my Swarmy (long as the slow procs fairly soon in the fight) with KEI. Gotta watch for the named Thought Horror that spawns once in a while though, as he WILL kill you. Kinda forces you to go grab a drink, take a bio break, go sell some stuff, and the like. He despawns after 15 mins though, bad thing is the exp in Echo dries up at 52, most of the slaves turn L blue, dark blues don't give very much. I've spent the last 2 and 3 AA's (Currently 82% into 52, my 3rd level) in JPF chasing around freaking griffons. I'd rather go to work than kite griffons, but ya gotta do what u gotta do. I've been told 45 - 55 will either make or break rangers, guess I'm choosing the first option :) Just keep at it, group when you can, take advantage of being able to solo without taking much dmg (Try EW, Scarlet Desert, or Stonebrunt if you're tired of DSP and JPF lags you)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thanks for the reply Zypheir and I can beleive the make/break thing. Trying to be a make myself :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Anyone know anything bout Kael for XP??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Aelias0fTunare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I've XPed in Kael a few times with my old main (now retired). It wasn't that great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Just another update, I have finally realized what XP is at these lvls :p<br />
anyways:<br />
<br />
43-47 DSP<br />
47+ working on Bloodgillz, not relaly spending much time lvling</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nift Trailhunter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well if you truely want to get to 50-51 and want to see 1% per kill I can offer you a spot.  Takes a swarmcaller to be effecient for me but you have about 20pts more regen and ft1 wich I don't.<br />
<br />
In DL there are three caves that contain yetis.  The two on the outside wall are good until 46-47 wich will maintain 1% per kill.  However, you might see some down time waiting for respawns with your gear.  Then at 46-47 the middle cave is the only one that is still full time dark blues.  There are 8 spawns here and with KEI and VoG for the 40 mins VoG lasted I would be full health and mana with a 1 minute wait for first repop.  With just KEI I would have to med 30 secs after the first pop.  <br />
These required me to use swarmcaller for two reasons.  First to get the proc and second to minimize ripostes.  I was first using swarmy till proc and then switching to 2 1hs and found that by just leaving the 2hs I would have to heal alot less.  Also good time to max 2hs if it is behind.  These however begin to go lblue and take more than one kill for 1% at 50 (average of two for 1% at 50).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hmm, those DL things sound interesting, here is just some basic info and updates:<br />
<br />
I am lvl 47 ATM (have been really lazy lately)<br />
<br />
Did 43-47 in DSP (still best XP)<br />
<br />
Now I have been killing the Bloodgills and am 74% through lvl 47 :p<br />
<br />
Only problem is that BG's have been camped as of late when i log :( however when I am alone I can get some nice XP there (although with KEI only about 20-30% an hour, not near the 125% in 2.5 hours)<br />
<br />
Looking to try Echo caverns and maybe th DL mobs, ty all</div></div><hr />
