<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The &quot;you can solo, so you don't need anything&quot; card against shamans, haven't been played too much recently, but still is played around by other classes that argue against any proposal by shamans to improve or fix our class.<br />
<br />
So, I went over the official homepage of Everquest and looked at the descriptions of each class.  I found them interesting and amusing, and so I posted excerpts:<br />
<br />
Bards <br />
&quot;Bards do well both alone and in groups.&quot;<br />
<br />
Beastlords <br />
&quot;Beastlords can adventure solo well in many places.&quot;<br />
<br />
Druids <br />
&quot;Druids are a well-rounded class, prospering in both solo and grouped situations.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mages <br />
&quot;Magicians are able to adventure solo, but also provide value in a group situation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Monks<br />
&quot;Monks provide a powerful ally in a group, though it's not unusual to see a monk adventuring alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Necros<br />
&quot;Necromancers are a very self-sufficient class and often choose to adventure alone, though they can provide great value to a group as well.&quot; <br />
<br />
Paladins<br />
&quot;Paladins can sometimes work alone, healing themselves with magic, but in a group a paladin really shines, going head to head with his enemies and occasionally falling back to heal.&quot; *I really like that last part  :rolleyes: *<br />
<br />
Rangers<br />
&quot;Rangers can hunt alone or in a group, though allies allow them to best use their abilities.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shadowknights<br />
&quot;Shadowknights can use their dark powers to adventure solo for a time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shamans<br />
&quot;Shamans are a well-rounded class with strong abilities in both group and solo situations.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wizards<br />
&quot;Wizards are capable adventurers both solo and in groups, and are an excellent choice for players who live to blow things up.&quot;<br />
<br />
So, apparently and officially, many classes can solo and many of the above have had numerous complaints like shamans are having today about issues, and yet they got what they wanted.  It seems we aren't alone in the tank &quot;IN TEH FACE&quot; category.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shoendesae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So only Warriors, Rogues, Enchanters, Clerics and possibly Berserkers aren't capable of soloing...don't tell that to my cleric in Unrest... he might die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think taking descriptions off Sony's site is a poor idea.  They've proved time and again that they don't know what they're doing.<br />
<br />
And tanking in the face doesn't really factor at all.  Most SK soloing is fear kiting, as is necro (or root dot).  Wizards/druids quad kite (or root/dot), ranger bow kite, bards kite, mages can chain pets.  <br />
<br />
No tanking involved in any of those =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Of course SOE has proved time and time again, lacking knowledge of their own game.  But there is truth to alot of those quotes because there are many of those classes who can solo well, just mostly in different ways than what a shaman would.  The stigma that has hung over shamans' heads for a few years now about &quot;Blah blah blah shamans can solo anything&quot;, &quot;Blah blah blah you can kill dragons, you don't need anything&quot; would hope someday be put to rest since the game has changed so much since those days.<br />
<br />
Basically, if any of those other &quot;solo&quot; classes wants to argue with a shaman about how godly we are with soloing, just point their class description on the SOE site.  And yes, there is humor to that. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think ya bring up a  good point, most classes can solo, and every class brings something different to a group. So whats wrong with wanting to increase your group role?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Graskulis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's also fair to note that those class descriptions are general. All those classes, at some point or another in their career, can solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hell, any class can solo...it's how effectively they can solo that makes a difference in the class.  Necros, Druids, and Bards can probably solo 1-65 faster than they can grouping.  The rest of the classes are probably better off getting into groups if they want to level faster.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wizards can solo really well once they get snare, and mages can solo to 50 as fast as almost anyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Jaruden, nobody fear kites after 50, well, most dont'. they aggro kite. big difference and it shows your ignorance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">So tell me, is any class actually fun to solo?  I wind up playing on weekend mornings when there's no groups available, and usually not enough folks around to form one.  Leaves me with a lot of time to either solo or log.  Soloing as a shaman is about as enjoyable as watching paint dry.<br />
Dont care about best, worst, whatever, I'm just curious if any classes are actually fun to solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">&quot;Fun&quot; is relative.  I dont mind soloing with my Shaman.  I enjoy groups, too, of course.  Even though I know i do all the work when I solo, I feel like I bring More when I help a group, even though i'm only contributing 1/6th of the help.<br />
<br />
Kiting multiples with a bard/wizard/druid can be exciting.  Or at least, you're not going to turn away from the computer unless you want to wind up dead quick.  And risking your life as an enchanter with charms doesn't get dull too quickly unless you have A.D.D.<br />
<br />
But, I probably have a bit of a different outlook then anyone.  Right now, I do not find ANY part of this game not fun.  If it got to the point where, i'd say about, 1/3rd of what I do in the game wasn't fun for me, i'd quit and go somewhere else.   Other people are willing to put up with a lot more.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>lanolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So tell me, is any class actually fun to solo? <br />
<br />
Hell no, and as a Bard I would be happy to give up all my solo ability to have some other issued resolved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">So only Warriors, Rogues, Enchanters, Clerics and possibly Berserkers aren't capable of soloing...don't tell that to my cleric in Unrest... he might die.<br />
<br />
Yeah, well, any class can solo Unrest if they're level 65!  :P<br />
<br />
Any class can solo at some given point, usually at the lower levels (like a low level, strong vs undead cleric in Unrest - and probably wearing twinked gear and buffed with temperance - two things that didn't exist when Unrest was created).  At 65 it becomes a matter of how efficiently can you solo.  Not that many classes are as efficient soloing at 65 and some classes can't really solo at all against anything worth fighting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Chanters cant solo..................(please excuse me while I wonder where all my charm spells went, where my tash/haste/slow went...***?<br />
<br />
as for soloing for fun, you have to make it challenging, killing katta guards 3 at a time was hard as hell but me and Dog Dog pulled it off back in the 50's<br />
find a dungeon and solo crawl instead of camp.<br />
<br />
<br />
as for soloing being fun you really have to work at doing something challenging instead of safe. killing katta guards in my 50's and taking down 3 at once was hard as hell but me and dog dog pulled it off.  finding some dungeon and solo crawling it hazardous as hell and will keep you on your toes.<br />
my current solo challenge is trying to solo my way down the ramp in tactics from top to bottom. its doable but damn you dont want to make a mistake once the repops start/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">So only Warriors, Rogues, Enchanters, Clerics and possibly Berserkers aren't capable of soloing...don't tell that to my cleric in Unrest... he might die.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have a chanter friend who solos in tactics all the time.  Stays near the ZO in the pit and if he can't get charm back on fast enough he just zones.  Let's face it, onyl rogues, warriors, and berserkers are really bad at soloing.  The other classes are all at least decent, depending on the situation.  I can easily solo undead with my cleric but wouldn't want her fighting the stuff my shammy solos.  /shrug  But, yeah, just goes to show, Sony just developed the game, they are NOT the experts at playing, and they should listen more to those who spend hours and hours every day playing instead of just making assumptions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Not to mention I am paying to play a MMORPG not a single player online game.  I do NOT want to solo and I rarely do so.  Grouping is always more fun, and the game is designed to encourage grouping, so why not make us more desirable for groupage?<br />
<br />
If this continues and I am forced to solo, I will hang up the shiny spear and go find a nice offline game to play.  If I have to play by myself, why should I pay a monthly subscription fee?</div></div><hr />
