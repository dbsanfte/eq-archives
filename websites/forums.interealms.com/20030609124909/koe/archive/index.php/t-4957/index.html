<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Neverflee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I sat down the other day and started this list, alot of this stuff is far from uber but some is nice. I would rather a guildmate have something that they could use than sit in Freeport anyday of the week! I am looking to get rid of this stuff, running out of bank room with all the Quest stuffs. <br />
<br />
To make this as fair as I can, First person to send me a PM with item they want gets, but I will show favortizm to a main (sha like this high high end stuff lol). What I can't get rid of in a week or so I will take to freeport and sell (may the auction Gods have mercy on my soul).
