<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ogath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">and wish SOE would quit with the Grouping push? <br />
<br />
adding incentives for those that want to group is one thing, <br />
<br />
forcing people to group to get spells/items, epics, more than 50% per `5 hours of playing et cetera <br />
is controlling and freakish.<br />
<br />
I like EQ, i know i do because there isnt a good RP that i havent played and now find boring. <br />
<br />
and everyonce in a while i actually want to group.  but i hate HAVING to group to get stuff. <br />
<br />
LDoN was a good idea, Nerfing solo XP was stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can do a LOT of stuff solo.  There will ALWAYS be things you cannot do solo and will REQUIRE you to get together with other people.  It is quite silly to expect to be able to say...kill Quarm solo, or take on the Rathe Council solo or kill one of the three velious kings.  You just must accept that you will NEVER be able to accomplish everything the game has to offer by yourself.  That isn't the purpose of EQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed.  You can absolutely solo yourself &quot;stuff&quot;, whether that's gear, or plat, or drops to sell for plat, or exp.  Will it be as good as if you were grouped?  No, and why should it be?  2 or 5 or 10 or 72 people working together can achieve greater results than one person alone.<br />
<br />
Was the solo exp nerf in PoP kind of ridiculous?  Yeah, mainly because it only really hurt the &quot;slow soloers&quot; -- shaman, non-charming necros (I'm thinking PON, POD here, not tactics training or mages soloing the BOT bees), beastlords etc.  Not swarmers/quad kiters.<br />
<br />
But I digress, I don't really like to solo so I'm not trying to speak authoritatively.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ogath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeha there is, but...when i look at my spell list, for both  my mage and sham, all of the new ones require i go do LDoN advents, <br />
<br />
but sometimes i'd rather not deal with people...i guess its my chioce, but to nerf XP to get people to group...now thats just a low blow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Go play Morrowind if you want to play single player Everquest.<br />
That, or resign yourself to the fact that EQ is a multiplayer oriented game and you won't be able to acquire as much as other people if you choose to solo.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I like most people in EQ but agree that there should be more things to do solo. Are there fun/good thing things you can solo as some others have said here? Yes, but not everyone is lvl 65 with 40, 100, 200 AA's. <br />
<br />
If people that would rather or need to solo try WoW when it comes out I don't think they will be back to EQ. The rewards will be greater for groups of course but there will be things to do that are rewarding if you solo or only have an hour or two to play a night. EQ2 sounds like it will be mostly group orientated as is EQ.<br />
<br />
Oh well, that was just my crappy tought atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">So far WoW looks like nothing more than a Warcraft 3 (heros) and Diablo 2 (easy soloing, randomized rare items and preset skill tree to put points into each level...) hybrid with a tad of EQ here and there.  Do you honestly think Blizzard will make something that is &quot;innovative&quot;?  They are trying to make a game that is accessible to their main player base...which is mostly 12 - 19 year olds.  Quick fix of action is what almost all Blizzard games are.<br />
<br />
And btw, I love just about any game that they have come out with, although I only use WC3 for the custom games.  I just don't see WoW being much more than an action game with less player interaction in its current form.  So maybe this is what you were looking for? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have mixed feelings on this...because I feel that MMORPGs (massively multiplayer being two key words here) are social games and as such grouping should be a large part of them.  If you don't want to group and interact with other people then why even play?<br />
<br />
I don't think they should cater to soloists and/or distort the game attempting to appease soloists by providing soloable content (and that being said EQ has an abundance of soloable content such that finding something to solo, if you can solo, isn't an issue).<br />
<br />
Now, at the same time, it drives me nuts when critical spells require groups to obtain.  Casting and spells are critical to classes and shouldn't be so difficult to get, IMO.  I don't mind a great piece of gear or a quest requiring a group - because I can get by without a particular gear upgrade - but as a class that relies on casting I hate being without my spells.<br />
<br />
I might say that EQ has taken the social aspects to an extreme (with raiding and many high level encounters requiring more than one group) but at the same time one has to admit that EQ has a lot of content in general and there's something for everyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Morrowind rocks +)...but im lvl 109 and the leader of all the guilds, 2 of the houses, cult, temple, and legion, and colected all the rare items. the nerevine (sp?) beat bloodmoon and tribunal, been a vamp, and a werewolf. <br />
<br />
maxed my blunt, longblade, shortblade, restoration, heavy armor, medium armor, almost got light armor, (94 i think) destruciton, conjuration, and mystisism, spear, athleticts, that one that makes you jump higher...lol ah yeah acrobatics, and a few others, <br />
<br />
yeah i tried to start over...but after being able to jump across a whole town, i dont know...its like making a shaman, getting to 65, then starting over, and getting the trash beat out of you by a large rat. bleh.<br />
<br />
good game tho +)</div></div><hr />

<br />
ok, i'll go back to my rock...but its MY rock! im in control, that is the feeling that has/is leaving EQ, SONY is in control now, you dont decide what happens with the game  you PAY to play. <br />
<br />
&quot;enticing&quot; you to group by nerfing the alternative is controlling and imo WRONG, i pay them to do with the game what i want, what i like, and what will keep me playing, <br />
<br />
little by little i have lost all say in what happens. <br />
<br />
yeah sure, no one is FORCING me to play, but in truth i LIKE to play, MY way. honest, fair, and enjoyable. <br />
<br />
its SONY's job to make sure that is what they provide, they are a business like any other, if they want money, they have to provide what the customer wants, <br />
<br />
little by little they have taken that away. <br />
<br />
im paying for what now? the &quot;privilege&quot; to play THEIR characters, on THEIR servers...that my money paid for?  <br />
<br />
do you see what im saying?<br />
<br />
where is the customer service? where is my money going? to nerf my class? to nerf my soloing xp? *** kind of way is THAT to run a business? when did i say they could nerf solo xp? <br />
<br />
...*puts flame suit on*...ok i have to say it, if youre a republican you know and understand what im saying. if your a democrat you dont. <br />
<br />
its the same with taxes. ITS MY MONEY! if i dont want you to take it, HOW can you force me to give it?...isnt that stealing? theft? 2000$ fine? 6 months in jail if i do it, but oh sure, good ol' uncle sam can do it AND throw ME in jail if i dont hand the dough over! <br />
<br />
...yeah im in a pissy mood about the whole nerf what they dont like thing. AND about taxes...you know my last check was 480 bucks...i &quot;got&quot; to keep only 212 of it. THATS THEFT!!<br />
<br />
im a pizza delivery boy, <br />
<br />
but thats the way i feel, i like security, comfort, ownership of what i pay for, <br />
i see down the sony's EQ future road, it looks bad. <br />
<br />
how soon before slow is nerfed? or haste? how soon before bow dmg is nerfed? or charm, dire charm, how soon before every mob in the game summons? how soon before AAxp is nerfed? or even better, how soon before one point in an AA costs 5 points for level 1, 10 for lvl 2, and 15 for lvl 3? <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I somewhat agree with you on the EQ stuff. The majority of posts on forums in hunting areas are about soloing. On class specific sites they have guides for soloing. So it's not hard to see that there are many people that want to or have to solo due to time, etc... If they want happy people they would add or change something. But, it is and was a group style game so solo will always be harder.<br />
<br />
...*puts flame suit on*...ok i have to say it, if youre a republican you know and understand what im saying. if your a democrat you dont.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't even know where to start. It's pretty ignorant to think that someone that is a Democrat doesn't understand wanting to keep more of their money. Both Dems and Repubs cover the full spectrum of ideas and believes. You're not on a freaking team. You don't have to put down the others to make yourself feel better. There are Repubs that create the largest U.S. government ever and the are Dems that cut programs to save money. And who wants to let in 8 million illegals to take your pizza delivery job? That's supposed to be something a democrat would do. See what I'm saying? Oh well, enough of me going on. And I didn't even put my 'flame pinky ring' on so don't think I'm flaming you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dissagree thats the whole point to the thier grouping emphisis.... more people WANT the grouping part becuase so few other games do that...  they ARE providing what the customer wants... you ARE the minority, sorry to tell ya... theres hundreds of single person shooter and rpg games out there go play one.   <br />
<br />
...whine whine bitch bitch... you cant please everyone all the time...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well I for one like to Solo, when I don't have the time to group, and group when I do.  It is a very simple fact.  The rant that the original poster had is very valid although some what whiney.  It is wrong to take away an ability/exp/spell/etc... That you could once had/could obtain solo.  Yes the game changes and that's what makes it great.  But to make me/you get less exp per kill if we are solo just doesn't make sense.  What they should have done was to truely give a bonus to those who did group.  IE.  Mob A = 100 exp If you solo you get 100 exp.  If you group with 1 other Mob A should Give 225 exp to split (112.5 exp each).  3 ppl should get 350 to split (116.7 exp each), 4 ppl 475 (118.75 exp each), 5 ppl 600 (120 exp each) , and 6 ppl 725 (120.8 exp each)  That way there is a bonus for grouping.  Heck this is just an example but don't take from one who solos, just GIVE MORE to those who can/choose to group.</div></div><hr />

I dont have a problem being forced to group for better items and safety factors. I DO however have an issue of having to belong to a superhero holier than thou guild with 400 members in order to be able to complete battles for drops like the epic peices. cant possibly take out mobs to get the &quot;Normal&quot; items without 6 groups. I belong to a small guild that likes to have fun and we get together regularly. we dont admit morons or egotistical babblers. we like it this way, but dont have enough members to take down average/high mobs (and no, im not talking about takingt out time lords)  sony has and will always manage to cater to a few guilds who regulary war clan over the rest of us</div></div><hr />
