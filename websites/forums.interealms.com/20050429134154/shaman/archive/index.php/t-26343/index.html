<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wow.  Nerf rogues.<br />
I was out in Alterac mountains today.<br />
I was harvesting some goldthorn when I got jumped by a 39 Ogre Warmonger.<br />
My rogue is level 38 at the moment.<br />
I proceeded to kill him.  I needed a healing potion, but I could have done it without it if I had bandaged properly mid combat off a gouge instead of a missed gouge...or if I had been able to stealth jump him with a cheap shot to open.<br />
This is with an assassination/combat build built around using daggers for big backstabs that isn't doing almost anything for me as I just got a huge weapon upgrade that's not a dagger for my main hand.<br />
So lame.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Feather My thief was able to solo a named 60 elite at level 59.<br />
<br />
With bandaging, chained essance of erankus, ambushing him, Liberal use of stuns, and the biggest honking potion I could find to heal with.<br />
<br />
It is still one of the best fights I have done with the thief. Pushed it to the wall on that one. <br />

It's been proven that all elites are not created equally. I've had my ass handed to me by a -6 elite before. At 60 some of the level 53 elite Black Dragonspawn in Burning Steppes take everything I've got to kill them, and I sometimes die to those.<br />
<br />
What was your point exactly? The only &quot;lame&quot; thing I see here is someone calling for a nerf because of some inaccurate perception of being overpowered.  Ogres are practically the squishiest mobs in game (save PC Warlocks :)). They die easily anyways.</div></div><hr />

[EDIT] - BTW...ogres are some of the squishiest mobs in game. They die easily anyways.<br />
<br />
That is very true.  I also solo'd that as a warrior at level 58.  That mob is way overconned or is not really elite.  If I can do it, then this must be true :) (see my other diatribes on warriors killing abilities hehe).<br />
<br />
Although I would also argue that a hunter has a good chance against many elite mobs close to their level, not just the mismarked ones :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The chieftan there is a gimp.  Any class can kill him that's level 57 or higher.<br />
<br />
I've been through Alterac mountains with 3 characters now.  There's no possible way my mage or my shaman could even come close to compete with one of those ogres on even terms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Mage I can believe. Nice power, low survivability if taking even the slightest damage, and ogres can hit pretty hard. But Shaman? Come on! Closest thing to a tank mage this game has.<br />
<br />
Not having played a Shaman up to sufficient level to test it myself, I'll have to defer to others here who have and have taken on the Warmongers. However, with the Shaman I know in game and the power I've witnessed them to have, I'm skeptical of your assertion.<br />
<br />
Only other assumption I can make is that you just suck at playing a WoW Shaman? :) /poke /jab</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I dunno, a shaman who kites properly can take just about anything I have seen. hunters solo elites much better, as do paladins.<br />
<br />
Really does depend on the mob and their abilities. <br />
<br />
Also, remember, a rogue needs to have their timered abilities up to accomplish things like that usually, many classes do not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LARRY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think he was being sarcastic because of Walrus posting on shaman boards that Blizz should nerf shaman cause they now have the ability to reincarnate without rezz sickness.... so that the instance group doesnt have to sit around 10 mins for it to wear off....<br />
<br />
Truely it is a over powering ability....and I think it will break the entire game.... <br />
<br />
/em looks around for chicken little screaming..ooooo noooos the sky is falling.....we dont have to sit around and wait for shaman to get rid of rezz sickness.....</div></div><hr />
