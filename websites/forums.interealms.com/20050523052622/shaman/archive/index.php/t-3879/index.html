<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shokar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Remember when you spent 1000's upon 1000's of plat working up your Alchemy skill just so you could make potions that people sometimes buy?<br />
<br />
Do you remember the time it takes to make these potions?<br />
<br />
Do you know how many YOUNG SHAMAN depend on SOWS to help them ADVANCE their COSTLY ALCHEMY skills?<br />
<br />
WELL - WHEN I SELL a SOW potion for 100 plat, or I sell a Shrink potion for 185 plat, I take all this into account.  Sure it costs about 112 plat for 20 of each ingredient to make a sow....  But that does not justify selling your potions for 60 plat in THE BAZAAR.<br />
<br />
That is basically like making SOWS for Free, because you are not recouping your developmental costs.  And it forces those shaman lower than us to take an even BIGGER hack at their banks, due to underselling shaman.<br />
<br />
I ask that ALL shaman STOP the bargain rates at which people are now hawking their wares.  100 plat is fair, and people WILL pay those prices.  PEOPLE WILL PAY 180-200 plat  for SHRINKS.<br />
<br />
With AA Skill Runspeed and items which right click shrink, and a lot of other potions we make NOBODY wanting...why are we giving our WARES away for free.<br />
<br />
I say, if you as a shaman cannot be fair to your fellow shaman, go create a necro!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The situation will straighten itself out.<br />
<br />
One solution that has been proposed is to buy up the low priced potions and sell them yourself at a &quot;normal&quot; price.  Generally tho, I can't make sow potions fast enuf to meet demand, at 100pp per ten shot.  <br />
<br />
Or you can just offer your potions at whatever price you wish and they'll probably be gone in the morning anyway.  But honestly, if you are only to the point of making shrink potions, you haven't spent that much actual cash on alchemy yet.<br />
<br />
One thing I did note . . . ten charge potions now sell for quite a bit more to vendors.  I got 39pp for a ten charge Null potion.  I think that will translate to sows and shrinks as well, so that's making it cheaper to level up your skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I refuse to enter into any sort of price fixing.  The enchanters/JCers on my server have a little &quot;agreement&quot; about prices and I loathe it.</div></div><hr />

Oh well, I will probably keep a couple available on my mule and sell them eventually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xalbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't care if they ARE being sold by some morons for 90pp SoW pots will always be 100pp at  my tent. I don't cave to the quick sale instant gratification weakness that some &quot;eq traders&quot; have. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that people who do that are morons. SoW pots are one of our only  guaranteed sources of income. I trivialized it less than a week ago and I have already made over 1k in profit off of it. 100pp is my price and I am sticking to it. I urge all shammys to keep the price at 100pp. They sell fast enough as it is. I sold 8 of them the last time I was on in less than 45 minutes. Try making that kind o' cash off a mob (besides GIANTS lol) in 45  minutes. Took me 20 minutes to make em all and 45 to sell. What kind of a genius can't wait 45 minutes to make a profit. Maybe its just me, I designate some nights to pure trading. some nights I camp loot. some nights I camp exp and some nights I trade in the bazaar. Its not about price fixing, that is virtually impossible. In order to have effective price fixing no one would be allowed to sell for under that amount. Free will reigns in the bazaar. No one can force people to not sell for under a set price. However people who do are contributing to the decline of the economy on SZ the same as on several other servers (A BCR runs about 800pp on Terris, on SZ I have seen it sell for near 2.5k). I buy up all the SoW potions I see for under 100 and resell them at regular price. Makes me a nice lil profit.</div></div><hr />

They'll sell overnight and I get a few 20-30p per sale.  Works for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>dominan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You know... alot of the &quot;10 charge SOW potion&quot; aren't really 10 charges?<br />
<br />
The name of the item is 10 charge... for me, I bought it from some shammy for about 150pp (punk over charge me) when i was playing my rogue. Now that i hardly play anymore, I just try to sell it. it has like 5 or 6 charges left, and I don't need it since i'm a shammy, so i post it up for sale for 60pp.<br />
<br />
It'll still show up as &quot;10 Charge SOW potion&quot; or something like that... and will be listed as 60pp.<br />
<br />
That might be the case in your server, so don't worry =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thalarctos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Why should other people pay you to skill up a mostly useless skill?  For the love of pete, you can get to a 35 skill in alchemy for less then 50pp (armor dyes), and once you get to 70 making invis to undead and shrink (sell invis to undead in lguk, shrink pretty much anywhere) you've lost what, 1k maybe?  Selling sow potions for 90pp, it would take you 30 potion sales to break even and then you're making money.<br />
<br />
The idea of price fixing for potions is pretty annoying.  It's all about putting a price tag on your time.  It takes on the outside a minute to make a 10 dose potion?  If someone could make 120 potions and sell them for 60pp, that's roughly 300pp an hour.  This looks better if you consider that it probably doesn't take anywhere near a minute to make a ten dose potion.  So someone wants to sell enough that they make up for the low profits per potion.  Hardly an earthshattering problem that needs to be whined about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Akhasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'd just like to add that you dont have to fall into the trap.  SOW potions are only that cheap in the bazaar; try selling them in OT, or DL, or anywhere where running for your life is a necessity...you'll find alot more buyers with more open pockets.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Browu Frostforge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have chosen simply not to make SoW potions, ever.<br />
<br />
I made boatloads of them when my skill was lower.  Now my main income, low as it may be, are gate potions.   These things are still more than most people will pay for them, though.<br />
<br />
People calling for price fixing haven't thought it out.  Do you also support uber guilds agreeing to price fixing on spells such as Malo and Torpor?  <br />
<br />
Make your potions, sell what you can and bitch like hell until VI improves the trade.  Don't start talking about price fixing; the notion is silly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>humburto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I stopped making sow potions. I will probably again make them once I get a mule in the bazaar full-time. <br />
One interesting thing I found out about potions, particularly the 10 charge ones: (this would usually be with the non-shamans who use the potions) When you go to sell a potion to the vendor with all 10 charges you get the same price as the 10 charge potion with only 1 charge... This means little except that you can sell the 10 charge potion when it only has 1 charge left for the same price as when it has 10 charges. For some potions this is more then the ingridients cost to make 1 potion, sometimes much more... I know I use shrink potions often when i use my horse since Luclin models need to be on, and they go for 30 or 40pp or something. Shrink potions are the only ones I have tried at this though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Winsome Dove</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This may seem mean but, why don't you just buy every potion he has for sell and when he puts more up buy em and turn around and sell em at normal price he may learn or he may have found a permenat customer and your just making an easy 40 percent if your sellin for 100 pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Leebae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">dont forget that you are not peoples only source for sow potions a lot of guilds are getting shaman to the point where they will supply the guilds sow potions at cost so paying 100p for a 10 shot or waiting for a guild shaman and paying 55p you make the call at what you would do i know i supply a lot of potions at cost to my guild</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Sorry, I don't believe in price-fixing either.<br />
<br />
I price at 90p in the bazaar, because the convenience of making potions next door in Shadowhaven and dropping them in the bazaar at my salesdroid makes up for the 10-20p.  I average 30p profit for about 3-5 minutes' work, and I think that is fair.<br />
<br />
If your cost is still high, don't sell in the bazaar.  When I sell them outside the bazaar I still charge 110p and I don't get complaints.<br />
<br />
BTW, I worked a great deal with a wizard friend when I was a newbie alchemist - at the time, he was flush with cash from the 5-10p contributions he got for ports (lol), so I offered to sell him SoW potions for personal use at my cost FOREVER if he'd start buying them immediately.  The first one cost him 130p or something; the price rapidly dropped under the going rate of 120p at the time and stabilized at about 80-90p for a long time.  Then I sank 2kpp into trivializing shrink potions and got my SoW cost down to about 60, where it is now.  So he gets SoW for 60p, as many as he wants, but in return I got a guaranteed sale of my expensive first attempts.  Win-win situation in the long term.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I only do SOW for friends.  Too many idiots running the prices down on themselves to make a quick buck.<br />

I sell DS in the bazaar in 5 shots for 175.  They move slow but they move.</div></div><hr />

Dear GOD, you're right! What have I done? How dare I ever offend or wrong another shaman, as we are all part of the same Candyland collective. Here, fellow shaman, have all that I own, since you are, after all, a shaman. No matter that I don't know you, you were at least enlightened enough to click the &quot;shaman&quot; button on the make character page. That, of course, is enough to bind us like brothers and sisters in this communal paradise. I have sinned tho brother. Deeply. I have enjoyed the company of necros! I am unclean, shun me for your own good. Your post has hit me with fury, razing my world in whitehot flames. But, I arise Phoenix-like from the ashes a shaman reborn. A shaman who knows what's right!!<br />
<br />

Frankly, I like the suggestion that you just buy what he makes and resell them. May I also suggest meds, strong ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I hear you mormegil... I never realized that a fundamental knowledge of economics is so completely absent from so many people. <br />
<br />
1) If you don't want to buy something for a given price - don't.<br />
2) If you want to sell something for a given price - go ahead. But no one has the responsibility to buy it. <br />
3) If you want to make something to sell and no one buys it, who's fault is that? Not the people who don't buy it - they don't owe you anything. <br />
4) If you are selling something and someone else is selling the same thing for cheaper - tough for you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Do like I do, don't do alchemy. I've been level 60 for months and have 20 AA points so far, and I haven't got a single point in alchemy and don't intend in putting any into it. I never had the plat to invest in alchemy in the first place and I'd really rather not spend hours working on it when I could be having fun with friends.<br />
<br />
Even in DAoC, a game in which I felt the tradeskill system was vastly superior to EQ, I found tradeskills boring. I'd rather be XP'ing with friends, raiding with my guild or just goofing off exploring new zones.<br />
<br />
The only tradeskill that offers great returns for the amount of time put into it is tailoring in my opinion. But to become a master tailor, you have got to smoke TONS or crack...that skill is insane.</div></div><hr />
