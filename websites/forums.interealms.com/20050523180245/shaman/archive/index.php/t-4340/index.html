<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Broder Spiritcaller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Would like to get some input from other Shaman on how your guild handles Vindi BP. Is it shaman only or open to any who can wear? <br />
<br />
Also could you tell me if your guild /randoms everything or awards by decisions of the officers.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Awards. has only gone to Shaman so far seeing as it's close to being the best Shaman BP in game and not the best BP for other classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Open to any.<br />
<br />
First 4 went to shaman though. Shaman seem to have priority, though nothing is set in stone.<br />
<br />
All our loot is awarded by a council.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">only warriors got them so far since is is great tank bp, I beleive there are tonns of SK/pal/bard will get it before any of us. the status seen never up and didn't drop bp last time, Vindi up pretty often which mean all melee will get one soon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They are a great warrior bp this is true.  But they are also a great shaman bp.  My guild does lewt thru point based system where u gain points by attending raids and spend them on loot you want.  Only those who are willing to spend the points (and thus forego first pick on other loot) will ask to roll on an item.  This makes for low numbers of people rolling for any given item that drops.  Usually it's awarded to the only person that speaks up.  Sometimes stuff rots or is awarded to &quot;Mort&quot; the thurgadin banker NPC.  The last vindy bp we got almost rotted but was last minute looted by a twink.  We were so relieved.  Twink was a 45 warrior played by a cleric's RL wife.  I felt good about that for some reason.  Come to think of it, she also got thurg legs from that raid.  What a lucky girl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cragnorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, in my guild all BP's are assigned to individuals by the guild officers.  We have quite a few of these in guild now but the order they were handed out was sk/pally first, then shaman, then bard and warrior.  Most warriors would rather have ToV or Kael bp or eradication or true mithril.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Vindi BP --&gt; Shaman. Pallies and bards get first dibs on Statue BPs for the most part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">shaman last in line for this. been on vindi raids with 3-4 different guilds, never seen it awarded to a shaman. (Probably been in on 15 vindi kills total)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kylemall Inthensom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Heya Broder :)<br />
<br />
Vindi BP is used to be shaman only with us, but we now allow other classes to roll on it as well...Catch there is that if you are a warrior etc. and decide to roll on the BP and happen to win, you pass rights to any ToV BP's that may fall in the future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Vindy bp is hard to top for a warrior in end game gear.  It has the best hps (HPs the greatest warrior stat (190(+19 if have durability3)) hps to a lvl 60 warrior)), quite respectable ac, minor regen, attack, and great resists.  A lot of end game warriors wear this bp.  Most of them aren't trying to get all their AC on their bp tho.  There are many many warrior bps out there with more ac.  Very few have more hps tho, and in the end game that's what warriors seem to prize the most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zenok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Way we always thought of it was if a guild can kill Vindi, they can definetly kill statue.......so statue bps went to warriors, and vindi bps went to shaman, since it was the best ac/hp shaman wearable bp in the game (pre luclin).....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Pikkelz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">we went shaman then bard then warriors that were too inactive to get an erad bp then twinks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Vindi BP goes to shaman first in our guild, but we are not allowed to roll on HoT breastplates (seems fair enough to me).  There are (arguably) better warrior BP's out there that are within our guilds reach, but not any shaman ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">When my guild first started killing Vindi I assigned the BPs to shamans.  Looking back on it I realize this was a mistake.  Yes, shamans love the BP and it's great for us, but it is also a better end-game BP than BP of eradication for all meleers.  Almost all of my warriors prefer it over BP of the Void or BP of Eradication.  <br />
<br />
If you already have maxed STA and are at the AC cap, there isn't a better BP outside of VT for a warrior, SK, or bard than Vindi BP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Our tanks got before i got.  its arugblyt he best shaman BP (pre VT)  but its also argubly the best warrior bp (pre uber duper stuff, i dont follow warrior gear).   a warrior with truely good gear will only care about pure hp cause there stamina is maxed.  vindi bp has max hp any velious items had (i think)  and aura of battle wich isnice for tanks also +13 attk.  tanks got in my guild first, i did not get my vindi BP till every melee who wanted had... granted i had wicked mail up to that point. but its a damn good bp for all classes who can wear so i think its riducolous to say shamans first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The E'Ci Raiding Public was orginally awarding the Vindi BP to Shaman.  Since we've gone to points, anyone who can use it can bid on it.  But it's the Shaman that are the most willing to use up their raid points on getting it generally.  Lost one in bids to a Bard however and had a Pally bid me up on the one I got.   They've gone for 6 to 25 raid points on different bids.   Most Shaman that get it will wear it until the day the stop playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Julean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Last few raids the BP has gone to these classes:<br />
<br />
Low 50s warrior<br />
60 Bard<br />
60 Shaman<br />
60 Shaman<br />
56 Pally<br />
<br />
I also believe the first Vindi raid my guild did...back awhile ago, a shaman got the first Vindi BP.<br />
<br />
3/4 of our 60 shamans have a Vindi BP, the 4th doesn't want one till she has a full set of SS *shrug*<br />
<br />
I WANTED the Vindi BP, even though an SS BP would of been nice as well.<br />
<br />
Traditionally, it's been if you have a Vindi BP, at least with the shamans, you pass on the HoT BP drops. Which is fine with me :)<br />
<br />
Who wouldn't want this BP, I look smokin' in black!</div></div><hr />

<br />
*edit*<br />
In my guild Vindi bp used to be Shm/Clr only for the most part, but by now nearly everyone in guild who wants one has it. Will be going to twinks very soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The effect is an Regen/Atk buff on the Seru BP, btw. Worn, of course so no stacking issues.<br />
<br />
Jormal Dawnhammer<br />
Oracle of Winter<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">My guild is mostly NBG, but one night a week we institue a raid council.  So far, between the council and the NBG raids 2 bards and 1 warrior have claimed the BP.  The BP is apparently (according to the bards) as good for them as it is for us.  Shaman are apparently in the running for the BP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Mil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Ok, I stand corrected, outside of killing Seru or doing VT, there isn't a better end-game BP for warriors, SKs, Pallies, and bards than Vindi BP.<br />
<br />
BP of the Void is a huge dissapointment.  I wish Verant would upgrade it some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Our guild uses a point system and Vindi BP is open to anyone who can equip it.  Points buy you 10 chances in the lotto, buyouts are possible with enough points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Dunno, there was some BP that dropped in NTOV that was 60 AC and some. A Paladin got it, sounded nice. All plate classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Any guild who does not let shamans in for vendi bp is retarded. You guys get the most benefit out of it then any other class who can equip compared to other pre-sst+ choices. I'd much rather shamans get these first default and they don't touch SS / Kael chain tunics. <br />
<br />
If your guild wants to argue against it then be sure to remind them how suck bp options are for rangers / rogues unless you're able to hit ssra+, then remind the said rogues and rangers you're going to be their competition for tunics :p</div></div><hr />
