<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">havent seen this mentioned but sorry if it has<br />
<br />
how about a rain type heal, ie heals in 3 waves in the area surrounding caster like the rain spells. 3 waves of 850 heals but need to be in the area to get healed? can be affect by aa , focus for normal heals. work out what mana makes this balanced.<br />
<br />
obviously depending how it work might need more or less hp healed per tick.<br />
<br />
coments and suggesting?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">While not an entirely bad idea I don't think it's that great of an idea either.  For it to mimic rains it'd have to become less effective based on the number of targets it was hitting.  Some classes already have group heals and plenty of classes have single target heal.  Typically when it comes to healing you want to hit specific targets or your whole group, not hope that hitting an area will heal someone in need.  Finally, shaman are generally mana inefficient as it is...a spell like this would surely have a ridiculous cost and be even less efficient than other healing mechanisms (not counting Q, which is insanely efficient).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rain spells only affect 5 (or 6) targets maximum.  A standard group heal would be more valuable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think its an interesting idea bara cudar.  I guess since shamans are a necro-hybrid utility class, regular priest quality heals are too much to ask for.  Maybe the rain style heal would be acceptable.  Maybe a group life tap like spell like necros get might be a way to go.  <br />
<br />
It all really comes down to how can the shaman community package a better heal that will not cause the real priest classes to feel threatened by our superior utility, and healing.  If we can get a heal that is strong enough to give me a second shot at turgurs while keeping folks alive, I'm all for it, no matter how its packaged (said with an ironic smile).</div></div><hr />

Necro-Hybrid utility class ??????<br />
I always thought we were a priest class.<br />
Anyway *** is a Necro-Hybrid utility class ?<br />

What the? Shamans are priests. We're not flippin hybrids. Never were. If that doesnt say it all about how badly we've fallen behind in healing, I dont know what does. Geezus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Not sure about waves but an area heal (as opposed to a group heal) with a max of 4 targets does not sound too bad, as long as it was coded to not hit full health people. Could just shoot it into the melee crowd on raids.<br />
Also bonus style points for having a completely unique spell.  :D <br />
<br />
Numbers are debatable but I do like the idea.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">btw, the poeple stuck on the necro hybrid bit, he explained in on another post, shaman do have similarities to necro in there dots, and some abilities. however i think he just making a point that aat the moment we just dont seem like a priest class, even though we are:)<br />
<br />
and yes a group Q, would be nice, this was more of a large quick heal that could keep up with mob damage, i suppose if you made it a single target we could make a uneffiecent version of Q, a blast Q, that healed 820 a tick over 3 ticks but for 625 or so mana. (total without effects about 2500 for 625 mana  less effeicent that the new cleric 3k quick heal and obviously as not a direct heal still cant complete with the high direct heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We used to be a preist class. Able to be a healer if we had the time. <br />
<br />
Now..<br />
<br />
Well.<br />
<br />
I just don't know. There is not really a classification for what we do anymore. Other than depending on the makeup of the group a shaman is getting to be the last class I would place in a group in much of the new content. <br />
<br />
Which really kinda hurts. Cause I am a shaman through and through. <br />
<br />
Our heals just do not cut it. Period. Our Dps Doesnt cut it. Our slows would cut it and cover alot of the gaps of our design. but they were mitagated or outright immune. <br />
<br />
The change to twitch gaming is here to stay. 30 second fights. Pathetic. When you spend more time pulling a single to kill than actually killing. When the game is made up so that 2+ monsters will wipe out people that could kill gods. When people can be killed in less time than it takes to sneeze. No matter thier skill. <br />
<br />
Sorry folks. SoE has turned the game into a mockery of what it once was. And I am past tired of playing in a game with people I like and gameplay that I do not like. <br />
<br />
I might wander EQ on occasion for nostalgia sake or to see how friends are doing. But the fire is gone. And that makes me awful sad.<br />

On the pvp servers one rain can hit an indefinite number of PC targets for all 3 waves.</div></div><hr />

Necro hybrid... Do you even play a Shaman?<br />
<br />
Oh I’ve had a shaman since the last stage of EQ beta.  Now I will admit I quit the game along with many of the PvP oriented guildmates I was in when we finally realized how poorly balance PvP was in EQ.  Played DAOC and ShadowBane for a long time, but a couple rl friends kept pestering me into playing EQ, and finally I dusted Tormac off and started playing again last November.   I think the fact that I quit the game for a couple years, then came back to my shaman makes it easier for me to see what our class has become.  I was not around for most of the gradual widening of the healing gap.  In fact when I started playing EQ again, I was puzzled why folks would ask me if I seriously thought I could heal, and then were surprised when I doggedly said of course I’m the main healer for the group.  But after finally leveling Tormac back up and hitting some of the new challenging content, I understand.  We are certainly not priests.<br />
<br />
Ok, for those of you that doubt me, if shamans are priests, then why does Sony not act like it?  You can think of your shaman as a priest all you want.  You can think of your shaman as a warrior with a doggy pal, or a primitive enchanter that performs crowd control through slows and roots.  It makes no difference how one thinks of the shaman.  <br />
<br />
The fact is Sony has not treated shamans like priests for quite some time.  You do realize that that is what is important don’t you?  Look at the heals clerics and druids have gotten and are getting.  Look at the heals that shaman have received.  Our defining spells are detrimental afflictions that we consign onto others, not heals.  <br />
<br />
If we’re priests, why are our heals being neglected to the point that even patch healing is problematic? You can call shaman what ever you want, but that does not change what shaman actually are.<br />
<br />
Verant may have one thought of us as primitive priests, tribal witchdoctors.  That was when in comparison to other “priests” we still healed ok.<br />
<br />
Sony does not see shaman as a priest class.  Face it they do not.  They see us as some sort of necro hybrid whose power comes from curses of the spirit world, inflicting others with debilitating disease and parasites that slow their offense, cripple them, and then slowly kill them over time.<br />
 <br />
Maybe necromancer is not the perfect word to describe us.  As a warhammer player I would say we were chaos sorcerers of Nurgle, but if you’re not familiar with the warhammer world that would not make sense either.  But its is clear to me, after playing again for a few months, that shamans are no longer priests, but something else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Galdir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">What we miss is a bigger fast heal dont help much that we have slow. When most boss mobs in GoD is immune to slow and casting the fast heal we have now heal to littel compared to the dps those mobs have,<br />
<br />
If they dont give a new heal do so the mobs can be slowed a bit mybe 10 20%  so we can be second healer. Now you realy nead a cleric mybe can do it with a druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Seichan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">While I like your general idea of giving us Shamans a deeper well of healing utilities...I dun like the rain.. too hard to control..and sounds unuseful PvP.. I'd frankly settle for the level 64 3.3k/upto 75% heal that never went live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'd settle for:<br />
<br />
BoT being same hp/mana ratio/cast as Q but healing 425-475 a tick<br />
<br />
Tnargs 2: same hp/mana ratio/cast as Tnarg but heal 1750-1800 base.<br />
<br />
Make these heals droppable in vexd/tipt.<br />
<br />
I'd rather see the type of heals we have upgraded to at least cut it in GoD higher content, rather than having AE rain 'patch' heal.. I still think we need stronger fast direct single target heals more than anything atm..</div></div><hr />
