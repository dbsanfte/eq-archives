<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>pestario</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I dumped my Bezerker at 28 and have my SK to 22, I'd like to get him to about 25 before grouping with my 27 Shaman. I can do this in Echo Caverns if its not camped. After this is acomplished were are some good spots for a 25 SK, 27 Shaman combo to level up?<br />
<br />
I do plan on hitting OT at 30 to get my Overthere Hammer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kashtae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First, although it slows down a bit, you can level as high as the low 30s in Paludal (I know this primarily from visits back there to heal/cure/buff at 32 and finding some bandits still conning light blue, as well as taking a character to 29 and still getting slow experience there.  I t wouldn't be worth it were it not for the XP modifier in that zone.)<br />
<br />
Now on to the question at hand.<br />
<br />
I'm sure you know to tell the SK pet NOT to taunt.  The SK will do your tanking, and both of you can layer some nasty dots on the prey.<br />
<br />
You can get some experience for a while killing in Netherbian Lair (Trogs or Netherbians), then move out to the edge of Dawnshroud Peaks and kill Zelniaks and Lightcrawlers. (The Lightcrawlers are aggressive and will blind you.  Be ready for that)<br />
<br />
When the lightcrawlers and Zelniaks stop being good experience, around the end of the 20s, you can prey upon some of the mushrooms between Sanctus Seru and GE.  These can take you into the low 30s.  I left there with my characters about 32.  LDON is always a good option in the 20's and 30's but you can't do that with just 2 characters.<br />
<br />
From the low 30s into the upper 30s seems to be a place I get hung up a bit.<br />
<br />
As an alternative, you'll find Unrest still offers considerable experience in the mid twenties and slows a lot in the early 30s.</div></div><hr />
