<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone else noticed that when they log on spell effects are always off? I turn them on but when i come back they're off again after camping out, Anyway to set them on to default.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Solairs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ok.  Its just not me then.  The same thing is happening to me too.  If anyone has a solution, I would love to hear it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shaben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've got a feeling that this is to do with the way you quit. Are you actually camping out? Camping to desktop? or /q ing. I think /camp desktop might not save this info, but I'm not sure - I'll have to do some tests.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thyrm Jarlson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I had this happen on my second PC, but not on my main. Since having 2 computers, I could easily compare the eqclient.ini files. There was a line on my secondary that looked like this:<br />
<br />
SpellParticleDensity=0.000000<br />
<br />
And my main:<br />
<br />
SpellParticleDensity=0.500000<br />
<br />
So I made the other one the same and it fixed the problem. This setting will put spell particle density at medium.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I changed this on my vendor to try to keep him in vendor mode for more than an hour at a time.  It didn’t work.  But as such changes are universal across characters, my other characters got stuck with it as well.  After making the change I noticed that spell density had become defaulted at none (or off).  I thought it was because my vendor had been booted off yet again.  But after sitting down and logging out properly for several days it never changed.  I’d log in, notice I couldn’t see any spell effects and turn them back on.  I’d sit down and camp at the end of my session.  But when I logged back in my spells would be turned off again.  <br />
<br />
I just kind of shrugged and kept changing it back every session.  Then, about two days ago, I logged in and my spell effects were back on.  Somehow the default spell density was reset to low. I have no idea how it happened.  To the best of my knowledge I didn’t do anything different than I had done for days before.  <br />
<br />
Sorry I can’t be of more help, but at least there’s hope.</div></div><hr />
