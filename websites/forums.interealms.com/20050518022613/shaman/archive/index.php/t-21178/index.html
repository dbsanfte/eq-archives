<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaninfrenzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Saw this post linked to on Castersrealm:  http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=testing&amp;message.id=29&amp;no_redir=true<br />
<br />
Scimmed through the thread. I haven't logged onto test yet myself. Apparently this will affect casters also as Brenlo states somewhere on the first page. He later goes on to say this is not aimed at allowing melee to solo better but to help low level players. He uses the example of someone playing a melee at lvl 30 and quits the game because of having to sit too long to regen health. He also takes a jab at shaman whining on page 6  ;) .<br />
<br />
My personal opinion is that this is yet another slap in the face to shaman and finally a way to indirectly nerf the fungi since it really is only a good shaman item. Ok, ok, just kidding, no negetive rep points please  :D.<br />
<br />
The regen is stated by Brenlo to scale, so the longer you sit, the faster you will regen. I'm only half joking about the indirect fungi nerf but that's not necessarily a bad thing. This change if it makes it live seems to go along with all of the other changes making the game easier and more attractive to new players. When I first read the last patch message, I was a little tempted myself to PL up some new twinks because of the &quot;Hot Spots.&quot; I'm sure a lot of the old timers, myself included, will cringe at the thought of an even newer crop of clueless lvl 65's in the months to come.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nothing new about clueless level 65's. There will be more no matter what, either by plevel or by ebay.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as what changed, all classes will regen hit points faster when sitting. However, it will have the greatest impact on those with more hit points.<br />
<br />
<br />
What that says to me is that they are working on a way to make it go off of a percentage instead of hp/tick...which leads to an incredibly huge problem that multiple people in the thread brought up:<br />
<br />
<br />
Iksar goes from a natural regen of double the human to a natural regen of 3/2 the human, yet still maintains a 20% penalty. Same for Trolls <br />
<br />
<br />
I had to get 20% more exp than you frogs and cats to get to 65, and my reward for that is a much better regen rate(go ahead and bring up the 20ac or forage, I need a good laugh). <br />
<br />
If frogs and cats close the gap substiantially with this upgrade I damn well better get something in return for erasing my racial advantage.I'd be glad to take the racial penalty exp I had to rack up returned to me in aa form.<br />
<br />
Being kos everywhere seems more than a fair tradeoff for my other two &quot;advantages&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">KoS just means more targets. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
  You did get something in return.  You got 5 years of having better regen than the other races.<br />
<br />
  The only way anyone with a racial exp bonus loses out on this is if that bonus still exists after the change.<br />
<br />
  Do you commonly go to the bazaar a week after buying an upgrade and demand that the person selling that SAME item at a lower price give you the pp difference between what you paid and what they are charging?  No, the extra money you paid you paid to get the item earlier, and if you thought it was worth it at the time, how is it NOT worth it now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm not really sure why the people there think its so hot for shaman, since we don't sit down while we're cann'ing.

<br />
BUT before they start introducing yet more things that will be nerfed/crash zones/exploited doesnt anyone else here think that they should put all of their Dev team on working out the 100's of problems that already exist some of them game breaking ?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rgallnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sounds like its nice for all classes.  Lowers downtime.  Betcha it works while we sit on horses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">While sitting on a horse you get STANDING health regen, and sitting MANA regen.  Has always been that way.<br />
<br />
  Only way you could really take advantage of this is if you were a FLAWLESS canni dancer and could manage to sit down at the registry of each and every tick, then you could (given enough time) build it up to healing your entire max hp every tick.  A mob would have to be slowed for this to happen, and even then it'd be easy for it to get broken and make it start over at base regen levels.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  Who knows, it may bring back the dance, but I never cared for dancing anyway.  Only change they are making that I think will impact the game at all is letting you bind wound while you sit and raising BW cap to 70%.  We'll see a lot more people using that skill, and with bandages flowing they will easily get to 70% before they start regening more than 1% per tick from the other enhancement</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I gotta agree with a sub-thread.<br />
<br />
Iksar / Troll regen doesn't matter. Period. 2 extra HP per tick doesn't make downtime move any faster at all, and it certainally doesn't help in a fight. Sure from levels 1 - 10, it's a pretty nice boost... But at those levels you're on an exp PCP trip, just blasting through them like nothing, anyway.<br />
<br />
20% penalty is too harsh for such mediocre returns. That's 54 bubbles of yellow exp my Beastlord will never see, enough to take him to level 64.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Its FFXI's healing system for basically the way I understand it. The only difference was in FFXI it actually takes time to sit and stand so you can only use it during downtime really. Either way I think its a good thing for melee's leveling up, but it really isn't going to fix the issue of melee soloing sucking while casters can pretty much solo at almost any level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hmm  I had a ranger, I think this would have been very nice, although just a pain to sit down and med for health, but better than obsoleting the regen spells.</div></div><hr />

12(at 2nd min), 18(at 3rd min), 24(4th min), 30(5th min)<br />
Total: 940 hp regened in 6 min<br />

If the formula continue, 1300 hp in 7 min, 2200 hp in 9 min, <br />
3340 hp in 11 min.<br />

<br />
It takes 11 minutes to regen 3340 HP? 11 minutes in game is a long time and that is approximately half of a well equipped tanks HP, isn't it? I still think that any tank class is going to prefer a healer partner over soloing at that rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Otoole Frostypants</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If Sony is not careful with this regen ability I can see necros using it in combination with Liche sequence of spells while root dotting.<br />
<br />
But if it takes 11 minutes to regen 3340 HP, why would a necro use THIS option as opposed to a lifetap? I can't see it. Lifetap is way faster to get HP than sitting for 11 minutes is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">But if it takes 11 minutes to regen 3340 HP, why would a necro use THIS option as opposed to a lifetap? I can't see it. Lifetap is way faster to get HP than sitting for 11 minutes is.<br />
<br />
Lifetap only uses more mana...<br />
has a chance of braking root..<br />
Finally try the leech line of dots it not cheap vs mana..<br />
<br />
When you need mana, the less time you need to drain (directly using mana) means that much more mana for the necro.  And yes even necros run out of mana.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">In that summary that was posted it was stated the additional regen will not work if you have a dot on you including the Lich line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Using this to root rot would mean sitting down at each and ever tick, and somehow keeping root up on the mob while doing it.  Roots don't last that long, nor that reliably.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Lethe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well, as the advantage doesn't kick until you have been sitting for 10 straight ticks I don't see how necros can use it for anything. And it (supposedly) keeps on scaling up for every full minute you have been seated without ever getting up. <br />
<br />
And it doesn't work on horses either, you still get standing hp regen while mounted.<br />
<br />
But that still doesn't mean that the pure melee will get the most benefit from it. I think soloing hybrids are the ones who will reap the benefits actually.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know about troll regen, but iksar is quite a bit more than 2hp/tick at 65, if magelo's are anything to go by. My naked regen is 21/27, whereas someone like Canaas, who I assume is a Barb, has 7/10.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yes, iksar and troll regen is about double that of Barbs and the rest currently.  Comparing to me is a bit misleading actually since I don't have any regen items nor AA, so if you take away your 3 from AA and 2 from Aug, then it stands at a 7/10 from me and a 16/22 from you, just a bit over double.<br />
<br />
  And iksar/troll WILL maintain their significant advantage here.   If you look at the info posted they showed taht every minute you add your base regen on to your current regen (so after one minute you and I would be 14/20 and 37/49, after 2 it would be 21/30 and 53/71).  So if anything the difference between Iksar/troll and the other races is now far more pronounced and possibly WORTH the exp modifier for once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">This is just another in a series of changes designed to eliminate the &quot;pain&quot; of leveling from 1-65. Its becoming more and more obvious that SOE isnt really relying too much on NEW customers, so they are increasing the playaility of the game for people who wish to try out other classes, for whatever reason (fun, hate their current class, as a boxxed character)<br />
<br />
Look at the recent changes. They are focused on one thing. Faster leveling from 1-65. Period. Level 65s could mostly care less about sit regen. Who sits? Even in XP group, the people taking the damage never sit, and the people who sit hardly need the extra regen. What 65's do you know that use Bandages regularly? Ok, non-healing classes that wish to solo-farm-pp farm, whatever. Whip-Tee-Doo. <br />
<br />
Everquest is now about being level 65, and I bet MOST, if not all, of the future content will be designed SOLELY around that level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">As I said, this is not aimed at the high level melee folks and many would argue that melee are not in the most need (Right Shaman, Mages and Necros?)  But back to the matter at hand. . . Yes this will not help you high level melee classes, what it will help is those folk who try a melee class and give it up by level 30.  Perhaps it will make them play the class a bit longer, maybe eventually making it to the point where they too can come here and poo poo any idea offered to help the lower level melee folks. <br />
<br />
<br />
Brenlo wins points for successfully using &quot;poo poo&quot; in a sentence.<br />
<br />
Not going to speculate on exactly what he meant by citing shaman/mages/necros in that particular post because honestly, it could go either way. <br />
<br />
All things being equal I agree with the idea of lowering downtime at lower levels. I'd like to know the regen advantage iksars and trolls pay for with their xp penalty isn't nullified by it however.... but I'm not wading through 8 pages of semi relevant posts to find out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Summary of the melee downtime change in Test<br />
1. Regen rate change every 10 level<br />
2. The longer you sit, the more you reg<br />
3. You can't get sit regen bonus while have dot effect on you( especially Necro Lich line spells) <br />
4. Troll/Iksar will get more sit regen bonus than other race.<br />
5. You can bind wound while sit<br />
6. Pre-50 bind wound cap raised up to 70%,  over 200 bind wound skill will only increase Hp healed/per bandage now  <br />

<br />
Actually, the 2hp from the aug isnt included in the naked regen, so its 18/24, roughly about 2.5x what a non iksar/troll. I'm surprised that you went for metabolism rather than regen for your 6 general aa points, since regen is basically a mana battery for us.<br />
<br />
Thats good to know about the additive effects over time. I'm not sure if it would be of much use to me though, I rarely sit with Mok anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Well, on going with Metab over regen it was more of a lazy factor.  For me 3 hp a tick isn't a large enough number to matter with how hard i ride the wire, and I don't like forcefeeding food, so in order to save running to the bazaar for new Halas pies, I popped some points into Meta :)  Plus at that time being on a horse made you eat faster (not sure if it still does).<br />
<br />
  On raids, I never have buffs fade cause I die a fair deal, in groups the healers overheal me all the time anyway, and solo... well, regen could help a bit there, but I don't get much time for it anymore, and I generally only die in the first portion of a fight where slow was resisted or I learn how much the mob REALLY hits for ;)</div></div><hr />

Not according to Brenlo in that thread, his second post of Page six of the melee thread (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=testing&amp;message.id=29&amp;view=by_date_ascending&amp;page=6&amp;no_redir=true) <br />
<br />
Our INTENT is to help melee classes regen faster.  The fact that other folks will reap benefits is a double positive.  I am not sure how you find that insulting.  By the way, and several people have contacted me to offer their opinions on this topic, the majority of EQ players are sub 60.  It is a fact folks.  They are merely not as vocal and do not play as long a duration as you die hard folks do. <br />
<br />
I wonder if they are counting all the characters on every account, or just the highest on each account? I've got all 16 slots filled on my two accounts, but only one level 65 character.</div></div><hr />
