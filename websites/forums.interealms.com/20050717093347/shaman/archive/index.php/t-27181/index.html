so the ones we release are jumping right back on the battlefield, and libs want them all released? Man that is odd.<br />
<br />
Among the names listed in the memo is Mohammed Yusif Yaqeb (search), also known as Mullah Shazada. Yaqeb was released in May 2003. He proceeded to become the head of Taliban (search) operations in southern Afghanistan and was killed one year later in a fight with U.S. forces.<br />
<br />
Also named is Maulavi Abdul Ghaffar (search), released in 2002 and returned to Afghanistan. As a regional commander, Ghaffar helped carry out attacks on U.S. troops in Afghanistan until he was killed by Afghan forces in September 2004.<br />
<br />
One of the more notable cases involved Mohammed Ismail (search), one of two teens held at Gitmo until he was let go last year. He was recaptured four months later fighting American troops in Afghanistan. The memo notes that at the time of his capture Ismail was carrying a letter &quot;confirming his status as a Taliban member in good standing.&quot;<br />

Always the first to reort to name calling aren't you Mill?  Just more proof of you recognizing the idiocy of your argument I suppose.<br />
<br />
No one bitches because we hold terrorists, Mill - it's what we should do.  But even your article proves this administration couldn't identify a terrorist if it detonated a bomb in its face.  Why in the heck did they release known terrorists?  Could it be because they didn't know they were terrorists?  If they didn't know, then why did they &quot;detain&quot; them in the first place? Is it possible this bucket of clowns is just shooting in the dark and hoping they get something right?  Your article raises a ton of questions, but only answers one:  This administration has no clue when it comes to terrorists.<br />
<br />
Since when did this administration start releasing terrorists because liberals told them to?  Your arguments are inanely humorous, buddy.  Go have another beer to help et your head on straight.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">So in Mill-World, the people who made the decision to release terrorists aren't responsible for the decision to release the terrorists.    <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Not to put words in Krup's mouth, but I don't think he's been critical of holding terrorists.  He's probably been critical of the detainment of people innocent of any terrorist activities.  Most of those guys at Guantanamo are likely terrorists.  We need to keep them out of action.  It would be the few that are innocent of wrongdoing we need to release.   The real key would be figuring out who is a terrorist, and who isn't.  <br />
<br />
What makes some people nervous is when they hear things like &quot;we know they are terrorists, but proof is hard to find, so we're just going to detain them indefinitely, since they aren't covered by the Constitution in Guantanamo.&quot;  That's not a slippery slope.  We're at the bottom of the slope at the point we can toss people into prisons indefinitely if we think they probably committed a crime, but there is no evidence.<br />

I dont really have a point on this, but I didnt even really view Krups first post as open attacks like yours were. He may have attacked your political parties stance on these issues but he didnt attack YOU. You resorted to personal attacks the first chance you could.<br />
<br />
Then you go and attack people, whom you've likely never seen or likely will see's real life. You are a class act sir, I mean that in all honesty. I'm not even pointing out the obvious flaws in your logic. Trust me, when you can debate a point in an arguement with out making personal attacks on those with a differing point of view, and can talk reasonably with people on the other spectrum with out calling them rude and derogitory names, you should come back and try to make this post. Until then, you make yourself, and your cause look very poor. I bet anyone on these forums who agrees with you has a hard time saying so due to the hostility you show everyone and the various and obvious flaws in your logic.<br />
<br />
Please dont resort to personal attacks on me Mill, or threatening to beat me up IRL or what ever you are going to do. It will, if anything, make me laugh, and if not that, it will make me feel sad for you, because when you cant win you try to back up your words with mock actions, petty threats and stupid and rude boistorous bragging about how great your &quot;real life&quot; is, and how good you are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My plan would be to (quietly) ship them off to several other smaller facilities. Gitmo just has a bad rep right now - its almost symbolic.  <br />
Send em somewhere else, close down gitmo and get yer **** together so the other facilities dont get teh same bad press.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Luckily for you, the Democratic Party also has people like Horomen, who actually has an idea besides criticism.  BTW Horomen, that's not a half-bad idea, the only downside is trying to organize the security required in all of those places - never mind that I think it could open up even more rumors.<br />
<br />
Also, I don't know if I'd want these Taliban and terrorists actually IN the United States.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Of course there are all kinds of different ways to handle things.  I agree with Clinton basically, it's time that bad stories stop coming out because it's just jeopardizing our troops.  I personally don't care if they close GITMO or not, ultimately it's just a facility, but the environment needs to change if it has not.  I suspect it's changed a lot since when the FBI emails were written.  <br />
<br />
But I do savor the accountability / responsibility angle that Mill's post raised, and which you apparently adopt.  Or rather, the avoid-responsibility and accountability contortions that this administration and its stooges indulge themselves in.  <br />
<br />
Pretty obvious where you are.  No responsibility, no accountability, and blame &quot;liberals&quot; for every mistake.  <br />
<br />
That's real honest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>tangurena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Afghanis were being paid $5,000 and up for captured taliban members. In a country where the average income is $800 per year and a very corrupt country even before the taliban took over, kidnapping your enemies and selling them to US troops who didn't speak your language became a very profitable business. It is estimated that more than 90% of the people sold to the US troops were kidnapped this way. This sort of thing also happens with police informers, but the police have procedures to cut way down on the evil done by the informers. <br />
<br />
Torturing people kidnapped this way is guaranteed to turn them into enemies. Only St Theresas or Nelson Mandelas would refrain from turning to violence, hunting down and killing everyone associated with the enemy. Gitmo is a self fulfilling prophesy. Everyone who leaves that place has been turned into an enemy of the US by the very nature of the place, and by the evil deeds done in our name. What are the retards in the whitehouse actually thinking? That we don't have enough enemies in the world, so we have to build more of them.</div></div><hr />

You're missing the point Jagged.  If this administration had placed procedures into effect that screened these &quot;captives&quot; (let's face it, calling them terrorists with nothing but their country of origin and the fact that they wear a turban as proof doesn't make them terrorists) then the administration wouldn't be holding folks that shouldn't be held nor would they release terrorists to go back and cause us more problems.  It's their arbitrary hubris that's gotten them into trouble.<br />
<br />
I don't think you're finding anyone here apologizing to terrorists (that some sort of neo-con, knee-jerk reaction?).  Terrorists suck and should be punished - period.  However, what you're finding, on an increasing level every day, is a US population that is appalled to find out we are holding captives in gitmo (now entering their third year) that have been through no form of due process to determine their actual status.  The resut is the terrorists live a (completely undeserved) comfortable life where they get to bitch if someone sprinkles water on their favorite reading material and the non-terrorists are held captive, in close proximity to terrorists, for reasons they can't begin to comprehend.<br />
<br />
To date, the administration has done little to correct the situation.  Instead you get &quot;yes-man&quot; senators publicly declaring how well the captives are treated, how they eat good food, have air conditioning, but they say nothing about the real human rights violation: Some people being held captive for no known reason, with no due process for them to appeal their situation.  This situation is unconscionable for a country that claims to be the world's greatest democracy.</div></div><hr />

That is one of the best posts I have ever read on this board.<br />
<br />
The saddest part of this whole mess is that we did not have to be here wondering who or who is not a terrorist at Gitmo.  DoD &quot;Bucket O'Clowns&quot; were advised at the BEGINNING of the Afghanistan war to do the status hearings in country immediately.  They would get their (albeit very minimal) due process and satisfy the world community.  They did not want to do it.  As we say - JAGs only advise, we don't make the decision.  Soooo how many court (to include Supreme Court) rulings have slapped us around? How are we viewed in the international community over this?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Here is another interesting article on a similar topic:<br />
<br />
Report: Witnesses Were Held Illegally; Many Jailed After 9/11 Never Testified; [FINAL Edition]<br />
Dan Eggen. The Washington Post. Washington, D.C.: Jun 27, 2005. pg. A.03<br />
<br />
 The federal government held 70 men as potential grand jury witnesses in terrorism investigations after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but nearly half were never called to testify, according to a new study by two advocacy groups.<br />
<br />
The report, released yesterday by Human Rights Watch and the American Civil Liberties Union, concluded that the government's use of &quot;material witness&quot; warrants in the months after the attacks was excessive and frequently unlawful because many of the detainees were never questioned by a grand jury or were denied access to attorneys for extended periods of time. Most were never charged with a crime.<br />
<br />
The report also said the witnesses &quot;were typically arrested at gunpoint, held round the clock in solitary confinement and subjected to the harsh and degrading . . . conditions&quot; usually reserved for more dangerous criminal suspects. It also said the Justice Department used the special warrants primarily &quot;to buy time to conduct fishing expeditions.&quot;<br />
<br />
The study focuses on the government's aggressive use of a little- known 1984 statute that governs material witnesses, who may be arrested if they have information important to a criminal investigation and are deemed likely to flee. Such arrest warrants must be approved by a judge, but the threshold for an arrest is lower than it is for criminal suspects, and the rules surrounding such cases are murky.<br />
<br />
The Justice Department declined to say whether the study's tally of 70 material witnesses in terrorism investigations was accurate. A Washington Post survey in November 2002 identified at least 44 such cases.<br />
<br />
The 101-page study is the latest in a series of reports by advocacy groups and media organizations raising questions about many of the hundreds of people detained by the Justice Department or other law enforcement agencies after the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. Many detainees were held in secret, and only a few dozen ever faced terrorism-related charges.<br />
<br />
Anjana Malhotra, author of the new study, said the report shows that the Justice Department misused the law in its zeal to pursue alleged terrorism suspects and frequently ensnared innocent immigrants in the process. All but one of the 70 detainees were Muslim men, the review found.<br />
<br />
&quot;The major finding is that the Justice Department was indeed misusing the material witness law to arrest people it viewed as suspicious but didn't have enough evidence to arrest under normal charges,&quot; Malhotra said. &quot;The government was able to use little threads of evidence and convince judges that witnesses had connections to terrorism and needed to be jailed in secret. . . . It was like being thrown into a hole.&quot;<br />
<br />
Justice Department officials have consistently defended their use of the material witness statute in terrorism investigations and have generally denied reports of abuse. Officials also say the power has been used successfully in many other types of investigations.<br />
<br />
&quot;Critics of law enforcement fail to recognize that material witness statutes are designed with judicial oversight safeguards and are critical to aiding criminal investigations ranging from organized crime rackets to human trafficking,&quot; said Justice Department spokesman Kevin Madden.<br />
<br />
The report found that more than a third of the detainees were held for more than two months and that one was held for more than a year. Sixty-four of those arrested were of Middle Eastern or South Asian descent and 17 were U.S. citizens, according to the report.<br />
<br />
The study identified 13 cases in which the Justice Department formally apologized to those arrested, including eight Egyptian men in Evansville, Ind., who were detained as the result of a bogus tip. Many of those detained are still haunted by the experience and often remain under suspicion because of the arrests, the report said.<br />
<br />
&quot;They treated us like professional terrorists,&quot; one of the men, Tarek Omar, said in an interview for the study. &quot;They put us in big cars and had big guns -- as if they were going to shoot people, as if we were Osama bin Laden. . . . I never knew how long we would stay in jail. It felt like we would stay forever.&quot; <br />
<br />
There have been a number of studies that indicate that often, criminals actually learn new crime-committing skills while in prison.  Younger criminals in areas with high rates of recidivism tend to end up back in prison, but for more serious crimes than the first time.  Often, they commit those crimes with people they met through their time in prison.<br />
<br />
Could we be subsidizing the creation of terrorists when we do things like this?</div></div><hr />

Followed by a slightly intelligent reply by you?  Perhaps you'd care to actually put something in a post other than fluff?

I don't know if I want to go to the extreme with regards to &quot;full-citizen&quot; due process, but there should be some end-game explained as to when some of the prisoners might be released.</div></div><hr />

The idiots do not bow to love and hugs, they only respect fear, so give them some. Crunchies here would suck their balls and give them a big fat kiss and hug and send em back to fight, like Krup would, that is disgusting.<br />

Perhaps you'd care to actually put something in a post other than fluff?  Are you disputing that most of the incarcerated people in Gitmo are terrorists and/or Taliban?  What exactly do you have, other than trying that sissy-crap of comparing my thoughts to Carl Rove.  I better watch out, you might get really mad and start comparing me to Rush Limbaugh rather than present any content.<br />

Your post was offensive garbage riddled with lies and wasn't worth much effort.<br />
<br />
I've shown I can exert effort offering detailed responses to people.  You aren't showing that you are worth that.</div></div><hr />

Please explain, in detail, exactly how a terrorist can be clearly identified as such without some sort of trial mechanism?</div></div><hr />

Ok Scooter, not that easy.  That does not make them terrorists, nor does it necessarily take them out of the GPW.  It may be a factor.  They could have been wearing arm bands, but no uniforms, could have been wearing turbans of a certain color, etc.  Uniform does not mean what you think it does.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now to take you logic and apply it to our troops, our SF bubbas that 'Go native&quot; are also terrorists I guess?  All the security contractors we hire (aka mercenaries) are also terrorists?<br />
<br />
Thinking - it is not just for figuring out where the beer is.<br />
<br />
Signed up yet or at least looked into it Mill? <br />

So only the people that are witnessed fighting by US troops are terrorists?  What about the guys that are turned over by Iraqi/Pakistani/Afghani security forces?  Or the guys turned over by local warlords?</div></div><hr />

Cmon now, you can do better.  Explain all of the nasy lies I'm telling.  This should be fun!</div></div><hr />

**** you.<br />

I suppose you would prefer they were back in Afghanistan attacking our troops, since that would mean only AMERICANS were being tortured and killed, right?<br />
<br />
Ditto above.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Nice try Mill.  I guess your ability to discern sarcasm is a tad less than many on this board expect (of the average 30-something living in someone else's apartment).  Also ironic of you to post this given your already well-earned reputation for racist comments. I guess you're using that tried-and-true, elementary school technique of &quot;if-I-attack-them-on-this-they-might-forget-how-guilty-I-am.&quot;  Did this really work for you back in the fourth grade?  Do you think it does now?</div></div><hr />

All this proves is that whether or not a man is a Taliban member when he goes to Guantanimo he may well be one afterwards.</div></div><hr />
