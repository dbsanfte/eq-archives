<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The wind blew cold across the plains of the Overthere.  Tumbleweeds ran wildly before the gusts, as rhinos and cockatrices took shelter behing outcroppings and in hollows.  The dreaded tigers stayed warm in their lairs, while the sarnak patrols stayed close to their fortifications.<br />
<br />
But two figures braved the biting winds and showers that accompanied them.  One was a tall figure the marched steadily forward, the other was a smaller, furtive figure that looked for all the world as if he was searching for shadows to hide in.<br />
<br />
Abash stopped a second and brushed her dark hair from her eyes. &quot;We're almost there, I hope?&quot; She looked to her shorter companion, who was barely visible beneath his hood.<br />
<br />
Truant took his  bearings and pointed at a hill in the distance. &quot;Yes, we grow close to the Temple of Charasis, that the locals call the Howling Stones.  Are you sure you still want to do this?&quot; <br />
<br />
Abash reached out and squeezed Truant's hand.  &quot;Aye.  I want you to be able to come amongst my people and for them to know you as I do. Let's go: the Wise Ones can be patient when they choose, but are not always so.&quot; <br />
<br />
Abash started off until Truant's voice called, &quot; As you say, My Northern Flower, but this is the way, over here...&quot; Abash's face turned a slightly pink shade, but it must have been the wind.<br />
<br />
They continued their journey for several more hours, when a figure slowly rose out of the distance. As they drew closer, the figure was seen to be a northern warrior, standing guard over a small camp.  Around the fire in the camp, were several others.  The warrior strode out to meet them as they drew closer.<br />
<br />
He was silent for a short time, his visage grim as he beheld the pair.  &quot;So it's true Abash? Ye travel with one o' Them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;His name is Truant and he's not one o' Them, as ye put it, Wulfran. He is a loyal companion and true heart. Can ye say th' same o' all ye have travelled wi'?&quot; Abash's eyes flashed angrily and her hands tensed near her weapons.<br />
<br />
Wulfran was silent a long minute, then he spat in the dirt at Truant's feet. &quot;Nay, not all my companions hae been as true as one would like, but that be none o' your affair. Come. The Wise Ones await ye: I'd na hae them waste o'ermuch time on this. No more than they need.&quot; Without waiting a response he turned and marched over to the fire where two other stern faced barbarians waited.<br />
<br />
The shaman, Blumgan, rose and calmly spoke.  &quot;Well met, Cousin.  What would ye have of us, that ye hae sought this audience?&quot; Blumgan's gaze took in the pair of travellers.  Abash stood proud and defiant, yet nervous. Truant looked as if the by-play of the northerners didn't affect or concern him, but he was watching them for signs of hostile actions. <br />
<br />
A wolf stood and walked from the fire over to Truant. It sniffed the air by him and gave a low, menacing growl. Blumgan made a small gesture with his hand, and the wolf backed away from the dark elf and lay down by the fire again, its gaze never leaving him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would seek to have ye admit Truant into th' Clan, so that we may wed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wulfran  looked taken by surprise and snarled, &quot;Thats <br />
out o' th'ques-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Silence, Wulf!&quot; The shaman Vhela, rose from the fire and held up her hand to the warrior. Wulfran's lips moved into a snarl of malice, but he kept from uttering a sound. &quot;Ye seek that which has not been done, Sister.  This one's kin, Truant his name? His kin have ancient blood feuds with ours. Wulfran is nay th' only one who'll object to having a Dark One, within the protection of the Clan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blumgan spoke up &quot;Many are th' Wolves o' th' North who have met th' dark elves in battle.  Many are th' ones who remember them as treacherous and dishonorable foes. Th' Dark Ones worship their god, Innoruuk, th' Lord of Hate, and not th' Tribunal and Justice.  Long has been th' enmity betwixt these forces.  Our kin know this.They'll nay be pleased with your choice, Little Sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;but it is MY choice to make! It is MY heart that has been convinced, and nay other can gainsay that!&quot;<br />
<br />
Vhela again held a hand for silence, this time to Abash. &quot;What say you, Truant o' th' Teir'dal? What say you t' th' fact that your kind and ours hae warred for centuries? How will ye respond an' a raiding party of your kin attacks our village? Where will your loyalties lay then?&quot;<br />
<br />
Truant knelt before the shamen. &quot; My heart and loyalties are Abash's to command. Whatever she wills, I will do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blumgan spoke again. &quot; Then we shall test this loyalty.  An' ye wish t' be admitted into th' Clan, ye must bring us proof o' yer intentions. Blood begets blood. Bring me th' blood o' our enemies. Though some o' th' dwarven kind be fast friends t' our people, there is a new order amongst them, an Order o' Purple Preists, who preach that they are superior t' us, and that we are t' be hunted for their sport. Bring me th' blood of such as these, t' proove your worth.&quot;<br />
<br />
Truant bowed before Blumgan and replied &quot;It shall be as you wish, Wise One.&quot; As he rose, Vhela spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is not all that will be required.  I too, will require proof of your loyalty.  To prove you are a member of our Clan and no longer Tier'dal, you must bring me proof that you have turned your back on them.  Bring me the proof of 6 slain tier dal and you shall be admitted.&quot;<br />
<br />
A malicious triumph gleamed in Wulfran's eyes as Vhela pronounced her judgement. His hands moved his weapons in anticipation of the impending refusal by Truant.<br />
<br />
Again though, Truant bowed and replied &quot; As you wish, Wise One.&quot; As Truant rose, Abash cried out,<br />
<br />
&quot;No! This canna be! Ye'll make him a Kinslayer! An outlaw wi' his people!&quot;<br />
<br />
Wulfran answered with a smirk. &quot; Ah, but we will be his people now, Sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abash, raised her hand to strike Wulfran, but Truant caught her hand. &quot;Its ok Abash.  I will be among your kin, by the Wise Ones' own words. If they can bring forth honest and trusting people like you, I will be proud to forsake Neriak and all she holds dear.&quot;  With a wary nod to Wulfran he turned and walked out of the camp. Abash spared Wulfran a final glare and set off after her companion.<br />
<br />
Vhela turned with a cool glance to Wulfran. &quot;That was ill done, Love.  We've set them a harsh test t' prove him. An' he is sincere, he'll bring her great joy.  An' he's not, ye've just added t' her heartache.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But nothing.  He is for th' Tribunal t' judge, not ye. An' he completes his task, he will become Kin, in name at th' least. Ye'll need to respect that.&quot;<br />
<br />
* Author's note: this again has lots of artistic liberties taken with it, but it is the general details of the Quest Truant was given to become an honorary barbarian, prior to his marrying Abash.  Truant and Abash will have to add their details of the quest itself :)*</div></div><hr />

<br />
Poor Abash always a bridesmaid never a bride I am afraid.<br />
<br />
*snicker* I always knew Barbarians to be cowardly and treacherous but to hide behind one of your sworn enemies to attempt something your ilk could never dream of well ...<br />
<br />
