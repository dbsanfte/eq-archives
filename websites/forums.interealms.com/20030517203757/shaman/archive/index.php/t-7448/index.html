<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Selkie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">(Apologies if this topic has been beaten to death, I'm still sorta new here. :))<br />
<br />
When I started my shaman (now level 25), I loaded up on focus items I thought would be useful for a shaman.  It's fun to light up like a Christmas tree whenever I cast a spell, but I'm starting to want more AC/HP and would like to swap out the focus items to swap for sturdier gear.  I mostly solo.<br />
<br />
So of this list, what are must-haves for a young solo shaman, and which should I ditch?  Are there any important ones I've overlooked?<br />
<br />
Focus items (all level II)<br />
- Spell haste.<br />
- Extended range.<br />
- Mana preservation<br />
- Extended affliction.<br />
- Improved healing. (I have a Book of Obulus for grouping, but use a shield when soloing.)<br />
- Extended enhancement<br />
- Affliction efficiency<br />
<br />
Thanks for any input. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wow. I never had more than 4 different items at a time.<br />
<br />
My own personal favourites:<br />
<br />
Extended Affliction - that extra 20% time on dots means life or death. EA III and pox.... oh, I feel faint. :) It also makes slow last longer, woooooo.... <br />
<br />
Extended Enhancement - again, extra 20% time on buffs. EE III is great - focus lasts 2 hours, sta lasts an hour and twenty, replenishment and celerity last longer, it's a keeper. More time between buffs is more mana, basically. I know some people prefer to put things on and off, but I'm a buff-as-we-go shaman, and if I had to stop, put thing in bag, cast replenishment, put thing back in bag every 20 minutes, I'd go crazy. &quot;want acumen? wait, I'm putting my necklace on&quot;.<br />
<br />
I think mana preservation is the next most useful one, and if I had to only pick 3, those would be the ones I'd pick. It's kind of an all-around nice focus effect.<br />
<br />
The others, well:<br />
<br />
Spell haste - nice, but really, unless you're casting focus, and I'm not sure it works on focus, the spell times aren't that long. I'm more worried about running out of mana than I am about not getting spells in first.<br />
<br />
ER - nice, but we don't kite. We tend to root/rot or tank, so while ER makes for nicer pulls in some tight situations (katta, splitting the guards), that's kind of rare. Usually I'm right up against the mob I'm fighting.<br />
<br />
Affliction Efficency - well, it's sort of covered under mana preservation, IIRC. Nice, but I wouldn't sacrifice hp/ac for it.<br />
<br />
Improved Healing - Err, I'm usually healing during a downtime, and I'm never the primary healer if I can wangle it. I'd rather be slowing buffing dotting attacking and patch healing, not primary healing.<br />
<br />
Impressive collection of baubles by the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you find that you are getting interrupted a lot spell haste can be a godsend.  I still have the boots but since my channeling went to 200 i haven't taken them out of the bank.<br />
<br />
Affliction Efficiency will save more mana per cast than Mana Preservation on DoTs and will really help a low level shaman to solo.  Dump it once you have enough HP to canni effectively.<br />
<br />
Other than those two point I pretty much agree with Harvyst,   I wear a EE3 item and i still wear a chipped bone bracer only because i haven't found a suitable replacement for it yet (Could someone please lend me a JBB.  I'll give it back.  Really, I will)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The effects I would be most likely to drop would be spell haste and extended range for grouping at your level. <br />
<br />
Theyre both nice effects for raiding, I think you can live happily without them for now tho.<br />
<br />
Drop improved healing if youre not spending much time healing, swop back in if you are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My order:<br />
Spell haste<br />
Affliction haste<br />
Turgurs ~2.5 sec cast. Malo ~3.8 sec cast. etc.<br />
<br />
Affliction efficiency <br />
Mana preservation <br />
Turgurs 250 mana --&gt; ~187.5 mana. Malo 350 mana --&gt; ~262.5 mana<br />
<br />
Extended affliction.<br />
Turgurs 6 mins --&gt; 8 mins. Bane of Nife 1 extra tick.<br />
<br />
Improved healing<br />
Need the new 1k heal (and focus 4) for this to be useful.<br />
<br />
Extended enhancement<br />
Regen 18 mins --&gt; ~20 mins.<br />
Focus 1hr 40 --&gt; ~2hrs.<br />
<br />
I prefer focus items over better stat items in many cases. Eg: Gem encrusted ring over other hp rings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Extended Enhancement<br />
Extended Affliction<br />
Mana Preservation<br />
<br />
That's all we need :) Amulet of Insight + Coldain Military Bracer + Obulous Death Shroud = Happy Shaman.<br />
<br />
Now I just need 20k and a MQ Kael faction dummy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Remember that the poster is level 25, whats useful to a level 60 isnt necessarily going to be useful to someone who probably isnt even wasting the mana on debuffing mobs yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Could anyone give me a rough idea on the price for that amulet of insight? sounds well worth getting my hands on one :) Still hoping to get an obulus death shroud to drop in seb, and the bracer I got a while ago, wish I'd done it even sooner :) Definitely recommend extended affliction. Even if you never solo and don't DoT much, its nice for extending duration on slows and roots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Guys, remember the original poster's level was....  NM Seredith beat me to it :)<br />
<br />
At your level, I would go for mana preservation, extend enhancement and *possibly* spell haste.   How is Improved Healing working for you?   I've never used it so I don't know if that's worth the ability.<br />
<br />
So Haste &amp; IH would be the two I'd be iffy on, the other 2 I would say are a sure thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Selkie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ooh, so the affliction items work on roots and slows, as well as dots?  That's good to know.  I always forget which item does what, and half of them are glowing on any given cast. :p<br />
<br />
This is all very helpful advice.  I'll definitely keep the affliction-related items.  I think I will get rid of the haste and range, and just plan my casts better. I wish I could get rid of extended enhancement, but it helps for keeping regen up.<br />
<br />
I do like the improved healing when I'm duoing with my boyfriend's monk, as I don't tend to get hit when playing with him and healing for extra is nice. My boyfriend did tell me how much more it heals for, but I forgot. Casters Realm says 20%, that seems about right.<br />
<br />
Thanks all. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yep, roots, slows and dots for EA. That extra two minutes on a long boss fight are crucial, at times.<br />
<br />
Although since I got my Coldain Military Wristguard, I haven't seen Tugur's wear off during a grind/soloing session, ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Amulet of insight sells for 4k on Rodcet Nife. Since it drops off a dwarf, and I'm on dragon/dwarf faction, I forked over the cash for it.<br />
<br />
Well worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Originally posted by Goldark <br />
Could anyone give me a rough idea on the price for that amulet of insight? sounds well worth getting my hands on one :) <br />
<br />
Hiya Goldy :) You are Goldark Stormwind right?<br />
<br />
I bought my Amulet of Insight for 5K on AB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cosik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The focus effects I found to be the most useful soloing where the extended affliction and affliction efficency. <br />
<br />
 the extended since if your root doting your saving mana by it lasting longer and the effic. will let your mana stay fuller and med less and let you pull more.<br />
<br />
Right now the items I am looking to get are a Coldain military wristguard so I can drop the kobold hide boots. A Amulet of insight to swap in with my Ivory imbued at the moment I use a Batfang headband I got for 100 pp in the bazaar to swap in before buffing(I use Vert's custom UI so I can swap the neck items very easily and quickly).  I would also like  to get  Obu shroud but its a bit out of my price range. <br />
<br />
Another item is a PoP item called Sharp Claw Ahlspiess which I haven't seen mentioned here that has affliction efficiency IV on it that I would love to have for soloing as its 25% on affliction spells versus the 10% on all spells for the shroud.  It would be even better to get both.<br />
<br />
Thats about all I am looking for at the moment just keeping my Affliction Efficiency, Extended Affliction and Enhancement going with the chance at a Mana Pres. item if I could get one.<br />
<br />
I also wouldn't mind getting a affliction haste item since its 33% increase over the spell haste which is only 15% since all the spells I cast that I matter how quickly they would cast(dots,slows,root) are covered by the affliction haste. <br />
<br />
Well I think I have rambled on enough now. =)  Hope ya get something from it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Oh! That's useful to know.<br />
<br />
I am working on the Circlet of the Falinkan, the CoV headdress that is AC 12 dex/wis/int/sv fire/sv cold/svmagic 5, hp 50 mana 75 str 7. <br />
<br />
Amongst it's qualities is affliction haste III. <br />
<br />
I want to get it as a replacement for my totemic (AC 12/5 wis) which I've kept forever and a day... 50 hp is nice. AH III making slow and root cast 33% faster is just icing on the cake.<br />
<br />
Plus it has no graphic, which I like.<br />
<br />
Now if I can only get Vilefang and the Taskmaster, I'll be set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Got a link for this: Sharp Claw Ahlspiess ? Slot, drop etc?<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />

These items coupled together has made some of the things i enjoy doing a lot easier and more productive. I wont go in to detail on what or who i like solo-ing but I can tell you that saving 20% mana on all debuffs and dots coupled with extending my dots by 20% has made these items some of my most prized possesions.</div></div><hr />
