And rangers now too.  Since ranger was implemented to the halfling race it seems that every up and coming ranger I see is of the furry-foot variety.  Probably because they have the best starting stats for any ranger and they have a 5% exp bonus.<br />

Thats because humans have ****ty stats, period.  And the Iksar AC bonus is nothing to write home about.  I remember parsings from a few years ago..was it an extra 35AC at level 60?  Wow.  <br />
<br />
Now, Vah Shir also have better stats than humans...why dont they have a penalty again?  And as far as cultural armors...big freaking deal.  They do have some nice armor quests that they can do, and the Bazaar is for everyone.  <br />

If you mean just the Exp penalties and bonuses then I don't agree.  If you mean all racial bonuses then I am positive many others will disagree.  <br />

I picked a barb not cause of looks, but because I was new to the game, and I didn't want to have to run around for a year worried about what could and would attack me.  Now, personally when I pick a class to mess around with, I pick it cause of the features of the race/class that I like, not cause I'm afraid that I might get stomped by someone that doesn't like what I look like.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'm sorry but the racial penalties for Troll/Iksar are crazy and outdated... I'm amazed they are still in the game.<br />
<br />
People used to talk about troll/ikky regen like it was big stuff (&quot;with regeneration spell and troll regen I get endless mana dancing with Canni 1, PWNED!&quot;) , but with fungi (Yes, I still wear fungi, swap it out with my BP for haste even, lol... too attached to it), upgraded replenishment, AA's, and a few assorted other items, I'm constantly around 80/tick hp regen.  Now, if I was a Troll, as opposed to the barbarian that I am, I'd have 81/tick regen in exchange for a 20 percent experience penalty (as opposed to my 5 percent).  Whoop de friggin doo... I'm not counting Infravision here, since I have plainsight.<br />
<br />
The only race that i could see warranting a slight penalty are Ogres with stun immunity.  I find it funny that Ogres have LESS of a penalty than trolls.  These exp penalty things are SO outdated and should really have been removed when they removed the class exp penalties awhile back.  Oh well...<br />
<br />
Granted Trolls have the snare necklace, but that doesn't factor in because the necklace was put in AFTER the penalty, and is Deity based as opposed to racially based.<br />
<br />
Now would be a PERFECT time for them to remove it, with the impending grind session from 65 to 70 on the horizon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Slimbritches I couldn't agree with you more.  And yes I am a Lizard Shaman who is 100% certain that I have paid for the exp penalty over and over and over already.  Its not about the extra regen and ac at level 65 (or 70), its about whether the overall benefit of having those advantages during your lifetime of playing has already been paid for by increased time leveling.  Leveling wasn't always so easy if you can remember that far back.<br />
<br />
But really, trying to look objectively at who is getting screwed the most with outdated experience penalties in the &quot;NEW EQ&quot; where regen isn't going to do squat on quadding 1100's it is Troll Warriors and SK's followed closely by Lizard Monks.<br />
<br />

PS: I have posted on this topic before on the Crucible board asking for a Sony comment without success.  I have posted on Sony's forums asking for a Sony comment without success.  I sent Brenlo a nice personal e-mail asking for a Sony comment without any reply.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At 65, the difference in natural regeneration (standing) is 11 HP/tick, which, admittedly, isn't that big a deal when all Shamans at that level are regenerating at least 50 HP/tick with Replenishment and Regen3.<br />
<br />
However, the XP penalty doesn't apply to AAs, so the comparison shouldn't be made at that level but rather at the lower levels where extra regeneration and things like infravision are actually noticeable.<br />
<br />
Now, the 65-70 stretch may be a different story depending on how much grinding is required, but I suspect that the limiting factor will be spell availability and not XP.</div></div><hr />

Warriors have a bonus. <br />
SK's also use to have a class penalty (and at one time it extended to any group they were with too)<br />

<br />
Having racial penalities between 65-70 is so stupid that its almost not worth the time to make the argument.  As I have mentioned in the past, if Sony drops the ball on this one I am going to be massively pissed.  It's one thing to screw up class balance a little bit, but to ignore what the game has turned into and not even re-assess racial penalities is unforgivable and hugely unfair to the peeps who rolled a character 5 years ago in the level 50 max world.<br />

<br />
You're sure about this?  It was my understanding that natural HP regen standing only went up a point or so every so often after 40 and capped for us at like 5 or 6.  You're saying trolls regen 16 or 17?  If that is in fact true, then I'd have to rethink my original post.  11 HP/Tick is substantial.  Still, definitely not worth the trouble that a unnecessarily large 20 percent exp penalty causes.<br />
<br />
P.S. I 'd also like to point out how on other threads of this topic, Trolls/Iksar complain that since they put in the new sitting regen changes, their regen is &quot;nerfed.&quot; <br />
<br />
To be honest, I NEVER sit.  I'm either mounted or in bear form, and to sit draws extra aggro and gives me no benefit.  I am much better off chaining canni IV while standing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Throm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Personally, I think the biggest reason race xp penalties is outdated is due to group xp changes.  Soloing doesn't quite hold the xp advantage as it once did, so more people prefer grouping where these race &quot;advantages&quot; do not really mean anything.<br />
<br />
Then again, this is the game that, on release, penalized everyone in the group for someone's xp penalty just so everyone could level at the same rate within the group.  I also think they admitted they screwed up in the beginning when they gave the xp bonus to halflings as it was supposed to go to the blind humans with average stats.<br />

<br />
One easy way to find out would be to check the Magelo profiles of different 65 Shamans. Mine says 21 points/tick standing (I have Regen3), which matches my observations as well as other sources, e.g. the Human/Iksar comparison table at http://jumpspot.net/eq/monks_by_level.html . Lizards and Trolls have the same regeneration, so that part of the chart applies.<br />
<br />
As for 11 HP/tick being subsatntial, well... it's nice and all, but I rarely have to heal myself when using Canni4 even now and if Replenishment 2.0 in OoW is 60 HP/tick as listed by Lucy, it will make natural regeneration even less important as a pecentage of total regeneration/tick.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I think that the Snare necklace is worth the 20% penalty. I had about 25 days /played when my Shaman hit level 65 (5th character = easier leveling), so in my case it was tantamount to a 125 hour camp. When you combine it with infravision, regeneration, higher STA and, heck, even slam, I think it was time well spent, even though the resulting snare is decidedly on the ghetto side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Racial exp penalties do apply to AA - But only if you split your exp between AA and leveling.<br />
<br />
Apparently the code checks to apply the penalty if any level experience is gained, then it reduces it, and then it's split between the two - Resulting in less exp total than if you were going 100% in either way</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't include Sk's at the top of the &quot;screwed&quot; list because they can sort of fear kite when leveling up if they so choose.  And Troll/Iksar, its all the same pretty much.<br />
<br />
Regardless, my initial post was about the inequity of continuing racial experience penalities from 65-70.  They should have been fazed out after 60 IMHO but definitely now since regen has been trivialized due to harder hitting mobs and the improved regen spell.<br />
