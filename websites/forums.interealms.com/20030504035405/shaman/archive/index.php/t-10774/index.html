<br />
I have fizzle 4 time in the row on blast of venon(lvl54 poison nuke) , after 2 fizzle on half attemp. 3 time in the row on torrent of poison !<br />
<br />
It's not my skill .I'm lvl60 ,max evoc , SCM2. This must be these spell.<br />
<br />
61+ poison nuke fizzle less or it's also terrible?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Blast of Venom uses the conjuration skill. My conjuration has been maxxed for a while, since I've soloed a lot (DoT's are muh friend). Anyways, since conjuration is maxxed, I hardly ever fizzle Blast of Venom. I was 59 or 60 when I got it, so I don't know if that matters. I will say, my evocation is low, so torrent of poison is a fizzle-fest for me. ;) I've lost almost 50percent of my mana trying to cast torrent before. /sigh I gotta work on my evoc skill someday. I don't know your skill levels in each of these areas, evoc or conj, but if you're not maxxed, then you're gonna get more fizzles for higher level spells. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Blast Of Venom will fizzle more than other spells.  It is designed that way (you may wish to check lucy.fnord.net to see why).  There is an attribute for each spell called a &quot;fizzle adjustment&quot;.  The higher the number, the more likely you are to fizzle.  The spell Blast Of Venom has a fizzle adjustment of 25, and the spell Spear Of Torment has a fizzle adjustment of 10.  The spell Torrent Of Poison (our AE) has a fizzle adjust more in the middle -- 15.<br />
<br />
What does all that mean?  It means max your skill in the class affected, and then keep on leveling.  Your level has alot to do with fizzle rates.  <br />
<br />
Why is it designed that way?  I have no idea.  Perhaps to put shaman in their place -- we are not really supposed to be wizards, after all.  Sunstrike (a wizard spell) has no fizzle adjustment at all.  I guess that makes sense.  I would expect a wizard to fizzle less on nukes.</div></div><hr />
