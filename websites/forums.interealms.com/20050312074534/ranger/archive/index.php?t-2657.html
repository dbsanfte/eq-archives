<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seprentor Nevermore</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So there I am, in East Commons, when friend x messages me and asks, &quot;Have you seen the new bugs with archery?&quot;<br />
<br />
I tell him no, I havn't, and ask what he's talking about. Then he informs me if you target a mob, and walk all the way across the zone, that you can still hit it with your bow. No limits to range. Wow. Then he says, if your target is too far above/below you, your delay on the bow you're using is 0. Double Wow!!!<br />
<br />
So, I message another friend of mine, who happens to be in the same zone, and ask if he's willing to duel me for a sec so I can find out. He says sure, no problem.  He's a 53 warrior, by the way.<br />
<br />
I go on and summon a quiver full of arrows, and climb up the wall a little bit. For kicks, I use /disc trueshot.  I was out of arrows and he was at less than half health in less than 30 seconds. I couldn't believe my eyes. I then left him in the target screen, and ran to the wc zone. Bare in mind, he's near the tunnel. I then summoned a few more arrows and fired away. Get this:  My bow shot did double damage from all the way across the zone.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm not the type to abuse bugs, and I insist that this was the only use I took of these little factoids from my friend. In fact, I'm sure the servers will be down any minute to fix it, but I had to  post it here, because if nothing else, it's fun to duel your friends with )</div></div><hr />

Im sure it will be fixed very soon.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyrthor</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 11:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I ran across this in the grey.  Once I figured out what was going on I tested it and did 600+DPS to a mob on a pull, all from areas where I should not have been able to hit it.<br />
<br />
After doing this,  I sat down like a good little ranger and filled out a bug report.  While fun for a minute, that flaw is &lt;b&gt;TOO&lt;/b&gt; sick to live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea , ill admit i abused it a touch, but hey, if it was a extreamly big problem they would have taken the servers down as soon as they found out about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gotta love taking out a wyvern in CS in about 45 secs....thou the downtime for summoning arrows was way long (12.5 min to summon enough arrows to take out 3 wyverns in about 2-3 min makes for a long time)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This almost makes me forgive VI for their WP nerf.<br />
<br />
Most fun I've had in a long, long time though...it looked like a steady stream of arrows leaving my bow, was hella fun.<br />
<br />
And yes, I got xp on the kill :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kruull</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 06:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I logged in and played with this a bit... This seems like the perfect tool for VI to use to fix archery.. put it on an internal test server and see why we cannot hit mobs on hills or in walls.. I was using it in ME and other zones known for hilly terrain and my hit % was less than 10%, with the other arrows just *poofing* no hit/miss error nothing :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lasalle Stormreaver</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 06:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was pretty fun even though I only found out about it like 2 minutes before the servers came down just now, but maybe some people boosted their fletching and archery skills in the process.  I amazed every single person near the DL spire I think =)    <br />
<br />
Given this though, I'm thinking-- wouldn't it be cool to have a spell-haste for archery-- a quest spell.  Mind you I don't think it would be fair for other classes to allow us to go rapid-fire machine-gun style... but what if it were to cut the delay of our bow down by 35% or so...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">farmatyr</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 06:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey bandaur, you think you could find a section of your log showing over 1000dps? Would be nice to post over the safehouse to piss them off.<br />
<br />
I abused it a little. No tolan's though. Klok whatever in dreadlands was doing good business in arrows. So many arrows getting eaten though that it was like, I could run to merchant, fill up all my bags, make two mobs melt, then go stock up again. Don't think I was making exp any faster than meleeing, but I did get archery from 212 to 216.</div></div><hr />

Meaning was this an all out bug, or was it a change to archery coding that just went horribly wrong...anyone wanna hazzard a guess?</div></div><hr />

Definetly helped me blow off some steam about the wp/cop issue hehe</div></div><hr />

Pally i was grouped with was swearing a lot because of the range i was hitting stuff at. Thought it was a bit odd but did not realy notice the diference untill i tagged a tro jeg and stood there plinking away gettigng double damage hits and he did not aggro. Then he walked away and out of line of site and i could still hit him. also the to high to low message would come up and i would still shoot an arrow. To bad they 'fixed' it...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xthorn</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The bug in archery was actually fourfold.<br />
<br />
1) Archery has unlimited range.  This allowed some to kill mobs out of aggro range.  However, upon experimentation, this was not really true for summoning mobs.<br />
<br />
2) You don't have to be facing in the correct direction of the mob.  You could be shooting a mob and connecting hits south of you even though you are facing north.  It would correct your direction to face the mob only if the angle between the direction you faced and the mob was very small.<br />
<br />
3) Player Characters were valid archery targets.  You could shoot arrows at PCs, but not hit them of course.  This allowed you to hit NPCs at point blank, as you could simply target a PC directly behind it.  Alignment wasn't that easy, but it worked nevertheless.<br />
<br />
4) When receiving the target is above/below message, you would fire arrows.  This made it possible to fire arrows as fast as your client refreshed this message.  Many of those arrows would succeed the check in connecting for a hit/miss roll on the NPCs.  The higher damage bows and trueshot disc were the best to use for this &quot;bug&quot;.<br />
<br />
Seems all four of these are fixed with the clean up patch though, and I agree that it helped &quot;blow off some steam&quot; regarding wp/cop and the fact they didn't address stacking issues with WP and BMB and damage shields.</div></div><hr />
