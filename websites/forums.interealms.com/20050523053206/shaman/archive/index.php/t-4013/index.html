<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zamnon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The bazaar was a great upgrade but I can't even use it!  Zoned in yesterday and could hardly even take a step it was so slow and choppy, ended up just gating out (after the 10minutes it took to load the darn spell).  My machine is a 800mghz AMD with 512RAM and a 64mg video card.  I turned the clipping down which did nothing.  I know that plenty of people are experiencing this as my machine is no slouch.  Any suggestions??<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wampaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its not just you bro. Nobody's computer runs smooth in the bazaar. Kind of hard to when there are 400+people in it. I heard turning your clip plane down all the way helps. But its just a matter of the sheer amount of people in the zone. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Face the walls and the floor, this reduces lag greatly for searching in bazaar or trading mode. Only  time you will lag now is when your getting to a trader to buy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xulak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What type of connection do you have?<br />
<br />
I had this problem a week or so ago when my cable modem was screwed up.  Basically it was acting about the same as a 56k, getting about 8kb/s downloads.  I took forever to zone in and when I did I had a 5000 datarate going and took me a few minutes to scribe gate, let alone cast it.  When the cable company fixed the problem and I was back to 80kb/s or so, I went to bazaar and had no lag whatsoever.<br />
<br />
I should also mention I play on a laptop, 1Ghz pIII, 512Mb ram, and 16mb GeForce2 Go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>talos68</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hello!<br />
<br />
Try turning your clip plane down, I've heard this works but have not yet had the time to try it (I share the 'puter with my GF).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Turn off all the new models,  turn clipping plane all the way down,  turn off all /ooc /shout.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually...I have a couple tips that could help ya...<br />
<br />
Not only Clip plane...but,<br />
<br />
1.Cut Sky from Double Layer, to NONE<br />
<br />
2. Shut off both NPC and PC names...<br />
<br />
If you're shopping, just right click on the player's name in the bazaar window, and you'll automatically be facing that person. If needed, you can &quot;reclick&quot; on the NPC names to see which person it is, but I have found NEW FREEDOM with this setup.<br />
<br />
BTW, I have a P2,750m with 457 ram...THIS WORKS!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I too found that i get the most relief from lag by turning off PC names. Before the new UI change someone had suicided in that zone like 70 times leaving a ton of corpses on the EM server. If you think its bad now nothing compared to that. That day i had to /hidecorpses all just to move, imagine if someone did it in there now it would probably instant boot everyone that ran into the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Before i head into the bazaar i turn PC and NPC names off, turn off NPC spells, socials, and turn clipping plain all the way off. I always have spell effects off. I think the 2 bigest things that help are PC names off and Clipping plain lowest. If i need to search for a vendor i do a /shownames 1 so i only get 1st names of pc's and a /serverfilter on seems to help as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zionak Maliseer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I run a P4  1.8 ghz proc and 620 ram.  I have a  Geforce 4 128 mb of ddr ram on it and my lag is still terrible.<br />
<br />
The bazaar is not worth the hard drive space that it takes up.  the only reason why I bought the geforce 4 was so I could use the bazaar features but it is so laggy that its not worth the time wasted.<br />
<br />
Just my thoughts.<br />
<br />
Also,    AMD processes graphics much better for online gaming.  I will never purchase a pentium again in my life.  AMD's are more expensive but its worth it.   I have every tweak done on my pc, it is finely tuned and there is very little difference between it and my   AMD 700 mhz 128 ram pc with 32 Ram vid card.  I have used my friends brand new amd and it blows the p4 straight out of the water.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Pingpang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Try switching to the overhead view when in the Bazaar. Works for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This is what I do. And with only 128 RAM, and a voodoo3, it works just fine. Only lag I get is the occasional thirty-second freeze... but i get that everywhere in luclin. Painful when running through Mons Letalis.<br />
<br />
Anyway...<br />
<br />
1) Set clip plane to at most 15. This allows you to still see, but cuts out most of the background.<br />
<br />
2) Particle Effects, old and new, OFF. There's always some jerk bard in the middle of a pile of merchants singing their food song, and half the time a cleric or enchanter spams the zone with a sanctuary spell (Those peoploe need to be killed)<br />
<br />
3) Either look at the floor, or use the overhead view. Most of the lag in this place comes from the 50 people that think being in the very front of the stalls is going to help them sell more. When the opposite is true - if nobody can get to you, you don't sell squat.<br />
<br />
4) PC names OFF. See above reason. <br />
<br />
6) Sound volume muted. No particular lag thing, but there's usually some guy who got pushed to the edge of a stall and is contunially making a &quot;thumpthumpthump&quot; noise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lyam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">When in the Bazaar, I am either always in Overhead Mode or looking at the Floor.  Clipping Plane is off and it seems to work okay, not great but okay.<br />
<br />
I run a P3 600, 512 MB Ram, GeForce 3 TI200 64 MB, and am connected on 33.6k Modem (ADSL and BB are just far too dear in Australia)</div></div><hr />
