<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You don't say how much cash you have but here are some ideas:<br />
<br />
Iksar ceremonial breastplate (5 regen, ~6k)<br />
JB or Totemic Helm (400pp)<br />
Ivory imbued earrings (if Barbarian) or black sapphire<br />
Elder Wolf Hide (shoulder slot, 1-2k)<br />
You could switch rings, gain 12ac for 20hp, and get velium fire wedding ones. Not sure about that one.<br />
JB boots<br />
new bracers, not sure what. You could sit in KC and ask for jarsath (no drop stuff that rots a lot)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Since you are Vah Shir you might look into the cloaks you get with the Sonic Wolfbane Weapon quest.  The shaman part is fairly easy and the cloaks upgrade.  The Officer's Cloak is something you will likely be wearing into the high 50's.  The quest is not bad if you do it while you still gat XP in Hollowshade Moor.  If you wait it can be tedious farming greens for hours for rare drops.<br />
<br />
At 51 I still wear the Dar Khura Garrison Cloak and don't see any upgrades that seem worth the inflated prices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At 27 you might have trouble with the sonic wolves for the cloak.<br />
<br />
Are you on Rodcet?<br />
<br />
If you are I can hook you up with others doing the quest, and give you a sealant soak. I've got spares.<br />
<br />
Level up 4 levels and do the Totemic Helm quest yourself, save yourself money and have fun doing the quest. It will still cost 160 plat in parts, plus camping the bear in Everfrost, but it's fun. Questing my own Totemic at 27-34 was an experience I'll never forget. Kinda scary, always fun.<br />
<br />
You can't wear imbued  ivory, by the way.<br />
<br />
At 27 I started wearing Totemic pieces, replacing my banded. At 34, I had a complete set of Totemic including the bp. (Took 3 weeks to quest). At 44, I got an Iskar Regen BP, and it's been slowly adding pieces since then. I think Totemic will last you till 34 (except the helm which lasts longer), Jaundiced till high 40's low 50's when you get better through your guild and raids.</div></div><hr />
