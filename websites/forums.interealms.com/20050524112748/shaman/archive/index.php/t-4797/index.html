<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For the last couple of weeks, I've been getting some strange things happening when I zone.<br />
<br />
It's not every time I zone, but sometimes I will go link dead, then get booted  to desktop.  Then I notice my Norton Firewall says someone was trying to access my computer using the BLA Trojan.  Check the ip and it's from VI.<br />
<br />
Anyone have a clue why VI would be trying to access people's computers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I really doubt they are hacking into your computer.<br />
If they were, chances are other people would have found out about it long ago, like those people that maintain showeq etc.<br />
You would have heard about this by now from someone else.<br />
In the past, at least one other gaming company was doing something like this, and that got slammed pretty quick.  It's illegal for them to do what you are saying.<br />
<br />
Try updating your firewall software, or turn it off while you play eq.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Perhaps the EQ server is trying to reinitiate your lost connection ...<br />
<br />
The firewall reporting the access as a trojan is almost certainly a red herring.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the firewall is misinterpreting the data from the EQ server as a trojan, and forcibly disconnecting you, hence the linkdeath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Another thought - I've no idea how Norton Firewall works or how good it is, but I find ZoneAlarm is rather good, and causes no problems for EQ.</div></div><hr />

I agree that it's unlikely VI is trying to access your computer, but don't be fooled into thinking that they can get into trouble with the law for doing it if they did do it.  You initiated a business relationship with them, there's not a court in the world that would convict them of anything for gathering information from your computer.<br />
<br />
There is no right to privacy under US law.  Unfortunately.  The laws that do protect us are a hodgepodge of special cases, none of which acknowledge any fundamental right to control data about yourself or to control how data is gathered from or about you once you enter a business relationship with someone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I used to use norton firewall, but it gave me no end of problems. So like Grippa I changed to zone alarm pro. It's really good and all my problems have stopped.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I crash to desktop on zone lots of times, and I don't run EQW.<br />
<br />
Seems to happen more often in Luclin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There's a known bug that causes some people to crash when entering certain zones - Shadowhaven is the one that seems to get me very often.<br />
<br />
This is damn annoying when I have all my tradeskill mules parked in SH - grrr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There's also a problem with Norton AV; there are a couple of things sent by the patch and the program that can tickle it just right and make it sneeze.  I keep it disabled and just run it weekly for maintenance.  I have the same Zone-to-Oblivion problem in Shadowhaven and some other zones.  Equally prevalent on all my PCs.</div></div><hr />

Show me where in the EULA it says they can access my computer other than for gameplay purposes only, and then I'll stand for that.<br />
<br />
However, I'm 99% sure that there is nothing that allows them to access my computer legally. This would be completely illegal, and would be covered under anti-hacking law. Gaining access to a remote computer system that you don't own is a federal offense and VERY illegal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lumor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Since were on the topic of Odd things.<br />
<br />
Anyone know why lately everytime I try to connect to EQ after the patcher runs and before the screen displays the EULA, EQ just freezes.  It has been happening more and more lately to me and I keep haveing to restart my computer to get it to work.  I tried running a thorough scan and it didnt find anyting out of the ordinary.  <br />
<br />
I dunno what else to do cept for restarting my computer and interent connection repetitively until I can get in.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Norton is a problem.  In my mind, that friggen program is WORSE than any virus!  I uninstalled it a long time ago and just don't open forwards from people anymore.  I miss out on some inane jokes and stupid pictures sure, but I don't have to deal with that STUPID NORTON program!  Gah!  I hate it so much k thanks.  <br />
<br />
Norton makes your system run like ****, causes jock itch, and has been known to make small programs spontaneously burst into flames!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kieran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Part of the problem is that the EQ protocols are designed to be extremely firewall-hostile. That's not deliberate, just that playing nice with firewalls isn't something anyone at VI cares about.<br />
<br />
Firstly, the various zone and world servers allocate their UDP ports and match up their local port bindings with remote clients in a way that means that they WILL use port addresses on their severs that are associated with well-known attacks.<br />
<br />
Secondly, for most of the sub-protocols in EQ the client releases its ports the instant it's no longer interested in listening to the server, but while their server is still sending to the client (rather than going through a coordinated disconnection). This generates lots of traffic to an unbound port every time you log in, or zone, or whatever, and personal firewall software then has to decide whether this is a probe or not - which, because of the way they use ports, can look like a well-known attack.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, they are constantly patching the containing applications, and most personal firewalls check to see if applications change so that they can exclude applications that have been compromised by viruses.<br />
<br />
None of these things VI do are strictly necessary; individually they wouldn't be so bad, but all three is the worst-case scenario for personal firewalls. Dealing with over-eagerly unbound ports is something personal firewalls can sort-of cope with gracefully if they remember the most recent application/port associations for a short time; but the rest are really up to VI, and are not going to be fixed ever.<br />
<br />
Because of all these things, the easiest - not the most secure, but the easiest - way to make NIS work with EQ is to add global rules to permit particular Sony hosts to send any traffic to your machine. That means eqlogin1.989studios.com, eqworld-XX.989studios.com, and so forth - if you play on a range of servers,you just have to consider opening the entire VI netblocks.</div></div><hr />
