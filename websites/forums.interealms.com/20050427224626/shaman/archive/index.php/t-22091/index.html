<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tomomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi my name is tomomi and im a 63 shaman on the torv server.Ive been finding it kind of hard to make some money for my level 63/64/65 spells does anyone have any suggestions where i could go to make some money for the spells? Im almost 64 and when i hit 65 im going to try for a raiding guild but there is a problem how would i go about getting flags without joining another guild? Also are there any good solo spots that anyone knows of for a 63 shaman to work on aa's?Thanks!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Might wanna try droga or even nurga nameds. If ya find out where the ph's are ya can probably bust through 3-4 nameds/ph's a spawn cycle and make some cash. Xp isn't terrible in droga, and if ya get into deep nurga they are blue there also. Might want to post a magelo so we can all see what your working with so we can get a better idea what your capable of. Also might wanna post what spells you have as that affects where ya can solo as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Droga will be your godsend.  You will emerge pale, grizzled, and full of plat from selling all the loot from the named.  Start out on the easier stuff to learn the place, and then move up to the harder mobs.  At 63, you should be able to handle Flame Master camp no problem.  You really only have to kill the ones around him, and that should leave you plenty of time to canni up before respawns.  Boots of Kingly splendor are common, and fetch 4-5k on TM.  He can spawn 1x, or multiple times in a row.  <br />
<br />
Bind yourself outside droga, use spirit stone to gate out, bank, gate back, run down before next spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Those 2 zones get my vote.  I was in Nurga for 6 straight months.  I came away from both zones with enough money to buy all my spells.<br />
I used to have a page bookmarked to all the names and drops of Droga but it appears the page has been deleted.  How sad as it was very informative.</div></div><hr />
