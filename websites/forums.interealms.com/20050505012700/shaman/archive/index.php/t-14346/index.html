<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just started camping him, like im doing it as we speak, im just wondering , i know he can gate and summon, but is it true if you keep him between the torches he wont ?<br />
<br />
If not how do you keep him from gating</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Stuns, snare him and try to fear him is an old but risky tactic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I haven't tried him personally but the idea would be if you keep any gating mob close enough to thier spawn point they don't try and gate. You can see the same thing in effect if you try to solo the cleric bee's in BoT. If you stay reasonably close to thier spawn point they don't gate. Pull them aways and they gate every time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yea, i just went ahead and tried him, got owned between the torches, summoned me after gating and preceeded to call his minions to tear me a new one.<br />
<br />
I hate to say it cause i have dogged the  AA, but if i had VP i would have been able to stup him from gating. But, i am able to stop him from gating, i just fight him in front of the tomb and get him at a angle and use Spirit Call to pin him in the corner next to his door. no gate, spam rooted him though lol , was afraid he would run then gate.<br />
<br />
Another side question though is. Am i right in the believe that all i need is 39 rogue to pick the locks of this place?<br />
<br />
I mean its level x 5 + 5 right ? so 39 x 5 = 195 + 5 = 200 right ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wudoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Have taken out the Emp numerous times (it's where I got lucky and looted torpor)...can single pull him past his minions to the front coffin room once you are level 60.  Fight him between the door and the coffin, keep him there...once he runs past the coffin he will try to gate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What wudoman said. Just pull him to right outside the door and then push left or right along that wall. Keep him between the door and the coffin and you shouldn't have any problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was doing him at 61 with 61 pet and only 6aa. I would pull him and let dog make a lot of agro, just use epic till about 50-60percent. Then I load him with all dots. I keep him rooted between the hall door and first set of torches. If root breaks and he runs past the torches, nuke and pray...if you root him there he will gate and summon.I would rather take chances killing him on  the run rather than see him gate. The only time I died with this method was when I let slow drop when he was at 30 percent and he pummeled me. Good luck, after a couple kills he is really easy./</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">actualy i accidently found out that you can let him get to half way between the 2 torches before he will gate, once he passes that its a gamble. i know he gated on me when he was still between the 2 torches but he was real close to leaving. <br />
<br />
Anyway, no uber loots yet=\.  pray for me , i want my 65 spells :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have a bit of experience farming emp.<br />
<br />
I think you need 201+ skill in order to pick the lock.<br />
I might be wrong though.<br />
It's been a LONG time since I've bothered going down there.<br />
<br />
As for killing Emp and not having him run and not gating...<br />
I'm not sure of the directions for his room, but this is the layout:<br />
There is a locked door into Blood room.<br />
There is a coffin in the center of the room where blood PH spawns.<br />
There is a hallway (I think there's a door there, but not 100% sure) leading into Emp's room.<br />
The room has 6 guards plus the Emp ph in the center of your vision.<br />
At level 60 you've already seen you can solo pull Emp and ph.<br />
<br />
My setup was having pet parked near the coffin.<br />
I'd stand between the hallway and the coffin and pull Emp.<br />
I had malo and torpor already when I was farming him to try and make some cash, FYI, so I'd pull with malo.<br />
If you don't have malo, I'd try pulling with malosini.<br />
Slow asap of course.<br />
You have lots of time to kill him.  I think every 20 minutes you need Emp killed before the blood PH repops.  No rush.<br />
Get emp down to about 30% health or so.<br />
Keep him between the coffin and the hallway.  You can even let him get pushed into the hallway, but not too far.  He won't aggro the nearby adds if he's in the hallway near the blood room.<br />
At 30% or so, lay on the poison dots that you can, and start nuking him down.<br />
Keep him rooted as much as possible.<br />
He'll start to run of course.<br />
If you let him get past the coffin, you will most likely get adds if you don't root him, or he'll gate if you do root him.<br />
You MIGHT be able to let him get a bit past the coffin before you root him, but it's unlikely<br />
For when I was down there, I had along with me a Fungal Fiend Gland thingy that has 10 charges of snare.<br />
I tried not to use it, but for the 1 time I let him get too far, I popped a snare onto him and it saved me a lot of CR or gating out.<br />
<br />
In short, if you let him run past the coffin, you either need to root him and kill him before he gates, or kill him while he continues to run before he runs too far and warps out through the locked door and gives you adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Why not just clear the stupid room and kill him in there ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">His guards are numerous and annoying. Not enough room to root them, and 6 of them makes it too hard to tank...constant interrupts, spells wearing off the first one before you cast on the 6th...you'd probably end up with the emp respawning before you killed off all of his guards. Speedy killing is not a strong point for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Lockpick skill required for the first door (I'm assuming the blood room too, but don't really know for sure) is 201.<br />
<br />
Normally a rogue can only go over 200 skill at 51, but you can get a 39 rogue with 200 skill and a +lockpick device (mechanical lockpicks, cheirometric lockpick device).<br />
<br />
I've personally confirmed this works on other 201+ doors (Chardok Royals door), though not these actual doors, but no reason why it shouldn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">because the emporer is the only mob out of the 7 in his room that can be pulled solo. even at 65.<br />
<br />
ever tried to slow and kill 7 mobs at once solo?<br />
<br />
the 6 guards aren't lvl 60 but they aren't pansies either.<br />
<br />
instead of using the gland here you can give your pet a few weapons that proc snare of some sort.  there's a few rogue daggers and the silken whip of ensnaring that will serve this purpose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well so far this camp isnt as lucrative as i thought, i have had maybe 1 good spell drop that PC'd for 7k, maybe i was execpting to much, but my question is, is this the most lucrative camp a shaman can solo and hold for a day or 2? the good thing about here and NG was that i could camp and come back, but NG is a lil slow for when you need like 100k to make cash for spells plus its always camped cause its the easiest to get and hold.<br />
<br />
So any other suggestions ?<br />
<br />
If not ill stay here, im sure if i stay long enough itll pay off, i mean i didnt expect first kill to drop malo or something ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think I killed the emp about 12 times before he dropped Malo for me. Add in alll the placeholders I had to kill and I was there for a long time, plus it was the only lucarative spell to drop. It is similar to gambling, you can make a lot of pp there if you spend the time, otherwise it is a crap-shoot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You can kill Protector and Jumpalot for spells, and they are at least up all the time, not a ranom PH to deal with.<br />
<br />
Also go solo GW's in VP for spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">well im not here for spells so to speak, im here to make cash. I need my level 65 spells :)<br />

im wondering if i would be better off camping where the duke is cause of this or someplace else</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">it is 201 picklock required<br />
picklock is maxed 200 to a rogue 40 but is raised to 210 when you ding 50<br />
My rogue is 40 ans was able to open crypt because he had a +3% skill mod, gloves of the brood if I remember well</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Maivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Question: When can the emp first be soloed. I just hit 59 and need a place to find Pox / Torpor / Malo as well as cash ( I'm a poor bastard ).<br />
Wondering If I can solo him, If I can't does anyone know of something else I can solo that would drop these spells ? Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
The answer, unfortunately, is no.  I know of no shammy at level 59 who could solo a yellow conn who summons after he gates, with 6 adds, in such a small area.<br />
<br />
You can group (trio would work nicely) and do Guardian Wurms in SF, who are level 60 as well.  However, this is an outdoor zone and it's easier to play with the mobs there.  The single thing I'd be concerned about is Chromatics.  It's bad enough pulling in an add, without getting one that will annul you for every buff you got.  It makes things MUCH harder....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The answer, unfortunately, is no. I know of no shammy at level 59 who could solo a yellow conn who summons after he gates, with 6 adds, in such a small area.<br />
Uh.  I beg to differ.  I'm pretty sure that a level 59 can solo pull Emp as well as a level 60.  A level 60 player is fighing a white con, while the 59 is fighting a yellow con of 1 level.  That's very little difference.  If either is doing this to obtain Malo/Torpor then both are using the same 58 heal, 59 and lower dots, and same 56 pet.  The only difference is 1 level for resist rates.  Why exactly can't a level 59 kill emp assuming he can solo pull emp just like the level 60 does?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I don't concede that this is a good solo camp for a level 60 either.  Although Focus and the extra HP's that a level would give you are nice, that's still too much risk for the reward.  If he gates, he'll summon you to your death, and your corpse will be stuck, unless you get a Necro to summon it for you or a SOS Rogue, etc...<br />
Malo and Torpor are huge spells and a great reward for an enterprising Shaman, but doing that camp solo at that level is just too much risk.  I won't take the resposibility to recommend that camp, solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">well im not here for spells so to speak, im here to make cash. I need my level 65 spells  <br />
Exactly, that is why your camping him for spells to sell to get cash, hence the reason you should be killing GW's in VP where there is essentially an unlimited supply of mobs that can potentially drop them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">hmm... well next trak spawn ill have my VP key so maybe ill try it, but i should VP was largly unsoloable due to the varying mobs, my understanding is that alot of the GW's split into 2 on death?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">If he gates, he'll summon you to your death, and your corpse will be stuck, unless you get a Necro to summon it for you or a SOS Rogue, etc...<br />
<br />
This is too true to ignore.  It's easy for emp to get away at this camp, as the spawn time is long and if you get distracted .. play time is over =p   There's lots of interesting ways to die at this camp.<br />
<br />
On another note, I'm fairly certain I was down there at 59 solo pulling him, and solo killing him.  He's not hard to kill at that level if you keep your head about you.  Just make sure you keep the bstrd rooted in between the crypt and the door and you should have no trouble at all.<br />
<br />
yes it's very risky, but it's completely worth it if you can get Malo and/or Torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Maivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Thanks for the advice. I'm gonna wait a bit before I try him. Don't have epic yet, which I forgot to mention ( been trying to get my tear for almost 2 years now =P ), So killing him would be a bitch and a half with just Bane and Ebolt while trying to keep him rooted.<br />
<br />
I have 2 other questions though, Could me and a 55 warrior stand any chance on a GW ? And IF I brought a group of friends is there any places that these 3 spells drop alittle more common ?<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your advice and being frank with me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I'd say that you and the warrior could duo GWs in Skyfire. You may need to kite them around a bit until they're slowed - Malosini will help there too. Remember, don't do any damage until they're slowed, and keep the pet off them, since when they're damaged, they'll start to summon. This may make it harder for a warrior than other classes to get agro, but I think it would still be doable.<br />
<br />
And if it goes wrong, at least there are often clerics there doing their time for shards. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">but if i had VP i would have been able to stup him from gating. <br />
<br />
Small point, but all of the times I have tried to use VP to interrupt a spell cast, it did not work.  It should, and I expected it to, but it doesn't.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Was just looking at lucy spell data, and notice that VP2 and VP3 push farther than VP1 which is what I have been using.  Perhaps with the farther push it will interrupt.</div></div><hr />
