There were some rumors that there were some blues there. Unfortunatly nothing seemed to have changed at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
I go an try CT. No changes that are visable. Some friends and I kill some stuff in CT. Bout 1% AA per kill.  Nothing amazing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone notice any changes at all in HS or chardok or any of the other zones?  These zones are on my top 5 favortie exp zones and i would love to exp in them again.</div></div><hr />

** Zone Revamps ** <br />
<br />
- The Deep, Charasis (Howling Stones), Dragon Necropolis, Siren's Grotto, The Hole, The City of Mist, and The Accursed Temple of Cazic-Thule have been partially revamped. Gameplay in these zones has been improved, based on feedback from players and careful review of the content. The changes are not dramatic, but make these zones more entertaining to play in.<br />
<br />
Velks and Chardok are not specified as having changes made to them.  The exact *gameplay* changes are not specified.  In addition, it says the changes are not dramatic.  It could be as simple as increasing named spawns and/or drop rates of various items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">they forgot to put the entrance to sol c in last patch...anyone want to place a bet now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">bah thought they said chardok VL were under there. Ct is a solid 2-3% AA solo now. Not bad exp for the easiness of the mobs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">so far im unimpressed by the revamps, they all seem the same sop far with very minor changes to mob count and like 1 o 2 more drops. everyhting is still green to me atleast. But i havent checked them all, i got the hole,DN and CT to check, though i think CT was probably just a ZEM adjustment or something like that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Skeeter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Now that this has gone live, I can talk about this...  I worked 'a little' with the developer that made changes to Cazic.  I suggested making the nameds spawn a bit more often -- and maybe add a little more 'loot' overall to trash mobs.  Not change the drops, but increase the chance for spell research and tradeskill drops, mainly.  Instead, they decided to increase the experience a bit.  Not very much -- just a little.  I don't see how this will help -- who comes to Cazic for anything other than tradeskill drops or items like the FT3 boots that drop once a month?<br />
<br />
He didn't explain why they chose this 'fix,' but I got the impression they were making minor changes to see if they saw an increase in volume in the zone -- if the Cazic volume spikes for a couple days then drops back to it's previous blah level, I'm sure they'll consider tweaking more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I went to the Hole and all the mobs by the lake near the dropoff were gone - replaced by gigantic spite golems. Found a quest fellow down there and started on his quest, but I'm stuck trying to find the second set of npcs. Oh, and the zone is called Ruins of Old Paineel now instead of The Hole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'll have to play with this over the weekend... I've always loved The Hole. Could be they finally added in NPCs who want the random No Drop loot that drops. Just before logging out last night I received a Block of Black Ore from one of the Rock Golems I was pulling. It has the book model, weighs 15 stones. Lore, No Drop.<br />
<br />
I'm going to grab some friends and spend the day Saturday putzing around through the zone and post some info if I find something nobody else has gotten to since then ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">in grieg now all mob are dark blue . They're no more any trap ,they don't anymore cast illusion on player,random resist.....well there nothing interresting .In fact pre revamped Grieg was 10 more fun than now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Spent a few hours running all over CoM today.  Most of the 'ghost' charactes have been replaced with human models.  They are no longer flagged as undead.   <br />
<br />
There was also much more randomization of loots.  In the time I was there I had 2 Ornate Rune shields drop, 3 MoSS, an all/all earring (+4 wis/int +30 hp/mana) I hadnt seen before and 2 priest Face (3 AC +3str, +10 wis +25 hp/20 mana) that were also new<br />
<br />
There were a few new mobs that were DB to me at 61, most were still green with the occasional ltblue.  Didnt have a rogue to open the castle for me so I wasn't able to get inside there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hmm ok some info. Some people will like this. Ok only visited Com of the places revamped. Some of the undead models have been replaced by the mutant models of echo caves and the deep. I came across a black reaver. Ok this is the fantastic info, THEY NO LONGER HAVE ABSURD RESIST RATES!. I was able to root it and dot it. It died and another spawned followed by lord ghiosk who also was easily slowable and dottaable. Still though Blind is Uncurable I think, well i tried rgc and disinfecting aura forgot to try cure blind lol. And also small concern is that I think they can blind themselves, because one seemed to run off and I had not cast blind on it or anything. <br />
<br />
Interested in any info about CT, and SG. I heard the drops in Grieg weren't too impressive. Or anyone been Dragon necropolis?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tranzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">So is our epic still ok in CoM then or has anyone tried it? Oh and SolC was in the last patch..i have been there and seen people fighting in it. You have to swim though some lava to get there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We hit DN this evening but not much to report. The spiders no longer have that annoying teleport and they might be a bit higher lvl. About half where blue and the rest LB. We didn't make it too far into the rat tunnels, got to the first trap and it spawned at least a dozen spiders, more than I'd ever seen before. Lost a couple of group members and then I got death touched while dragging a corpse back to zone. Nobody thought it was worth staying after that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Revamp != blue to 65.<br />
<br />
I'd assume all said dungeons are retaining their level ranges, just making some tweaks and fixups to make them more viable (loot, pathing, mob types, quests).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">GE has a few traps still, and alot of static spawns.  Grieg is still easy, except 2 SMs in  portup room, and 10 around grieg now.  Much longer respawn time on them.  They didnt respawn in about 20 minutes we were up there which was nice.  Loot table seemed the same, except he dropped 3 items, 4 spells + orb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">What's the word on the deep?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Howling Stones now has a master key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Secs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Greig didnt drop any new loot, you can invis pretty much all through the zone, without see invis traps.  Still no CoH, the key mob for grieg dropped an int-caster book with spell haste 3 on it wasnt too impressive stat wise, but then again the mob isnt very hard.  It was pretty cool logging in late, and invising up and catching up to an almost done greig raid =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Spent a few hours in GE after the patch.  Everything was dark blue at 65 and about 1% AA per kill solo.  Killed 4 named that dropped some decent stuff.  An earring that dropped twice had some wisdom and 60 hps and a decent ring dropped that had maybe 5 wisdom, 35 hps and 70 mana.  Oh and right before I left a pretty sad plate helm dropped that had around 15 ac, some agility and str, 25 hps/mana, but negative 10 dex.  <br />
<br />
Mobs hit for around 140 up to 190, don't have very many hps, and are somewhat magic resistant.  The named weren't any harder than the normal trash.  Trash dropped anything from 5 gold up to 10 platinum, some luclin gems similar to Umbral, and sold old world gems like fire emeralds and jacinth.  Overall I really liked the changes to Griegs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">CoM - Reavers CAN now be hit by spells (Cure Blind always worked on reaver blindness Mcroc, always try the obvious solution first  ;) ). Also heard reports that mobs near the castle drop keys to get the door open, although I've not tested that one yet.<br />
<br />
(Edit)<br />
Deep - Oops almost forgot this one. Nothing spectacular here, although nothing (yes nothing) now seems to see through invis anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'd assume all said dungeons are retaining their level ranges, just making some tweaks and fixups to make them more viable (loot, pathing, mob types, quests).<br />
<br />
Nope. The rock golems that used to be up front in the Hole were dark blue, but now everything up front is green until you get into the tunnels where you start finding some light blue stuff. The giant spite golems (massive constructs they're called) are green and hit for less than 100, but they have real high magic resistance. The gargoyles up front mitigate slow also (greenies at 65 too).<br />
<br />
Far as I could see, the ratmen and flighty fiends were gone. Zone was filled with elementals, various golems, and gargoyles. Tracked some citybound spirits from the zone also - I assume those are down in earth town.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">While guild was checking raid targets I went to CoM and poked around a little bit. <br />
<br />
As already writen here ghosts are gone and replaced by human mobs. Not many skellies up too. Everything in the yard was green to 65. But they hit quite hard for green mobs (up to 150).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Spent a few hours running all over CoM today.  Most of the 'ghost' charactes have been replaced with human models.  They are no longer flagged as undead.<br />
<br />
From what I've read here, the models have been replaced, but not by human ones. The human model is the default model for when the client doesn't understand which model to use.<br />
<br />
This sometimes happens when the texture cache file gets out of step after a patch, or system change. I suggest you delete your texture cache file (I think it will be something like citymist.txc), and let it rebuild itself next time you zone in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Didnt have a rogue to open the castle for me so I wasn't able to get inside there.<br />
<br />
a key drops from the captain and gets added to your keyring when you use it, no longer need a rogue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Nope. The rock golems that used to be up front in the Hole were dark blue, but now everything up front is green until you get into the tunnels where you start finding some light blue stuff.<br />
<br />
However the overall level range of the zone seems to have been kept about the same. There was only ever one rock golem near the Hole entrance, all the elementals around there (in the old zone) were green to me at 61.<br />
<br />
Far as I could see, the ratmen and flighty fiends were gone. Zone was filled with elementals, various golems, and gargoyles. Tracked some citybound spirits from the zone also - I assume those are down in earth town.<br />
<br />
The ratmen are still there, albeit with a name change, and in different places. No flighty fiends. There are undead (the same model as the old ones) scattered over the whole zone too, they are called things like &quot;a spirit of the old city&quot; etc.<br />
<br />
Other notable things I found were:<br />
<br />
Some gargolyes see though sneak/hide - you can no longer visit the entire zone with a Brell rogue.<br />
<br />
Caradon is no longer in the jail, wonder how this affects SK epics. Similarly the mimics are no longer in the bank, although they've been replaced by &quot;a chest&quot; which is the same model, and might drop the key, I didn't find out.<br />
<br />
Polzin Mrid still lives in &quot;More than Mushrooms&quot;.<br />
<br />
There are several locked doors throughout the zone, didn't find out who drops the keys. The first door in the zone (at the top of the ramp over the pit) is now openable - you can get out of the zone without a porter.<br />
<br />
Master Yael wasn't around, I assume he doesn't live there any more. Down where he used to be, there's a HUGE gargoyle.<br />
<br />
Also, Nortlav the Scalekeeper isn't there any more, but a new mob called &quot;Echo of Nortlav&quot; is standing near where he used to be. Didn't respond to hails.<br />
<br />
The tunnel behind Master Yael's door still goes nowhere.<br />
<br />
I couldn't get into the undead tower to check on High Scale Kirn. But seeing as everyone cheats their epic these days I bet no one cares.<br />
<br />
At the bottom of the drop, around where Yael used to be, there are various untargetable player corpses called &quot;a fallen adventurer&quot;. Most of them are wielding their epics - I'm not sure if this is a subtle hint about a quest or just pretty scenery.<br />
<br />
There you have it, roving reporter from the Hole (sorry, Ruins of Old Paineel) signing off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
These werent the standard male human models.  They were the similar to those found in echo caverns.  Mutant something or other. I killed them, but didnt pay too much attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Went to SG last night. Seems a little higher level. They added a few more mobs. The Enthralled Bulthar's are now clerics as well and slightly lower level clerics than the Molktors (or whatever they were called) - they were casting Reckoning on me when used to be all Judgement. But there are a lot more of them. Not sure if the walrus heads are casters - kept getting trained by a ToV raid so had to leave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Less and less a point of playing a rogue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Apart from awesome DPS, an epic that you can do at 50 in a few hours, and general huge group desirability?<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Took some friends to Howling Stones last night to check it out.<br />
<br />
North wing doesn't seem to need a key anymore, west and south still do but we had a rogue show up and we skipped ahead to south.<br />
<br />
Most of the drops were the same only on route to Dru we killed about 5 or so named where as before we'd usually only get one or two. <br />
<br />
Same crap as before only it drops more. Kylong Chestplate (rotted) Guardian's Mace, some bard lute and a decent mask for casters. About the coolest thing that dropped on the way was a Sash which went to a happy young SK with us who hadn't had a haste item yet. <br />
<br />
Mobs in most of South and all of East conned blue to 64 and were still as easy as they were before.<br />
<br />
Now Drusella, some changes to her it seems. It was my first time fighting her though so not sure how she was before but she was pretty easy. One malo, slow stook no prob. Think I slapped up on Tnarg's on the MT and then was about to cast a DoT and she was already at 50%. Supposedly she summons and hits over 300 though. Dunno if that's new /shrug<br />
<br />
She was also in the Golem room before the last room before the portal. I always thought she spawned in the last room. Like I said, my first time fighting her. I've been to HS many times but she had never been up. <br />
<br />
As for loot, she dropped the mirror. Don't know if that's common but she also dropped the Urn (which I hear can be very rare) and she dropped a new item.<br />
<br />
ACID ETCHED GIRDLE <br />
AC 10 STR 5 STA 5 DEX 5 AGI 5 WIS 8 INT 8 HP 50 MANA 50 <br />
all/all <br />
<br />
I lost on the roll though :(<br />
<br />
Was a fun dungeon crawl though!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Howling Stones Master Key (http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=13504.topic)</div></div><hr />

<br />
To a 61, everything round the entrance area was green. Once into the city, everything was dark blue. Elementals, gargoyles and constructs (black reaver models) are impossible to slow. Undead and rats can be slowed as normal.<br />
<br />
Once we got into the tunnel that leads to the undead tower, we were meeting gargoyles of about level 58. Didn't get to the tower so I can't report on Kirn yet.<br />
<br />
All in all, first impressions are good - nice level progression as you go deeper into the dungeon. My only gripe is that a higher level group wanting to get to a decent xp spot would have to fight though a lot of greenies to get there.</div></div><hr />
