<br />
high wis will let you cast more often per cycle. But AC and HP will let you take hits better and regen the mana. I would find yourself a iksar regen BP and go nuts.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>mudders16</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">again if i didnt post it or if i did and someone just didnt see it ( my shaman is level 1 ) i dont need that stam gear and hp till 20 when i get canni, i know that doesnt take long to get but it doesnt take long to get gear either, and my stam/ hp doesnt suck either, but thanks all for changin the subject, and fyi i've already rolled a 65 druid  / cleric on an old account, but whatever</div></div><hr />

<br />
when i started my shaman i had no idea what stats did what and put it in strength and dexterity.. i played in karnors castle and upgraded every single piece of armor there but not until lvl 53.<br />
<br />
not everybody in this game is going to have capped everything and 2000 hit points 800 AC at lvl 24.. <br />
<br />
quit being pompus snobs<br />
<br />
best players in the game arent always the best equipped, and the best equipped arent always the best players..  its how you use what you got and how much you enjoy playing your toon.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't matter if you have Canni or not, having high HP/AC is the key to blowing through the levels fast.  High wisdom does near nothing at low levels.  The mana formula for wisdom is based on Level, at low levels you get relatively no mana from all that high Wisdom.  Even at level 20 that 220 Wisdom is only giving you a few hundred mana compared to having 120 Wisdom, at level 1 its less than 100 mana.  Also, high stamina also not as effective at low levels, because the stamina to hp ratio is based on level as well.   <br />
<br />
The key to leveling fast as a shaman is to have high hp, high AC, good hp regen, and a good melee weapon.  Thats it.   Even with just the 8k you stated, you could buy enough gear to put your level 1 at 400-500 hp and 300 AC.  Until level 10 mobs won't even be able to touch you.  As your AC starts going up more as you level you'll still easily beat mobs and take little damage.  With an Ikky BP (or Fungi if you have the cash) and the lower level torpor spells you'll have little downtime.   With a good weapon you can melee your way to level 30 fast.<br />
<br />
As for zones:<br />
1-10 Blackburrow<br />
11-16 Unrest, just stay outside, great xp.<br />
17-21 Paludal<br />
22-36 Tizmaks in Great Divide, with a melee partner its insane xp, easily soloable as well.  Loot sucks but its all about the xp, non-stop pulls and you never run out of spawns.<br />
37-45 Dreadlands, I prefer the snowy area near the Yetis.  Clear the cave, go out and kill spiders and such, then clear caves when respawned.    Lower Guk is also pretty good.<br />
