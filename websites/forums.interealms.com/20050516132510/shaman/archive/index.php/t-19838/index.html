<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone got a link or some info on details of the Leadership AA?<br />
<br />
Specifically, any numbers for:<br />
<br />
Offensive Enhancement<br />
Mana Enhancement<br />
Health Enhancement<br />
Health Regeneration<br />
<br />
<br />
[edit: Updating based on what I know first hand]<br />
<br />
<br />
Spell Awareness - 6 points.<br />
Passive, granted to the whole group.<br />
<br />
Give you the ability to recognize ALL spells being cast in your area, including both PC and NPC.   This ability simply changes the text &quot;Henora begins casting a spell&quot; to read &quot;Henora begins casting the spell [Turgurs Insects]&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Inspect Buffs - Level 1 - 4 points.<br />
Active, group members can create hotkeys from the Leadership Window.<br />
<br />
Adds a hotkey ability that allows you to target a group member and get a list of their buffs.  It displays exactly like /pet report health. <br />
<br />
<br />
Inspect Buffs - Level 2 - 6 points.<br />
Active, group members can create hotkeys from the Leadership Window.<br />
<br />
Enhances the Inspect Buffs 1 ability to display a timer that shows the time remaining on each of the buffs reported.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i was wondering myself...our guild and alliance now has offical raid leaders who will be &quot;leading&quot; ever raid to earn points.  these are people who tend to make most of the raids...unfortunatly i am going to be one of them.  so any info you guys have would really help out.<br />
i am boggled with this leadership thing =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mitrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">From what my guild has discovered so far:<br />
 - Offensive Enhancement adds 10 ATK per level to your party members.  (Max 50 ATK)<br />
 - Mana Enhancement adds FT1 per level to your party members.  (Max FT5)<br />
 - Health Regeneration adds HP regen at 1 per tick, per level to your party.  (Max regen 5)<br />
 - Health Enhancement - the first level adds 10 HP to each party member.  (I'm not sure how much for additional levels yet)<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the group leaders and raid leaders points are totally independant of each other.  You can't earn points as a group leader and buy raid leader abilities, and vice versa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mitrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Question I don't have the answer to yet is whether these will stack well or not.  For example, if the mana or health regen stacks with existing item caps.  Anyone know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Mana Enhancement adds FT1 per level to your party members. (Max FT5)<br />
<br />
This is incorrect. There is no FT leadership ability, its a mana pool gain, similar to the hp enhancement. There is no mana regen.<br />
<br />
NPC Health and Delegate Main Assist are pretty useful group ones, and MA one would be good for raids. As would offensive enhancement</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mitrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">its a mana pool gain. . .Oh really?  Do you know how much?  My apologies for the mis-information if that's true. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Mana Enhancement<br />
Usuable by: Anyone in Group<br />
This ability increases the maximum amount of your group members may have. Each level of this ability increases it an additional amount.<br />
<br />
And as far as I know, it's about 100 - 150 mana, as much as the hp pool gives(when maxed).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">- Health Enhancement - the first level adds 10 HP to each party member.  (I'm not sure how much for additional levels yet)<br />
<br />
<br />
Not correct. I have the first level and it adds 30hp to each group member.</div></div><hr />

I got the Health Enhancement level 1 the other day it gave all people in the group extra 30hp :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
I sure hope you can change the ui for the effect.<br />
<br />
I have already done a /feedback asking them to slow the pulses before i have an epelectic fit  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Does groupleader skills also work when soloing? If e.g. I got the skill that gies every group member +30hp, would I also have the same +30hp when ungrouped?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">No, you must be grouped.<br />
And ya... I like Delegate Main Assist, but I keep targeting rings off, so only get the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; name &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; - %</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You must have 3 or more people in the group for the leadership aa to work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have to be the group leader for my leadership AA to work.  I had read somewhere that 3 people could have leadership AAs in effect on the group, after they had been earned.  I have spell awareness and it wont work without me being the leader.   I really like it though, it's very nice for coordinating debuffs and heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">How exactly does spell awareness work?  Like what message does it give and is it for pc spells only or npc spells too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">PC and NPC spells both, its right after the so and so begins to cast a spell message you see the text in &lt;&gt;. It also gets pets, so get ready for spam.<br />
<br />
The health effect at least gives the bonus with two people in the group, but you can't gain leader xp unless you have 3 people in the group.<br />
<br />
Find Path to PC is decent. It is limited on its range, which does annoy. But you can use it to help people get on the short bus to find you instead of escorting folks all over creation. The path is made to your location at the time of the ability. It doesn't move as you move.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just an update.  I've purchased Spell Awareness (6 points) and Inspect Buffs 1 (4 points).  I really really like spell awareness and so does my group.  I am made leader like instantly now, heh.<br />
<br />
Spell Awareness is innate for your group.  It works on both PC and NPCs.<br />
<br />
In the past you would see:<br />
Henora begins to cast a spell.<br />
<br />
With Spell Awareness you see:<br />
Henora begins to cast the spell [Turgur's Insects]<br />
<br />
Bard songs are shown without their name and simply come up in the brackets.  For example, rather than seeing:<br />
Rizlona's flames pulse through your body.<br />
<br />
With spell awareness you see:<br />
[Rizlona's Call of Flame]<br />
<br />
You can also see when people are using AA abilities, like spirit call, suspended minion, cannibalize, bestow DA, Lifeburn, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Inspect Buffs is a bit less useful in the first form, I am really looking forward to the second one though.   You make a hotkey in the Leadership window (any one in your group can make the hotkey once you have the ability, by opening their Leader window and pressing the button).   Then target a person in your group and press the hotkey you just made.  It gives you a list of their buffs (and debuffs), similar to how /pet health does.<br />
<br />
Level 2 adds a timer feature, that shows you the time remaining on all buffs (and debuffs).<br />
<br />
I'm working on level 2 next.  Will be very nice to just quickly target a group member and see how long until the chanter haste we bummed before we started is out.  It's easy enough to time our own buffs, if we must, but this will time others too.  Your cleric pals will know at a click if they should do HOV or just refresh one person individually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">WOW!!! I know which ability I'm getting first, that inspect buff sounds AWSOME.<br />
<br />
That and targets target look like the perfect caster abilities.  All in all, I'm rather impressed by the fact that SOE actually had some clever ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">For raids nothing beats the Target of Target window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">How do we check the list of leadership aa?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I spent the points on the MA's targets health thing and its pretty useless considering the hp only updates if you have the mob targeted anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I have Health Enhancement 1, and can also confirm it gives 30 hps. You only need 1 other person grouped with you to get the extra hps, but you still need at least 2 others (and killing dark blues) to gain leadership exp. <br />
<br />
I was told the second level gives 60 hps, and the third level 100 hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">...so if six people each have HE3, everyone in the group gets +600 HP?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sunbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">No, you only get the benefits from the Leadership abilities that the current leader has.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">some more nice information about Leader AA from the Safehouse.<br />
