<br />
If travel in Veeshan’s Peak is easier … what is the value of raiding or exp’ing in this zone for the lvl 65 types folks?  In looking over the equipment list … it’s going to be hard to gather interest to key for this zone based purely on drops.   <br />
<br />
Has anyone tried VP lately?  Other than Crown of Rile and Spear of Constriction … is there any reason for a Shaman in VP?  Any reason for tier III plus enabled guild to visit VP?<br />
<br />
For those 61 plus guilds that haven't keyed for VP ... Will you key for VP now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Zoned in the other day just to put it on my keyring, did some vision scouting. Sweet looking zone. We plan on clearing the zone once just to see the entire thing.<br />
<br />
Sure would like to find a spot I could split up to solo. Seemed like most mobs would be at least in 2's and some spots looked more like ToV with a mass of dino's. Didn't get to see that much of the zone tho, and the only thing I noticed that saw thru invis was silverwing and hosh ( and I assume the other dragons but I couldnt find em with vision )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">we gave it a shot and took a couple of groups in there.  Didn't get very far, and got us a very nasty CR, when one of the guardian wurms we pulled to the entrance split in two on death, including one wurm that trippled for 1555 dmg. These split mobs stay bound to their spawn point, and return there even if pulled a good distance away.  Bad thing if you have a dozen corpses undernieth in a room full of lava.<br />
The experience seemed nice, but with the splitting mobs it's not a safe zone to take less then 2 full groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Khatmandu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">VP is a fun zone to do with a guild. There are still some decent pieces that drop for folks in there even though I admit some of it is junk. The fun challenge with that zone is like doing a Pub crawl, where you basically go from room to room killing everything in your path without stopping until you pop out in PoA after waxing every dragon in the zone. By double duel dying it was not tough to leave the zone, with a cleric parked outside at your bind point, but being able to gate out definatly will make it easier, but it does lose some of the thrill of actually bein in a place with the possibility of a BAD CR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">LOL thats right, I forgot shamu that was you guys who had silverwing at the zone in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My guild is starting to get keyed.  It's partly just coincidental timing, as we've only just begun taking out the easier dragons and therefore only now have access to the teeth.  But the addition of the ability to Gate certainly makes it more worthwhile.  We can't rally huge numbers for really long raids, so this way we can take our time and leave safely when folks need to get going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We skipped VP and are VT bound, I doubt we'll go back.  I have a few of the VP key pieces but haven't done the Pained Soul and a couple of others.  If I can gate out I might finish it on my own... someday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I went with some folks from another guild recently and had a grand time.  <br />
<br />
We didn't have many people, and when the named dragons start to run, they really fly.  You can't cast when they leave melee range, so it's hard to finish beating them down if they do take off.  <br />
<br />
And they regen really fast.  I think faster than they used to, but I am not sure.  <br />
<br />
We had one wipe out when one of them took off like a shot and aggroed a ton of adds.  <br />
<br />
I am sure that's avoidable, but it happens.  <br />
<br />
I thought it was cool and a lot of fun.  Much more fun with 2 groups than 6, when I was in there before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">One thing that I would love to go to VP for, is that I heard level 60 drops are a lot more common than anywhere else!!:)<br />
<br />
But I guess if you're 65, then theres not much incentive other than to have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">yep, the regen on the named was outrageous - until we got disease to land, then the mellee were actually doing visible damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=13562</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>gazkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Cleared VP easily with 11 people in about 2 hours (in a guild has been farming ele planes for about 2 months).. There's a couple of reasons for shammies to go to VP.. haste boots off Hoshkar, and Spear of Constriction off Xygoz, that's about it if you're in a Elemental Planes or VT guild, robe off Phara Dar is very nice if you want to have that gnome wizzie look once in awhile.  Anyone on legends that can give insight into the new drops here?  Maybe a link?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">We have started doing VP for fun, it can be done with two grps of 65's and is a good laugh when there are no better targets up.<br />
<br />
Last night i got  - Hammer of the Dragonborn, a 2hb with Primal Essence as a clik effect.  It sits next to my JBP and JBB in my &quot;click item&quot; bag in my inventory and is really useful.  Some other fun stuff drops for shaman there, i highly reccomend this zone, it can be cleared in around an hour and a half.<br />
<br />
Just make sure you mem Blood of Nadox for Hosrak (i use a wicked bone atltl to speed up cast time, and it casts pretty quick).<br />
<br />
Also in the last raid we got 2 Malo's dropping, as well as a Pox, VoB and a Tali of Raptor.  All this time we thought the Shm spell drop rate was nerfed.  Looks like they drop loads, just only in VP p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I am a big fan of this zone but I have to admit - its usefulness to a mostly level 65, elemental guild is close to none. 60 and below spells drop all over the place in this zone. Rare ones. Torpor and Malo galore, with Sunstrike up the wazoo. But that's one of the main reasons its useless to an &quot;uberguild&quot;. Runes give upgrades to basically everything that drops in VP, and the equipment is useful for a few classes (shaman being one of them with the PE clicky hammer and snare weapon) but stat-wise is pretty pathetic. The best thing I've seen out of there is a 35hp/35mana +5 all resists +5 agi dex and str all/all belt. Hardly worth the effort to elemental guilds.<br />
<br />
<br />
If any people in your guild need 60 or under spells, this is THE place to be. For anything else... there are much better places.</div></div><hr />
