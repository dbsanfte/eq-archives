Very nice haha.  I think this is funny cause I remember wiping to Sont with 30-40 people in the not-so distant past.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Grats rangers, they certainly can do some nice burst DPS.  :)<br />
I bet those guys had a fun time.<br />
<br />
At any rate, I dunno why people think Sonty is hard.  He isn't the fight he was before, POP &gt; Sontalak.  My guild failed him our first attempt, with 18 people.   After that we farmed all our ST keys off him and never failed again.   I think our smallest kill was with 9 people.   I seriously don't understand how people can lose to him with 40 or 50 level 60-65 chars.  But I see it all the time on my server.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vixy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Gouten is in my guild, and I was actually there at thier first attempt at this.  They wanted me to buff them, then stand back and do nothing.  They actually got him to like 10% the first try, and I was laughing my ass off.  The only reason they didn't succeed was because Gouten triggered his tanking disc before the fight by accident.<br />
<br />
The amount of damage that Rangers do is just unbelievable.</div></div><hr />

Well, I dont know the guild, and after i checked their website, I wasnt too sure on their progression so far...but then i'll be doing this calculated from the view of a 65 ranger friend of mine, in a guild that does aow/al etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
He is equipped with a primal bow. His average dps against pov golems and trash was 185. With disc, he had between 300 and 350dps.<br />
<br />
6 rangers. Assuming 1 ranger has to weaponshield tank him, thats 5 rangers x 300-350 dps. Melee, a ranger *depending on aa's, but taking my ranger friend as an example* does around 100 dps in melee. <br />
<br />
5 x 300-350= 1500-1750 + 100.<br />
<br />
So we are looking at 1600-1850 dps.<br />
<br />
Say, a fully buffed ranger has about 7khp buffed. Weaponshield grants 18 seconds of non stop parry. Sonta will eat the ranger in about 10 seconds after it drops, if he is heavy on evasive aa's. <br />
<br />
Sonta takes about a second or 2 to re-allign and summon a ranger, to make it a bit easier. <br />
<br />
One ranger, can tank sontalak for 30 seconds. <br />
<br />
30 x 1600-1850 dps= 48000- 55500<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats 30 seconds. After tat, a ranger dies, and one uses weaponshield and does the melee thing again.<br />
<br />
1 ranger tanking 100 dps<br />
<br />
4 ranger machinegunning still= 4 x 300-350 dps= 1200-1500dps.<br />
<br />
After 30 seconds, thats 36000- 45000 damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sonta has 90k hp iirc. Sonta, is toast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gooshemz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can't have a second ranger going weaponshield if they already burned their disc on trueshot.  It takes an hour to recycle.  As a 62 ranger in non-elemental gear I have about 4500 hp's buffed with virtue and focus and boar.  I dunno if even the leet rangers can get 7k hp's.<br />
<br />
I am guessing they did some kiting at the beginning until the puller got summoned, to get a head start on his hit points.<br />
<br />
Assuming only one ranger is using weaponshield disc, that means 5 rangers have to do roughly 20k damage in 30 seconds each.  That's a helluva lotta dps, even with elemental bows.<br />
<br />
I have a feeling there is more to this story then you are led to believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was thinking the same Gooshemz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bubkuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Eh eh eh, I know one of those rangers, Rezz, an old friend of mine. NO is one of top 2 guilds on Prexus. <br />
<br />
One of the spells that was dropped off of Sont was Voice of the Beserker which Rezz was nice enough to give to me. Guess all the uber shamans in NO didn't need it. :) <br />
<br />
Rezz is seriously decked out, and puts my guilds top ranger to shame, and even kicks the snot out of our most uber tank.  Last I talked to em he was capable of doing an average of 200 dps. Hes a great guy and glad to see he was a part of this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If I remember correctly 4 of the 6 rangers were killed during this fight (that doesnt happen w/ Manaburn crews).  <br />
<br />
As to HPs, I have a mix of Velious and Luclin gear and can get almost 6k HP buffed, but that requires the lvl65 brells, Pot9/Symbol, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Buntuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Breaking 7k HP buffed is fairly easy. You don't have to be an &quot;uber&quot; ranger to approach those figures if you get properly buffed and focus your gear on HP.<br />
<br />
I'm at 7300 buffed with Warder's Protection rather than Brell's Stalwart Shield, and I've lots of upgrades to get hehe.<br />
<br />
As for the Sontalak issue... hey, how surprised can you get that a mid-range boss from two expansions back gets swamped by a high-dps crew. Remember folks... in Velious you didn't even have access to AAs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Man was reading through that and doom and gloom about being nerfed all through there. These guys had to use some strategy and tactics to get this dragon killed. They failed once before i read? because one of the weapon shields were accidental burned and than the 2nd time a chunk of the rangers died. This wasnt 6 button pushed and dead dragon after 6 seconds bit of a difference. Bet this fight was actually fun cosidering they didnt all come through alive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My guild is only in VT and all our rangers are over 7k hps buffed, think our guildleader is either over 8k or nearing it.  Thats nothing for rangers, hell I'm a shaman and at 6200 or so hps buffed.</div></div><hr />
