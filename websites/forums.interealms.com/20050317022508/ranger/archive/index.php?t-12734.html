<br />
Well, I was wrong. It casts our level 51 spell, Ensnare. Same casttime(1,8), same chance of resists. It has a 5sec reuse.<br />
<br />
It saving up a spellslot is okay I guess, but as a Ranger I usually don't have a problem with not having enough spell-slots.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't bother to spend points in this skill.</div></div><hr />

I use Ensnare pretty exclusively,  and I am always short on spell slots,  so no spell slot (and presumably no mana) will be great.<br />

Sure, a lure snare or insta-cast or something would have been great, but as long as it is as good as what I cast all the time now, and saves me a spell slot, I will buy it.<br />

Will be nice to free up a spell slot, and to have it always memmed, and it being manaless is nice too.  The only real issue I have with the skill is the fact that didn't reduce the cast time, a 1.2 to 1.5 second cast time would have been nice.  From where I'm sitting, having another spell slot to use for one of our shorter combat buffs, or another nuke, or to not lose as many slots when I load both jolts for raiding, will be very nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After using it some it's nice to chain-cast snares when you want to get aggro. Since it's a skill you can cast Entrap the second Tang Weeds hit, which makes it alot more &quot;chain friendly&quot;.<br />
<br />
But I think at level 64 you expect it to be a bit better than Ensnare. A reduction of cast time to 0,5 or so and I'd be very happy with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And like some of you pointed out, its manaless, it can free a slot, not such a bad ability.<br />
<br />
I also understand the fact that haveing to be lvl 64 and spend 4 points for the same lvl 51 spell, sucks. It should be faster casting time. There is a earring that has manafree snare, if we wanted a mana-free snare, we would get the damn earring, why spend points?<br />
<br />
SoE sometimes has thier head up their butt when devolping things . Mana-free, plsu a extra spell slot for Rangers doesnt mean much, or atleast it doesnt mean much to me.<br />
<br />
Where's our new disc at? Wheres our new abilities to fix LoS issues? a lvl 65 Ranger should be able to shoot arrows and not have to worry about LoS issues. Come on think about it, a lvl 65 Ranger, should be accurate enough to shoot a arrow thru another persons legs and get the mob right where the sun dont shine:)<br />
<br />
Should have givin us something instead of a mana-free snare, sigh, will SoE ever get a clue?<br />

After fizzling snare half a dozen times in a row here and there, would be nice. And saving a spell slot, and saving mana.. overall I'd say if you normally use Ensnare, this is a smart investment.</div></div><hr />

I get 2-4% AA per mob when soloin in PoP atm, and still havn't even seen the exp in the higher tiers. And when grouped... the AA exp is simply amazing. *shrug* Manaless snare, something most rangers use every fight... easily worth 4AA pts.</div></div><hr />

I don't even want to think about what level druids get ensnare.<br />
<br />
Ranger...level 64 + what?  6+12+18+4 ? AA minimum?  it should be better.<br />

Ways to improve it:<br />

greater speed reduction<br />

Count me in.  I just saved up 4 pts thinking it was level 63 but no matter, aa's come quick.  And no fizzles and no mana?  All the better.

Yes, instant reuse on interupts. The PoP aa for rangers are weak and have no thought. GotF= poS with stupid wrong stacking issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Synernian</div><div class="date">11-19-2002, 09:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I agree that making it insta snare or a very low recast time would make it worth the points to a 64 ranger. As it goes for me I have never wonce had to stop to mem a different spell or not have enough slots for a spell except when buffing and then it doesn't matter what offensive spells i have up. As for mana free, ensare costs about 1 to 2% of my mana. As for fizzles, at 59 I can remember fizzling ensnare more than one time probably a total of 3 times since lvl 55. Personally I would spend my points on many other things than this. As for aggro abilities, its cool to be able to aggro a mob faster, but honestly how many times to i have to gain aggro on a mob as a ranger? Maybe once in a full day when we get too many and an add is on a chanter or cleric. And even then there is very very few times when I am not able to take the aggro off before the chanter/cleric dies. Personally I wont be investing in it when I reach 64 unless I am completely bored and have nothing better to put 4 aaxp points in. <br />

BTW thanks for bringing this up. It is a great help to know if an ability is worth it before you waste away 4 aa points. I hope they change it soon to make it much mroe useful for you since you have already invested in it =0)</div></div><hr />

Im L65 with 180+ wisdom, max casting skills, and had ensnare fizzle 4x in a row the other day twice in one hour.  I constantly have double and triple fizzles on it.   It is worth the aa just to not have the fizzles anymore when trying to pull a mob that runs close to SoW speed and your ensnare keeps fizzling.</div></div><hr />

 Now I am not sure if when you run 0m this happens but after a rez I tried to use this skill and i recieved the not enough mana to cast this spell, ***. So it seems to me that although it doesn't use mana to cast it; entrap does require you to have the mana to use;/</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I have tanked those, and I go OOM pretty quick. And when I'm OOM and try to use Entrap it gives me a &quot;Insufficient mana to cast that spell!&quot; message, even though it's an AA skill, not a spell.</div></div><hr />

they should make it<br />
1) a lure like save<br />
2) insta cast<br />

then you bet your sweet arse that every ranger and thier mother will buy it for 4 or 5 AA points. ATM though it is a total waste. Seriously, your guild will be happier that you got MGB then this POS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also for anyone who thinks the casting time should be lowered or instant does not understand how completey broken that would be.  look how much agro can be genterated by just one snare now think about poping it of 10 times in one sec because off it being instant.  look at all the rangers who use tangle weed just for this reason.<br />
<br />
In theory<br />
mob is pull ranger starts chain entrap &quot;insta cast entrap&quot;<br />
same time Debuff group starts fireing there spell because ranger has complete agro<br />
when mob gets to ranger they weaponshield and MT engages<br />
ranger gets CoTH second before WS wears off.  MT should have agro<br />
Mob losses it biggest chance to win by the loss of the time to  debuff them.<br />
<br />
also insta click can break pulling by pullng a bunch of mobs snaring quickly the ones you dont want and kite them untill they loss interste, leading to the solo pull of the mob you want<br />
<br />
Also if they make it produce no agro that leads to broken pulliing by snaring unwanted mobs befor the pull starts.<br />
<br />
Maybe there is a way to balance those two things but as of now i think Entrap is a bargan at only 4 points<br />

Why is this better then entrap? Because lets suppose you start casting ensnare and you get an interupt... this macro will start casting again for you. The macro also gets around the fizzling issue unless you fizzle five times in a row which probably happens once or twice a year. The only drawback is it still uses mana, but I prefer the ability to automatically recast after an interupt over saving 35 mana.<br />
<br />
If there were a way to macro AA abilities then I would switch to entrap immediately.<br />
<br />
Edit: One other thing that I like about this macro is if you hit it while the mob is OOR, it will catch and start casting at the exact moment that the mob comes into range.</div></div><hr />

Four AA for basicly an additional spell gem is awsome alone, not to mention manafree and no fizzles part. Having to have atleast one point of mana to start casting it needs to be fixed though.</div></div><hr />

Did anyone mention you can chain cast it because the refresh isnt working? *shhhhh*</div></div><hr />

Guess what?  There is.<br />
<br />
/alternateadv activate xxx<br />
<br />
..where xxx is the number of the AA ability.  Guardian of the Forest is 184.<br />
<br />
Basically, with the old UI, if you made an AA hotkey and ducked while it was casting, then scrolled up through the issued commands, it would show you the command line for your AA skill. ;)<br />
<br />
With a bit of fiddling, you could generate a list of all the available AA's and their code numbers.</div></div><hr />

Entrap is the next thing on my list to get now. I'm going to still use my 5 line macro with the command line you suggested. I have to wonder what other things I'm missing out on. Where did you learn that command?<br />
<br />
edit... I just thought of something. When I use innate cammo and it gets interupted, the timer still resets, so I have to wait 7 seconds to use it again. Is this the same case for Entrap? And if that's the case then it won't work the way I want my snare to work.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sean SpiritArrow</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 02:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, if you interupt it the timer resets to zero and you can use it again instantly. Odd that Innate Cammo works differently.</div></div><hr />

It interrupts it seems a bit when you are moving in the z as well as x and y. Basically the little IC button stays depressed for 7 seconds. Would be cool if it didn't do that, but 7 seconds isn't usually too bad of an issue.</div></div><hr />

Free spell slot, many many classes woudl kill to have invis and ensnare on a hotkey to free up slots.  There is no reason why any ranger shouldn't get this skill :)</div></div><hr />

It'll be the first PoP AA skill I purchase.  Convenience stuff like this is worth more to me that the (IMHO) very underpowered offensive abilities of PoP.  And 4aa is relatively cheap as easy as AA is now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arkus</div><div class="date">12-06-2002, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, these 4 points were some of the best aa points I ever spent.  My only problem now is figuring out how to rearrange my spells and getting used to my new hot keys.  I used to use Alt-3 to cast real snare, and just hot key 7 for a quick tangling weeds.  Now that I have that reversed I am constantly casting the wrong snare.  <br />
<br />
Does anyone know if Entrap can be interrupted?  I have only used it a few times when tanking and I never got interrupted.  My guess is I was just lucky, but I would like some collaboration.</div></div><hr />

Seriously though, while i certainly think it's a nice skill and on my list of abilities to get it's still quite a way down, below innate camo. I would just like it to be more class defining, yeah it saves a spellslot, but still, any druid or 52+ ranger will be able to do the job. It's not much i am asking for just a very tiny little improvement to make it better than ensnare.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You basically get a button that makes you cast the level 51 snare, only difference is it's manaless and can't fizzle.<br />
<br />
The same rules applies as any other spell. It can be interuppted, you can't cast while moving and so on.</div></div><hr />
