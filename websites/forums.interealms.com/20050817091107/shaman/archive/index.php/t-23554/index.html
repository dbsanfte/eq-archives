<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am not sure about the exact date, but aren't we coming up on the 5th anniversay of Ruins of Kunark?  I had heard a rumor about Exiled mobs (as opposed to Fabled).<br />
<br />
So, which mobs in Kunark do you think should be highlighted in the 5th anniversay celebration?<br />
<br />
&quot;Fabled&quot; Trakanon<br />
&quot;Fabled&quot; Chancellor of Di'Zok<br />
&quot;Fabled&quot; Lord Gorelik<br />
&quot;Fabled&quot; Grachnist the Destroyer<br />
&quot;Fabled&quot; Crusader Zoglic<br />
&quot;Fabled&quot; Hangman<br />
<br />
Ideas?  Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I kind of enjoyed the fabled mobs the first day, but sitting in a line of 15 people to kill a mob isnt fun for more than about 8 hours or so.<br />
<br />
Still, it would be nice to see something going on during the anniversary.  Kunark was a great expansion, and I have some great memmories of crawling through Dalnir and Kaesora for the first time.  I remember the first time I took a trip to DL: I had heard about this place called KC, and was going there to check it out.  Coming from the spire area, I agroed a yeti and a giant or 2 and proceded to die in the middle of nowhere.  3 chipped bone rods and 4 hours later I finally got my corpse back and that started a long, long hate relationship with DL.  I went back for exp twice there, but I never spent as much time there as some of my friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Kunark was such a great expansion.  Remember when just getting to a zone was a quest?  I remember as a young monk, hearing of special armor dropping in Dalnir and thinking that I could spend some time down there and grab it.  The very trip there to find that little cave was a quest in and of itself.  After several deaths and still not seeing any crescent armor I gave up.  It was many, many seasons later that I went in and destroyed the place, and saw my first crescent armor drop (long after it was useless).<br />
<br />
I remember the sarnak fort in LoIo, being asked to pull, and being absolutely terrified any time I walked into the hallways..for all I knew, that place was gigantic.  I remember running to the windmill and filling like I was safe on a small oasis in a sea of bad, bad things.<br />
<br />
Sorry to wax nostalgic; the whole expansion seemed done so well.  There was lore, the zones were well designed to go along with the lore, and it all basically made sense.  I'd love to see an event to go along with  it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Fabled Jade Chokidai Prod - add some more stats, better dmg ratio and maybe a proc.<br />

Fabled Ceremonial Iksar Breastplate - bump the AC, some more stats, up the Regeneration to Replenishment or something.<br />

This is one thing I'm glad is mostly long gone. I did a lot of hunting in CoM in my high 40's and early 50's and it wasn't even worth the time getting there if you didn't have 3-4 hours at least to spend there. <br />

I used to hate travel. If you wanted to go to Kaesora you were potentialy hosed. I used to hate travel. If you wanted to go to City of Mists you were potentially hosed. First you had to find a port to Dreadlands. It wasn’t so bad back then because many druids and wizards used to make cash porting people. Figure about 10 minutes to get a ride during peak times.<br />
<br />
Once in Dreadlands you had two options. If you were lucky and had a porter you could run through half of DL to Karnor’s Castle. If you were lucky not to run into a train long enough to port to Emerald Jungle you were almost done. Or you had to run the entire @#$% zone to get to Firiona Vie, and btw, DL is not a small zone either. If you had some form of SoW and Lev on it was not that bad of a trip through DL. Once in FV however the ride started getting bumpier! There you had the wonderful blessing of Frog shamans with SoW and lots of mobs that could see though invis. So you had to avoid all the see invis mobs because if one saw and hit you that meant trouble. The Shammies liked to make sure all of their buddies had SoW too!<br />
<br />
I don’t ever remember much trouble with Swamp of No Hope in spite of it’s nasty assumed name! But it led to two nasty choices, Field of Bones or Trakanon’s Teeth. Each had their downsides. TT you had to worry the same worries as you did in FV. Or FoB there were guards who were blue to lvl 55 characters with SoW and if you were headed to CoM you were under 55!<br />
<br />
Emerald Jungle was pretty safe, not too much with SoW so even if you were seen you could out run pretty much anything and pray that someone was not training the zone in inside of CoM.<br />
<br />
There was nothing like running all the way to CoM to get smacked down by a train and have to make the @#$% trip again if there was not a cleric there to rez you!<br />
<br />
You also have to remember that this all happened in the time before in game maps. So everything you did, you did by loc’s! I still have some of my hand made maps on graph paper with important loc’s written down to help me get around.<br />
<br />
So yeah the game may have seemed a whole lot bigger and a whole lot whatever… back then but a lot of time was wasted (and I do mean wasted) with useless, pointless, annoying, @#$% travel.<br />
<br />
I for one cheer the invent of the portals!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't need the extra hour.  That was part of the game.  I did not (and do not) count my time played by the number of mobs I kill, the exp or the loot I receive.  Getting there was part of the fun.<br />
<br />

The greatest expansion ever is just a stagnating backwater that no amount of temporary &quot;fabled&quot; would help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Loved all the runs. I was in Paw at level 3.<br />

From Halas.<br />
<br />
I spent half my life it seemed in Kaesora. Or chardok. Some Seblis. Lots of Karnors. Overthere.<br />
<br />
Howling stones. Never a better place. Evil in the extreme and if you went you went with your combat boots on. Ready for pain. <br />
<br />
I ran to Seblis just the other day. A new person couldnt find it. With a downloaded map. I recited From memory exactly how to get there with landmarks. <br />
<br />
1st time or the 700th time. It feels more like a world. Lke an adventure is waiting to happen if the content was made correctly. (**** needs to change. Zones need to change and evolve spawn patterns. ) If they took every single old zone in the game and Set it up so once a week the spawns would change to a variation of spawns 5 levels higher. Till you reach double the intended level then cycled back to original Or they had events worth doing for all comers. (Complete a LDON rescue get a tell from the Gnome that was trapped to meet you in The overthere under the Iksar statue and he has a job for you in warsilk woods. It seems some goblins from Gracnist's brood had hired the Orcs to kidnap him. and he wants revenge. Hand him this pendant so that he can summon up the power to make them pay. Then once you do it he Spawns Alt monster set 1 in Warsilk where you can go exact his retribution for him. With him as a pet attached to Someone. ) <br />
<br />
Boom travel is needed once again. People who have learned the zones will prosper and everyone else will download the spoilers to go after it as well.<br />
Do this in every damn zone in the game. Make adventure come back into the game. Not marching armies after the next peice of loot. <br />
<br />
But I guess more people want an arcade game rather than a world. They want encounters rather than adventure. And they want thir little cookie cutter Sword of uberosity_001 rather than something that has meaning to them and thier friends. <br />
<br />
Some day someone will make that game. And I am pretty damn sure it ain't gonna be SoE. They are too damn clueless.<br />

<br />
You can drop me anywhere in misty thicket and with in 10 steps I know exactly where I am. I can do this for a lot of zones but misty is where I came into this world and is where I plan on going out at! (&lt;--makes it obvious that my first character was not a shammy) ;) I also spent a huge percentage of my play time deep in the bottom of some dungeon. I loved the crawl that the old world had.<br />
<br />
How ever that being said, no way on this green Earth could you get me to go back to old world travel.  Running someplace to get to your actual play time is not playing. When you are in your group and dont have any crowd control, everyone is half mana and your puller gets a multi multi pull and it all comes down to good teamwork for you pull it through or not. That is fun, running for 2 hours is not!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Travel on Kunark was easy as pie... If you were lucky enough to bind in the firepots before they nerfed it. I tell ya, nothing made people's jaws drop like seeing [32 Shaman] Gandwer &lt;Raging Fury&gt; Zone: Cabilis west back in the day.<br />
<br />
Screw fabled mobs, I want Kunark instanced zones - Kaesora, Howling Stones, Dalnir's, and Chardok. Maybe one of the outdoor zones could be instanced. How would you all like to see Swamp of No Hope have an instanced option, eh?<br />
<br />
But nobody ever listens to me.<br />
<br />
Look for - Fabled Xalgoz, fabled Garg Oberboard, Fabled Bandit Warlord, Fabled Paduck Whatever (tree weave giant), and a few fabled mobs in Sebilis, Karnor, and Howling Stones. I largely expect the &quot;revamped&quot; zones to be left alone, with the possible exception of City of Mist. I also expect that some of the &quot;cycle&quot; mobs in DL, FM, Swamp of No Hope, Trakanon's Teeth, and Emeerals Jungle will have a few items as well. Don't be looking for fabled Trak, VS / VSR, or King / Queen. Similarly, expect minor / class quests to be screwed severely. And, of course - Giant blue skeletons charge all four corners of Cabilis, only to be ripped to shreds by the level 52 guards that could solo Mith Marr!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hah I have been powerleveling a friend up in Kaesora. I love that place. <br />
<br />
I was in there a few days ago and Some nice folks were so scared and lost. So I marched down and gave the the tour of the place. Letting them know about how the place was laid out.  Helped them with a few fights and generally made a couple new friends. <br />
<br />
They asked how I new so much about it. I told them I fell down the spider well At level 30 The first day of the Kunark expansion. And me and my friend needed to get our bodies back. So I had to learn. And learn fast. <br />
<br />
God damn those were the times. Exploration with no maps. No spoilers. And no damn clue how you were going to make it out of there alive. I rode eyes on the Vision line till I spotted corpse with the gear then floated down invis Drageed my boddy up halfway. Then friend caught it on the fall and got it the rest of the way up after a couple tries. I died like 17 times that day perfecting it. <br />
<br />
And along the way learned that the vision spell is a subtle and incredible way to scout a dungeon.<br />
<br />
I never looked at is as running there to get the fun started. Hell with my friends half the fun was getting there. Poor Fabia could get lost in 3 steps. <br />
<br />
Another friend got lost in west karanas I asked him what he saw. He said a rock. Near a steep hill.  I said I would be right there and ran directly to him. He still talks about that to this day. (Smiles) Part of the game was learning the enviroment. Nowadays the enviroment is simply window dressing.<br />
<br />
The game has lost something wonderful along the way. <br />

<br />
I like the idea of rotating spawn levels, forcing people to move and learn new areas. Even better might be a quest to force a zone to spawn a particular way that would be appropriate to the group that wants to hunt there. The party does a turn in, and attract the attention of higher level mobs who move to the zone to investigate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I wonder how much of the &quot;magic&quot; of the orignial game was simply because it was our first encounter in a game like this. Could anything really re-create the first time?<br />
<br />
<br />
You nailed it right there. <br />
<br />
I was not a D&amp;D kind of guy but a buddy got into a early beta and kept goading me to apply to the beta so I did. I got in and was hooked! I still cuss him from time to time for getting me addicted!<br />
<br />
I was really good FPS kind of guy always have been probably always will be (I hope), but watching him fight giant spiders and bears and all the other cool stuff in the BETA rocked. I was drawn in. I had to apply! I loved the fact that there were a ton of other real players in this huge and beautiful world. I had never seen anything like it!<br />
<br />
For me it was great the first time I popped my head out of misty thicket to do some exploring and wound up in the gorge and saw my first minotaur… made the entire game worth it imho! My first trip across the ocean, incredible! My first trip to a dungeon (najena), Breathtakingly Scary! The first time I ran into Naggy I about had a stroke and I would have died a happy man.<br />
<br />
I took time off for work every time an expansion was released (up to LoY) to explore and see the new places. I truly have loved this game, but alas now I am a jaded ol’ man who will never find the pleasure and excitement that the game used to bring me and I have to find fun with the friends who still play when they can!<br />
<br />
There will never be another “first” for me in EQ and thus the luster has worn off of my once shiny coin!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">No new game has been able to recreate the same feeling eq did when I first started it. Maybe Vanguard will. Though hopefully it does not involve too many time intensive activities. I do remember staying up till 7am on a Vox Raid for corpse runs, it was fun the first time but then the corpse runs just completely sucked.  Travelling is another thing. Travelling used to be very tedious, especially when the logic of which zones joined to which was not very good. (I mean if there was a map like Asherons Call 2 with the zones of eq it would be a good combination.)<br />
Though in eq I don't think it should have been reduced to gravestone styled portstones for travel. Perhaps a better idea could have been a druid style area, which could have automated travel to druid portals. Or perhaps it could have been done sololy by more travel potions and spiritstones.(including for melee classes)<br />
<br />
As an additional point, I don't think raiding is bad. I think specializing equipment, abilities and spells for raiding would have been better than how eq has done it. This way, it does not alter the balance of standard group play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Helzik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Aye, much of the magic of the good old days came from experiencing a type of gameplay that we had never experienced before.  But that certainly did not stop us from complaining about the inconveniences and suggesting improvements.<br />
<br />
Like many others, I loved the adventure of old-style travel to distant lands at first.  But the long waits for boats, the long boat rides, and the long stretches on auto-run became tiresome after a while.  I thought the Nexus spires were a great idea when they arrived, and of course I now use PoK as Norrath Central Station.<br />
<br />
I have a thought (probably not new) about PoK stone travel.  What if you had to travel by non-PoK means to a book and use it once in order to &quot;unlock&quot; the corresponding stone in PoK for future use?  That would force you to make the initial journey at least once to see the sights and perhaps experience some danger.  Who knows?  You might see something interesting, learn something new, or simply have some fun along the way.<br />
<br />
I am a casual, non-power gamer and I think I would enjoy doing it this way.  But I'm sure it would still be viewed as an unecessary inconvenience by many.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Yeah its a thought in other games. For example, I'm not sure if its Earth and Beyond but once you come across a teleporter you could use it. Instead of this, perhaps in future games it could be like say you go to OS 5 times. You then gain a bonding with the place and can tp straight there. Or perhaps as you gain experience in a dungeon you earn the rights to use a porter, like a faction based reward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I don't know if you guys remember but they tried this once already and people hated it.<br />
<br />
In velious in order to be ported to the rings you had to first travel there and pick up a tooth. Once you had the tooth you could be ported there. It was kind of cool for porting classes after everyone had their teeth. If they were porting for cash they could just leave their tooth for the portals in the bank and cast the spell, who ever had the tooth went and the porter would stay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Niw,<br />
<br />
See, though, there were some pretty big hurdles there. Getting the Great Divide key was easy enough. For the Wakening Lands key, you had to hope and pray that Wuoshi was not up. And Cobalt scar... HAH! Siren's, Dragon Necropolis, and Western Wastes used to be &quot;uber&quot; zones, just because you either had to kill a hell of a lot of giants to get the faction to do the quest, or you had to go to Skyshrine and get the key off the Captain's cold dead scales.<br />
<br />
Now, compared to this, I think that a simple city-to-city quest of some sort to access port stones is childs play.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I'm torn about whether going back to the old way would solve anything.  On the one hand, I'll never ever forget my entire guild rallying (my little kunark guild) because some ranger I'd never met had lost his corpse deep in Droga (old droga).  All, like, 12 of us stormed in there and laid waste - that was the happiest little naked ranger I ever saw.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, there was my monk friend, who'd lost his connection while the guild was in Kael, and had died a dozen times the next day pulling it a few feet at a time toward the zone (remember when they broke FD?), and then making the 45 minute run back to do it again, by the time I logged on with my little druid to get it with him in 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
A lot of the agony was taken out, but we also lost a lot of the possibility for heroism, and heart-warming helping of people in dire straits.  Nothing dire is going to happen with graveyard zones.  But then again, knowing that you somehow have to help that guildie get their corpse, when she died 2 steps from the zoneout in the bottom of Dalnir when you're all level 35?  Not something I ever really want to do again...<br />
<br />
Yeah, I'm torn about what's better.  I WANT things to be easier, but it really does cheapen things.  Now if I could just convince my bf of that every time our little newbie iksar die horribly and he wants to go to the bazaar and buy gear.  :P</div></div><hr />
