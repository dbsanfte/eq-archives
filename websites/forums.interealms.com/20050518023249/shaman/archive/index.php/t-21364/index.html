<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vandal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Played a shaman to 58 2 years ago, looking to get back in the game...Should I play a shaman again, or what would be the funnest class to start now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">depends on you as a person, theres no one really fun class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Telosk hit it on the head.....the high end game as it stands now though basically is catering to chanters, clerics and warriors, the rest are basically fillers for a group...unless there are major changes to GoD, the new expansion out in a few months, Omens of War, may well cause a veritable hemmorage of players.<br />
If your interested in just banging around, enjoying the game and not interested in seeing Time (but really, who isnt interested?) then play what looks interesting, fun, or whatever you can gear up easy....FYI beastlords, necros and mages can be damn near naked and do quite well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vandal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Beastlord eh...basically I don't want to pick a totally broken class.  I also loved my shaman but don't really want to go though all the same quests again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
News flash. They are all broke.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously, none can decide something like this. You need to man up and decide whats best for yourself, otherwise you will most likely not like it down the road since someone picked it for you.  Make sense?<br />
<br />
Good, now go forth and spread the word.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Have you considered City of Heroes?<br />
<br />
Great game, lots of fun, most everyone is also low level and learning the game still, and there's no worries over which gear to get/twink with or whether someone KS's and loots your mob.<br />
<br />
Restarting EQ today, I'd probably recommend a necromancer, beastlord, or an enchanter... possibly a ranger or rogue depending on what you want to put into it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fibonacci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you list some of the things you liked or disliked about your shaman that would be a big help for us to help you.</div></div><hr />

Don't Mana Regen? You'll miss it...<br />
Don't Have good DPS? You'll miss it...<br />
<br />
etc etc etc, repeat adnausm...<br />
<br />
I would personally only make a Shaman Or Bard simply because they are very versatile and don't die at the drop of a hat...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">if it's fun you want then I've got one word for you... Bard<br />
<br />
I've created one as an alt just for fun. I've solo'd my way to 18 just doing aoe kiting. The risk v's reward is crazy. I love my Shaman, but when you kite 20+ mobs that con yellow-red to you it's such a rush. ;)<br />
<br />
I've no plans to make my Bard my main, but I do enjoy just grabing a bunch of mobs and kiting them down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Budana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have a 65 shaman with a little over a 100 AA.  I would say 70 or so of those AA come from PoV, BoT, and HoH.  My brother started a druid a little after me and is well over 200 AA now from those same zones.  They are a very strong class for Heals, DD, Snare, Dire Charm, and Charm.  If you are looking for a class that will level quickly and get required AA's for a decent guild that is probably your best choice IMO.  Groups always need a healer if they already have one a druids DD is almost as good as a mage and in the right zones their DC is better than a Mag/Beast/Necro pet any day.  If you play off hours you can easily solo better than just about any class with all the tools they have.  All of this is if you feel the need to get caught up to the rest of the game as quickly as possible and have a character that can stack on raids.  If you’re back just to have fun make any class that has some form of self heals because at the lower levels it can be tuff to find groups.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As a person and at different stages of the game, I think everyone has different urges to what kind of class they want to play. So taking on this mindset;<br />
If you fancy playing a class that can hide, sneak and is effectively hasslefree then pick a rogue.<br />
If you fancy a class that can feign death and can tank then pick a sk.<br />
If you fancy a class that can port anywhere then choose a druid or Wizard.<br />
If you fancy a class that has a lot of similar spells to shaman but with added melee and offensiveness then choose Beastlord.<br />
If you fancy a class that could be challenging and versatile to play then choose bard.<br />
If you fancy the role of a warrior then choose warrior.<br />
If you fancy being able to rez then consider cleric or paladin.<br />
If you fancy having the versatility of tools for using on the undead choose Necro.<br />
If you fancy having a powerful pet then choose mage, necro or beastlord.<br />
If you fancy playing the role of crowdcontrol, or want to try charming then try bard or enchanter.<br />
Are you looking for a class strong in groupability, soloability, or partner/trioability. <br />
Or do you fancy twinking a class up?- in that case, melees are probably the most twink-friendly.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think I played all classes and they had all their advantages/disadvantages. If I am allowed to break up by level, then funwise I enjoyed druid/rogue to mid30s, and shaman/ranger/enchanter to 50s.(although I played shaman to 65-but I found 1-60 the funnest) (Additional Note I levelled up 2 rangers and shaman(s). so they were probably my personal favourites)<br />
<br />
Also, personally, I can say what I did not enjoy playing too, I did not enjoy playing tank classes or pure melee. I tried a couple of those classes at level 65 with betabuff and never found their fun, however, some people enjoy them immensely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I recently started a Human Mage and a Gnome Necro. I've been going a bit back and forth between them before I decide which one I want to stick with for a while. The best part of this is that all my gear works on either one so I just toss in in the shared bank when I want to play the other.</div></div><hr />

Sonofa! Necros have all that too...bastards :)<br />
<br />
*disclaimer -- this is not a class envy post*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Esquel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Beastlord if you want to keep the old shaman feeling, although I admit Necros pretty much have it all.  Honestly though ever class board is full of 'grass is greener' attitude so go with what interests you most.  I don't know of any class whose boards are happy about their current state.  I suspect some of that has to do with fear of being nerfed if they really did admit just how powerful their class was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vandal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Really awesome posts guys!  Really appreciate the incite...thinking bard maybe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Vittra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I twinked a bard and its not exactly easy to play.<br />

Its quite easy to get carpel tunnel syndrome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>LachdanonColdpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">A necro has all of these  :p<br />

True, but necros die 10x in a row if you land a single hit =)</div></div><hr />

ACK! You should definitely use macros. Make a macro for each song that has 2 lines like this:<br />
<br />
/stopsong<br />
/cast 1<br />
<br />
That will cut your keystrokes in half immediately. Then, if you value laziness &gt; effectiveness, you can cut keystrokes in half again by making a 4-song twist that only takes 2 keystrokes. Here is the setup:<br />
<br />
Macro 1-<br />
/stopsong<br />
/pause 30, /cast 1<br />
/stopsong<br />
/cast 2<br />
<br />
Macro2-<br />
/stopsong<br />
/pause 30, /cast 3<br />
/stopsong<br />
/cast 4<br />
<br />
Now you have a 4-song twist with only 2 keystrokes! Of course, fizzles will make this inefficient, so I use 4 macros normally, and switch to the 2 macros only when fingers tired.</div></div><hr />
