<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zokof</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
Thinking of starting a Shaman and am interested in doing an Inny Troll so that I can quest the snare necklace later on.  <br />
<br />
Do the troll shamans out there think the exp penalty of the troll is worth the snare and regen?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Absolutely!  Having snare is invaluble.  Even at 62 I use it plenty; soloing in PoG, soloing in Seb, even in PoP groups if snare is needed and we don't have it.  Its not the end-all, be-all of being a shaman; plenty of shamans do without it.  It is a very strong argument for going troll though.  And trolls &gt; all other races anyway. :D  Especially those stinkin frogs &amp; cats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm.... well to be honest, initially before I got to lvl 57, I was cursing about  choosing da troll as it was much slower to level than the Barb I use to have a few years back.<br />
<br />
But not anymore. I just lurv being a troll shammy and we have very good hps and regen not to mention we also look darn cool on a leezard! :)<br />
<br />
I do not notice myself leveling slowly anymore and in fact I out level so many people, they all keep asking me how the hell I out level them. Did 58 to 61 in about 6 days, doing all of lvl 60 in less than 11 hours real time cause I had zero lvl 60 spells lol.<br />
<br />
I found that having a leezard and canni = ungodly mana when you want it and am nearly always fm using Stoism ( /hugs the spell lovingly) is so fun to keep chirping FM while the KEIed cleric and chanter are at 50% mana lol ( I have a 61 necro and me shammy beats her hands down in mana regen and I dun even have Canni 5 yet)<br />
<br />
But at the end, it's really your decision. And about the snare necklace .... well sorry I can't help there cause I chose CT when I made me troll and only after getting to lvl 30+ did I find out I had the wrong diety to get the necklace /cry<br />
<br />
Echeebum<br />
Torv<br />

PS Another advantage is being one of the very few troll shammies around, you will be remember easily :)</div></div><hr />

if this is soupy is pretty sad heh <br />
would also have to change my vote to keeping him banned</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm a CT troll too, I never had the snare necklace and to be honest I didn't miss it. I think the other plus points of being a troll (regen, looks cool) are worth the xp penalty.<br />
<br />
I'm the kind of player that doesn't really watch my xp bar that closely though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Halycona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm a CT troll too so no snare necklace but the innate regen was great :) Lower levels it makes a huge difference but I've still noticed eveyr little helps at high end game as someone fungi less with no torpor or stoicism. <br />
To see how infuriating it is without regen get a level 10 ogre shaman and a level 10 troll shaman whack them down to low hp and wait and see who's ready for uptime ;) I hate playing my other characters without regen now hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What exp penalty???????<br />
<br />
With amazing cheap gear, fungi tunics, KEI, and 2-box madness is levelling even hard anymore? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you like playing an evil race, then I’d say a troll is a fine choice.  And if your going to play a troll you may as well pick the god that allows his followers to use the handy dandy little snare necklace.  For myself, I don’t like playing evil races.  It’s just not my style.  Even my gnome necromancer is doing faction quests night and day so that every NPC in Norrath will like him.  So when I decided to play a shaman I chose to play a Vah Shir.  I think the kitties look really cool and I don’t have to worry about the guards in my favorite cities trying to lop my fuzzy little head off.   I miss having snare, especially after playing two snaring classes to 51, but having to play a troll wouldn’t be worth it to me.  Play what race you think you’ll have the most fun with.  If that race happened to be a troll then the necklace is icing on the cake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I love playing a troll.  CT worshipper, which gives no benefits that I know of (may help faction Cabilis, maybe.  never had that much time to kill)<br />
<br />
The snare necklace would be a plus.  I never missed it, and flew through 51 to 60 faster than anyone else in my guild (except the guy who lost his job and played full time - hehehehe).<br />
<br />
And if you level up fast, it does not matter what race you are.  Like blending in to the crowd, play  a Barb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Inny Troll 4 life<br />
<br />
Snare necklace is just bad ass...even at 65 i use it when no snarer...only lasts 30secs...but mobs dont last that long when fleeing even at 65 grind spots so the snare works perfect</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I didn't know about necklace until way into my Troll and he worships wrong god.  Wish I woulda known cus snare would have been great to have all this time.<br />
<br />
:)&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The exp ammounts to when a barb is full 60 your a 4/5 the way through 59... its not that bad ;)  And officially your regen pays for that and everything else is just gravy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If I don't want it to run, I root it.  Sure, snare is better, and I'd rather have it than not, but the functionality of the class isn't truly changed by snare neck (IMO).  So I don't think it's worth it STRICTLY for snare, because I also hate exp penalties with a passion.<br />
<br />
Factor in regen though, and you have a close match.  If I were starting today with pop and the fact that &quot;evil&quot; faction is completely trivial now, I'd probably have made a troll.  Like trading out the fungi for tae ew - that regen is something you really don't notice till it's gone, and you have to make a little more effort to torpor and canni that mana back, rather than just sitting and firing off the occasional canni.<br />

Troll is #1 on my list in terms of the lazy factor.  :)</div></div><hr />
