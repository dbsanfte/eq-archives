<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Clerics get rez, which should be considered miraculous, but is pretty commonplace in Norrath. Druids get to stop the rain. Wizzies get to manaburn dragons, which is a wrath of god sort of thing. <br />

Avatar? Not really that much of awe-inspiring sight, since the targets are near maxed-out in stats anyway. Grow/Shrink are more for amusement or utility, not really anything that makes the zone shout in awe. So what spell makes us look like a god?</div></div><hr />

I still say slow. Yes Enchanters can slow, but trust me, they don't want to. Just like I have no desire to haste the melee.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yup its Turgur's Insects. People are always amazed how effective this spell really is. Easily one of the 3 most powerful spells in the game imho.</div></div><hr />

You'd be surprised what a robe can tank when the mobs are slowed.... really surprised.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, when my chanters get aggro they're always like &quot;wow, im not dead.  I wuv shammies!&quot;<br />
<br />
I also have a necro friend who soloed a dragon construct by slowing it and tanking it.  I didn't believe him until he showed me :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Torpor is kinda kewl. <br />
Canni5 is awfully nice, but normally has the &quot;Oh **** our shammy is dying!&quot; effect rather than people thinking I am a god or whatever.  <br />
Slow is definitely game changing, but so many classes can do it these days . . . kinda loses its edge.  Chanter max slow is only like 3% less than our max slow, so really I don't consider this the biggest thing we have to offer.  <br />
<br />
In my considered opinion, the best thing we have to offer is a savings of groups spots.  Yes, with me along we can forget the cleric or the chanter (in almost every place) and get some other class instead that contributes more damage.  I offer a greater flexibility of group possibilities.  I can literally take any 5 people of any five classes who AREN'T all druids and wizards and make them into an elite fighting force.  <br />
<br />
Also being able to duo Lodizal is kinda kewl.  Not sure if the old standby cleric/warrior combo can accomplish that too.  I kinda doubt it.  I duoed Lodi last night with a 56 warrior in average gear, on short notice of course since he's dead as soon as he pops anyhow.  As it was we were only seconds ahead on engaging him from another larger force who had to sit back and watch us.  Thank goodness they did cause they coulda KSed us easily.  I think the PnP is finally getting understood.  Anyway, grats me on turtle belt, that'll get sold.</div></div><hr />

(True story)<br />
<br />
Tiger: I'm bored..hey Csin wanna duel?<br />
<br />
Me: Sure Monkey Boy..bring it on..we've got a cleric.<br />
<br />
* Tiger challenges you to a duel to the death!*<br />
*You have accepted blah blah blah*<br />
<br />
Csin Begins to Cast a spell<br />
Tiger Yawns.<br />
<br />
*You stab tiger for 75, You stab tiger for 68, You stab tiger for 36, Tiger is ravaged by the spirits of the land*<br />
<br />
N00bishCleric: Hey Tiger! Why aren't you hitting him? Why don't you hit back?<br />
<br />
Tiger: OMG..I'm slowed as Sh&amp;@!<br />
<br />
Csin grins evilly<br />
<br />
Tiger: OMG this sux!<br />
<br />
N00bishCleric: LOL<br />
<br />
Csin: I think Tiger is gonna need a rez.<br />
<br />
*Tiger is rooted*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Class Defining spell? Group Charisma.<br />
<br />
On a serious note - Slow.<br />
<br />
Csin City - Tiger is an idiot. We had a 60 Monk duel a 60 Shaman on Xev.<br />
<br />
Shaman dead in 9 seconds. (Inner Flame and good weapons).<br />
<br />
GOOD Shaman can do a lot. <br />
<br />
Things a GOOD Shaman DOESN'T Do:<br />
<br />
1) Refuse to Cannabalize<br />
2) Ride the Bracer<br />
3) Slow then sit and med.<br />
<br />
A GOOD Shaman DOES:<br />
<br />
1) Inquire about his class <br />
2) Slow's, Buffs, heals, DOTS, <br />
3) IS NOT AFRAID TO USE HIS PET.<br />
<br />
&quot;Adds? Great - I'll root and slow em, you guys mow them down.&quot;<br />
4) Is the master of flexibility<br />
5) Is aware of their limitations<br />
<br />
Note (imo) the latter 5 apply to all classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I actually paced back quite a bit before I accepted the dual..and we were both low 50's at the time (think i was just 52.)<br />
<br />
Be nice...it was a pickup duel..for fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">these days everyones immune to spells, with like 200 in all resists :/<br />
<br />
