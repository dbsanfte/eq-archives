<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Laproaigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Monk out of those too... Depending on circumstances a necro/sk/pally/rogue/enchanter will outperform the monk but warrior is pretty much never the best choice.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Out of genuine curiosity, Why a Monk?<br />
<br />
I would ~think~ that a warrior would be a better tank and fairly capable damage dealer. What am I missing? (assuming very little twinkage)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A warrior's main attribute is tanking with higher AC and high HP. Since you are duoing, you will be mostly fighting blues and the higher AC is not as helpful (monks tank blues very well). The high HP is not helpful either since shaman can't Complete Heal. Throw in FD for pulling/splitting, 25% heal every 6 minutes (mend), 20% more damage output and now you start to understand why a monk is a better duo than a warrior for a shaman.<br />
<br />
As others have mentioned, monks may not be the best duo overall, but monks are excellent partners and definately better duo for shaman over a warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">M O N K ! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Monk is a vastly superior damage dealer.  The fact that you say the duo will be untwinked seals the deal.  The shaman's biggest weakness solo is damage dealing, and the monk compliments that perfectly.  With slows, tanking is not nearly as important and monks are roughly equivalent to warriors in tanking in non-/defensive situtions anyway.  <br />
<br />
The monk also brings utility to the duo (mend saves a significant amount of mana over the long haul and fd iis very useful both to break spawns and as an escape when things go wrong)  The only thing a warrior brings to this duo is a ton of hit points and a taunt button, and max hit points are irrelevant to xping if you do not have someone casting complete heal (which is why clerics make good duo partners with warriors) and taunt is not a problem with monk damage output and root.<br />
<br />
In short, the shaman is an almost brokenly overpowered defensive soloist with some offense, and the monk is an almost brokenly overpowered offensive soloist with good defense.  Together, wowza.<br />
<br />
Necros, as mentioned, are a nice choice as are rogues (albiet higher maintenance).  Rangers are also quite good.  Basically, look for damage.  SKs and Pallies (particularly at high levels) bring some nice tools but, like warriors, do significantly less damage than rogues, monks and rangers.  This is not to say that a duo with a warrior (or even a non-necro caster) won't work, of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">That makes sense.<br />
<br />
Thank you for explaining it to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Renendor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Dont discount high level pallies.  Wave of prexus, heals, lotsa extra hp buffs for canning, LoH, plenty of aggro, stuns, spell procs, Soulfire CHs, and they can self celestial heal or be torpored.  Monks certainly have the better damage table come 60 but its always nice to have someone keeping You alive...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I only see monk as a mending-machine.<br />
<br />
That's why I love them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Laproaigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Actually the nicest thing about pallies is that you can hunt in areas where mobs regularly gate. SKs have the advantage of snare for those of us that don't worship Innoruuk.<br />
<br />
They'll never be as efficient as a monk or a necro but for utility purposes it may be nice. I usually duo with a pally. Many dungeons have these assigned camps which you're supposed to hold with your group and they're rarely enough for our damage output anyway. And the best PP camps in the game include gating and/or CHing mobs, stun comes in handy..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mikshal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I duo with a 60 monk and i feel like i was a good pet =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Aqualungg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">for a longterm partner id take a ranger over a monk, out of pure laziness.  <br />
ranger can sow himself, invis himself, can single pull outdoor zones with harmony, and can snare.  And their dmg output isnt all that far behind a monks.  and top end, rangers can do hideous amounts of dmg with their AA bow skills.<br />
<br />
but, in your case, monk is probably the best bet.  youll get a lot more mileage out of an untwinked monk than any other character type.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well, my main partner for a LONG time has beeen a pally.  <br />
I've tried several combos, and, to be honest, monk is near the bottom of my list. <br />
<br />
If I had to rate them (from most preferable to least):<br />
<br />
Paladin<br />
Ranger<br />
SK<br />
Warrior<br />
Monk<br />
Rogue<br />
*Insert pure caster here*<br />
<br />
Warriors I've been so-so on.  They can dish it out and take it like no tomorrow, but with SO many HPs, it can be a pain to heal them (especially since I don't have Torpor yet).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Spraggon-Test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think any class could be a great duo outside with a shaman, indoors however I would pick a monk, then SK probably. (feign death pulling is just too handy, gives you access to sooo many more places as a duo)<br />
<br />
Warrior<br />
-More HP<br />
-Can take a beating<br />
-Can pull with a bow :P<br />
-Fatty or Barb has Bash, interrupts casters<br />
<br />
Monk<br />
-Doesn't get hit as often as warrior (Max Dodge:  Warrior 175, Monk 230)<br />
-Mend (free 25% hp heal ever 6 minutes)<br />
-Feign Death pulling, you will go to more places with a monk than you'll ever be able to do with a warrior.<br />
-Getting out of bad pulls (you can leave the monk alone, most likely he'll be able to Feign death after your gated, warrior would be screwed)<br />
-Damage Output is much higher than Warrior, so mob dies faster<br />
-With slows HPs aren't as big of a concern because the mob gets fewer swings<br />
-Two previous items make it so you have to heal less overall.<br />
-CR is a lot easier (add a res stick from Vox on top of that and its even better)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>bearknukl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">not sure if the &quot;monks don't get hit as often as warriors&quot; thing applies because usually monks aren't getting hit in larger groups because they are not taunting.  But if AC stands for damage avoidance than i'd think a warrior would stand the chance of better not getting hit.  but that doesn't mean i have a preference either way.  Shaman's are engines, slap us to the back of any class and we make it better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes Shaben, you can but you need two of them.  One that is full charges one that you need to recharge.  (or something like that, its been a while and my monk friend knows it better than I do.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its not a huge difference, but Monks can dodge more often than warriors as they have a higher cap:<br />
<br />
Warrior 175 Dodge<br />
Monk     230 Dodge<br />
<br />
All other defensive skills are comparable between each other and have the same skill level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Monks get hit less than warriors when tanking for sure, just duo a warrior and then a monk, you will most likely not have to heal the monk but the warrior will drain your mana (this is based on xp group mobs). When a monk does get hit they tend to get hit hard and inconsistantly which is why a warrior is better as a raid tank as their hps drop more smoothly than a monk thus making heal timing far easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Tohlagos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The monk parnter I've grouped with was like a buzz-saw through mobs.  Give him some buffs and off he went.<br />
<br />
We always have a great time.<br />
<br />
Interesting to hear about the paladin, I'll have to find one and try it out.<br />
<br />
Aye, ranger is great with snare,  my dots love him/her too.   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Tohlagos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Oh, and a bard rocks.  Very flexable with songs.  They have dots that stack with ours and you just watch the mobs die.  Down time is very low with their regen song stacking with regrowth.  And they do get track and a snare song as well.  yum yum!<br />
<br />
Enchaters can also be cool to group with.  Mana is usually not to much of a problem and they do have dots and decent DD's.  But, down side is of course the agro thing and low hps on the chanty.<br />
