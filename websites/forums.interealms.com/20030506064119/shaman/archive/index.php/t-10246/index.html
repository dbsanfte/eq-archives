<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Time to seek advice I think - I have recently gone back to playing my Shaman, and he's at level 41 now. Some of his gear is ok for that level, some of it sucks.<br />
<br />
The question is, with an upgrade budget of maybe 5k, what should I be looking for? And those boots have GOT to go - but what would be a nice upgrade? JB Boots are rarely seen on my server...<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any advice :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ThatDumbGuy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First thing I would do is drop the jasper ring and pick up another velium fire wedding ring.<br />
<br />
Then I would get rid of the earrings, and get black sapphire electrum earrings, similar wisdom (well, maybe abit less), a wee bit less AC, but decent HP.<br />
<br />
I would keep my eye out for JB Boots, most definitely, and JB Arms. Ghetto, but the solid AC makes it worth it. If you can't find a pair or don't want one, Crystal Chitin Armplates are decent, if abit expensive at this point.<br />
<br />
Leaf Scale Gloves aren't much of an upgrade, but they go for 100 plat on my server, if that. You might also consider shissar scaled gauntlets, crystal chitin gauntlets, or coldain skin gloves.<br />
<br />
Crystal Spider Eyes would be worth looking into for your face. Under 1k on my server.<br />
<br />
I really don't know how you prioritize, but hopefully I've given you a few ideas. Good luck.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: Actually, screw all that. If you have 5k already, sell yer tin mail shirt and buy a Ceremonial Iksar Chestplate (Ikky BP). If ya have money left over, the items I listed above are cheap upgrades. If you can get a friend to help you with the Kromrif Military Leggings and Coldain Military Wristguard quest, that would be outstanding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For boots, work on your epic and get black fur ones.  Or look for a pair of barbed dragonscale, they have pretty good hp and stamina on them (can't remember numbers off hand).  Otherwise, just try to get in on some kael raids (might need a few levels), and shoot for a new pair of boots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Garror Frostroar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If it was me, I would sell my boots, velium jasper ring, northman bracer, and my earrings.<br />
<br />
For the bracer get another chipped bone bracer (cheap and decent, sure you lose AC but you gain wis and maybe a lil cash) replace the earrings with 25hp 35mana ones or the 35hp 25mana up to you. Boots and ring will be tough with your budget but try to get coldain skin boots and a shadel bandit ring, awsome items.<br />
<br />
Those are just some of my ideas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Were it me I'd be looking for items with AC/HP/STA  (in that order of preference) over WIS gear.<br />
<br />
If you want high wis/low ac, go play a druid. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Tribal war boots should not hurt your budget and are pretty nice.  Other than the expensive bits, JB armor is all crap so don't even think about it.<br />
<br />
Other easy and cheap upgrades would be an Enshrouded Veil, Brown Chitin leggings, and a Sentry bracer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Arms : Giant Scalemail (AC 11, Wis 3, Int -3, HP 20). You gain AC, a few HP, and lose 1 Wis. The STR loss is meaningless, and the STA loss is compensated for by the raw HP. Currently goes for 300pp on my server.<br />
<br />
Earrings : Gotta go with everybody else in suggesting Electrum Black Sapphires (AC 2, HP 35, Mana 25). You lose 1 AC, gain 35 HP,  lose a few point of mana and the 4 CR. Fairly cheap.<br />
<br />
Rings : Again, have to agree with the majority here : Velium Fire Wedding Rings (AC 6, HP 65) and maybe a Shadel Bandit Ring (AC 6, HP 55, Mana 55, DR 10, CR 5, Summoning Haste II).<br />
<br />
Shield : Sarnak Battle Shield (AC 25, Str 5, Sta 5, HP 40, FR/CR/MR 10). Same AC, some nearly meaningless STR, slightly more HP overall, and some useful resists. Pretty cheap these days.<br />
<br />
Range : If you have PoP, buy some Hobgoblin Surprise and do the Beginner's Magic Manual quest (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2218) (AC 7, INt/Wis 6, HP/Mana 15) or buy some Planar Blood Brew and do the Beginner's Combat Manual quest (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2214) (AC 7, Str/Sta 6, HP/Mana 15). You could instead get the Planar Peridot Encrusted Stein to do the Beginner's Stealth Manual quest (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2216) (AC 7, Dex/Agi 7, HP/Mana 15) but it really isn't that great and unlike the others wouldn't really be an upgrade. On SolRo you can get the Hobgoblin Surprise or the Stein for under 200. Can't find a blood brew in the bazzar at the moment, but I expect that one wouldn't be all that much more.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wrist : Whatever you do, do not follow the advice to get a 2nd chipped bone. Overall, the only truly redeming factor of that bracer is the focus effect. The AC is just to low to be real Shaman equipment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, thanks for all the advice guys :)<br />
<br />
I have just completed the Beginner's Magic Manual (the meal cost me 450pp which i thought was a bit expensive!), but it is a nice item :)<br />
<br />
I also went for JB sleeves, the AC was just too nice to resist, and I got some stats back by being given an Arctic Wyvern Bracer, which will fill in until I get a Coldain Military Wristguard. Another 6/65 ring is on its way too :)<br />
<br />
Am still looking for a bargain pair of boots though!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, got another couple of items :) A pair of Engraved Royal Velium boots - nice AC and saves, and a Fine Antique Ring, some AC, hp, mana and Mana Preservation 2. Nice ring for 15 minutes work and 20pp lol<br />
<br />
Just thought I'd keep y'all up to date!</div></div><hr />
