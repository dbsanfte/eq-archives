<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think I'll post my vote in favor of sever slow mitigation and immunity in GoD.  It is important that as new expansions come out alternative classes become desireable, and a couple become nearly useless.  Keeps us on our toes or something like that.<br />
<br />
  Next expansion I would really like to see 75% of the mobs proc an unresistable, uncurable version of Balance (a spell proc from Emperor guards that limits all healing to DD heals and caps those at 300 a shot).  This would free groups from the tedious need to fill in that annoying &quot;healer&quot; slot in their groups and allow more use of bandages.   For the first time ever clerics will be graciously allowed to skip out on that annoying nuisance of groups and raids to work hard on thier twinks, afterall that is what we want to play this game for, is being level 10 or less all over again.<br />
<br />
  In expansions after that I propose a 90% or greater existance of perma-rooted mobs with weaponshield discipline active from all sides at all times that proc DTs.  This frees us from the melee DPS bother and allows the complete nullification of 3 classes in one expansion (go go efficiency!)  Furthermore, this expansion will have to plan ahead for the fact that tank Hp will be getting to the point where they can actually TAKE a DT, and strikethrough weapons will be so common that even pets will have them, so make sure that all of the mobs have a strong knockback and root proc too.<br />
<br />
  And for the third expansion, maybe we can get away from healing and DPS completely and make mez and root return to their former glory.  We can implement mobs which will only die if you can keep them completely stationary for more than 5 minutes.   This should quite completely screw up anyone's understanding of what the hell they are doing in the game and finally realize the true intent of driving people back into older content.<br />
<br />
  In the fourth expansion, we can persue broader horizons and make it so that you actually only get experience when someone in your own group dies, and that experience is scaled inversely to the level of the mob.  This will provide some much needed group desirability for those people who are especially adept at forming large trains of green con mobs while encouraging people to view their class skills from a unique angle as they attempt to get everyone around them dead while somehow living themselves.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  I feel these changes are going to help the Everquest community at large, and should advance the concept of slow mitigation to its fullest potential by eventually balancing out all classes as &quot;completely undesirable for grouping.&quot;<br />

small edit for spellin' that I noticed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Lol, better add more curse counters to balance just to make sure they can't remove it and use their damn healing spells over the bandages. <br />
<br />
Nice post hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Those are wonderful ideas Caanus! <br />
<br />
Your quick post has more imagination than entire EQ expansions that I've paid for.  I wish you could get a job designing content for someone. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you missed making mobs proc a spel tht decrease all skills by 75% meaning that all classes become pretty much equal and anyone can fill any role as all classes are now unable to do anything.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, we are currently working on later expansion ideas.  Currently favor is being given to &quot;schreodinger's Island.&quot;  In this expansion since you can't know your position and momentum both precisely all players are prone to continual shadow step traps if they move at all.  The main highlight of this expansion will be to improve the tracker desirability as in order to kill a mob you must first find it and have your entire group OBSERVE the mob in order to collapse it's wave function :p<br />
<br />
 (Yes, I am a physicist, and no I don't expect most of the world to bother taking the time to think that was funny.  It was purely self gratification)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually, it is rather amusing.<br />
<br />
So what's next, a Cold DoT that reduces the mobs temperature to absolute zero, at which point they shatter into lots of tiny mobs each of which expands at a constant rate until they encompass the entire room (forcing multi-dimensional geometry, which gives SOE an excuse to require DirectX99 installations on all computers, and upgrades of video cards to the latest greatest?)!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Other mobs: <br />
<br />
Heisenbergs: Any attempt to target a Heisenberg causes the mob to move out of range of all attacks by PCs. <br />
<br />
Einsteins: Tiny wisps that explode upon being attacked, unleashing enormous energy and creating an AOE disease proc that lasts centuries.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have wondered how many warriors it would take to kill aow if it were just warriors...how many bind wounds would have to be taking place constantly to keep a tank alive vrs AoW?<br />
<br />
