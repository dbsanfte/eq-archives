<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shoto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Plaguebone thief camp in DL.  I'm sure its in here somewhere but I just had to post and make sure everyone knows.  Get C3 from wherever and get this camp.  They're not social, they run at 20%, they dont resist (3 resists in all 3 levels) and give 1% per kill.  At 46, would pull with slow, send in jobaber, Scourge, wait.....VoS, wait...either nuke or reapply VoS at 50 and let puppy finish it off.  Wayyyy to easy.  If your on Povar, disregard above message.  Thanks.<br />
*edit*<br />
Still 1% per kill at 49, Ebolt makes this disgustingly easy.  Enjoy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blackke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">DL as in Dreadlands?  Do you have a Loc for this camp Im not familiar with the area and I cant see anything about Plaguebone thieves on the maps?<br />

Thanks, <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blaand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">its at the lost city, in the valley with the wizzy spires and druid rings near the huge spires and weird pyramids. they hang out undder neath some of thes pyramids</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shoto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Take the spires down from wherever and head southeastish, you'll run into a bunch more spires and some pyramid looking things, check allas etc for details.  Still goodish xp at 50, pull with slow, dogdog takes agro, Ebolt at 76%ish and you have a dead skelly.  I buffed pet with Harness, speed and regen and he tore em up.  I reccomend having a few velium weapons or some such on ya, the proc really helps the pet take agro.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cheb KB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I tried this camp and the skellies were right on top of each other and very social. I had to root park and then log because i didn't think that they would help each other.<br />
<br />
I only had a chance to see about 6 of them. Is there more then that in the temple?<br />

<br />
Both as a necro and as a shaman I have hunted here a great deal....I expect I have killed somewhere between 500 and 600 plaguebones....in that time i have never had an add....<br />
<br />
park your pet at the edge of the pyramid facing the doorway...take a few steps forward and f8 till you pick a mob...cast a slow on it and step back behind pet...as soon as mob hits the door tell pet to attack...then I would usually drop a dot on it, if it agros, turn on melee and poke it a few times, then step back and let pet get agro and give it a good nuke, if I didnt pick up agro on the dot I would generally sit and med till pet got down a quarter or a third, then nuke...<br />
<br />
The nuke will bring agro to you and you wont shake it till the bones die, but by this point it wont be long...when the mob begins his walk sit down and med while pet finishes it off...<br />
<br />
I would then generally run and loot because they can drop several plat...if you are rich just sit and med...by the time pet shows up you should be back to full mana and ready for another...<br />
<br />
there are eight bones in the building and two that roam, you probably won't be able to clear them all till you get to your high 40s...</div></div><hr />
