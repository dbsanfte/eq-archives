<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First on my list is flying.  It REALLY IS all that and a box of cookies.<br />
Obviously, the fun will wear off a bit as I get used to it, but DAYUM ... I've been waiting for a video game to incorporate flying this well for a long time.  I'm not disappointed.  It's kind of the same feeling as I got when I scribed torpor.  Except I didn't have to suffer waiting for it.<br />
<br />
Air Superiority - got this with the scrapper, and knocking people into a flip that lands them on their bum is something I'll never regret having the ability to do (that and it interrupts casters, and things that are trying to blow up on you).<br />
<br />
Hover - on ranged-attack types.  Once I found that holding down the space bar (or whatever you remapped your jump key to) will make you float up a good deal, I get a HUGE kick out of watching the frustrated little guys staring up at me mournfully with baseball bats in hand.  Gives you a nice vantage on the fight if you have crowd control abilities.  Bonus height - jump and immediately hit the hover key to start out a good ways up... this works particularly nicely if you're wierd like me and also have the super jump power.<br />
<br />
I'm interested in any other powers people are getting a big kick out of.  Not necessarily the Monstrously Powerful Superbuild stuff, but the ones with good cheezy fun factor...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I like to use teleport friend on random groupmates halfway across the zone ... <br />
<br />
WOOT!  There's just something about it that's cheesy and fun as all get out, plus there's no confirmation box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Force Bolt in the Defender/Controller Force Field line.<br />
<br />
It throws mobs around like rag dolls. Even Bosses. I can't stop giggling when I use it, even if the damage is unnoticeable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Propel has to be mine.  You levitate some random item and hurl it at the bad guy.  I've seen air tanks, computer desks, computer monitors, light posts, etc. all get thrown around.  It's always entertaining to see someone get conked in the head with a flying pool table.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd go with Propel as well, endlessly amusing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Recall Friend is a really good one.  When I was low level and no one had any travel powers, I would hover on top of the tallest building I could find, recall someone on top of it, and then hover back down.  This is really great if they are afk and you leave them teetering on the very edge.  If you're pissed at someone you can also drop them from a really high height into a group of mobs: guaranteed death.<br />
<br />
I also like teleport.  Whenever I see a group of mobs I am going to attack, I pick my target out of that group, and then teleport directly on top of him with Shadow Maul queued up.  Basically I appear out of thin and and unleash a flurry of attacks on my target.  It's a really cool looking gank.<br />
<br />
I also really like the animation for siphon life (basically its lifetap).  My favorite is when the enemy starts to run away just as I am casting it.  My character makes this gesture with his hand (if you've ever played mortal kombat, it is like scorpion's &quot;Get over here!&quot;) and the villain just drops dead.<br />
<br />
Propel is also one of my favorites, even though I haven't played a character that has it.  The first time I saw it I was like &quot;did someone just throw a sink?&quot; and the guy is like &quot;yeah&quot; and I was like &quot;cool&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jenavyra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My current favorite so far (my highest char is only level 8, so I can't speak for the future) is combat jumping.  I'm not sure why, I just get a kick out of being able to jump over big stuff.  Planning to get super-jump at 14, and I can't wait for that either.  Hover is fun for getting out of melee range as well - there's just something about a hovering robot throwing down ice blasts on the poor thugs that gets me giggling every time.<br />
<br />
The animation for the Spines scrapper power Impale is really funny too, at least on some characters I've seen.  My husband plays a character who looks similar to Tezrian (he's a full-fledged demon), so watching this evil looking black and gold demon-guy wind up to throw a pitch is pretty funny.  The sadistic part of me grins when he hits with it too, as the fleeing thug gets it in the back and falls over with this huge spike through him.  (What was that about *arresting* criminals again?) *ahem*<br />
<br />
Anyway, I've been pretty impressed over all with the animations and general concepts of most of the powers.  It's been *really* hard to try to settle on a character, because there are just so many options that are cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Meglo Maeneac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Mass Domination.. MUAHAHAHAHA<br />
<br />
My character.. dressed in the American Flag Colors and named Mjr. Freedom is a mind controller.<br />
<br />
Mass Domination is *great.*  You walk into a group of guys and *poof* they all begin beating on eachother..<br />
<br />
Too bad you don't get experience for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Perhaps you mean mass confusion?<br />
<br />
Mass Dominate just sort of leaves 'em all grabbing their heads in agony, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Mr. Freedom... the mind controller.  You're one twisted puppy!  ;)<br />
<br />
Agreed.  I'm really happy when someone joins the group with Propel.  It's rare enough that I still see some new vehicle or piece of furniature being hurled...<br />
<br />
Way too many fun things to take, and not NEARLY enough character slots.  We've taken up a 2nd server just so we could get all our costume and power choices out of our heads...  I'd definitely pay a one-time fee to have another 8 character slots on Protector...<br />
<br />
I'm really looking forward to mass confusion strictly for the giggle factor.  I dont' care if it's the most worthless power in the game, I want to cause that kind of chaos.<br />
<br />
I really like the look of Hyjal, btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">LaughingWoman,<br />
<br />
I'm on protector too.<br />
<br />
Look up Prodigal (mind controller) and officer of Jormungander.<br />
<br />
The core of the guild has been around together since the early days of EQ, then to DAoC, and now onto CoH.<br />
<br />
If you don't have a guild and want some solid folks to adventure with, let us know or send me an email in game.<br />
<br />
http://www.dangall.com/jormungander/phpbb2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Meglo Maeneac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Er, yeha, Mass Confusion.. sorry.  :)<br />
<br />
Powers are kind of named backwards to me.. I would think that if you &quot;confused&quot; someone, they would be unable to do anything, while if you &quot;dominated&quot; someone, they would do whatever you said.  :P<br />
<br />
But yeah, Mass Confusion = Major fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jenavyra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I made a gravity controller last night just to play around with, and I have to add Lift to my list of favorite powers.  It basically picks the target up into the air and then drops them back down to smash into the ground.  What's funny about it is that running targets actually have forward momentum (as they should), so when you lift them, they go flying through the air in the direction they were running.  Maybe I'm just demented, but I found that *so* hilarious..  Can't wait to get Propel and be throwing around cars. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I was fighting a freakshow boss, when he got a couple of hits in on me (they hurt), and I had to make a run for the elevators. He was right behind me, and as I clicked the elevator, he lobbed a grenade at me. It knocked me down just as the doors opened, and I landed on the floor, bounced once, and then flopped into the elevator.<br />
<br />
When it hit the lower floor, I did one of those kicking forward flip thingies that players do to stand up, and flew out of that elevator.<br />
<br />
About the coolest thing I'd ever seen in a game :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thanks Ciccero.  :)<br />
<br />
My goal this time round is to remain determinedly NON uber, and simply piffle around with friends.  Hence my 8 active characters, 2 of which are level 14.... *grin*  Toward that end, we made our own playful little guild of close family and friends (link provided because I had so much fun making it http://mywebpages.comcast.net/kmarf/DoA/ ).  But I'll definitely stick you on my friends list.  Old EQ shamans really are the best people...<br />
<br />
Doh, threadjacking my own thread.<br />
<br />
I think I can safely say that a fire/ice blaster doesn't start out with any particularly fun or funny abilities.  Lots of firepower, but nothing that ever makes me laugh or go &quot;ooooooh&quot;.<br />
<br />
My controller's confuse ability is a constant form of entertainment, however.  Especially since the baddies my charmed friends beat up on really don't fight back.  So as long as I'm not in aggro range, I can watch them beat on each other indefinitely.  Nets zero exp, but dangit, it's funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tikcuf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I play an Energy/energy blaster and the Power Punch is a nice little hit if one gets to close to me...  Add a knockback enhancement and when you hit them it's nice to see them fly across a 4 lane street or a room and bounce off the walls..</div></div><hr />
