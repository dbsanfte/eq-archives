<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Redseal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got a 52 Iksar Shaman and 51 Ogre War, decent gear on both.<br />
I would like to stay in the Kunark area, BW in particular cause its close to nexus port (DL), Chardock, and KC.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm not too familiar with some good spots where this duo would be good to go.<br />
<br />
Any shamans out there have any suggestions for me hunting, at these levels, in BW?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

The two of you will be able to devastate the place. Will be a lot of light blue giants to you but you can also pull from the areas around it. The ancients will con dark blue at 55 i believe. Also the ancients will drop spells occasionally and the loot is quite good. There is a name (Gorgol??) that drops the treeweave. Skellies, sarnaks, bees and if you really want a challenge at your level try a wurm or two :) The area right around the fort is a fairly safe spot to med and there is tons of mobs to pick from.</div></div><hr />
