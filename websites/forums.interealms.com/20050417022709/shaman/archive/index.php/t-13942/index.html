<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm currently 55 and have a RL friend who is currently a 57 rogue.  Are there any places we could effectively duo on days where we just have a small window of time or run out of patience lfg or trying to put one together?<br />
<br />
Preferable something with decent xp and/or monetary value.<br />
<br />
Also would you suggest I tank so he could BS or have him play tank?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Two suggestions:<br />
<br />
dulak - grab one of the boats<br />
poj - basement, though this might be a bit challenging without harmony for single pulls</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>grootz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/agree Go to Dulak on a boat.  Use root on mob. Then stand close and take the hits.  Rogue stands back further and gets backstabs.  If necessary use stoicsm on self.  Works great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">IMO with a rogue seb is yours for the taking... and since you are rooting and using REIF instead of jbb :) root won't break as much and so you don't have to worry about snare too much.. let him get summoned, let him take the beatings is the way I would approach it if you are fighting summoning mobs.. remember you can heal him, but if you have aggo then it's not gauranteed that you can heal yourself..</div></div><hr />
