<p>I was lucky enough to get the new spell this weekend on Xegony. If memory serves it came off of the battle master. Of course you can mem it yet its broken. Is there some new SK earring as well?<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>I've been to the hole a few times and we haven't seen any sk spells or ring.  We're gonna camp the safe hall soon, so maybe we'll find something different.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>I havent been in Chardok too much. Usually im COH'd down to royals for epic stuff. But we fought battle master near a bridge that is right next to a doorway that looked like it was a door on a waterfall. this was all arround the corner from where korocust (sp) spawns. We pulled him from past this door on a waterfall. does any of this help?<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>I picked this up the other night (sunday) from the Battlemaster.  He spawns near the arch in the waterfall area (if mah memory is correct).  Also picked up a very nice palli sword there (Jeldorin or something)  From what Ive seen of the new Chardok common / uncommon drops are some decent earrings for casters, rare drops tend to be either a weapon or some kind of armor..I picked up some Hardened Bone Spaulders the same night i got my Shroud of Undeath spell (12 ac 12 to all saves....15wt).  Also, all of the mobs tend to have random drops to them, and the SBS is no longer visible when they have it (atleast the 3 or 4 ive seen since the patch werent).  Ohh yeah....and its REAL easy to solo the zone-IN now.....good xp and the occasional random loot drops.<br />
<br />
Sorry...I dont know what i was thinking when i said zone out originally.....I havent tried that yet because of the two that spawn right there.  At the zone-in is a nice clear area to fear dogs and sarnaks back and forth on.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>zone out isn't really soloable.. 4 statics there very close to each other.. zone in however is a different story altogether. All clear for a weak fear kiting. And the statics make for very easy breaks. <br />
<br />
I can hold 6 of the zone ins very easily when the zone isn't too crowded. All the timings go the hell when there's too many ppl running in and just whacking thru. <br />
<br />
Spawn times seem to be around 21-22 mins. I thought it was 20 before, but it seemed to gain a min or two each time. Watch out for an abnormal pat. I dunno where that comes from, but he doesn't seem to be on any timer. Just pats in from somewhere. I've had a LOT of double kiting to do unfortunately because of him. But it's a rush. <img src="images/smilies/tongue.gif" border="0" alt=""></p>

<p><b> couple questions about Chardok</b></p>

<p>So you guys are saying there is a chance for some decent drops near the entrance? I am wondering if I could get a group of friends together including me (40 SK), 43 wizzard, 39 warrior, and 51 cleric and do well?<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>Yeah...I went back and edited my original post when I noticed I had said zone out.  Let me state again....the Zone IN is very soloable....the zone out....leave that for a group or something.  Sorry for the brain fart on the first post.....its just been one of those weeks at school.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p><b><img src="images/icons/Clown.gif" alt="" width="15" height="15" border="0"> </b></p>

<p>Where is the Battle Master (waterfall and all that) compared to the Bridge Keeper? Is it down toward the castle? Or is it down by Niblick or something. I know the way down to Korucust and the castle pretty well, and for the life of me I can't think of where this guy is...<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>If you are standing in the little cubby where the Bridge Keeper spawns at, go straight ahead through the waterfall.  His PH is one of those sarnak skelies.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>Awesome thanks for the info - I thought it was near there, but to be honest I never realized that was a waterfall! Must... stop... and... smell... the... roses!!!<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>Anyone killed the royals since the patch? I was in there for a few hours a couple of days ago and one of the mobs dropped the crap dagger that the queen used to drop. I'm just curious if she has new loots...<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>the SBS still shows....its always been that if its the first item to pop on the item list its showable....if its not..then when u lewts the mob the SBS is the second item in inventory lewts and also as you said doesnt show....<br />
<br />
we got 3 SBS this week with all 3 showing....<br />
<br />
<br />
yes ZI is very soloable....one thing i would like to share..<br />
<br />
i was struggling to solo mobs....straight up.....pet-eyepatch-Atramentous/Massive Dragon Claw shard (28/30).....Ancient Sea horse speedy (34%)...dot taps-taps...no fearing....AC self buffed 1230 HP 2567...<br />
<br />
<br />
then i tried this.....pulled with Cascading (1200dot)....boil blood(540 dot)....dot tap (280)<br />
<br />
and it was a breeeeeeze.......<br />
<br />
so use those dot's...far more efficeint than trying to conserve mana for an extra dot tap or tap or speed up your pull rate for soloing....<br />
<br />
then mi exp rate when sky rocketting...half blue bub in 59! in 45 mins!...or 1 blue bub in 1hour 30 mins in 59!...not too shabby  in anyone's book...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
and also forgot to buy spell Diamond Skin (390 damage absorption).....*slaps forehead*<br />

<p>Zone out can be solo'd....<br />
<br />
I do that at odd times so not many peeps are around zone in/out (and no trains).<br />
<br />
Circlet over to zone out and start snare pulling from the bottom of the tunnel (I usually pull them all the way back to zone in or clear zone in tunnel and pull to the bottom of the zone in tunnel)....work your way up to the zone out.  Once you have cleared thru....set your self up at the zone out area and begin reclearing from the bottom.  Once the bottom couple have been cleared....restage towards the bottom of the tunnel (pet/med area) and work your way back up to the zone out.  The mobs at the zone out, even though 4 spawn very close to each...can be single pulled (I did at 58).<br />
<br />
Drops...to date....2 Battleshields, 3 Staves of Shielding, some mantle (dog drop), shammy collar, and some other minor lewt.<br />

<br />
Cuz as soon as they spawn, they get whacked  LOL<br />
<br />
I've fear kited some critters around zone in while LFG. The drops are rare, but the mobs near zone in and out do drop stuff...I got a couple SBSs (could see both), iksar skin gloves, jagged chokidai spine, and a chanter neck piece I forgot the name of. The xp isn't great and the drops so rare I wouldn't bother farming for loot there, but they're nice little rare surprises.<br />
<br />
I saw four SBSs drop my first night in Chardok after they redid the zone. It was obvious I could get another one easily, so I traded it for an Idol of the Thorned and got a new shield a couple days later...now I see SBSs being auctioned for 6kpp in EC, often two or three people trying to sell at the same time. Too bad it's such a girlie shield. It clashes with my Umbral.<br />

<p>Only thing I ever got from soloing zone in was a mask that kinda sucked. But it seems they can drop anything, just very rare heh.<br />
<br />
I´ve also seen like 3 sbs auctioned in EC same time, tho still at 12k heh. Btw do they drop more often the deeper inside ya are?<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
