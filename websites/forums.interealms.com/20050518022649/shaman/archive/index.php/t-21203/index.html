<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xantir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Long Post Warning!  (I apoligize ahead of time)<br />
<br />
    I started playing this game last spring since I have 3 friends that play it.  I thought it would be fun.  My friends have a warrior, a monk, and a bard.  When I asked them what class I should play that would best fill out a group with them, they unanimously said &quot;You should play a shaman.&quot;  They had all played for much longer than I and had lvl 65 characters, so I got to lvl 65 as fast as I could myself.  It was great, for a while.  I could slow, heal, nuke, dot, buff, summon/charm a pet, and melee.  My problem is that once I hit level 60, only the monk would group with me and the bard told me straight up that a shaman is a waste of a group slot.  The bard and the warrior then started to tell me I should have played a beastlord, since shamen don't add any dps and are only usefull as a bot buffer.  Now this REALLY pissed me off.  I know what you are thinking, find new friends.  Well, I tried, I learned that a lot of raiding guilds no longer want shamen.  What's going on here?  Are there really so many shamen that guilds don't need them?  Are my friends simpily a bunch of jerks, or are they right?  I have noticed that my dps in groups sux now since I have to cast so many debuffs just to get slow to land, can't heal well for the same reason.  I no longer enjoy the versitility that I had at low levels, charm died at lvl 34, mobs eat me alive in melee, summoned pet has a damage cap of 60, nukes take forever to cast and often don't land, and dots get resisted a lot and eat huge amounts of mana.  Also, it seems everyone can slow these days, warriors can get a wepon that procs a 50% slow(not that great, but it is a slow), bards can 50% slow, beast lords can 65% slow and enchanters can 70% slow.  Did I really just waste 30 days of my life leveling to 65 a class that isn't worth anything except as a buff bot before adventures and raids?  Is there any chance of this getting fixed?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Oh gee.  There's only about 10 different threads ongoing about this very issue.  Try doing some research first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>iso2202</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, imho, shaman are useless on the GoD scene, but in PoP and LDON grouping, they arnt, wether they are or arnt useful in a group depends on what other classes are in the group, ie if there is another BL or Enchanter, But even then, backup heals are always welcome, in most BoT groups im in i feel as if the cleric feels as a buff bot because after slow a Q and a tnarg here and there keeps the MT at 100%, And on the raid scenario, atm, yes, we are more or less a buff bot, this CAN be fixed, a group avatar would certainly help, but wether it WILL be fixed is still in question; I own a 65 shaman and a 65 BL, and i find groups generally picking the shaman in LFG when i list &lt;or 65 BL&gt; under discription, but then again im not sure what lvl of the game you are on, if you are in EPs and whatnought, i really can't relate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krakur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think the &quot;need&quot; of a shaman is based on how well the person can play their class. I know people that *do* prefer *some* shaman over other classes.. while they are few, they do exist.<br />
<br />
Once GoD came out I said oh yay, more stuff that I'm useless in. Well not more than a week after release I had gotten tells to come join Trial 5 / 6.. it wasn't because they couldn't get anyone else, but that they would rather have a smart shaman versus a not so great enchanter, or other slower.<br />
<br />
As for the number of shaman... yes I do think there has been a huge influx.. ever since shaman were reported soloing dragons, everyone else had to try it too :P<br />
<br />
And, as for our dps and healing sucking.. I thought I'd just say this here;<br />
<br />
Our heals are not great, but they are not bad either. It's how you use them. Q/Breath + Tnargs is a decent amount of healing. I hate people that say our heal over times are crap, because they aren't if used properly.<br />
<br />
Our dps is not great, but it's not bad either, it's how you go about doing your damage. Same situation as heals, use a dot(s), and use our low damage nukes in conjuction, and we actually can put out some decent damage. And dont say the cast time is too long either, use spear of torment you geebs, that's why we have focus effects for it on our ele / ornate gloves.<br />
<br />
We can get mana back faster than anyone, so mana should never be an issue even if you're going full bore dps.<br />
<br />
In short: The class is worth something, as long as the person playing it is too.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but this sentence makes me laugh out loud. You're concerned about having wasted 30 days of your life...whereas I have played my shaman for 5 years. If anyone has wasted time---it's me. :p<br />
<br />
30 days is a drop in the bucket. If your friends aren't digging the shaman, take another 30 days and make a cleric. They'll dig the cleric for healing.</div></div><hr />

That's 30 days /played.  I didn't get to 65 in a month.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">30 days played really isnt that much...to learn any class, not just a shaman. Either make a new char to 'fit in' with those you play with, or find new friends.</div></div><hr />

This post makes baby jesus cry, seriously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">my shaman has about 90 aa's, after I get 90 more (yeah right) I will have a toon that is, a decent back healer for most pop, ldon normals, possible main healer in those groups depending on make up.<br />
a good slower<br />
an ok buffer<br />
craptacular dps<br />
one of the most durable classes in the game, the one ability shaman still have is the power to survive **** that makes just about everyone else cry like little girls. unfortunatly it doesnt do jack in god. ldon hards we are still usefull but only with a real healer along for the trip. <br />
<br />
30days is nothing, if you really want to roll up a toon that will always get a group roll a chanter, if you arent a really good player I woulndt though. chanters are not an easy class to master.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Shamans are durable? In what setting?<br />
<br />
If you are talking about soloing then I agree, but in a group setting Shamans are hardly a durable class anymore. I die like a caster, easier than an Enchanter.<br />
Of the Slowing classes, the Shaman is the most fragile one hands down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Why oh why does this post spell funny?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zigmund</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I played my shaman to 65 and 206aa<br />
<br />
Don't play a shaman, they were &quot;replaced&quot; by beastlords.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">To be completely honest i dont hate my class for its shortcomings. However, there is one thing i really miss that the shaman cannot give me, and that is beating stuff on the head with a large sword. Thats why i borrow my friends paladin from time to time.<br />
<br />
Not that i have any idea why i posted this on this thread...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Piss off your friends and make a Mage. Seriously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Banuddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Wow, your friends wouldn't group with you because you weren't the &quot;ideal&quot; class?  Some friends...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Hordza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">...30days! :O, dude it took me 98 days to get to 60 lol<br />
<br />
yeah, remake a cleric or druid..lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think I was level 54 alone for more than 30 days....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Again, drop in the bucket. I'm well over 150 days /played. I haven't checked recently. I might be over 200 days /played. Sorry, 30 days = drop in the bucket. :)<br />
<br />
Make a Druid for healing/porting/nuking/soloing or a Cleric for healing those lame ass friends of yours who think your healing sucks. While your healing DOES suck, they are lame for telling you to make a shaman then dumping you when they weren't happy.<br />
<br />
You really need better friends more than anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Geeze.  Play for your own entertainment, and not to entertain your friends.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Shaman are tough!  Shaman are the toughest of the slowing classes.  <br />
<br />
I make a damn fine offtank in Phase1 trials in Time.  Earth/Air.  I often end up tanking one of the mobs for a long time - in fact I am sometimes the designated offtank when we are low on melees.  Once slowed they are pussies.  1650AC/7.8Khp, ID5/LR5.  Oh, and I malos/slow/cripple all of the other mobs while offtanking.  And I healed myself - I did get a couple of supernals from the clerics when I got a long string of big hits at one point, but heck, they healed me less than the SK.  <br />
<br />
Enchanters?  There is no way in hell an enchanter could have taken the damage I took while offtanking a phoenix noble, their AC just means they take Max hit way too often and they cannot rune enough.  <br />
<br />
Bards?  they have a problem sometimes keeping aggro while the clerics are spamming heals.  They just can't seem to generate the aggro fast enough.  <br />
<br />
Beastlords?  in leather they get pasted by these mobs, and they can't self heal for spit.  <br />
<br />
Mind you, take me to GoD and I get eaten way too fast for it to be fun though.  :(</div></div><hr />
