<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Timbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I personally found the first stanza racist and offensive, but you have to admit it's very well written and has a good message.  It came to me without attribution, sadly.<br />
<br />
Every U down in Uville liked U.S. a lot,<br />
But the Binch, who lived Far East of Uville, did not.<br />
The Binch hated U.S! the whole U.S. way!<br />
Now don’t ask me why, for nobody can say,<br />
It could be his turban was screwed on too tight.<br />
Or the sun from the desert had beaten too bright<br />
But I think that the most likely reason of all<br />
May have been that his heart was two sizes too small.<br />
<br />
But, Whatever the reason, his heart or his turban,<br />
He stood facing Uville, the part that was urban.<br />
“They’re doing their business,” he snarled from his perch.<br />
“They’re raising their families! They’re going to church!<br />
They’re leading the world, and their empire is thriving,<br />
I MUST keep the S’s and U’s from surviving!”<br />
<br />
Tomorrow, he knew, all the U’s and the S’s,<br />
Would put on their pants and their shirts and their dresses,<br />
They’d go to their offices, playgrounds and schools,<br />
And abide by their U and S values and rules,<br />
And then they’d do something he liked least of all,<br />
Every U down in U-ville, the tall and the small,<br />
Would stand all united, each U and each S,<br />
And they’d sing Uville’s anthem, “God bless us! God bless!”<br />
<br />
All around their Twin Towers of Uville, they’d stand,<br />
and their voices would drown every sound in the land.<br />
“I must stop that singing,” Binch said with a smirk,<br />
And he had an idea—an idea that might work!<br />
The Binch stole some U airplanes in U morning hours,<br />
And crashed them right into the Uville Twin Towers.<br />
“They’ll wake to disaster!” he snickered, so sour,<br />
“And how can they sing when they can’t find a tower?”<br />
The Binch cocked his ear as they woke from their sleeping,<br />
All set to enjoy their U-wailing and weeping,<br />
Instead he heard something that started quite low,<br />
And it built up quite slow, but it started to grow—<br />
And the Binch heard the most unpredictable thing...<br />
And he couldn’t believe it—they started to sing!<br />
<br />
He stared down at U-ville, not trusting his eyes,<br />
What he saw was a shocking, disgusting surprise!<br />
Every U down in U-ville, the tall and the small,<br />
Was singing! Without any towers at all!<br />
<br />
He HADN’T stopped U-Ville from singing! It sung!<br />
For down deep in the hearts of the old and the young,<br />
Those Twin Towers were standing, called Hope and called Pride,<br />
And you can’t smash the towers we hold deep inside.<br />
<br />
So we circle the sites where our heroes did fall,<br />
With a hand in each hand of the tall and the small,<br />
And we mourn for our losses while knowing we’ll cope,<br />
For we still have inside that U-Pride and U-Hope.<br />
For America means a bit more than tall towers,<br />
It means more than wealth or political powers,<br />
It’s more than our enemies ever could guess,<br />
So may God bless America! Bless us! God bless!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jlove Fizzboom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hmmmm, not sure exactly how to take this.<br />
<br />
if it says &quot;to hell with all those who are Islamic&quot;, then no.<br />
<br />
if it says, &quot;all those who were celebrating in the streets when thousands of innocent lives were snuffed out - gather in one place so we can nuke the bajeezus out of you&quot; - then you bettcha<br />
