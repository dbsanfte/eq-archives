<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tomanator Two</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I got Tear from Fear. <br />
<br />
I am going to fight Nek and Rak during the same raid. <br />
<br />
So I am going to take down Nek first, then go do turn in to Spirit in EJ , and then I will proceed to take down Rak afterwards. <br />
<br />
My question is this, is Rak a spawned NPC, or does he just chill on second floor. <br />
<br />
I heard he spawns after killing the last reaver. <br />
<br />
Second question, can raid group and I get to Nek without killing all the reavers. <br />
<br />
I am not familiar with CoM, where is the lift that takes you to the second floor where the reaver and Rak spawn. <br />
<br />
I know that to get to Nek you go around up the ramp through invis wall, and up another ramp above city. Can I avoid fight with Rak, until I have allready killed Nek? <br />
<br />
Thanks for the help. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">One bit of info that I didn't see there:  I bound myself in the courtyard (just S of the &quot;C&quot; in the map).  You kill Neh, loot the diary, gate and go turn it in.  No nasty deaths on the way out.  You gate back in and run to the castle to join the rest of your friends (maybe training them with one or two small mobs).  It seemed to me that binding in that location made the whole thing jsut a little easier for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We just levved from the top of the zone, and ran out.  No agro, except by the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The short answer is yes, you can easily avoid Rak on your way to the 2nd floor. You'll have to kill the Giosk reaver just past the first locked door but the other 4 reavers (and Rak) are up a locked elevator. No way that you can accidentally agro them on the way through. <br />
<br />
For both of them, they'll spawn after you kill the appropriate reaver, they spawn at the spot that the reaver is killed. <br />

In case you're interested, we tried to duo Rak a few days ago with a 65 SK and 61 shaman and failed miserably. Only got him down 1 bubble but I died at half mana , I wasn't paying attention to positioning and I had to get into AoE range to heal which got me killed. SK wasn't wearing any resist gear and didn't have FR buffs (but did have enchanter haste). If we'd buffed up correctly and let our 52 cleric help we probably could have taken him but we didn't want to risk wiping the group so only 2 of us engaged. I was pretty much chain casting my 2k heal to keep the SK alive. Didn't really have any time to canni and heal myself in between.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can heal from outside the AoE range, I know, I was doing it.  We had Rak spawned where the first Reaver spawns, the one that spawns Ghiosk.  The healers were all just inside the room, or just outside the room at the door.  At that location, you are out of AoE range, but within healing range for Cheal, Kraggs, and Tunares Renewal.<br />
<br />
If the 65 SK had had decent FR gear, and you had stayed out of AoE range, I would expect you could duo him.</div></div><hr />
