So any suggestions on a slick, sexy Half Elf ranger name? ( or stick with Devaron and screw 5 characters with same beginning and ending) - Whoever comes up with the name i decide to use gets a sticker! :p <br />
<br />
Thanks for advice :D <br />
<br />
PS. no silly names like cannonfodder, or bowboy etc. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Too bad the &quot;dead&quot; part is in bold so often.</div></div><hr />

Personally I think you need to break out of the DN cycle, try new names, new ways of thinking about yourself.<br />
<br />
Tree names work well for rangers with elf blood.  Think about some of the tree names then vary them a little.<br />
<br />
Examples<br />
<br />
Yewt - from Yew tree<br />
Dagwood - Dogwood<br />
Erdwood - Redwood<br />
Alden - Alder<br />
Kherry - Cherry<br />
Allnut - Walnut<br />
<br />
you could also go for partial names of Norrath trees, like <br />
<br />
Hickory - be prepared to be called Hick a lot<br />
Ashe<br />
Elmer<br />
Oake<br />
Dark<br />
Shade<br />
<br />
and one the might fit your parameters<br />
<br />
Dalmon - Almond<br />
<br />
There you go, have fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In naming my characters I goofed off with words until I found one I likes the sound/feel of. I have Taamar, Laanya, Xevior, Nevarre, Hiroku, Kolsha, Yselle, and Bait (yes, BAIT. We were doing a guild naked newbie Iksar run, Cabilis to Erudin. I teamed up with another scaley named Runnah) On other servers I have Dahlei, Jadrek, Treeni, Alrick. If you REALLY wanna cheat, go to a server you don't play on and sit in their auction zone awhile, then steal the name you like best *grin*</div></div><hr />

These are all great suggestions, but a real name is one that tells a litte something about you, like Loungin Stormweilder. I'm a lazy Halfling Ranger worshiping Kanana. <br />
<br />
I have to agree with the halfling here.<br />
<br />
I went with the borrow culture half elf thing. Anyone who realise the true origins of my names and what they mean, will then know a lot about my character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Devaron</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What does your name mean Crydee? I like Silvanus cause its Greek for helper of the woodlands (or something like that)<br />
<br />
Just can't decide whether to make it my surname or first name =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crydee Ossiriand</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My character's name comes from works by two different authors.<br />
<br />
Crydee comes from Raymond E Feist's Riftwar Series.<br />
This was a human frontier city near the border to elven territory. The main ranger of the serries (Martin Longbow) is from this city and is one of the few humans who is allowed to come and go from the elven area as he pleases. Other rangers in these series all seem to have Crydee as their main home point, even if they were not born there.<br />
<br />
Ossiriand comes from Tolkein's Middle Earth, specifically from The Similliron.<br />
I don't remember a ton about it, though it was home to the green elves (which would be the EQ equivalent to wood elves) who used the colour green to disguise or camoflage themselves from outsiders.<br />
<br />
<br />
Knowing all of this, you would city that:<br />
<br />
- First name is of literay human culture. Surname is of literay elven culture, specifically wood elves. Only a half elf would have a name of mixed cultures.<br />
<br />
- Now using the ideal that a half elf first name was often that of the opposite culture from which he was raised in, you then that my home city is Kelethin. You would also know that his diety would be Tunare as wood elves don't worship Karana.<br />
<br />
- Now considering that the only classes that are really associated with the colour green and to any strong degree are rangers and druids. While Ossiriand could have had both (I don't really remember) - Crydee only had rangers. Thus narrows down my character class to that of ranger.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, I spend days figuring out my character's name.</div></div><hr />
