<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pecannius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So i tried my first rumblecrush solo the other day without doing any research.  Single pulled easily to zone in, slowed/crippled before engaging.  <br />
  <br />
I noticed the rampage on my pet, taking 60% off his life in 1 round(just shammy buffed). Casted a spiritual serenity on him, but he died too fast.                                                                 <br />
<br />
Then RC started rampaging on me, (only other person there). I found myself unable to heal myself efficiently, RC was out dpsing me(I'm time/qvic geared).  Popped SC and got him down to 50%, (only dps was 1)me meleeing with leopard on, 2) 33pt dmg shield 3) spirit call).<br />
  <br />
So my question is, if you single pull him with no pet up, does he still rampage? Without rampage, which occurs nearly every round, he would be very possible for me to kill.  <br />
  <br />
Besides getting another 300ac in gear, and another 20% shielding, i dont see how i could kill him if he rampages on me.</div></div><hr />

Once your pet was gone, the rampage message was just spam, not doing any damage.  Your gear is quite good, you should be able to take him I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Also.. try to use some other buffs.. like dots or somehting.. cause you sitting there just meleeing I don't think will cut it.  You need to be able to put out more dps at some point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Pecannius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Might have been just having bad luck with mitigation the first time.  Second try i landed sinia and curse of sisslak/bane landed all the time.  Used spiritual channeling at 10m (so much &lt;3 for SC) and finished him off accordingly. Exciting fight!  :cool: <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shlob</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i tried him he has a boat load of hp i didnt get him down much but im not nearly equiped enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Purbs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">how'd you single him?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">max defensive and healing AAs, 30% or better magic focus, 1.5 and Ancestral aid for free healage, spiritual channeling for a second wind, and discordant healing really helps. it all adds up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">And if you meant single pull him... he outruns his guards, so by the time you get him to ZI, he is all alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Pecannius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">To single him it's really quite easy. Just aggro him and &quot;baby&quot; him to zoneline.  He runs faster than the others, and the others give up when they get far enough away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Purbs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">aye i did mean single pull, that makes sense though does he get stuck in the hallway?I remember him walking into a corner before and being stuck there, how many hps unbuffed do you think you would need to tank him? im only 5.6 unbuffed atm I know aas play a huge role was just wondering how many hps you all think would be needed<br />
<br />
edit: i know i wouldnt be able to take him just a question =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It's probably quite a fuzzy line on what base hp are required, but 5.6 is definately too low.  At some point it becomes a synthesis of base hp, ac, and focus effects.  Anyone trying can be assumed to be at the level cap, have all of the relevant aa, and the few spells that matter (though OoW Ancients certainly give one a leg up).  I don't think anyone's done it under 1800ish ac, 7500ish hp.  The absolute minimum is sure to be under that, but you'd be running into the issue of where your focus effects are coming from, if your gear isn't up to snuff.<br />
<br />
From my perspective, I'm pretty sure my hp/ac/level/aa are sufficient, but I'm just as sure that I'd need better than Muram's Anger and Spell Haste V to get the job done.  Dunno, maybe I'm underestimating myself and should just go for it :)</div></div><hr />

Hmm....I'm pretty sure that my warrior has taken ramp damage when on the top of the hate list. Ramp goes through furious (as do other special attacks), so its easy to see when it happens.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Normal single-target rampage does not hit the first person on hate list.  AE rampage will, and mobs that flurry with a &quot;Goes on a RAMPAGE! message&quot; will hit the first person on the hate list - Mith Marr is a good example of a mob that gives a ramp message, but doesn't actually ramp - but plain old rampage will never hit you if you're top on the list.</div></div><hr />
