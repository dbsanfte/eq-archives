<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was wondering what levels the new nurga is at now. I know that droga is mid 50's-65 but haven't seen much posted about nurga yet. Was really wondering if a 55 shammy and a 56 ranger could dou down there and get decent xp/loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you can handle the exit and entrance ok, the mobs are lower level. Deeper they get to be 57+ so you would wanna bring a group at that point./g the loot will be nice, though it really doesnt get consistent on the 15-20 plat drops till you move in ajust a hair deeper then the first hallway. But im sure it would be great XP and factiona nd decent plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Havn't been much in Nurga, but I doubt they are 57+. I have done a fair amount of hunting in Droga and 57+ describes that place fairly well. My guess would be that the higher end Nurga mobs are low 50s. Note that this is a guess. I know for a fact that a lot of mobs in there were green to me at 65. That makes them &lt; 45.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>dikkakor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Did nurga the other night with this grp..<br />
<br />
43 shm (me)<br />
42 mage<br />
46 Sk<br />
42 cleric<br />
45 pally<br />
<br />
we went all the way through.. hit the pits and came all the way back out.  no deaths and Xp was flowing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>otakuryoga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i was soloing in nurga at 48....fairly easy at entrance area<br />
<br />
mobs there have like a zero agro assist range so almost always single pulls...sic dog, slow, dot,etc,etc....just watch for the wizzy mobs..they take you down FAST<br />
<br />
gotta go try now im 49 with new dog and dots</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Daedric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You would do very well there at those lvls.  I think MoBs top out at 51 (maybe 50) at the deepest part of new Nurga.  The loot is decent there and exp. is nice.  Some of the unsolved quest stuffs look like they could be really nice as well.<br />
<br />
I've played around in new Nurga alot with my 60 ranger.  Teamed with an enchanter we could non-stop kill.  It's fun and a nice break from more crowded places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks Skalz/keaton. Was what I was looking for, sick of the same old spots and wanted a challenge that wasn't gonna turn into a nasty corpse run.</div></div><hr />
