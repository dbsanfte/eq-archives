<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valdak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well SOE seems to have forgotten about us one more time.  For the eighth time this month we are down for a patch and what is the foremost item in the patch message? PETS  Mage pets are the main focus it seems, bst and necro pets get some help, (guess their damage and spell casting abilities needed a boost), and what about the shaman pet?  I was very disappointed in the lack of anything substaintial in the GoD expansion for for us and now it seems that we do not even deserve a mention in the pet classes.  I have long felt that SOE has something against shaman and with each change I feel justified in that belief.</div></div><hr />
