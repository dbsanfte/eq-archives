<br />
Some of this looks really interesting.  There is also an interview out there ( on GameSpot I think ) where VI says that there will be many caster focus items dropping in SoL, things to up caster damage in the end game in the same fashion that better weapons and haste items have done for melee.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I really think SoL is gonna be a great expansion.  I just hope there aren't too many balance issues with these types of mass changes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sinsemsinfutura</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Are we only able to pick 1  skill? <br />
In other words, same 2 warriors, same race and same equipment will be some what different depending what skill the focus on? 1 warrior could more tank base while the other warrior could be more offensive?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Canelek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kilrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">HOLY CRAP!<br />
<br />
Those skills are awesome! Sin it is my understanding that you can gain several skills depending on your class. Only question is how much exp will you have to give up to gain one skill point? Imagine if it takes the length of time to get through level 59 to gain one skill point increase in some of those... *gasp* ...anyhow I love the sound of all this. Should be fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Umm.. WOW!<br />
<br />
Lot of these look awesome.. be interesting to see how it all works.. couple of weeks away. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grinric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think the way it works is when you &quot;ding&quot; to level &quot;61&quot; you will have a choise of what skill you would like.  and then you start over again at the start of level 60 with that skill and so on like that.  At least that is what I am gathering from what I have been hearing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Vi says you will have an xp &quot;switch&quot;, and toggle back and forth between a level bar and a skill bar.  Getting enough xp for a skill point is supposed to be the same as going all the way through level 51.<br />
<br />
<br />
The option to toggle is supposed to be available to any character 51 or higher.<br />
<br />
<br />
A level 52 warrior with flurry and rampage!  Woot !<br />
