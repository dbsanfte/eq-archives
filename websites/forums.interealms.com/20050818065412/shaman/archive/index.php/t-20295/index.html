<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Priest Balancing (DRU/CLR/SHM)<br />
<br />
Everyone wants something - fine.  Here's my thoughts, just brainstorming.<br />
<br />
First off - assumptions:<br />
<br />
Clerics are very irate about even a PERCEIVED step on their toes without them also gaining some other benefits to make up for the other priest classes being able to heal a little better.<br />
<br />
Druids are by and large cool but wouldn't mind some additional healing.<br />
<br />
Shaman are wandering around scratching our heads in GoD at the fast pace of the game and mobs DPS.<br />
<br />
My ideas for class adjustments:<br />
<br />
AAs:<br />
-----<br />
Give Clerics, Druids, and Shaman a double attack series of AAs. 5 levels @ 40 pts equiv. / level. so rank 5 = ~200 skill.<br />
Give Druids and Shaman a 85% rez AA ability on a 90 minute timer.<br />
Give Clerics an AA pet ability to make their hammer pet persistant like a chanter pet. Let them buff it if they want to.<br />
<br />
Spells:<br />
------<br />
Give shaman Spirit of Eagle.<br />
Give clerics a 10 second cast, self-only, SoW/Lev/Enduring Breath/Invis combination spell for travel-only.<br />
Give clerics an 8 second cast, 120 second poison DoT.<br />
Give druids and shaman an 18 second Divine Aura/Barrier type spell.<br />
<br />
Direct Heals:<br />
-------------<br />
Give Shaman a 2100 pt, 3 second cast, Direct Heal<br />
Give Druids whatever type of direct heal they want.<br />
<br />
Combo Heals: HoT with direct component built in:<br />
-----------------------------------------------<br />
Give Shaman and Druids 6 second cast, 1000 pt. direct, with 500 pt Heal over Time heal.<br />
Give Clerics a 4 second cast, 1500 pt direct, with 600 pt heal over time heal.<br />
<br />
And call it done.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Modified above to take in other thoughts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No rez.  That would be stepping on toes.  We dont need it anyway.  Something in line of calling a person to their corpse maybe.  No rez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Geoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Some great ideas there although I agree with jdthomas that a corpse summon spell is more in line with a shaman than a rez.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Some good ideas, 2100 direct heal might be overpowering unless you up cleric's and druids. A rez sounds like a nice idea, but when the stuff hits the fan I am normally one of the first ones to go since I am trying to heal everyone root everything etc etc. DI sounds nice, but can't cast can't do much.. wouldn't really be a point. What we really need is a secondary job after we slow/malo there isn't much for us to do, except minor patch healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tynne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Most Clerics don't really care about rez.  Rezzing is a chore to do after everthing has gone wrong kinda like rebuffing.  All 3 priests should be able to rez.  If dru/shm get anything less then a 90+ % rez who would be the only ones to get rezzed by them?  Thats right the clerics so they can click back in the others.  It should be a spell all 3 priests get.<br />
<br />
Clerics don't get groups for having rez.  They get /tells for having rez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My idea behind the AA rez idea for druids and Shaman was basically that in a typical group makeup, you have:<br />
<br />
Cleric<br />
Tank (war/sk/pal)<br />
dps<br />
dps<br />
backup-healer (shm/dru)<br />
floater/slower maybe<br />
<br />
Groups are dynamic, but generally you have a few things - and seldom do you have a cleric, druid, AND shaman all in the same exp. group, so if you have a CLR/DRU, chances are you have an ENC/BST/BRD for slows.<br />
<br />
If you have a druid / shaman group, then chances are you have no rezzing at all, which is not viable as it leaves zero room for mistakes and starting over at square one.<br />
<br />
If you have a cleric, cool, but what happens if the cleric falls and you're 3 hours into some adventure or 4 zones back  and now it's basically game over for everyone else as well.<br />
<br />
Paladins are good if you have one as your tank or dps, but if your group is PAL only for tank, chances are he'll be the first to go then the CLR about 2 hits later lately.<br />
<br />
As a priest class, I think DRU / SHM should have some form of an emergency rez just since as a secondary priest/healer we make a pretty poor case for ourselves when we can't even bring the group's primary healer back online if he falls.<br />
<br />
Heck, 50% might be too much of a penalty, because yes, really the only person who'd see this spell used on them with any frequency would be clerics and possibly paladins, so maybe 85% would be better and make it a 120 minute restricted AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Geoid - I live about 2 miles from the Point A dam.  I work for Alabama Electric - we own that power plant there at the dam.<br />
<br />
Bigbadbowlingdude - that's where I put in the double-attack idea for the priest classes.  If we wanted to invest and follow that AA route, we could then whack the mob a few times without much of a problem or without bothering to ask for any additional dps from nukes.  Without melee combat tables or modifiers, I don't think that would be too bad, and really in the back of my mind I don't think druids would care about melee, but for shaman / clerics it would be nice to add some flavor since neither of our direct damage capabilities are all that stellar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shoendesae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Look just forget about the rez. <br />
<br />
Cleric/Paladin get rez<br />
<br />
Necro/Shadowknight get corpse summon<br />
<br />
Maybe if we wanted a &quot;rez&quot; a soul gem option MIGHT, and that's a huge might, be viable but it should cost something obscene like our OWN un-rezable canabalization death to make the stone...and the stone should be something on the order of a diamond, not just an emerald.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No, I think if it's on an AA timer, it's definatly not something that will ever been frivolously (sp?) used without pretty darned good reason.<br />
<br />
CLR / PAL - sure, they both get rez, but they're what 2 classes out of a possible 17?<br />
<br />
In an instanced, respawning dungeon, through 3 other rough zones, and 3 hours deep when the cleric dies on an overpull do you just summon corpses and restart at the beginning?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jenina Icemyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Its funny that people talk about it but most people who think about it hard don't really want rez.  I'd LOVE for someone else to get rez.  Shaman and druid both would be fine with me.  <br />
<br />
But like someone said, it needs to be 90+% please or clerics are the only one that will be willing to take it.  Way back when I was in my low 50s I actually had group members refuse a 90% rez and look for a &quot;better&quot; one.  I also was the only 56+ cleric on a raid that wiped once and had people absolutely refusing to take a rez from anyone else (even though I personally took a 50% rez from a pally just to get back in there so we could get moving again... the person who's epic raid it was told me she worked too hard for her xp to not get a 96% rez).  Granted there wasn't pop xp then but still... people are silly about losing xp even though when you think about it the difference is almost no time to make up.<br />
<br />
Some clerics would have fits if others got rez but I think most of us would be happy not to have to try to get back to the zone we just wiped in to do the rezes all the time.  Funny how the people with the least travel utility are expected to do corpse runs while the rest of the group considers it afk time (good groups don't do this but you'd be amazed at how many do).  <br />
<br />
Personally, I want druids and shaman both to get a better patch heal.  Don't assume just cause some clerics are shortsighted and think the sky is falling every time the topic comes up that the rest are the same.  I'd like them to look at slow mitigation again because I think in a limited way it was a good idea but imo it has been overused.  I'd like shaman to go back to having the best HoT.  I would think something between 600 and 800 would be good.  I don't think it should cost a lot of mana either since HoTs tend to be situational and more often overheal then underheal (if you are thinking it might not be enough you are gonna toss a fast heal on top of it).<br />
<br />
K... now gimme my invis!   ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Clerics are very irate about even a PERCEIVED step on their toes without them also gaining some other benefits to make up for the other priest classes being able to heal a little better.<br />
We are so far behind clerics in healin that a straight doubling of our healing abilities would not come close. All we are asking for is an increase to our ability to spot heal less then what druids already have.<br />
No group heals. No CHs. No Divine Arbitration. Just a spot heal that heals a little more then half of the cleric spot heal.<br />
<br />
Druids are by and large cool but wouldn't mind some additional healing.<br />
Which suprised me to be honest. I was all ready for a pack of rabid wolves over at the glade.<br />
<br />
Shaman are wandering around scratching our heads in GoD at the fast pace of the game and mobs DPS.<br />
Or more likely yelling for our spell to finally finish casting only to see it heal for less then half a MOBs attack round.<br />
<br />
AAs:<br />
-----<br />
Give Clerics, Druids, and Shaman a double attack series of AAs. 5 levels @ 40 pts equiv. / level. so rank 5 = ~200 skill.<br />
I for one do not want double attack. I could care less if other priests get it.<br />
<br />
Give Druids and Shaman a 85% rez AA ability on a 90 minute timer.<br />
That would be a nice AA - not something to balance anyone with though.<br />
<br />
Give Clerics an AA pet ability to make their hammer pet persistant like a chanter pet. Let them buff it if they want to.<br />
Would maybe want to make it commandable too :P .<br />
<br />
Spells:<br />
------<br />
Give shaman Spirit of Eagle.<br />
Give clerics a 10 second cast, self-only, SoW/Lev/Enduring Breath/Invis combination spell for travel-only.<br />
These are not balance issues. And I could care less if clerics get invis. <br />
<br />
Give clerics an 8 second cast, 120 second poison DoT.<br />
Umm . . any damage values on it? For all I care though clerics can get our entire disease DoT line under different names on any resist check they like.<br />
<br />
Give druids and shaman an 18 second Divine Intervention.<br />
You mean Divine Aura, right? If so, that is a balance issue. I would not mind getting DA but I can do without it. I would rather get useful versions of the spell lines I have always had.<br />
<br />
Direct Heals:<br />
-------------<br />
Give Shaman a 2100 pt, 3 second cast, Direct Heal<br />
Give Druids whatever type of direct heal they want.<br />
2100 may be a little high. As to druid healing I have honestly not given it much thought. I do believe that content, not class balance, is responsible for any healing issues druids have.<br />
<br />
Combo Heals: HoT with direct component built in:<br />
-----------------------------------------------<br />
Give Shaman and Druids 6 second cast, 1000 pt. direct, with 500 pt Heal over Time heal.<br />
Give Clerics a 4 second cast, 1500 pt direct, with 600 pt heal over time heal.<br />
Hmm . . novel idea, will have to think about that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I like Jenarie. Can we keep her? I'll give you invis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">yay for level headed clerics  :) <br />
<br />
I would not mind clerics getting invis - the single issue I see is shrinking class diversity. Hmm . . . how does a fixed duration 60 second invis (affected by focuses) sound?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I haven't been a fan at all for giving druids or shamans a rez.  However, GoD has proven to be the biggest pita when it comes to travel and deaths.  There's nothing like waiting and hoping for your cleric to run through GoD safely to meet your group, only to find out his/her invis wore off and died.  Then you have to wait even longer for the cleric to get back hoping the situation doesn't repeat.  It'll also be great for the higher end trials where death can come easily.  Perhaps a 0% rez (cleric/pally can re-rez to get back xp) would be good.  I seem to spend more time waiting for people to show up for GoD stuff than any other place, and more than half the time it's because of people dying (usually a melee or cleric), due to travel.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Ah if you mean DA or DB then that is another that I think Clerics don't really care about.  The amount of times it is usefull for me can be counted on one hand in the last month.  Please take it and take rez and together with scrm maybe you can logout on a wipe and rez me back in.  Now Divine Intervention I would have a problem giving up because noone else has it it is something only Clerics can do and it is something situationally usefull.  Then again it is another, except on raids, that is only used as an &quot;Oh Crud I messed up spell&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">lol da the spell? yeah right where would you put it? in that mystery 9th spell gem?<br />
<br />
I want double attack, as it is I only sit to load new spells, I never sit ever...I dont even own a horse/drogmor and I dont sit so I frequently stand next to the mob with auto attack on taking pokes here and there.<br />
Spirit if eagle...yeah please, about 10lvls ago <br />
as for fixing cleric solo ability, like I posted someplace else, clerics are healers, anyone who thinks clerics are supposed to do anything else is kinda slow...<br />
might as well fix rogues ability to solo while your at it, give em roots and some dots maybe.<br />
sorry but when you pick a class notorious for weak solo ability it was your choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yeah, I realize a lot of those aren't balance issues, but it's still things that would be nice to see... even if our &quot;Spirit of Eagle&quot; is just another spirit of wolf speed spell with a built in levitation effect, that's cool with me.  I just get frustrated having spirit of wolf first, scale of wolf, spirit of scale, etc., and then getting gipped and having to sit down and cast individual levitation on everyone in the group.<br />
<br />
How about a Spirit of Bih`Li-esque spell with built in levitate and see invis?  It's not a balance issue, but it would save me the frustration of casting 14 spells to move a group.  Bih`Li x1, Lev x6, Acumen of DarKhura x1, Invis x6 ... bah!<br />
<br />
And I also have no problem with clerics getting an all in one travel spell.  Lord knows they need it.<br />
<br />
And for a DA - well, in all honesty Diab - we'd probably mem it in the same slot we used to mem spirit of cheetah :D ... but it's a situational thing, and it's a little more versatility vs. mobs that quad for 2000 a whack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My #1 complaint in GoD.  Our cleric dies a lot.  And at least 1/3 of the time dies again while trying to get back to whatever trial/zone we're in.  We did the Vxed trial, got clear to the end, spawned the final hail mob, and entered the very final room.  Some wierd agro stuff happened and a mob beelined right to the cleric.  Wham, dead faster than I could cast a heal.  Enchanter pacified the last 2 mobs there and we just took the flag and zoned out.  3.5 hours+ and our cleric didn't get the flag, because noone else can rez, and we didn't have time to clear back through half the zone again.<br />
Took us 4 tries to finish the plant trial because of the same problem, eventually something would happen where a mob beelined to the cleric and just pummeled her before anyone could do anything about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Think about it folks.

<br />
Clerics have IVU.  They need regular invis.  Begging sow, invis and lev for some of the runs my DE cleric alt makes is a real pain.  Thank goodness she has a shaman who can make potions as her big sister.<br />
<br />
I dun wanna rez as a shaman.  Leave that to clerics, pallies and necros.  If there needs to be more rezzers, it seems to me that SK's would be a more logical choice for rez capabilities as the necro hybrid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Iynna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I'm a shaman. I don't want rez. I don't want a 10 sec cast heal. I just want upgrades to what I have already so I can bring something to an exp group.  Shaman are suppose to be the king of bufs. What happened to me in the end game?<br />
<br />
Focus is good, but effectively just a 544 HP only buff in the end game.  Give me an upgrade to my level 55 Talisman of Kragg.  Make it group, MGBable and up the hitpoints from 395 to maybe 700hp. Make it stackable with Diaku/Wrulan if the melees aren't maxed and want to consume a buff slot.  If the Kragg upgrade also had a 5 point stacking mana regen too, that would be great to.  Compare that to Blessing of the Nine which is 32AC, 618 HP and 8 mana regen and you'll realize I'm not asking for too much.<br />
<br />
Give me an upgrade to my level 39 group sow.  I was the first class to get sow (level 9 vs. druid level 14) so why is my group sow so gimpy? Add acumen and up the attack to 50.  Make it castable i both indoor and outdoor zones. Don't add levo. <br />
<br />
Seems like every hybrid and caster has a mana regen they can bring to a group.  I'm suppose to be the king of buffs.  Where is mine?  If I can't have mana regen added to a Talisman of Kragg upgrade, then why not give me a  combo HP/mana regen.  I was the first to get hp regen in the form of Chloroplast (RNG/55 DRU/44 SHM/39 BST/55).  Why not give me a 25hp/5mana group regen buf. The other slowers all have a means to increase the mana regen of a group.  If I am the chosen slower over a BST, enchanter, or bard, why can't I also bring a little mana regen to the group?<br />
<br />
FA is nice for single exp groups.  In the end game with focus effects, it lasts for 11 minutes or more.  However, spell gems are precious to a shaman and I'd prefer a duration 20 or 30 mins so I could un-mem it after I catch the melees, but the base duration of 6 1/2 mins works for me.  However it doesn't work so well on raids.  Give me an AA that allows me to MGB FA once every 72 mins with a fixed duration of 10 mins. <br />
<br />
These simple thing would move me back towards being the king of buffs.  <br />

Just a note, Iynna.  If you improve talisman of kragg to something like this, we're pretty much screwed as buffers.  Talisman of kragg is also a beastlord spell.</div></div><hr />

Humm talking with clerics, it seems that only the first rez gives back xp, then other rez are just a summon to corpse but without xp regained.<br />
Could someone add more information about it ? I used  to think like Ramhorn :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I don't read the whole thread, just replying on the initial post ;).<br />
<br />
Thanks, no rez for me :). It's not my job and honnestly I don't want it. It could be of some use in a group exp or even, eventually, in raid, but way too much for solo. I don't know for you, but I don't die too much when I go solo and when I do a mistake, death is usually the price to pay ;).<br />
And for druid, it's no too :p. They can already replace a cleric in a hard ldon (with a slower ;)) just for healing and I don't want to ear the HUGE cleric/paladin moaning if the druids (or us) got a rez ;).<br />
Much better healing power for both druids and shamans, I can understand, but not more ;).<br />
<br />
Melee AA... what's the use ? :p... for group or raid, if we got a better healing, I don't think you should have time for melee between heal and debuff ;) (or you are lazy or your guild has hundred shamans :p). And for solo, root &amp; rot is more efficiant than melee and heal ;).<br />
<br />
For the SoE, Levit, EB idea, I don't really care :p. I think the most useful would be levit and inviso to clerics ;).<br />
<br />
Giving a 120 secs dot to cleric... this one made me laught, really :D. Not that's a bad idea, huhu, but we are the first to &quot;whine&quot; that our disease dot are useless due to their duration ;). Until you want clerics feeling the same way, I just don't see the point :p (but I still think it could be funny *evil grin*).<br />
<br />
Anyway, the three things I think we need upgrade are :<br />
Our slow (who isn't anymore more useful than any other slow with the mitigation), but I can't see how to improve it without making it too much powerful.<br />
<br />
Our healing power who is way too much behind Druid. I always said that we should have the same healing power than druids. We slow/tank or root and rot, they snare/kite or root and rot... saying they desserve more healing than us because of slow is not a valid point ;).<br />
<br />
Our DPS who just suck bad. More efficiant quick  DoTs or a better/faster nuke, I don't care, but something worth casting in group or raid that contribute to the DPS ;).<br />
<br />
But it was debating over and over and over, I won't restart this :p (who said too late ? :D)<br />
<br />
And about a DA, hmmmm... I only have a 8 slots spellbar, before getting this spell, I better beg SoE to give us 2 or 3 slots first ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">We complain about our disease dots when we're in a fast experience group.<br />
<br />
How many of us complain about disease dots when we're solo'ing?  The clerics want something to help them solo more easily - I'd say they already bring enough desireability to groups.  Our disease dots are the most effecient things we've got to solo - and if that's what it takes, then share 'em.<br />
<br />
A long reuse 70 - 80% AA rez on a timer won't be anymore overpowering for us than a 100% AA rez on a solo'ing cleric that can virtue and Supernal Elixir his pet for 7 hours while dotting a mob.<br />
<br />
The game's gotten gray enough already that I don't think a little more sharing among the priest classes is such a terrible thing.  Each class would still have their strong suites, but seriously - do any of you actually CARE if clerics get an invis/sow/lev/EB combo spell or a 120 second dot... heck, make it cold resist for all I care, but if they whine we can't be upgraded because they can't be upgraded and the shaman don't want to share any of our abilities, I just want to make sure they realize that by and large shaman really don't CARE if clerics get persistant pets, sow/invis, or increased dots for solo'ing.  Heck, I encourage it if that's what it will take to get our heals looked at. Why should they be the only priest that has so much trouble solo'ing or moving around?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Moregar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">This seems like a very viable option....give Shaman an AA ability with a long reuse timer that allows them to summon the group members back to the zone.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>trolebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Reading this thread I had an idea. <br />
<br />
What do you think of a potion that did a &quot;gate to corpse&quot;?<br />
<br />
It would port the user to his latest copse (no rez, just port). <br />
<br />
This way, people could have this potions in the bank, and self-port themselves to the death spot. <br />
<br />
Now that i read it, seems a bit overpowering :) Maybe make it cleric-only? (so they can make a fast recovery)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Healing is just our most critical issue, well - depending on what SOE sees us as I guess.  Maybe we're fine healers as is according to where they want us, but if SOE is going to be looking at these things, let's look at the big picture overall too.  And if SOE thinks we're fine as healers now, then what other tools do we have?<br />
<br />
The other stuff isn't mission-critical, but it's a valid concern and definatly worth brainstorming about.  Giving clerics those mega-proccing melee hammers to give them some &quot;fun&quot; ability wasn't mission-critical either.<br />
<br />
And I agree with clerics, solo'ing for them is an excercise in frustration on any living mob because of how hard things hit for these days.  They can't get in there with those &quot;popcorn mallets&quot; and swing away/stun with their HoTs up, just like we really can't stand toe to toe with a mob anymore either solo.  So what does that leave them?  Nukes that are only marginally better than ours, roots, and stun?  Clerics want to be able to solo better to lighten up about us healing better, I say let 'em solo if they want to if that's what it takes and I'll stand behind giving them tools to help them with that.</div></div><hr />

Maybe even make it like a zombie-type effect.  Instead of resurrection illness, make it a detrimental type effect that has all the symptoms of rez sickness but lasts UNTIL the player is rezzed.  That would stop folks from just doing it to call someone in and not rezzing them.  Just &quot;something&quot; to help in those situations in GoD and abroad where the only rezzer dies and the group has to go back to square one.</div></div><hr />

Aye.  this is huge.  People aren't making groups without a rezzer period.<br />
for exactly this reason.<br />
<br />
I don't even mind eating xp loss, I do mind having to waste 3 hours because the rezzer died, deep in a trial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">- I like the 85% res idea... 85% is enough that people would accept it... but not enough that you'll say &quot;screw clerics&quot;.<br />
<br />
- Give each class CH as it stands now... identical, no change.    <br />
<br />
- Give each class a strong, direct, slow heal.   (Lets clerics be 10% better)<br />
- Give each class a &quot;not as strong&quot; , direct, fast heal (Let clerics be 10% better)<br />
<br />
- Let clerics keep group heals, and group HoTs<br />
- Let Druids get the best &quot;regen&quot; type spells.<br />
- Give druids a small HoT, smaller than shamans.<br />
- Let Shamans keep their HoT spells, and &quot;regen&quot; (but let druids have an edge there).<br />
- Give shamans endurance regen<br />
- Druids already have mana regen<br />
- Give clerics a spell that does mana+endur regen, but neither as good as a shaman or druid.<br />
<br />
Now... all priests can heal, all priests can res.   Clerics are still better... but just on the basis of heals alone... they're darn close.<br />
<br />
But we have the hard part left... why pick a cleric?  Why pick a shaman?  Why pick a druid?   They all want to feel the love.<br />
<br />
Shamans... we have the mana regen, we have the soloing power, and we have slows.    I'd say we're done with the above heal/res changes.<br />
<br />
Druids... traveling, evacing, direct damage DPS.   Maybe they're even done.  <br />
<br />
But Clerics... what , oh what, can clerics get?    I dunno... they could revamp the stun lines... make them effective on most mobs, low mana costs.     <br />
<br />
They could expand upon the &quot;Vie&quot; line of spells... clerics can help &quot;mitigate&quot; damage better. <br />
<br />
Let them nuke middle of the ground between druids and shamans.   A cleric can represent DPS through DDs, but not at the level of a druid.<br />
<br />
Let them truly kick undead ass.    Not just efficency... but big numbers too.<br />
<br />
I don't know if that's enough... I  think groups today looks to max dps in everything, from BoT to LDON to GoD trials.<br />
<br />
This is just stuff off the top of my head... I guess I'm thinking of comments I've seen from WoW, where raw healing power of the priests will be equal... any are viable healers... but the clerics will be better... and each class has abilities they bring to a group.</div></div><hr />

A reverse rez would be useful. You target the player,<br />

if you wipe, and had the forsight to bind the Cleric<br />

<br />
This is a neat idea, but IMO WAY too overpowering.  Especially if it's just targetable on anyone - or even self targetable.  At that point, who would care where they died anymore in relation to where their corpse was ... a spell that you could cast on a guy at the bank in PoK that would REZ him, invis him, and TP him directly to his corpse?? That would so trivialize CRs as to make summoning corpses, heck, even traveling to far off zones or mob spawns if you leave a corpse there, a piece of cake ... imagine just leaving a corpse next to nnnnn mob's lair and every so often getting a &quot;reverse rez&quot; to your corpse to go check on it, with free invis.  It's a good idea, but I see WAY too much potential for really bad abuse there, not to mention necro / SK summon corpse line in the event of a total wipe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Warning: Both these ideas are stupid<br />
<br />
How about givin' us shams a 2 hour recast. 0% res, adds 1 hour to the rez timer, allows another res to be cast on top of it (for exp gain) and makes the person receiving it 100% drunk? because we're simply forcing the soul back into the body and it's disoriented :b<br />
<br />
Give the druid one also except it's reincarnation and polymorphs the person into a random animal model in the zone (or a wolf or bear if none is present) who can't cast spells and has melee skills cut to like 20% for 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
Both have drawbacks of making the recipient thematically useless for a while, but gets the job done of bringing someone back to thier corpse.</div></div><hr />

New shm AA ability summons player to corpse.<br />
<br />
Like a reverse nec summon body.  Give it a 30 min refresh or something.<br />
Doesn't rez you just brings you back to body.  Would allow clr or other classes to return to fight while still being able to rez later.  The refresh and having to be cast on corpse would prevent it being used as CoH.<br />
<br />
It may just be late and i'm missing something but I can't think of any way this could be misused or would step on anyother classes abilities.</div></div><hr />

better patch/quick heals for shamans and druids. more so for shamans. maybe a quested spell like the druid's quested LoY heal.<br />
<br />
higher dodge cap for clerics.<br />
<br />
stronger undead dots for clerics.<br />
<br />
possible a spirit summon spell. summon body to corpse like a rez, but no exp back and can still be rezzed for exp. dunno if it should be like a coth summon and have health and mana uneffected and buffs not stripped, or if mana/buffs get stripped and health low. maybe strip buffs and leave hp and mana at half?</div></div><hr />
