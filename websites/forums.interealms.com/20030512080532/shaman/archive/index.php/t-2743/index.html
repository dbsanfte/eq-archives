Arkand Eagleseeker's Guide to Canni-dancing <br />
<br />
First, let me make sure you all know there's nothing secret about the canni-dance. Verant is well aware of it's usefulness and the design of Cannibalize may have been intended for this use. In fact, one friend of mine was taught the dance by a GM (not a guide, a Verant employed server GM). <br />
<br />
Canni-dancing is, to put it mildly, annoying. It requires significant micro=management, interferes with conversation, and causes the other healers in the group to be constantly on edge; however, it has significant advantages for long term and emergency mana production. <br />
<br />
First, let's understand how mana is generated. Every 6 seconds, the server sends a HP and mana update to the client. The amount of HP and mana gained are dependent on a number of factors, but the important one for the canni-dance is sitting state. If the PC is sitting at the moment the server does it's calculations, the PC recieves sitting HP and mana regen. The number for HP is dependent on level and spell/item regeneration. The number for mana is dependent on the meditation skill, clarity/manasong, and the rare Flowing Thought items. The equation for meditation seems to change over skill, but at 200+ skill, it seems to run at skill/10, capped at 25/tick. Lower levels have reported skill/5, so the effect of meditation skill may suffer from diminished returns. Regardless of the actual lower level med-&gt;mana equation,. skill/10 will be used in this document. Further, a tick is defined as 6 seconds long, and begins with the HP/mana update. <br />
<br />
Cannibalize first comes into the Shaman's life at L24. Med skill at this point should be 125, or 12 mana/tick. Cannibalize converts 50HP to 20mana at this point (casting time is 2 sec, recast 5). So merely by standing and chain-casting Cannibalize, the PC gains mana much faster than medding. There is a HP cost, of course, but emergency mana production is greatly advantaged. In 15 seconds, the Shaman can gain enough mana to cast the L19 Healing spell, which could be a lifesaver. The actual maximum mana production rate of Cannib alone is 20x6/5 = 24 mana/tick and the HP loss is 60/tick. There is, however, another way to use Cannib that will serve to greatly increase long term mana production. <br />
<br />
One can notice that the casting time, 2 seconds, is significantly less than a 6 second tick. That means cannib can be cast immediately after a HP/mana tick, and then be sitting down long before the next mana tick arrives. The recast time is 5 seconds which means the spell can then be cast after the next tick. By casting Cannibalize in between the HP/mana regeneration ticks, the SHM can gain 12+20 mana per 6 second tick, or 32 mana per tick. This exceeds the straight chain-casting of Cannib by 33%, making it faster mana production. Additionally, the PC loses 50 HP/tick rather than the 60 of chain casting Cannib. This is more mana/second for fewer HP/second. It also limits the harm of fizzles, since a SHM can recast the spell before the next tick, thereby maintaining the higher mana regen rate despite fizzling. With straight cannib casting, fizzles decrease overall mana production rates. This is the Canni-dance -- casting Cannib between the HP/mana regeneration updates. <br />
<br />
To Canni-dance, first go to full screen 800x600 mode. You want to be able to bring up the transparent inventory window, which has this very convenient HP report for you. Mana and HP are regenned at exactly the same time, so that HP meter will serve to tell you when the tick occurs. So, if you aren't damaged, stand and cast Canni once, then sit. Wait until you see the HP's increase, then stand, cast Canni, and sit. Some people create a hotkey to do this (/sit off, /cast x, /pause y, /sit). You'll need to experiment to find the proper /pause value. I have found that in raid situations, there's too many lag spikes to trust a hot key, so I personally don't use it. To each his own, use what you think is best. After that, just wait for the HP to increase again and repeat. Be careful, you CAN kill yourself with Cannibalize, and it costs exp. <br />
<br />
If you can't enter 800x600 mode, then you'll have two options for detecting HP/mana updates. The first and best is for teh SHm to self-target and watch the higher resolution HP update in the selection bar. The second is to watch teh lower resolution HP bar under the SHM's name. The worst possible choice is to stare at teh mana bar, since the mana bar updates in smaller increments than a regenning HP bar. <br />
<br />
The problem with Canni-dancing at L24 is inefficient healing. Regen is the PC's most cost effective healing spell, at 5mana/tick for 10 minutes, or 500 HP for 100 mana. Converting that 500 through Cannib becomes 200 mana/10 minutes, and when you subtract the cost of regen itself, the actual mana gain is at best 100mana/10 seconds. If the PC has access to healing through other means (Bard healing song, for instance), more mana can be generated. <br />
<br />
At L39, the Canni-dance really starts to take off. Chloroplast increases the regeneration to 1500HP for 200 mana. Through Canni 1 (at this point, 50-&gt;23mana), this converts to 690 mana, minus the 200 casting, is net 490mana/15 minutes. Cannib 2 converts 67-&gt;28mana, for only 626, net 426 mana per 15 minutes. Now, that would seem to indicate the Shaman should stick with Canni 1 over Canni 2, but Canni2 provides more mana faster in emergency situations, and cuts down the number of Canni castings by 33%. This improves the micro-management a little, and increases the Shaman's communicativeness. Overall, teh spell may not be more efficient, but it's easier to use and worth the downside. <br />
<br />
L51 also inherently aids the Canni-dance by increasing sitting HP regeneration from 2 to 4. This occurs again at L55 when it rises to 5/tick. Any regeneration increase converts into mana for the shaman <br />
<br />
Regrowth at L52 is the next boon to Canni-dancing. at 2250HP over 15 minutes. This converts through Canni 2's 67-&gt;31mana to 1041mana, or net 704mana/15 minutes. <br />
<br />
And at L54, Canni 3 converts 74-&gt;36mana. This increases mana production to 1094/15 minutes, 794 net. The biggest problem with Canni 3 is the horrible fizzle rate. It runs about 20%, so the Shaman finds chained fizzles common. Don't try to cast a fourth Canni, or you'll miss the med tick. <br />
<br />
This continues until L58, where the Canni-dance ends with Canni 4, right? Wrong. Canni 4 changes the rules, but the canni-dance can continue, should the Shaman desire it to. Canni 4 changes the casting time, so that many think the Canni-dance stops being possible, but it only changes the details of the dance. Canni 4 is a 2.5 second cast with 7 second re-cast, and the conversion ratio is the same as Canni 3, 148-&gt;82 instead of 74-&gt;41. (Other spells can be cast 3 seconds later, but Canni 4 is grey for 7 seconds.) Canni 4 greatly improves the fizzle rate, down to about 5%. Since 7 seconds exceeds the 6 second tick, it can't be used for sequential ticks, but obviously could be used every other tick. So first and msot obviously, the Canni-dance continues through L59 at one cast every other tick. <br />
<br />
Canni 4 can, however still be used every tick. Consider the tick to have 6 steps. Step 1 is the HP regen, step 2-6 happen one second later each. So, the first canni 4 cast on tick one occurs at step 2. The next canni 4 cast occurs at step 3 of tick 2. The third Canni 4 takes place on step 4 of Tick 3. Tick 4 must be skipped, though, because the 2.5 seconds casting would have the Shaman still standing at Step 1 of Tick 5. The fourth Canni cast can occur at Step 1 of Tick 5. So, to increase mana production further from Canni 3, the Shaman casts 3 Canni 4's where he previously cast 4 Canni 3's. This improves the mana generation rate, with no change at all in HP-&gt;mana conversion rates. The net result is an incredible shortening of the dance length, decreasing micro-management and increasing communication time. <br />
<br />
At L60, the Shaman receives Torpor. Torpor has undergone many alterations, and is 1200HP over 24 seconds for 200 mana. (It is possible to get 1500 out of it, if you experiment and figure out when to cast it. It seems to last 25 seconds, not 24, so a 5th tick can be caught according to some Shamans.) It suffers three disadvantages: it snares the target, it slows the target's attack rate, and it can only be cast in group (preventing usefulness on PvP as an unresistable snare on PC's fleeing combat). But, given the incredible HP/second and ratio of this spell, the mana production potential is obvious. Given that many Shamans specialize in Alteration, the 200 mana cost is actually mis-leading: it can cost very much less. For use as a mana producer, the disadvantages are unimportant. <br />
<br />
Many L60 Shamans with Canni 4 and Torpor never Med again. Chain-casting Canni 4 is much faster mana production than Med'ing. There is a way, however, to still increase mana production using the old Canni-dance. During the casting of Canni 4, there are 4 seconds worth of time where no casting can occur. Simply sitting during this time will provide a 4/6 chance of catching a Med tick and a free 25 mana and a few HP for sitting. This may not be a large increase in OOM-&gt;FM time, but it will help a little. <br />
<br />
Some Shamans have measured tehir mana generation times at L60 and compared the various techniques. Straight meditation runs on the order of 10 minutes. Canni4/Torpor with no dancing runs a little over 4 minutes. <br />
<br />
You'll notice we've gone from &quot;Canni 1 and Regen being an aid to meditation&quot; to &quot;medding being an aid to Canni 4 and Torpor.&quot; <br />
<br />
For the Shaman alone, that's the limit of the Canni-dance mana generation: the Shaman can not increase the rate without external aid . There are ways for others to help the Canni-dance. <br />
<br />
Paladins that have the Deepwater Helm can essentially heal the Shaman for free. It's an additional 100HP/8 seconds or so, but if the Paladin is FM, it definitely helps, especially for the L51-55 Shaman. The Shaman must be denied the better Clerical Resolution and Heroism buffs. <br />
<br />
Bards can do two things. The first, and more common at lower levels, is Healing Song. The Healing song converts to mana much better than anything but the L31 Mana song. Contrary to some information, Mana song can be twisted, so a good Bard can have Mana song up for the other casters, and Healing song up for the Shaman. A less obvious twisting song for Shamans is Shield of Song, a L49 Shield. Cannib will eat this damage shield first, so essentially it provides 20HP regeneration every tick. It too can be twisted with healing and/or mana song to further increase mana generation. <br />
<br />
Druid's with Group Regens can help, since it's free healing, but over the long term, since these lag behind Shaman single target regens, the Shaman can be better off sticking with the superior HP/second. <br />
<br />
Good Clerics loathe seeing anyone damaged, and will instinctively heal the Shaman out of combat. By L50, most Clerics have gotten used to constantly damaged Shamans, but a few just can't take it and will toss things like Celetial Healing at the Shaman. If the Cleric is constantly LoM because of your Cannibalizing, then it's up to the Shaman to stop the Cleric from healing him non-combat. If the Cleric won't stop on his own, then the Shaman needs to space out the Canni-dance so that damage stays too small for the Cleric to top-up heal. Most Clerics will not worry too much if the Shaman is down less than one bubble, especially because usually the Cleric's heal will overflow and lose efficiency. Just keep the damage down ove rthe shrot term, you'll still do the same amount ove rthe long term. <br />
<br />
Monks will often love to practice their Bind Wounds on the Shaman. Below L50, this requires Cannib'ing down to below 50% HP, so it shouldn't be a typical tactic. MOB's see low HP and jump on the PC. Try to keep above 40% HP, so that if a room spawns on you or someone trains a MBO past you, you don't get jumped on for low HP aggro. <br />
<br />
One problem spell is Rune. This line provides a HP buffer, but once those HP are gone, the spell is gone too. Unfortunately, Cannib eats the Rune first. Many Enchanters understand this problem and will Rune Shamans only at the last minute, but Enchanters that doesn't quite understand, need be informed on the futility of Runing Shamans. <br />
<br />
The Cannidance is simply the fastest mana production in the game. Not even the Necromancers can come close to Shaman mana production rates at L60. It's annoying, it's tiring, it's even embarrassing, but no one can fault a Shaman that Canni-dances. It decreases downtime and therefore increases exp production. That, in the end, is worth all the trouble. <br />

<br />
This guide is a little outdated ; The first 3 Canni spells all have the same re-cast time and there is a noticable hp/mana increase as you go up as well. Canni 4 can be stuck between ticks, but it's very very close and even the littlest bit of lag will prevent it from happening.  Nor does the guide include the Alt Ability Cannibalization. (aka; Cani5)<br />
<br />
<br />
 Here's info from the spell.dat<br />
<br />
Cani I:<br />
1: Decrease Hitpoints by 50 <br />
2: Increase Mana by 20 (L24) to 28 (L60) <br />
.4 Mana per HP @ 24<br />
.56 Mana per HP @ 60<br />
<br />
Cani II:<br />

<br />
If you use the old non-fullscreen mode (F10 IIRC) - that's the one that has 'in a window view'. If you press 'I' to get the shaman symbol on the left.. it rotates every 6 seconds.. which is quite handy.<br />
<br />
I use that 90% of the time when canabalising.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Profundo Basso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mana song is not really twistable.  It can be &quot;Pumped&quot;, not twisted.  Because of an idiosyncracy in the lvl 20 and 31 mana songs it can be recast immediately for a (roughly) 25% increase in mana production.  Heal song works differently and recasting has no effect beyond increasing the length of time the song is active.<br />
<br />
The best way to describe it to a Shaman is, &quot;Mana song stacks and Heal doesn't.&quot;  Anything that stacks can be improved by casting over and over.  As limited only by recast time.  Most bards don't do this because there is usually something better to sing than straight mana song.  And its the most annoying form of singing because you cast quicker than once every 6 secs.  Kind of like keeping a 4-5 song twist going.  During downtime when everyone else is chatting, the bard will be pumping mana song and/or heal song, wishing s/he could join the chat.<br />
<br />
So, the impact on Shaman?  Asking for heal in addition to mana will  decrease total mana production.  And the bard will probably do it if asked, but s/he'd rather just put on mana song and kick back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Or, you can do like me, and just canni-dance whenever it becomes available.  You'll win some, lose some, but won't go insane trying to time it.  /grin<br />
<br />
And Canni 5 changes all the rules.<br />
<br />
Heheh.  And if you think your clerics freak out with Canni 1/2/3/4, just wait til they see Canni 5 for the first time!  Without buffs I have about 2100 hp.  Getting enough mana to give myself Focus after a death is quite amusing (don't do this when mobs are in camp!!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Boraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Great Guide, thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just a comment, canni4's recast time is way less than 7 seconds.  Its more like 3 seconds, making chain casting canni4 (and probably even canni3) a faster mana regen than canni dancing.<br />
<br />
The tradeoff is regen speed vs effeciency.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I may be wrong, but I am fairly sure that the rotating shaman symbol is not synchronised to the actual tick. It does rotate approximately every 6 seconds, but it is not in synchronicity with the tick.<br />
to verify this, you only have to target yourself, cast regrowth on yurself, sit down and watch the small incremental jumps in your health - stadying these for a few ticks will soone connvince you that the rotating shaman symbol is best ignored</div></div><hr />

I'm very technically challenged, and haven't a clue how to customize my interface, so I've been opening my inventory and watching the health numbers, hitting the hotkey I made as to Blackdust's suggestion whenever the hps went up instead of trying to do it as the symbol turns. Is there a lag time between the update of the hitpoints on screen and the tic to determine if you are standing or sitting?<br />
