New Stuff on Test (http://www.graffe.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=11040) <br />
<br />
this is what I am referring to:<br />
<br />
Inspect Buffs<br />
This ability allows group members to target their companions and inspect their buffs.<br />
<br />
lame that it's going to cost aa's or something like that, but what a great thing to have in my opinion!<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: hmmmmm, at first I assumed it would be in a window, like with those UI timers for buffs...but after reading again, you have to target to get the buff info - still nice, but would be more useful if you could put it in a window all the time</div></div><hr />
