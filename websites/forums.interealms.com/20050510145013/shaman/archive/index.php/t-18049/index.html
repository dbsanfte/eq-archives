<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stareff2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I wanted to Share what I have found to be a tremendous success, mybe others arent doing it and would like to try it.<br />
<br />
Whenever I slow a Mob I like to get in the thick of it and Stand literally next to the MT. By doing this, the tank can resume aggro and I take no damage whatsoever. Its rare that the mob even pays attention to me when I do this.<br />
<br />
This also helps the tanks mitigate dmg faster by not having to regain aggro and chase the mob around.<br />
<br />
Also we are great CC whenever a Chanter/bard isnt around. I will go toe to toe in order to keep a mob off the healer until I can get them rooted and slowed. I have enough HP now to just stand there and tyake a few shots while I get my slow off first and then root.<br />
<br />
We are also great splitters if done with the same technique as above.<br />
<br />
Play hard, play fair and play like youre the best shaman in the lands....</div></div><hr />

This is a necessary and, honestly, known tactic to do when your MT isn't a Knight-class and you want to get a slow off when it'll do the most benefit for said tank and take it a bit easier on your healer.<br />
<br />
I agree this is a good behavior to exhibit, but I'll say this isn't a new tactic.....</div></div><hr />

Aggree I dont think it is new but I do think its not used ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This is a very commonly used tactic and a very wise one, so you have definetly come to the right conclusion my friend.<br />
<br />
Depending on situation i usually stand toe to toe with the mob as to not force the tank to chase it if i should mess up.<br />
<br />
If you try to slow from distance at a raid, and gain aggro, you will not only force the tank to chase it, you will also position the mob where it might hit healers or casters with AE.<br />
<br />
When exping, i try a few times, i slow lands good and the tank knows how to get aggro, i usually risk slowing from distance, but never when they are resistant or i dont know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't seem to get too much slow aggro unless I'm grouped with a weak warrior, and I'm not saying warriors are generally weak, because I group with some warriors that can hold aggro well even with me slowing as early as I can land it.<br />
<br />
I also use slow to split and root park when there's no mezzer around - it's a great technique - I just wish more groups were aware of it.  All too often I'll see tanks split up after I intentionally cause slow aggro on an add or multi so I can peel and park it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree, tanks need to just stay on the mob, we are different form other casters and will yell for help when needed.<br />
<br />
Also Ive found that alot of Warriors just have sucky taunt and thats usually when slow produces aggro on the shammy.<br />
<br />
Alot to be said about a good taunting warrior.........</div></div><hr />

I know the pain.  I cannot easily count the number of times I have gotten the &quot;Loading...please wait&quot; screen on account of the MA thought I was in trouble when I pull an unwanted addition to our little swarea out to a suitable area and begin dealing with it.  Most of the times when we get an add, I get laughs when I throw out the &quot;/g I got the add&quot;.  It usually goes well, but an occasional druid, or sometimes my fat fingering the keyboard, will get me killed.  What is it about Ogre SK's and them being aggro hog's?  It seems if they don't have all 5 add's on them, they aren't happy! :p Aggro envy I suppose. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This is like, Basic Slowing Strategy 01.   Good that you came to the same conclusion that the rest of us did :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">To take it a step further, I'll sometimes use my slow and my position as a way to move the mob to where it should be.  Tanks/melee often start fighting a mob before the puller has brought it all the way back to camp, but i can always remedy that!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This method is a good way of slowing when you are unable to gauge aggro with any precision. <br />
<br />
However, when you get more experienced at gauging aggro standing at max range is way better because of the aggro modifier that range gives you. The aggro modifier at 150 range is roughly 0.6-0.7. This only applies to raid level mobs obviously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">In exp groups with warriors I don't know, I stand shoulder to shoulder with them while slowing, at least until I know how well they gain and maintain aggro. On raids, the warriors in my guild are awesome so I stay at a distance. The worst thing that can happen is I get summoned.  :eek:</div></div><hr />
