    Getting to the point people are calling people whiners and people are telling people not to whine about the whiners and everyone is getting uptight. I mean ive seen this on a topic here and there before. But its getting into all the posts now. The mood i mean. People are pissed about the focus item and pissed to a degree about the expansion coming or the trolls getting booted or torpor not droppping or the punk newer shaman having it to easy and walking to school up hills etc etc etc etc etc etc. <br />
   <br />
My suggestion take a day or two and forget all the damn eq topics and go kill ****!! or play another game and kill ****. Take the family out , take yourself out and do something (no killing **** here thats frowned upon). Just starting to get ugly out there. This is a good forum lets keep it that way regardless of all thats going on in eq atm please. Thanks for listening.</div></div><hr />
