<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shaft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Can you connect the two computers somehow?  Network would work, or if you could just take the hard drive out of one and attach it to the other.. a direct copy will work fine, EQ doesn't touch the registry.  Not sure on the hard drive bit, I have no idea if laptops use the same connections, and if not, if there are adapters available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks to my roommates, my original everquest CDs were lost long ago.  Whenever someone formats and wants to install EQ, they just copy my entire EQ folder to their comp and it works fine.  Try that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>JESTER</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thank you I will try to just copy it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">if you cant network the PCs you could always burn a copy of your EQ folder, though it is pretty big nowadays</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dimdim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yep, copy it across, saves having to re-download patches/zones too, I always copy it to an identical path so there's no issues of the new downloads going to a different directory (this may have changed but I had this issue once).</div></div><hr />
