<br />
Is it like Spirit of the Wood for druids? Heal per tick? Duration?<br />
You know just some general info on it so i can see if its worth buying.</div></div><hr />

that is lvl 1 2 and 3.<br />
<br />
I have lvl 1 now it is pretty nice.  My only complaint on it is for some reason it won't stack with diaku but I rarly use that spell anymore for anything but a junk buff.  <br />
<br />
It will stack with quinessence/other hot heals that part is pretty nice.</div></div><hr />

It stacks with celestial regen, paragon, Q/BoT, Fateseer's boon, but does not stack with SotW, Diaku and rabid bear atm. It's instant cast and well worth the points imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We get 36 sec on ancestral aid with the SCRM AA. Is nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">1. Do the increases to stats only last 5 ticks?<br />
2. Does the HoT component stack with Q?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Foradce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The stats last as long as the HoT. It stacks with every heal over time except for Spirit of the wood and it's upgrade from what I've seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xilrasis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the info</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>StormCrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have level 1 and it is useful, not my favorite AA but it has saved a group a few times.<br />
Would be nice if it would stack with diaku but until it does I'm just using VotB if i really feel a need for the extra str and dex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What I like best is that it stacks with 1.5 epic clicky.  I have level one of Ancestral Aid, so that's nearly 700hp/tick on top of whatever other healing I'm throwing around.<br />
<br />
Firing off both of them at once has saved my group's bacon several times already in the very short time I've had them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I group with a pair of RL buddies, a cleric and paladin, with the Clerics Divine Arbitration, his HoT AA, the paladins waves and my HoT AA we rarely have to do much healing....we use our own chat channel to co-ordinate and it works out well.<br />
Is it the best AA we have? nah, but its at least as useful as RC or VP and should rank up there as get ASAP. I am currently grinding out 5 AA to bank for when I hit 68 to get the second rank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This AA has saved me a few times now when I'm getting beat on and just can't channel that Trushar, this is instant cast so you can't get interrupted.  Also works great when your running from a mob and can't stop to cast a heal.  That extra 1390 hp (for level 1) can make the difference sometimes.</div></div><hr />
