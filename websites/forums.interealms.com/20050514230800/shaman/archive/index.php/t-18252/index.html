Morden Rasp has it in his possesion in Nedaria !!<br />
<br />
Exterminate the slimy pests.<br />
<br />
(Long story short: Broken skull clan steals Grozmok stone from Grobb. The poor, trol saints go looking for it. Meanwhile slimy, despicable, coniving, backstabbing (not wrong about rogues mind you), goodie, blackhearted (not meant as a compliment) frogs sneak in and stage a coup. ) <br />
<br />
We have found the stone, nothing can stop us from true victory!</div></div><hr />

But Nedaria is commonly thought to be the launching point of the new expansion. I bet trolls get a new home :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Grozmok stone is a religious artifact that has sacred writings from Innoruuk carved all over it.  It was stolen from Grobb by the Luggalds of Broken Skull Rock.  Naturally, this pissed off the Grobbian Trolls who went after the Luggald's, leaving Grobb with a skeleton crew of defenders.  Then Mithaniel Butthole Marr made Frogloks 2.0 and they zerged their way to victory.<br />
<br />
Basically, as far as the Lore goes, if the Trolls recover the Grozmok they may be able to rally enough forces to take Grobb back.  I'd imagine that they'd have aid from the Teir'dal in this, as they don't seem to be too happy about all the trolls in the Foreign Quarter.  Other possible sources of aid are the Dismal Rage and Freeport Militia as the Guktans are allied with the Knights of Truth in North Freeport.<br />
<br />
in game, what happens when we loot it off Morden Rasp?<br />
<br />
More than likely he doesn't have a loot table.  Though I'm willing to wager 2cp that he drops cloth caps.<br />
<br />
sorry to be such a noob, but... well... I'm a noob.<br />
<br />
Dude, never apologize for being new and asking questions.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmmm was hoping trolls would get a new city all to themselfs instead of taking back old one, but im not a troll so my opinion is worthless ;) Maybe you guys could switch back and forth with the city, frogs get it every other weekend, take turns cleaning it once a month? :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thyrm Jarlson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmm, what level is Morden Rasp? hehe</div></div><hr />

Funniest thing I heard all day. You earn yourself some faction points.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks, Meku.  I try.<br />
<br />
As for the question...<br />

<br />
Morden Rasp is level 65.  According to lore he is also a rogue.  Not sure if he's targetable for melee or not.  I'd guess he has a ton of hp and hits fairly hard, also.  Haven't been to the camp in Nedaria's Landing yet but I know there's at least three others in the camp with him, all level 65.<br />

<br />
Tondal is a dark elf in plate.  Probably a Shadowknight.<br />
<br />

<br />
Vdrae Qix`Tki is probably also a dark elf because of the apostrophe.  I'd guess a caster of some kind.  No image at link.<br />

Ieandra Pael also has no mug shot available at this time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Morden Rasp was targettable, but unkillable (your spell doesn't land) when I tried to murder him last time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I still think the trolls (maybe with some inkie assistance) are going to take over Freeport.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zugarbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Giving Grobb back to the Trolls would be retarded. It is now Gukta and should remain so. Just give the Trolls a new city and don't make the froggies homeless!<br />
<br />
Oh, and could someone PLEASE change the name on the stone in POK? sheesh!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I will second the freeport theory.  Trolls kick the paladins out of Freeport, getting some revenge on Marr and setting up part of EQ2's backstory.<br />
That would kind of suck, but also be kind of cool.  Think of all the Freeport quests (epic quests anyone) that could become a little more hazardous.  <br />
<br />
I think it would be hilarious if they replaced the NFP Guards with Trolls, desecrated/renovated the Temple of Marr (moving some Pally/Cleric NPC's &amp; their quests to Grobb?) and then subjugated the weak humans in Freeport w/ the assistance of their lackeys in the Freeport Militia.  I.E.  Leave 80-90% of the venders and NPC's in place, but have big ugly Trolls all over NFP corners.  Would make the run to the bank a little more exciting. :D <br />
<br />
I could live with that, and the storyline would fit more than some of the other odd twists they've put in over the years.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

Great, so I get to buy PoP II in order to visit my new home? :rolleyes:  No thanks..  I've already bought one expansion of which 90% is for the top 2% of players, I won't be fooled again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hm... I can see how it would work.<br />
<br />
Simply move the Dismal Rage from the sewers and into North Freeport along with the Trolls, then kick the bards and paladins into the sewers.</div></div><hr />

I'd like to see a poll from Sony on whether the frogs should be evicted, obliterated, or left alone.  Myself, I vote for makin em lunch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Got no idea which expansion you talking about. More then half of the PoP zones are now open to everyone, one more is easily accessible via quest. And a lot more then 2% of people are in elementals/time.</div></div><hr />

Seriously... why would trolls wanna live in freeport? Way too cramped. I loved grobb as my sk. Easy to navigate, small city with all you need in it.</div></div><hr />
