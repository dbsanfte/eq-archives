<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok guys,<br />
<br />
I know we all want it left alone, but reality seems to be it HAS to be nerfed (for reasons I STILL don't comprehend) ....<br />
<br />
Yeah yeah, I know you will say &quot;the DPS&quot; ... but I ask you, if you have 12 Shaman on a Raid and 12 Melee hitting a target, how much DPS can those 12 Shaman combined add to the Raid with Panther ?!?!?  Now substitute the 12 Shaman for 12 Wizzards, and how much DPS can they add ?!?!?<br />
<br />
Anyway, they want to nerf it ... I want to know what YOU would swallow as a nerf ....<br />
<br />
Tek</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">oh good, another thread dedicated to panther.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, well ...<br />
<br />
Judging by the (dodgy) logic behind why the nerf is needed, it is obvious that numbers and pretty graphs speak louder then reasoning / logic to SoE ....<br />
<br />
Feel free to make long winded posts about why what and how .... but I ask you this ..... if we weren't warned / asked about the planned change they were going to sneak in, what makes you think they have any interesting in reading &quot;reasoning threads&quot; about the subject ....<br />
<br />
I have tried to provide the SoE onlookers with a fast and easy way to see how the Shaman community feels ...<br />
<br />
But if you think writing multi paragraph thread on 500 different boards relating to the subject is going to help more, be my guest :P<br />
<br />
Tek</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you left out adding an agro/hate modifier to the buff...that is my preferred adjustment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Vote none of the above:<br />
<br />
Make the spell a group version, one cast hits 5 targets + pets.<br />
Cannot be targeted on other groups.  Cannot be mgb'd.<br />
Refresh time 1 minute.<br />
<br />
I see that as good for a couple main reasons:<br />
1.  Accomplishes the lowering of dps that Rytan seems to want.<br />
2.  Makes it far less of a hassle for us to maintain.<br />
<br />
Any suggestion by Rytan I've seen so far leaves the spell annoyance factor way to high for me to mem it.  <br />
<br />
The various ideas here:<br />
        Reduce Proc Rate (screws grouping, balances raiding)<br />
	Reduce the Proc EFFECT (screws grouping, balances raiding, too vague, and doubt they'd tune it well)<br />
	Leave as is, but make it GROUP ONLY (annoyance factor remains, while decreasing dps.  lose lose scenario)<br />
	Increase the Recast Time (2x the current annoyance factor)<br />
	Scrap it, give us a 300dps DD (overpowers solo'ijng, provides none of the benefits of zero aggro we currently get )<br />
	Scrap it, give us a 300dps DoT (overpowers solo'ing, provides none of the benefits of zero aggro we currently get)<br />
	Increase the mana (~1000) and duration (~5min) (totally overpowers the spell.  1000 mana for 27,000 damage??.)<br />
<br />
Everyone so far has voted for making it group only.  Why again would I want to accept a tremendous dps nerf, while not gaining anything back?  I don't see what would be so hard about making Panther a group spell.  The only argument one could make for keeping it single target, is that it ties us up and doesn't allow healing/curing to be performed... <br />
<br />
But aren't we primarily healers?  Secondarily debuffers?  And lastly Buffers?  I don't want to be the only healer in a dps group in a raid, if maintaining panther means a couple folks die because I don't have time to heal them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Solemneyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">wheres the option rytan offered to make it hit the whole group at once?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You guys are weak and you'll have no one but yourselves to blame for this nerf. I'm sorry, but that's my honest opinion. This nerf is unwarranted and everyone is folding under the threat of the nerf that's on Test now. (which I'm guessing is the exactly the reason it's on test, so Rytan can come in and play good cop saying how he doesn't like it either and we'll be putty in his hands)<br />
<br />
Heaven forbid we get something useful during the class rebalancing like an honestly useful buff. We're all so used to having our buffs suck that when we finally do get something worth a crap, it seems overpowered. We'll all wish we'd have stood stronger on this when BSTs get their new slow.<br />
<br />

It maybe will be nerfed; but as far as I can tell, no reason has been given why it must be nerfed, and no persuasive reason has been given even why it ought to be nerfed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jahvah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">How about remove the 30 second recast on test, and let the players test it with just the pet change.  Honestly, they have NO data on the actual effectiveness of the spell in it's current form. They didn't trouble shoot, so they don't actually know if it needs to be nerfed.<br />
<br />
They need to follow Rytan's original plan.  Fix the pets (which they did) and leave the rest of the spell alone until they have the data to support further changes.</div></div><hr />

Case in point. Yet another person who thinks that if we bitch more, they will keep it as is, but if we discuss options, we are &quot;bending over&quot;.<br />
<br />
How many other shaman feel this way? Seriously, confess. How many of you feel that the spell is going to be nerfed BECAUSE we &quot;bent over backwards and allowed it to happen&quot;? <br />
<br />
Oh, I found that link. Here ya go Virul. You get to be FIRST!! Head in Ass (http://www.rickywolking.com/news/uploads/HEAD-UP-YER-ASS.jpg)<br />
<br />
Anyone else really wonder why I am so fustrated? Read this guys post. He HONESTLY feels that &quot;most shaman are apparently all too happy to cave in&quot;. No other reason. Absolutely NOTHING regarding the actual semantics of the spell. Just that &quot;most shaman are apparently all too happy to cave in&quot;.<br />
<br />
Yippee Kie Yeah, Mutha Froaka<br />
<br />
(yeah yeah, I know I said a week, whatever, another thing to &quot;get&quot; me on, eh?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oh, for the record, I didnt vote. Here is my latest acceptable adjustment, and its not on the list:<br />
<br />
NO recast time. <br />
NO change to the current cast time.<br />
A SLIGHT increase in mana cost.<br />
A SLIGHT decrease in damage per proc (in addition to the current reduced proc rate on pets)<br />
<br />
And thats it. Hows 700 mana for a 450 dd proc? How about 750 for 400? I think these are the numbers we need to find a &quot;common ground&quot; on, especially if we are going to be so firm on the NO RECAST TIMER aspect of the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">aside from your idea, Blazz, i totally agree with everything you have said in this thread.<br />
<br />
seriously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Why is that reality?  Why does it HAVE to be nerfed?<br />
<br />
It maybe will be nerfed; but as far as I can tell, no reason has been given why it must be nerfed, and no persuasive reason has been given even why it ought to be nerfed.<br />
Mac, the reality is that the spell is going to be adjusted. Period. Time to accept that and try to come up with a plan that SOE and the Crucible can at least agree SUCKS for both sides. (cause both sides actuall agreeing on something POSITIVE won't happen). <br />
<br />
So. What numbers suck for us, yet still suck for SOE? Thats our spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">But Blazz...<br />
<br />
The fundemental problem is group vs. raid scaling.  An appropriate amount of group dps multiplied by a raid is too much.  <br />
<br />
Likewise, if you balance the current spell so its not too much raid dps, it would suck in groups.<br />
<br />
Its a matter of how many targets you have to cast on.<br />
<br />
Rytan hasn't given us a view of what he thinks the spell should provide, so its impossible to come up with something that will appease him.<br />
<br />
If the goal is 300 dps, aggro free.. well thats a solid thing to work with, and we can provide a million different ways to meet that expectation.<br />
<br />
The problem is, Rytan won't ever tell us what his purpose is, so we have to guess what he deems appropriate.<br />
<br />
From what I've read, 600 dps is too high.  He views this as personal damage, not a buff.  He compares a single shaman casting this to a single wizard casting nukes.  I think that is an inappropriate comparsion, but I'll digress if I argue that again.<br />
<br />
The fact remains, Rytan believes that 600 dps is too high.  So we might as well try to work any other angle we can to leave the spell bearable.  Say we could provide 400 dps, and it was an absolute breeze to maintain?  What then?<br />
<br />
So maybe work on that.  Pick a number under this theoretically &quot;bad&quot; 600 dps number, and find solutions.  <br />
<br />
My vote is still a costly 1 minute refresh group buff.  But I don't even think he'd go for that.  What if the group was all pet classes with the pet affinity AA?  Thats 10x targets again.<br />
<br />
All in all, this spell was a bad decision all together.  It gave us a taste of true usefullness on raids after the mob is slowed, and made solo'ing and grouping a joy.  Literally anything you do with spell is going to be a nerf that will seriously piss off shamans for a long time.<br />
<br />
In its current form, there isn't anyway to balance raid vs. grouping, so most likely it'll end up being a recast time, despite all our plees to the contrary.  <br />
<br />
Why say you?  Why would he leave it a single target, annoying recast timed spell?  Well what are they going to give us next expansion??  Yep, you guessed it, a group version.  Just like with FA--&gt;Champion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Blazz, if you weren't the subject of the picture in your link you might have taken a moment to read the comments, adjusted for context and then just stayed gone for the rest of your week.<br />
<br />
So, let me point it out for you.<br />
<br />
Virulence wasn't bitching to bitch but rather pointing out his frustration with all the &quot;shaman compromising&quot; being bantied about when no compromise is needed, warranted or justified! SOE and Rytan have made a HUGE mistake in placing the current form on test. HUGE.<br />
<br />
GIGANTIC.<br />
<br />
MONSTEROUS.<br />
<br />
and .... most importantly ...<br />
<br />
OUTRAGEOUS!!!<br />
<br />
I am in total agreement with him and many other shaman who stand hard and fast on this: NO CHANGE NEEDED - BACK OFF!!<br />
<br />
That is what SOE/Rylan need to do. Back off. Say &quot;oops&quot; and &quot;sorry&quot; and stop right freakin now. There is no easy out for them as far as the humiliation factor goes ... because letting this even make it to test was stupid. But, you know what? The best face-saving and customer service option for them is to face that music. <br />
<br />
Say &quot;oops&quot; and &quot;sorry&quot; and drop the recast delay on test. Give this time to parse with the pet changes and then ... IF THERE IS AN ACTUAL PROBLEM (not theoretical or potential - ACTUAL) ... and only if this is FACT ... work with the community to find a balance.<br />
<br />
So, Blazz ... if you want to whine at folks for saying &quot;F*** YOU, SOE, STOP BEING STUPID&quot; then keep going. You are doing a good job. Almost as good as all the nice things SOE has done for shaman over the last year+ of you being their NUMBER ONE FANBOI! Get a clue - it doesn't matter if shaman are nice or not ... it only matters if shaman can find a way to make them pay negatively if they don't address these problems correctly.<br />
<br />
That happened once ... and was a major contributor to the summits, class representatives and some changes after GoD was released. Of course every other class was up in arms over it ... and as we have seen it was whitewash PR for the most part.<br />
<br />
But I digress ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I don't know why you are so stuck on the zero recast aspect, considering that there are pretty much no other spells with zero recast timers, except for some clicky effects. I would much rather have a recast timer than a reduced proc magnitude for example. Rytan pretty clearly explain the basic issue involved, and that is the ability of the spell to lay down a very large amount of damage in a relatively short time. You say you want to discuss alternatives, but none you are willing to contemplate will address the issue at the heart of all this.<br />
<br />
If you persist in insisting that the spell HAS to have a zero recast time, the only way to make it balanced when used for high dps scenarios is to massively reduce the magnitude of the proc and/or the frequency of the proc. That would balance it in situations where large targets are concerned, but would make it basically useless for normal xp groups. Is that what you want? (because that is what you are essentially asking for).<br />
<br />
Face facts, the spell WILL be reigned in one way or another to prevent it being used to produce massive dps. The only (and best) way for the devs to do this without impacting on its use for xp groups is to impose a recast timer. Whether the current recast timer is just right or too long is debatable, but the fact remains that even as it currently stands on test, it is effectively the best dps spell available, both in terms of damage dealt and in terms of mana effectiveness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Face facts?<br />
<br />
What facts are we facing? The only acknowledged over rated effect of this spell is the pet proc rates. SOE has adjusted these.<br />
<br />
Rylan claiming a theoretical potential damage threshold as compared to a wizard dps is simply stupid. The point has been made that this comparison is like asking for chanter haste nerfage as well as any number of other &quot;buff&quot; damage enhancers because they add much more dps over the course of spell duration.<br />
<br />
It does not produce massive dps ... it produces a moderate dps boost on all targets who have the buff. Just like haste. Just like a DS (if you are getting hit.)<br />
<br />
To buy any of Rylan's logic is equally stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Face facts?<br />

To buy any of Rylan's logic is equally stupid.<br />
<br />
It is more than just a 'moderate' dps boost when it is cast on a large number of melee (pets/pcs).<br />
<br />
There are examples shown where it has cut approximately two minutes from a 6-7 minute encounter.<br />
<br />
30-33% reduction in time as a result of using these spells is a considerable difference.<br />
<br />
I don't want the spell to be changed. Hopefully the pet changes are tested first before going any further, but I wouldn't hold my breath on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gaag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I voted group only, but would like to add the extention that also pets within the group should be targettable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Scowls1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">i didnt vote yet, theres no option to tell rytan to bite me.   Why are so many so easily convinced...why not grow a backbone and tell him that its fine and **** off to the other classes.  sorry shaman can add decent dps now days, but its long ovr due.  we have been neglected since velious, anyone around since then would remember that shaman used to be KINGS...but that changed and now were a lowly supposrt classes, that can be boxed in to buff a raid and invite latecomers.<br />
Panther was a Good thing, we liked it, melees liked it, mages and beastlords liked it...in game.  the only ones who hated it were number crunchers who got jealous, half were probably retired from the game, or tardlets like that chanter in serverwide.shaman the other day.<br />
<br />
if we take this nerf whats next? wizzies will complain that champion over buffs them and ask for it to be single target?  <br />
<br />
no one in the game that i have ever met hated panther. in fact the more they nerf it, the less likely it is i will cast it on others, witch doesnt hurt my dps one bit, it hurts everyone else.  ever hear  a monk as not to be casted on? or a gimp warrior who cant keep agro from malos? maybe a beastlord, if his pet is snaring...O.o.  <br />

<br />
I'm not yet another, this has been my stance on this since that monstrosity turned up on test. And you're damn right...I feel this nerf is not needed or warranted. The numbers being thrown around to justify this are horse ****. People talk like we can maintain these numbers on a raid 100% of the time when it's simply not the case...not even frigging close! A wizards's overall DPS contribution on a raid is still going to dwarf ours, but because we can almost match them if we bust our asses to blow all our mana and do nothing else, we need this spell crippled?<br />
<br />
And what the hell anyway, Blazz...aren't you supposed to be gone for a week? Pretty please, shoot yourself into space, won't you? We don't need your kind of help on this. Rytan is doing a fine job on his own. (which is apparently the ass that your head is stuck up)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">It is more than just a 'moderate' dps boost when it is cast on a large number of melee (pets/pcs).<br />

<br />
I think Rytan's 600 DPS figure for the first Shaman on a raid is pretty realistic. This might even work for up to 3 Shamans, but the 4th will undoubtedly run out of targets and I ambeing very generous as I can not see 3 Shamans buffing 36 targets without overlapping, ever.<br />
<br />
If, for argument's sake, we assumed that up to 3 Shamans added 600 DPS each(I call it fiction for above reasons and hurts my head watching me type this even), how the hell can that be significant at all? <br />
<br />
People are saying that they could sustain 300 DPS with DoTs, so that's 300 additional DPS for up to the 3rd Shaman at best or 900 DPS more for a frickin' 54 man raid. That's ~17 DPS per player...****ing overpowered for real!<br />

Try again bud. On Txevu minis, we  frequently have folk parse damage on those, and even with panther running very few folk are parsed over about 350 dps, and thats including casters. You know how much dps panther adds on each target its applied to, and you know that 3-4 shaman can easily cover such a raid. You do the math, the contribution of those few shaman is a very significant contribution to the overall raid damage.<br />
<br />
The consequences of all that are profound. Encounters that people could only get down to 20% due to insufficient dps will suddenly be winnable. The numbers needed to win an encounter will be reduced. The relative importance of pure dps classes is diminished. How can YOU say with a straight face that that isn't disrupting balance in existing encounters.<br />

In spite of all your protestations that panther isnt that much of a spell, the fervour of all the posters here suggests otherwise, and in spite of your claim that it doesnt add that much dps, the emphatic rejection of allmost everyone here to any changes to the recast time gives lie to your position. THEY all know exactly WHY they dont want that changed. They may not say so, but the tone of their posts clearly establish their view of the spells power.<br />

By that I mean stop actively seeking nerfs for a class that you don't play as a main. You might not want to see a class that you bot improved but stop trying to get things reduced. You'd be damn quick to jump on anyone who went over to the warrior boards and requested that anything you were given had a reduction applied.<br />

I've been a supporter of some of your posts when you have been walloped by people here but on the panther line posting you are doing here and on the SoE boards you are out of line. You post as a jealous warrior, not as a shaman.<br />

<br />
Rytan (the spell guy): <br />
<br />
Here’s a break down of the problem as we see it with the current live version of Sprit of the Panther. <br />
<br />
The base DPS for an application of panther is roughly 100 (counting crits from applicable Aas) for a focused duration of about 16 ticks or 1:36 seconds.  Theoretically with full focus and extended enhancement, perfect targeting, etc, one shaman can keep it up on 16 players.  I don’t really think that’s a reasonable balance point though, so lets call it 12 for the sake of argument.<br />
<br />
DPS/Target = ~100<br />
Target/Shaman = 12<br />
DPS/Shaman = 1,200<br />
<br />
It actually takes a while for this to get going as it’s being cast on several people, so really it ends up being about half that if you don’t reapply it to the first target.  So roughly 600 DPS for 7800 mana, which most shaman should be able to handle for at least those 12 applications, and in most cases longer.<br />
<br />
I even put the important part in bold for you. Rytan's logic is fine imo. Buffing 12 people takes time obviously, so the 100 DPS figure can only be applied for the 1st of the 12 while the 12th will do way less. Assuming 50 DPS, and thus the 600 DPS figure, for each of them seems perfectly reasonable and even Rytan acknowledges that.<br />
<br />
600 DPS for every Shaman buffing 12 people. Now every single one of these Shamans can put out 300 DPS himself, so that Panther adds a total of 300 DPS over what he can do not using it. For 3 Shamans buffing 36 different targets that's 900 additional DPS, which results in 17 DPS per player in a 54-man-raid.<br />
<br />
Can you follow this, son?<br />
<br />
Panther actually needs to be upgraded, because the only thing making it good was the increased proc rate of pets, get it?</div></div><hr />

I want a response from you, Tugela. A real one, based on Rytan's numbers and above argumentation this time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Tug, you are thinking in terms of the pre pet-proc-nerf version of the spell, when the potential DPS for Panther was pretty staggering. The /cycle nearest PC works on pet armys. A mage sending in 10 little guys with a Shaman ready to Panther them all was a pretty signficant chunk of DPS. <br />
<br />
Now however, its been lowered dramatically, so you cannot really go by the &quot;it shaved 3 minutes of an encounter that normally lasted 15 minutes&quot; data, it doesnt apply anymore. In its current &quot;adjusted&quot; state, Panther is simply a solid DPS spell, that can provide reasonable burst DPS in certain situations, but it hardly dramatically game altering in the overall scheme of a &quot;Raid&quot;, especially when you start comparing it to things like haste, VoQ, etc. Other true DPS classes have their own version of &quot;situational burst DPS&quot;. <br />
<br />
One thing that annoys me is that I continue to see our &quot;BEST case Burst&quot; compared to the normal, standard levels of other classes. A rogue with a couple disks up can drop some MAJOR league DPS in a pinch. Necros with 10K hps can Lifeburn for insane amounts. Wizards can almost stand there and out-do our &quot;best case&quot; with normal casting patterns. A mages pet army, un-Panthered, is still a POWERFUL bundle of slamming. Why is it so unbalancing for us to be able to provide the normal DPS of a &quot;true&quot; DPS class in a best-case burst situation? <br />
<br />
I am being won over by Giac. I think the spell is pretty &quot;average&quot; with the pet-proc nerf. Its nice, its handy, but it still has a huge mana cost and a major PITA factor. The pet-proc was more than enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Vork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Ive got a new strategy. Im gonna be hell-bent on leveling until vork can cast panther.  Then Im going to write up a program that automatically logs him in every 3.762 hours to cast panther on my group. When the buff fades in 29 seconds and Vork dies from all the aggro his buff generated, the program will immediately /feedback ..l.. oh, and the program will keep track of the game-breaking 14dps boost it gave.  After two years of collecting the data, the program will feed it all into a post on the &quot;official&quot; forums.  Then my computer will self destruct and perhaps the noobs playing EQ7 will get some kind of constructive revamp of the spell.  Provided there are any Shaman left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Acceptable nerfs to panther:<br />
<br />
1.  2400 hp blast heal, 2.5 second cast time.<br />
<br />
2.  75 % slow, -150 chromatic resist adj, 3 minute duration, 1.5 second cast time.<br />
<br />
I don't need another lame spell, I have plenty of them already.  If you are going to take away a powerful spell, then give me a powerful spell as its replacement.<br />
<br />
As for leopard:<br />
<br />
Leave it the way it is, put a timer on it, make it my pet only, use if for soloing, whatever.<br />
<br />
But if you are going to envision shamans around a very powerful new spell -- a buffing spell, as it happens -- and then you are going to turn it into just another ho hum buffing spell, what's the point?  Take it away, and give us a powerful blast heal, or else a slow that is clearly superior.</div></div><hr />

I cannot find any flaws in the arguements you guys have made on this subject. I am totally convinced now of 2 things. <br />
<br />
1.- Panther with the old pet proc format was noticably abusable.<br />
2.- Panther with the current pet-proc rate is a pretty average, high PITA spell, at best. <br />
<br />
Very usable, still reasonable, but absolutely NOT worthy of any sort of additional nerf whatsoever. No mana increase. No proc decrease. Nothing. <br />
<br />
Keep on them. MAKE Ryan respond. I gotta figure there are memos flying all over the SOE Developers offices as we speak. <br />
<br />
Post on other class boards as well. I think we can get a lot of momentum with some other classes supporting this. Heck, I bet if you take this approach and show it to the Wizard community, we would get more than a few converts who would be willing to accept the spell the way we would like it to be (pet proc reduced, no other nerf).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Scowls1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">to say that you want another spell in return?  ***, i want my old pet proc rate back.  you wrongly label it as &quot;Overpowered&quot; when it was actaully &quot;Powerful&quot;.  Yes if i wanted to use all of my mana casting panther on all the melee and pets in a group, it did ALOT of dmg, but it used ALOT of mana...overpowered would be it only using 10% to buff everyone.  I dont want a stupid heal that i never use, i dont really want DA, FD, or the &quot;excape&quot; AA, i dont want yet another slow that i dont mem cause i have a TA, and even if i wanted it, it would rare drop from the boss of Omens, and be a turn in rfune shared by all other classes (so like only &gt;1% on a server would even have it).  <br />
If you want to &quot;Improve us&quot; then have the devs roll pet procs back, work on making PoP items clickable from inventory (love the TA, but im tired of being chained to it), and for god's sake update AA canni.  Panther made shaman wanted in groups.  and with beastlords new slow coming out, were gonna need that desire to get thru it.  <br />
lets remember that just because some of us have loads of amna and can blast panther all ove the zone, cast from hps and cast it even more...doesnt mean all shaman can...Im sure theres alot of shaman who cant get thru enough don encounters to even get the spell, and alot that have it that cant sustain the mana to cast it semi-regularly.  when/if they get champion, there almsot ruined as far as mana goes.  just because the biggest of the shaman can increase there guilds already insane dps...doesnt mean that less geared shaman shouldnt be able to help out there guild dps.  <br />
<br />
blazz i dunno what button you hit, but cycle PC doesnt cycle thru pets on my computer...it cycles thru PC.  cycle NPC only went thru mobs.  i was asking for a cycle pets button before everyone started asking for a nerf.<br />
pet proc rates were not &quot;more than enough&quot;.  Pets are companions to certain classes to deal out dps for them.  they are supposed to be powerful, and if you add a powerful spell to a powerful target...they will kick ass (for 1:30).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I agree about consolidating our message guys.  We have too many threads with too many ideas floating around.<br />
<br />
Remake a poll, with the most succinct arguments at the bottom of it, and lets recast our votes.<br />
<br />
I can't believe that the shamans that voted &quot;group only&quot; actually though about what they were voting for.  Most probably though &quot;group version&quot; rather than group only.  Others probably didnt' consider raiding.  Others yet, probably aren't in the endgame and have no clue how much dps from dots do.  <br />
<br />
 4 x 72 dps &lt; my dots.  And maintaining 4 one minute buffs is of much greater annoyance than dotting.  And I rarely have aggro problems on raids now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Sorry Tek, I do not want to swallow any nerf. I am sounding like a broken record I guess, but anything beyond the pet proc fix is unacceptable. <br />
<br />
I canceled my fresh station account I started shortly after DoN came out yesterday because of this nerfage to come. I really thought that SOE got something right with this spell and most of the expansion. Sadly, shamans having fun does not seem to please Rytan the ****lord. <br />
<br />
As any other reinvisioning is also stalled atm., and I am not really confident about what it has in store for shamans, the Leo/Panther spell in its current incarnation would have kept me content for quite some time. The proposed group spell drek just means that I cannot cast it on my pet anymore. 12 AA to &quot;fix&quot; that is not much to me, I just do not see how this will then be an extended line for the reinvisioning as Brenlo hinted at (not my observation only). <br />
<br />
So, the poll is missing the most important option: Don't change anything beyond the pet fix!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Well, ok Giac, if you want it. The part of Rytan's post that you are convienently missing is &quot;so really it ends up being about half that if you don’t reapply it to the first target&quot;. I've highlighted it so you dont miss it again. 600dps average for one round of casting, but if it is recast the average will increase because there wont be dead time at the end of the cycle. <br />
<br />
So, the question is how frequently can an average shaman actually cast this? After your post I saddled up Mokara, who is pretty average and tested it. He's 68, so he doesnt have panther, but does have leopard. With no buffs on, sitting on his trusty lizard and using canni5/pained, I was able to cast leopard no fewer than 26 times before running out of mana. With proper raid gear, fully buffed and all the appropiate aa, along with channeling running, I'm sure he could do way better than that. Targeting in raids by list is no problem at all if you have set yourself up to do that. <br />
<br />
So how much does that work out to? It took 4 minutes 25 seconds to make those 26 casts. Add on about 1 minute 20 seconds for spell duration, lets say 5 minutes 45 seconds in all. <br />
<br />
Assuming a proc rate of about 13 (roughly for Mok, more for other people) per duration, we are talking about roughly 151k of damage. That works out to something in the 440 dps range averaged over that time period. And that is without buffs, no chanelling, modest aa skills and low level raid gear. If he had those things then he would be able to cast even more, and the dead time at the tail end of the time period would be filled, in other words average dps would increase even further. <br />
<br />
Now, if a level 68 shaman like Mokara can be set up in the middle of a raid and is capable of sustaining at least 400 dps over the course of a 6 minute fight, you dont see that is being totally out of whack?? <br />
<br />
<br />
Here is the log from start of casting until Mok ran out of mana. <br />

[Sat Apr 09 04:08:17 2005] Insufficient Mana to cast this spell!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Tugela, you are just as selfish as everyone else on the issue yet you want to make it look like you are not. You come here and espouse how overpowered it is then you have the tenacity to ask Rytan (on the SoE boards) for a second version that would enable a shaman to hit up to 3 targets outside the group, like the main tank.... what class is your main again? Oh right, tank.... how interesting that your main class would benefit from your bot if that happened...<br />
<br />
What makes me most annoyed about this change is that all of you shaman have been angry until YOUR happy medium has been met, and that is bull****. Some of you have the ear of Rytan and you choose to use that to stop complaining when the spell meets what will work for you..<br />
<br />
I see things like &quot;I can barely keep this up on 2-3 people&quot; and just think &quot;Thanks for nothing&quot; to that person because oh look, a group only spell means you don't ever have to step outside your easy life.<br />
<br />
What you guys fail to do is comprehend that you might one day grow as a shaman and actually do more than cosy grinds, or lazy raiding. Play the what if game....<br />
<br />
What if you really want to add dps on a mob and you work out a method where you can add value.... well now you can't.. you have the toolset but Rytan took the spell away that would do that.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day the middle of the road shaman who can't be bothered, or doesn't have the ability, or hates raiding, or doesn't have the playtime just screwed those shaman who like to make the most impact with their characters. The sad thing is that you didn't need to be like that because those shaman that could see the value of keeping the spell out of group weren't hindering your cause in any way. I guess some of you can't understand that there is an aspect to this game that you might not understand or won't ever play.<br />
<br />
Cheers class mates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">The point of asking for at least some capability of hitting targets outside of group is specifically for the purpose of assisting people who have to tank maintain agro, whether they are the MT or a secondary tank that has to step in at a later stage. Thats a useful application, I certainly understand why that is so, it's too bad that you don't ;)<br />
<br />
Oh, and the log above clearly shows that it is possible to maintain it on a lot more than 2 or 3 people, if thats what you have set out to do, for most large target fights. For a 6 minute fight I figure you could do about 8 reasonably comfortably, probably a fair bit more if you are high end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I can understand it Tugela.... what I fail to understand is why you feel the need to advocate downgrading 2 spells to achieve something that would be perfect for you yet you fail to consider that your bot/tank relationship is not the mainstream shaman way of life.... <br />
<br />
You can say what you like but you took advantage of a nerf to find YOUR happy medium at the expense of all shaman.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">You wouldnt use a bot to do this, it would be someone dedicated since they would be very busy. They wouldnt have time to be run as a second toon. However, as you no doubt well know, shaman don't really stack all that well on raids, and excess mains could easily be set up to do this sort of thing. And if they can, they probably would be. I don't think the problem is that severe at the high end of raiding, since those encounters typically have a lot of other things going on where shaman might be more usefull on other duties. Most of the older content is not like that though, and would be heavily affected by these sorts of strats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">/sigh<br />
<br />
Tugela, you are not helping your cause here, you are showing why the nerf sucks.<br />
<br />
You are saying that in theory it is something that can be sustained on a number of people, yet in practice the shaman who wanted it nerfed say that they find it too challenging to do that.<br />
<br />
Those people who find it too challenging are (by merit of their magelo and posts) in the content you say it would be too overpowering on.<br />
<br />
So, based on your logic this was downgraded because it might be overly powerful for people who say they couldn't handle using it to that extent. It's not that they are bad shaman for underusing the potential, its just that at that content level the tanks/healers/other classes are not geared to the extreme and shaman invariably pick up the shortfall.<br />
<br />
The best method Rytan could have followed for evaluating this spell would have been to put people in game to watch the spell being used. I'm sick of the maximum theoretical output that gets spouted. Real application of these spells across many encounters/guilds/raiding levels is what is needed to make decisions.<br />
<br />
Either way, you got one of your ideal spells, you'll probably get the second request because it's something most shaman have already said they don't want. Let Rytan know that! It should help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Well, if people weren't intending to use in the way I described, they wouldnt care if it was limited to be used on a few people, either through refresh timers or group tags, now would they? But they do care, so they clearly DO intend to use it like that.<br />
<br />
oh, and I didnt get my preferred spell version. I would have rather have seen them in the current format with a 3 tick recast timer, like pained ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Stop trolling.<br />
<br />
You cannot say that shaman in the high end raids are so busy that they have other duties and couldn't do this type of activity and then say that your reasoning for saying the changes are good is that those people would be doing it.<br />
<br />
You change your logic between posts Tugela. Stick to one thing or go add some value to your mains class boards.<br />
<br />
<br />
oh, and I didnt get my preferred spell version. I would have rather have seen them in the current format with a 3 tick recast timer, like pained ;)<br />
re-cast timers make for perfect botting character, why doesn't this surprise me.... people who actually play their shaman don't want to be hindered by unnecessarily grayed out spells. But you wouldn't understand that.<br />
<br />
Good luck with the changes Tugela, I am not spending all day regurgitating obvious points in a futile exercise of explaining the shaman class to a warrior.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Tugela:  I'm pretty happy with this nerf, I think it will work fine for me, so there's really no problem.<br />
<br />
Karshak:  No, there's a big problem, this spell has just lost a huge amount of utility.<br />
<br />
Tugela:  It works fine for me, so it's fine ... you just don't know that it's fine for you, too.<br />
<br />
Karshak:  You need to see that if it works, it has to work for all different kinds of people:  casuals, high end raiders, mid range raiders -- not just for your situation.  And I'm telling you, it's a bad bad nerf for me.<br />
<br />
Tugela:  Don't be silly, it's fine for you.  After all, I can see that it's going to be fine for me, so you are just not seeing that it's fine for you, too.<br />
<br />
:: repeat(50x) <br />
<br />
Karshak:  is there a point to talking to Rytan?  Probably not, he probably won't listen -- but if he does, it could make some difference. Is there a point in talking to Tugela?  Well, no. <br />
<br />
Tugela:  you may be the world's best 2box, and you can write a string of complete sentences (which already puts you way ahead of a lot of posters); but someday you need to learn that the world is not just about you and your preferences.</div></div><hr />

Recast timers have no affect what so ever on botted characters. It has been explained time and time again that the spell is capable of delivering too much damage, and as much as you might choose to pretend otherwise, its a simple fact that it can be used in that way. That is a consequence of the way it is applied, by distributing the effect to hosts who then direct damage at the target. Whether some or other people may or may not do it is beside the point. Trying to suggest that this is some sort of alt agenda is absurd.<br />
<br />
If you are concerned about unnecessarily greyed out spells, you must hate things like your epic, pained memory, the bane line etc. Ask yourself this question, why are those things greyed out?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see things like &quot;I can barely keep this up on 2-3 people&quot; and just think &quot;Thanks for nothing&quot; to that person because oh look, a group only spell means you don't ever have to step outside your easy life.<br />
<br />
Hmmm, if you're talking to me - Rytan did not answer any posts I directly made to the community summit forums asking about the nerf. I didn't get any special feeling he was listening to me at all, he was just responding to everyone's comments on the EQ Live forum.<br />
<br />
My stance was ALWAYS - don't change it, I started nearly every post with &quot;I don't think this spell should be changed.&quot; The only change I was willing to accept was the pet proc fix. When the final changes were announced - I said the changes were too harsh. I'm still angry that the spell was changed.<br />
<br />
I did make one comment on this forum (which btw, Rytan has not visited since March 30 according to the forum manager - so he didn't see this comment anyway) that there would be a small benefit (to me) to having the spell group only because sometimes it's confusing in a big raid to coordinate who is casting pather on whom and then finding the appropriate targets when everyone is running around like crazy.<br />
<br />
I said it would be nice to only be responsible for casting panther on my group - not because I'm lazy and want to cast a spell 3 times and then watch the OC, but because there is OTHER stuff I want to be free to do as well. Before panther, I had a lot of fun on raids, I like healing and curing and nuking and doing some kiting - I don't want to be a non stop panther bot on raids.<br />
<br />
I'm just a person who plays the game for fun, and it was just an opinion.</div></div><hr />

Wow.  Apparantly some people are HAPPY being gimp at one of our primary roles that has also been passively nerfed into uselessness in the past. (melee DPS support through buffs)</div></div><hr />

I guess part of the problem might be that a lot of us have come to accept the fact that changes were inevitible, and LONG before anyone posted any &quot;its too good&quot; threads whatsoever. <br />
<br />
Its all well and good to sit here and say &quot;I wont accept this or that&quot; but at the end of the day, all you have done is gotten yourself even more upset when things dont go the way YOU think they will go.<br />
<br />
EQ is largely about compromise. Give and take. SOE made a massive mistake, no denying it, but the mistake they made was not thinking thr ORIGINAL version of the spell through. If it had come out in its current, proposed format, people would have thought &quot;cool&quot;. Instead, they gave us a GODDLY spell, then realized how goddly it really is, and were forced to scramble to fix it. Heck, I bet if the pet-proccing thing wasnt so stupidly abusively broken in the first place, we might have never seen such drastic changes (for example, if pets procced same as PCs, they MAY have adjusted the damage per proc down, and jumped the mana up, to keep it &quot;reigned in&quot;). <br />
<br />
SOEs mistake isnt the nerfs (well, the size of the nerfs is pretty bad, but not the concept itself). Its the original spell. Now, its our job to find SOME form of the spell we can live with, since SOE always seems to over-shoot in these situations. Instead of drawing a line in the sand, try to work within the parameters you KNOW, in the back of your mind, exist.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you stopped fighting around this post Gloriana...<br />
<br />
Hey Rytan, if a change must happen, I like the second option above the best so far. I use leopard/panther most effectively in groups and this change would have zero impact in that scenario.<br />
<br />
You know that mad-cap raiders will use the raid management function to toss shaman from group to group on big fights and you'd have the possibility of the same &quot;uber&quot; raid DPS scenario that exists today. <br />
<br />
<br />
You explained that your happy medium is in a group, then went on to highlight that he should watch out for those mad-cap raiders who would try and abuse it.<br />
<br />
You also said on here that:<br />
<br />
<br />
I didn't get any special feeling he was listening to me at all, he was just responding to everyone's comments on the EQ Live forum. <br />

I'd say that this comment by shows that he does ignore other posters and answer yours considering there were 11 posts between your thoughts and his response:<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd originally thought about lowering the damage as well Gloriana. <br />
<br />
<br />
You might state on the crucible that you are unhappy but your post on the SoE boards proves that the nerf has zero impact to your play style.<br />
<br />

<br />
I only pointed out the fact that raiders could use the raid functionality to keep using the buff on multiple groups because I thought his fix was flawed and if the problem was casting it on multiple people - his fix would have 0 effect.<br />
<br />
I was trying to say - you have problems with X, people are going to keep doing X, what is the point, why make that change?<br />

Ha, I think he answered me because it was something he wanted to say anyway. Notice he didn't answer any of Chutoi's very articulate arguments - it's not what he wanted to talk about.<br />
<br />
If he had wanted to talk to me directly - he could have responded to my very lengthy post on the summit forums (which he did not).<br />
<br />

<br />
Of course it will change how I currently use leopard. Today in a fight, I used the /assist PC hotkey to cycle through every melee at the raid to cast it - it's a fun spell. I'm also not happy with the reduction in damage. I don't agree with the changes at all.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry you think I stopped fighting because I wasn't very active on the boards yesterday after the final &quot;fix&quot; was posted - I WORK. I had an offsite visit and was offline from noon til 6.<br />
<br />
I think the change is a rotten change - panther was a fun spell and I'm not happy about anything that takes fun out of the game.<br />
<br />
What makes me the most upset - after years of lip service that shaman were the Kings of Buffing, the Masters of buffing while we pored over parses and charts and tried to figure out what our buffs actually DID (what effect does str have, what does dex actually do??) we finally get a buff that was unambiguously wonderful - really increased the power of a melee the way our stat buffs were &quot;supposed&quot; to. And they nerf it. So aggravating. <br />
<br />
Anyone that thinks I'm happy about this, is very wrong.</div></div><hr />

Encounters that people could only get down to 20% due to insufficient dps will suddenly be winnable. The numbers needed to win an encounter will be reduced. The relative importance of pure dps classes is diminished. How can YOU say with a straight face that that isn't disrupting balance in existing encounters.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
OMGs!  What will happen when people start getting elemental armor, or ANGUISH drops!!!!!   Encounters that people could only get down to 50%, due to insufficient stats and DPS, will suddenly be winnable!!!!<br />
/sarcasm off<br />
<br />
Its called progression.  These spells were a LONG OVERDUE step that fit in very well in helping shamans progress.<br />
<br />
My vote is for NO CHANGE to the spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Rytan began almost at the end of the process, and went on to the end.  Many people on this board and on the EQlive boards followed him in this.  That's the key deal here.  <br />
<br />
Last step:  here is your nerf, it goes live next Tuesday, gratz.  Rytan is now here.<br />
<br />
Next to last step:  panic in the community, severe nerf on test that was actually scheduled to go live, people wondering whether to offer compromises or shout No Change! No Change!<br />
<br />
One step previous:  Rytan has decided, for his own reasons, that Panther will be nerfed.  His plan is to put a severe nerf out and then scale it back.<br />
<br />
Over the last several days, several of us have said, as hard and as often as we could:  whoa, lot of unexamined assumptions here.  Before we go any farther, we need to back up this whole process and answer questions like these:<br />
<br />
1.  How much damage does Leopard / Panther actually cause?  When and how?<br />
<br />
2.  Should this damage be considered as direct (like with a dot or nuke) or cooperative (like haste)?<br />
<br />
3.  What is an appropriate amount of damage for a shaman's buffs to provide in a raid burst-damage situation?   <br />
<br />
4.  Should a level 70 Anguish-geared 500 aa shaman be able to provide more (healing, buffing, dps) than a level 70 bazaar-geared 50 aa shaman?  <br />
<br />
It seems to me that you cannot decide how much to nerf this spell until you have answered these questions.  People may have different opinions about these matters:  so they could be debated.  Let's see what we can learn.<br />
<br />
Rytan never bothered to respond to any such question on the EQlive forums.  He's the guy we have to convince, and in this case at least (maybe forever, but that's another question) he did not listen.  He did not answer.  He maybe did not care what anyone else thinks.<br />
<br />
He posted  April 7 that the spell would be scaled back to half of its power.  His preferred method to do that was probably to make it a group buff.  He meant one cast hits all your group, and that's what he then cranked out onto test; but people found that confusing, and they didn't want to buy pet aa, and it evolved into a single buff limited to your group members and their pets.  As far as I can tell, that is the only indication that he was responding to posts in the thread at all.  He then went ahead and posted that, &quot;based on the feedback in this thread,&quot; the spell would be changed to what we will get next Tuesday.<br />
<br />
Those of you who are angry at Blazz are hating the wrong person.  <br />
<br />
Blazz had some opinions.  You might or might not have agreed with them.  But let's especially notice a couple of things here:  Rytan is the one who decided to nerf this, and he didn't listen to anybody else's thoughts; Blazz had an opinion, but he listened to other people, and his mind got changed.  Blazz is not the enemy here.<br />
<br />
Rytan is the guy who made the nerf decision.  He chose to nerf it severely, because he had concluded it was overpowered.  Many posters here and on EQlive still say that it was overpowered.  But all of that is just a feeling.  Nothing more than that.<br />
<br />
Here's the thing.  NOBODY has DEMONSTRATED that it is overpowered.  Because you can't demonstrate that it is overpowered without answering those four questions I asked up above..<br />
<br />
To be honest, I hadn't figured any of this out when I started making my polls, just a few days ago.  I was trying to gather information.  It was in the process of debate that a lot of it became clearer to me, and it was only then -- Wednesday evening maybe?  not sure -- that I bedame an outspoken advocate for zero nerfage.<br />
<br />
Some people -- luckier guessers than me, maybe, or shrewder in their past experience with Rytan -- had already moved past this point and were saying &quot;Since we are going to get screwed, let's negotiate for not getting screwed too hard.&quot;   I don't blame those people.  In the event, they were right:  Rytan was not listening.  He had already made his decision.  <br />
<br />
Rytan was wrong, and he is still wrong, and he is making a decision that has a very serious effect on us, and he is doing it without considering critical questions.  There are many people in the shaman community who could help him see things that he is missing.  But he doesn't want that help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">I think what you are forgetting...Rytan is an asshat wearing nerfclown.  That is true.  There are no polls needed to come to this conclusion.  So, what we SHOULD have done is start our reasoning in this order.<br />
<br />
1.  We have a spell that rocks.<br />
2.  Asshat wearing nerfclown wants to nerf it.<br />
3.  OH GOD NOES!  HE IS GOING TO NERF IT INTO THE GROUND.<br />
<br />
Then we start at #4.<br />
<br />
Instead, some people actually thought something reasonable would come out of this and got duped.  <br />
<br />
ALWAYS ASSUME THE WORST FROM RYTAN.  He has no freakin clue about Shaman.  He is a failure at his job.  He has single-handedly caused more Shaman to quit than anyone else.  How does this clown have a job still?  <br />
<br />
The reason people blame Blass is that when you have a nerfclown circling a bloodied mass (Shaman), they look for one opening.  They look for one weak spot.  They got it when people actually said it needed nerfing.  Whether it was correct or not, that is all he needed to take off running.  Never assume anything will come out correctly from this man.  He is a failure.<br />
<br />
On a side note, <br />
<br />
WHO CODED THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE SPELL??  That person should be fired from SOE.  Really.  They have caused so many shaman to get pissed off because of this nerf.  If a little testing had been done and the spell would have come out as they 'wished' the first time, so much anger would have been saved..as well as a few accounts.  If Rytan did the original..then he most CERTAINLY needs to be fire. What a joke he is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Noone said we liked Bane. We ate the 30 second recast timer because that's how it was from the start. I don't understand the theory behind this...To this day I still hate that god damn spell. Pained Memory sucks ass too. But it's a minor upgrade from Cann4 and we were told that that's what was going to happen (Bigger chunk, longer recast). Panther started out with no recast. One of the few shaman spells without it. And now they're taking that away from us? **** that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Blazz had some opinions.  You might or might not have agreed with them.

Very true, except that my original opinion was &quot;Pet proc needs fixing and thats it&quot;. My mistake was thinking that SOE and Rytan would be reasonable in their nerfing of the spell, and BOY was I wrong. I could have accepted &quot;Pet proc and now Group-only, same damage and mana&quot;. I could have accepted &quot;Pet proc and now only 450 damage for 50 more mana, and a bit higher proc-rate on pets&quot;. Hell I could have accepted &quot;pet proc and 1 tic (6 second) re-cast, castable on anyone&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Mostly what you convinced me of Mac, is the whole &quot;buff vs DPS&quot; concept. Its no wonder Rytan wont respond to that. He cant. There is no response. The ONLY answer he can now possibly have for these additional nerfs is &quot;because&quot;, you know, the reason I get from my 10-year old about why she wrote on the wall of her room with permanant marker. &quot;Because&quot;. <br />
<br />
What I am REALLY having trouble swallowing is the EXTENT of this nerf. Group only, MAJOR (~30%) reduction in the proc, and a Pet Proc Nerf that I feel went too far (if its equal to the PC proc-rate, that is, we still lack any data on that, other than Retrons 1.6-1.7 numbers from the original fix, pre-30 second version).<br />
<br />
Heres how I feel now, and go ahead and take a chunk out of me if you want too. <br />
<br />
1. SOE isnt ever going to make this spell castable outside group without a big re-cast OR a major damage reduction (like down to 250, so when we &quot;Channelburn Panther the Raid&quot; its only 300-600 DPS, not 600-1200).<br />
<br />
2. The group-only version actually has SOME positives to it. XP group usage remains the same. There is still a potential for respectable burst DPS, with creative group make-up. It will be easier to contribute OTHER spells to the situations (probably wont have more than 4 targets, max). It increases our raid-stackability slightly. It will be easier to target our recipients, heh (got sick of typing /tar Goner anyway), and best of all, NO Paladins will be sending me &quot;/tell Blazz: PANTHER ME BRO!! (heh, but I know a couple that will still &quot;Yo FA man!&quot;, and I will send my usual response &quot;OK, tell Roamin, the 600 DPS rogue, your taking his slot in my FA rotation&quot;, LOL)<br />
<br />
3. BUT the spell is still too weak. Needs some more damage (make it more mana too, fine), needs a longer duration (the limited potential targets should off-set the need for this abusively annoying PITA duration, even pet armys will die before the duration runs out, so thats no arguement against), and I STILL think that the Pet-Proc rate should be 1.5-2.0x of the PC rate. <br />
<br />
I think we can fight for these things. I think we can get them. I want 500 damage on the proc, I bet we can get 450 (instead of 400 it is now). I want 3 minutes on the duration, I bet we can squeeze em for 2, at least (instead of the current 1), I want a pet-proc bonus of SOME kind, not the &quot;broken&quot; version, but SOMETHING, because that will help more classes in the long run with desirability, stackability and versitility. <br />
<br />
Someone with more respect that I currently have start a new thread, a thread to discuss this, a thread to unite us with a NEW purpose, to get the spell off the &quot;mediocre&quot; hump its at right now (lets face it, the PITA factor for a lousy 400 damage proc isnt anything to write home about when Wizzies are blowing 6-10K holes in stuff), and into the &quot;Very cool spell, we all like it&quot; area. <br />
<br />
Mac, I think your da man on this. At this point I think we can suck it up on the group-only thing, and try to work it into a better spell from this angle. A longer duration and 50 more damage would be a great start, IMHO. Still nothing to write home about in the steady, 4-hour DPS category, but some potential with a good group make-up, and some potential for some good burst in certain situations. <br />
<br />
And if a statement like &quot;We wont ever see a non-group only version again, lets deal with it&quot; is caving, and asking for a nerf, and betraying my class, so be it.</div></div><hr />
