<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Belor Pyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I typically dont complain about anything concerning EQ and really never do I complain outside of my guilds private boards, but LDoN has really destroyed some aspects of the game I held dear and in my cusory search I havent really seen anyone hint at the specific problems me and some of the other people in my guild have found with LDoN.  First of all let me tell you I am the second in command of a small guild (rarely do raids get much past 25 people) we are starting to work on the higher mobs in Velious (NToV), whatever we can catch up in luclin, and the mobs in POP which can be done with less than 50 people.  We are pound for pound pretty good at killing stuff with limited numbers considering our gear and not all of us are 65 yet.  And we are trying to slowly buff up our roster in order to be more flexible in being able to catch contested mobs up and the fact that you just need bodies to do much of anything in POP.<br />
<br />
However as I quickly realized with LDoN, all of this is moot, as far as loot goes (which is a large driving force in this game, admit it or not) my guild is functinally worthless to its members.  We are pretty good at taking down TOV names with 15 people and one cleric, not any easy task considering our equipment isnt exactly uber, but with LDoN, we might as well have spent the time camping key peices for VP.<br />
<br />
The progression chart used to look something like:<br />
Kael-&gt;HOT-&gt;TOV-&gt;Ssra-&gt;VT-&gt;Elementals-&gt;Time<br />
with lots of misc mobs on the TOV,SSra, VT lvls.  And there was endless discussion on if this or that step was 'needed'.<br />
<br />
With LDoN progression looks more like:<br />
LDoN until you are capable of getting all the needed flags for the elemental planes-&gt; elementals and more LDoN-&gt;Time and LDoN raids<br />
From the all important gear perspective no other encounters are needed, most arent even recommended.<br />
<br />
I am not a casual gamer, I do not dislike raiding, however those two facts dont equate to me being in a time enabled guild.  And unless you are in PoTime raiding is largely pointless.  I enjoy leading my guildies into battle with smaller numbers than conventional wisdom would suggest and I enjoy watching them win said encounter.  However this is not always the case, sometimes we wipe and wipe hard, this can be a challenge, and raiding isnt easy even when you are winning, it can be stressful and cumbersome even when everything is going right.  When people know for a fact they can be getting better experiance, loot and cash from the relatively mindless task of collecting 20 bones off of pathetic mobs the challenge of raiding becomes almost impossible (and largely pointless) to overcome.  And while just continuing to raid while ignoring the draw of LDoN might sound all cozy in nice it is not a very realisitic goal even for a relatively small group of people, not to mention the numbers needed when you are trying POP gods.  LDoN is the golden tit of Loot, and Loot is a hard mother to ween yourself from.  Its hard enough watching my boys all die because my tactic wasnt clear to everyone or it just plain didnt work, its even harder to do when you know that even if you do win your time would have been better spent elsewhere.<br />
<br />
For a given amount of time, grouping should not provide the same amount and quality of gear that raiding comperable targets would provide, not to mention more.<br />
<br />
For the sake of brevity I will not even go into our hopes when we heard of LDoN having small raid encounters and our disappointment when hearing the specifics of the raids.  Or my distaste with the fact loot is no longer a good day/bad day thing, but more of a sears catalog type system.<br />

I could post some more rants about the expansion but I hope by now Ive managed to get at least some of my main complaints across and I dont want to continue to bore both the people still reading this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">VT still offers many many pieces that are better than LDON loot. Not to mention you can still upgrade, though minimally, with Augs. ST is still pretty much in the equation as Avatar is still a boon in raids. So, like my guild. We will continue to follow the old ways. A little slower due to the attration of LDoN, but we are still heading up the ladder.<br />
<br />
After the next couple expansions (unless they start putting better equipment in the kunark and even velious I see those going by the way side. But considering LDoN an upgrade to the old world, this might actually happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">LDoN does not offer much in the way of FT items. And those are crucial for casters. The best expansion for these was SoL. But I doubt that you can kill the mobs most of these items drop off of yet if you are only starting NToV.<br />
<br />
Ssra has tons of decent weapons, and more gear casters and melee alike seem to want, but most of the items there can pretty much be interchanged with Wayfarer purchased items it seems.<br />
<br />
Outside of that, yeah, you can farm points in LDoN for awhile, and get the gear from the Wayfarer merchants. The top end gear is better than Ornate, but not as good as Elemental, even after you augment it with the best augments. The problem is that the time involved in getting that gear, and the augments, is insane. 30 successful adventures for one 1492 point item, and then you will want 3 augments, and many of the better ones are 1150 points. So roughly 5000 favor points per item. It adds up to about 100 adventures per slot. So assuming 1 hour for each adventure, you are looking at 100 hours per slot. Or 5 played days, if you do nothing but live in LDoN dungeons. And there are 18 gear slots plus 2 weapon slots. 2000 hours to completely gear up. LOL<br />
<br />
Have we reached insanity yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">LDoN is the golden tit of Loot, and Loot is a hard mother to ween yourself from. <br />
<br />
That's one of the funniest things I have heard in a while, but it is also largely incorrect.  The best loot I have seen off LDoN merchants is inferior to VT loot, and even with the best augs (about 5000 points invested in one piece of armor), it is still subpar to elemental.<br />
<br />
I guess it really depends on how you feel about raiding.  If you like raiding, you'll raid.  If you like exping, you'll do LDoN.  I prefer raiding.  If you are having trouble getting your guild to show up to raids, it is probably because LDoN is pretty new and the novelty hasn't worn off yet.  However, it will, and soon.  Raiding can get boring at times, but still, killing pofire mini's for the 30th time is still going to be a lot more fun than doing mistemoore for the 500th time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So what about the raid level Ldon content?  Is that also droping loot inferior to VT/elementals?<br />
<br />
Just curious :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Raid level LDoN stuff is really not beatable unless you are in a very strong guild who are already elemental. Casual players are never going to be able to beat adventures where every mob in the zone is almost completely immune to magic (so no slow) and quads for 1100+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I wouldn't say &quot;almost immune.&quot;  I mean, after Malos and Tash both, you have probably a 50/50 shot or so of landing slow.<br />
<br />
But they are very resistant, yes.</div></div><hr />
