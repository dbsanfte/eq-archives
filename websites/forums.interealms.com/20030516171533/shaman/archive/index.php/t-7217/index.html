<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Participants in the EQOA beta should make sure they understand their obligations as a beta participant before posting anything to a public forum like this one.<br />
<br />
In general, discussing betas before they go public is grounds for being banned from the beta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Agreed, observe your NDA's please.  This is basically for general discussion, not anything specific (hard numbers, bugs, etc...).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kalduin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">According to the terms of agreement from SOE beta testers are not allowed to disclose ANY information on EQOA. Nothing. Nada. Sorry guys, but looks like nothings leaking (legally) until next summer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am a EQOA beta tester, i wont give u game specifics or anything but i'll keep ya updated if it sux or not</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Can't even update if it sux or not...<br />
nor can we even conferm or deny the existance of an NDA...or possible contents of any possible NDA.<br />
<br />
lol, they went all out :x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">xDeMeNtiAx, subjective evaluations like &quot;it sux&quot; or &quot;it doesn't sux&quot; are grounds for dismissal from beta programs.  In fact, merely saying you're in the program is grounds for dismissal from some programs.  I don't know how aggressive the EQOA guys are going to be but I'd be very careful - the intent of beta programs is usually that as little as possible leaks out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i'm gonna be a beta tester too :) at least.. I will be once I send my system info in... grr gotta do that when I get home before i forget =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just got my beta letter too.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Seeing as I am in no way invovled in the beta.... I had a friend who was in beta.  he was playing when I went over one day.  I didn't see much but it sure did look like it sucked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I still need to get a network adapter for my PS2 hehe.. of course gamestop and ebgames are sold out and on back order indefinately.. /sigh anyone know where else they sell them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">A lot of stores got restocks on the network adaptors over the last month.  The Best Buys near me have shelves full of them now, whereas a month ago I couldn't find one anywhere.  They should be easier to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I got one mail order from ebgames.com, pretty fast too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ordered my ps2 network adapter from amazon.com.. said it'd take 5-7 days.. hopefully their site was updated and they aren't really back ordererd..<br />
<br />
Still haven't gotten the beta dvd yet.. so not going crazy yet :)</div></div><hr />
