<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rgol The Greatspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I really have no clue what is going on, I log into eq and select my char just like normal. Then once I get into the game at some random time it will hang and then right when it comes back the background eather turns all black or looks like a kalidascope. The char models are still there but in weard colors and i can't see my spell bar, text boxes, or anything like that. My system use to run fine then I didnt play all this week and come back to it doing this. I reinstalled the drivers and checked for DX 9 update, no suchs luck on those ends. Also did the compleate file check and all seems to be good there. any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">lol i cant belive it, someone with the exact same problem as i have, i did a virus scan, cleaned the hd of about 10 small viruses. then i reloaded dx9 and now, although it still happens, i have reduced it to about 1 a day... also try turning off the complex sky that seemed to help also</div></div><hr />
