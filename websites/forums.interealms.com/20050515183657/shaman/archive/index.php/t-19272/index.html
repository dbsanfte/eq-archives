<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi everyone,<br />
<br />
Hopefully a very quick question... can someone explain to me how this getting into a flagged zone, with no flag, by being part of a raid works.<br />
<br />
Last I remember, it was some 85% rule or something... if 85% of people have the flag... 15% can still get in without it?<br />
<br />
Is that the case?<br />
<br />
What are the limitations on that... as an example...  Lair of Terris Thule... PoNb...  can you get non-flagged people in there?<br />
<br />
I believe it does not apply to Keyed zones right?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You are correct on the 85/15%<br />
<br />
The only zone I think you cannot get to with the 15% rule is Bertoxxulous's CoDb, you actually have to hail the pusling at the end of the Carprin Cycle to be able to zone into CoDb (Im only to SolRo, so there may be more after there that it doesnt work).<br />
<br />
In your example, you can 15% into PoNb, TT's lair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">PoEb is the same way. Killing the Arbitor and hailing the thingy (technical term) gives you a key on your keyring.<br />
<br />
Time is also a key, so no getting in there without completing the EPs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You also can't *raid into* PoEb or PoTime either, need to be keyed for both of those zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So you don't have to do anything special?   You just form up your raid...  and if say...<br />
<br />
10 people have the flag... you can bring in 1 person who doesn't... (assuming SoE rounds down) they're all just in your raid, and you click on whatever you need to, for zoning in?<br />
<br />
If you had 20 people... 3 can come unflagged.<br />
<br />
I also wonder... would this work on BoT?    Say you had people under level 62... and you have a lot of people who actually do have the flag... could you get them in?<br />
<br />
And finally... lets say you had 10 people you needed to get in.   Could you take them in 1 at a time with a raid of 10 flagged people?    Can they disband from the raid and stay in the zone?<br />
<br />
Thank you for the replies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I believe you have to have at least 35 in the raid before you can start flag sharing.<br />
<br />
I don't know about BoT, since you are technically supposed to have a key for that zone.<br />
<br />
And the person flag shared in must stay in the raid or they will be kicked out of the zone in 3 minutes.  But like I said, a raid of 10 people can't get flag shared people in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's only 32 people flagged in raid for you to be able to get unflagged in zone.  At that point, you can get 4 unflagged in, I believe.  From there on out, I believe you can get in 15% of your raid as unflagged, up to maximum of 10 unflagged in a raid of 70 or 72.<br />
<br />
Raid exceptions to flags do not apply to keyed areas.  As noted by previous posters, lower CoD (bertoxx area) and PoEb are keyed and cannot be entered with the raid feature if you are missing the keys.<br />
<br />
There are some problems with the raid feature.  First, if you form up the raid in a different zone, it has a tendency to get bugged.  Thus, if you form the raid in Potranq, then zone into PoFire, unflagged may or may not be able to get in, even if you wait 5 minutes for the raid to register in PoFire.  As a general rule, form the raid up in the zone you wish to raid.<br />
<br />
Another problem with the raid feature is linked zones.  For instance, H0Hb and PoEb are good examples.  To get unflagged characters in there (assuming they aren't high enough to zone into HoH by themselves since restrictions were removed), you have to form a raid in HoH or PoE, get the unflagged inside, then run to the portal of HoHb or PoEb.  If it's HoHb, the best method I've noticed is to reform the raid in HoHb, then send someone out to invite the unflagged back in HoHa. If the unflagged are in danger of getting booted (by the three minute rule), have them camp out at 1 minute remaining, then camp back in.  With the majority of your people in HoHb, you can invite them into the raid and they can zone across with no problems.<br />
<br />
PoEb is a little different.  They can zone across if they have a key, but you have to have the raid in PoEa for an unflagged person to get into PoEa or PoEb.  Additionally, a keyed person (if unflagged for PoEa) used to be able to stay in PoEb without a raid.  However, this was changed so that even if keyed, an elementally unflagged person requires a raid to stay in PoEb.  Form the raid in PoEa, get unflagged in, have them zone into PoEb first and then camp out at 1 minute left.  When all unflagged are in PoEb, then zone the rest of the (flagged) raid over and invite the keyed but unflagged back to raid.<br />
<br />
Never be afraid to reform raids, but one important note:  A PLANAR PROJECTION for flags IS TIED TO THE RAID.  Don't reform to try to hail a pp!<br />

<br />
<br />
Not 100% but I'm pretty sure if you have a time key you can zone into time w/o being able to zone into eps or even tactics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That is correct, Khozik.  If you have a quintessence of elements, or whatever that time key is called, you don't need to be elemental flagged to zone into time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mixelplux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually, there are a few nuances most don't know about, and Chutoi addressed one of those.<br />
<br />
Flagshare spots as noted above are limited to 15% of your total raid force, with a minimum of 32 in the raid. If you are doing a calculation (# in raid * 15%) always round down.<br />
<br />
Flagshare spots will NOT be regained if a flagshare person leaves the raid or zone. For the instance of the raid, when a flagshare spot is taken once, it's gone. Nothing but reforming the raid will give you back flagshare spots. That is why, as Chutoi mentioned above, forming a raid in the zone you will want to raid is a must. Use a group leader to zone out and grab people so they can zone in.<br />
<br />
One person can use up multiple flagshare spots. Most notable is HoH and HoHb and Sol Ro and Sol Ro's chamber. A person lacking both flags, will use up 2 flagshare spots. There are ways around that by reforming the raids as you move through the zones and resetting your flagshare count, but it's time consuming.<br />
<br />
Raids and Flagshares can be a nightmare at times. There are still bugs with it, but if you keep in mind to always reform a raid fresh when you change zones, it keeps them to a minimum.<br />

I've never seen raids to be that consistant as far as things go. We've had situations like sol ro's tower and doing sol ro and we've brought unflagged into the zone till we couldn't get anymore in then gone to sol ro's room with out having to reform. We have also seen several situations where the raid gets bugged and no one can get down. We've also as rescently as last night gone from PoWater to PoAir and gotten numerous unflagged into both zones with out reforming the raid inbetween. Yes zoning definitely seems to increase the chances of it becoming bugged but it isn't sure thing.</div></div><hr />
