<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bowel Impact</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've gone through 40-45 with a twinked monk, and a necro, both very good solo classes at that level, but nothing was as easy as 40-45 with my shaman.<br />
<br />
I don't have tons of time to play, but really want to get to higher level fast.  Grouping DL way too slow.  Once I got the hang of this.. I was getting a gold bubble every 40 mins.. which more my pace.<br />
<br />
Here's what I did.  I'm sure this was mentioned somewhere, but I'll put together some details.<br />
<br />
Zone:  The Overthere, for obvious reasons helps if you are not KoS to the outpost.<br />
<br />
Plan:  Level 34 charm animals.  A hasted rhino or tigress makes a GREAT pet.<br />
<br />
What I did...  cast a CHA buff on myself first (troll).  Put on some cha gear, if I have it, nothing special.  Take off the neg cha gear (paw of opolla).<br />
<br />
Buff up with some HP/AC/AGI buffs, regen.  I used a Fungi Staff, which helps a good bit too.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cast Charm animals on a tigress or rhino.  Be ready to root the target if it is too high a level to be charmed.  If it is too high, you'll get a message.  Just root it and go find another tigress or rhino.<br />
<br />
Ok.. so you charmed a rhino/tigress.  Be ready, it may break instantly, but I've found charms (89cha) lasted me for 4-10 minutes.  WORST case.. just root it.  Once it's charmed, haste it.<br />
<br />
Pull mobs with tagar's insects... more mana efficient that way.  Send in the pet.  Stand opposite of the pet and just STAND there.  Maybe toss in a nuke or DoT if you have mana/clarity.  Don't melee back to much.. the mobs WILL riposte you and they hit hard.<br />
<br />
So very easy.  Just cast charm on your pet every few mins, keep it hasted.  Pull mob with Tagar's.  STAND there while your pet destroys the mob.  Canni up your mana (dont cannidance.. sitting = bad when being attacked!).<br />
<br />
I don't bother memming GATE.  Let's face it.. if you get in trouble, you wont have time to get gate off with a hasted pet on your butt, and another mob or 2.  BUT.. you CAN get Spirit of Cheetah off easily.. and get way out of range/zone with no issue at all.<br />
<br />
Charm, and STAND there.  No down time.  Canni when you are standing there (standing there makes it so the mob will attack you, not your pet).  If you get low, back off.. let the pet take some hits.  It's more mana efficient to keep your pet alive, rather than re-charming all the time.  I've kept the same rhino as a pet for 2hrs.<br />
<br />
If you see another mob roaming near you.. run to a clear spot while spamming the &quot;pet back off&quot; key, and you'll be fine.<br />
<br />
If you get an add.. it will likely attack your pet.  Just root add, run away and pet back off again.<br />
<br />
If you get too many.. just run to a zone.. pet will buy you some time.  Or Cheetah worst case.<br />
<br />
I died 1 time from 40-45 doing this... it was when I got too cocky and waited to cheetah at the last min... and had fungi-staff effect up.. cheetah didnt hold, I died.<br />
<br />
Otherwise.. it's about 1-2% exp per kill.. and you can get about 1 kill every 2 mins, easy, if there aren't any groups around.<br />
<br />
If you arent KoS to outpost.. collect the sarnak braids.. turn them into (4 at a time) Capt Rottgrime, for an additional percent or two of exp per 4 braids.<br />
<br />
It gets boring.  Slow, pet attack.  stand there and canni.  Your defense goes up FAST.. got to 200 in no time.  Got so boring I decided to group.. but the exp was so much better, I dealt with the boredom.  At tmes just surfed the web on my other computer while I occationally pressed the canni hotkey :)</div></div><hr />
