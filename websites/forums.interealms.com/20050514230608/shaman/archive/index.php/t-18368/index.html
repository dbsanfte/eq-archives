<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>iso2202</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When i first started this game, i knew i wanted to be a shaman, particularly a troll one cuz from what i read in forms EQ has enough barb shammys, I didnt have SoL so Vah Shir was out, My friend picked an Ikky shaman so i didnt wanna copycat, and...um... i dont remember why i didnt want an ogre, SO I always have and always will be a proud Troll shammy. They look awsome and funny at the same time, they are not as numerous, and they get a nice regen, im not sure if they still get the exp penalty, i heard they got rid of em but not sure...But it wasnt till i started playing that i found out a few things...<br />
<br />
Before the release of LoY they already had a few bad things goin on<br />
<br />
I know that they are not so popular to the other races, but if u lvl in the wrong places you will be hated in even cities that tolerate trolls. One thing that i learned about 1 month in is that Grobb iz ur friend and only friend, dont go anywhere else cuz ur prolly KoS to something in a city, at first Neriak was okay, but then I like many others lvled in CB, so now the Indigo Butthood wants to ice me, and as for Oggok, i killed some ogres..somewhere...and next time i walked in to oggok some ogre chased me out...this just goes to show that all of the trolls other factions in cities (2 others) are hanging by a thread. <br />
<br />
Now things went from bad to impossibly evil after LoY<br />
<br />
OKay, Grobb, the only city on antonica i knew i was safe..got taken over by Kermit the frog muscle heads, i just remember loggin in the next day and seeing an ooc saying &quot;any trolls out there i feel for ya, that must suck&quot; didnt take me long to find out what happened, then the even worse news i recieved was that we were moved into neriak, so that means, where i am EXTREMELY KoS cuz of CB, i was just a newb when i went to crush bone and had no idea what the butthood was, nor did i know i was gonna have to bunk in with em, so now, alot of trolls are prolly KoS there see'n that CB was &quot;da&quot; place to lvl and it seems the only way to raise my indigo butthood faction is to do a complete Holacaust on CB slaves for 72 hours straight, andeven worse is that now we have to compete with a new wave of frogloks shammys, which seemed to magically rise to my lvl overnight, so now we are basically a race that begins as a minority squeezed into a tiny part if a city that glowers at you dubiously ,  hated everywhere else, begins with below par wisdom, and a bunch of other stuff, i think SOE are tryin to make trolls go extinct next expansion will prolly be an even gayer race kickin the trolls out of their place in neriak...like bixies or some other type of muppet look alike...<br />
<br />
i know i can sell and all that in PoK, but not having a city to call home is just....degrading...only thing that can make trolls up to par now is if they begin with M-16s for hands and can fly...ya right..only thing SoE will do to trolls is nerf our regen...try as they will im not givin up my shammy..HAPPY HOLIDAYS!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Trolls are a great class for shaman They do have the exp penelty which sucks in the 50's I've heard but they get nice regen and even better if you follow innoruk they get a snare neclace!!! It's te easiest to get reusable snare item for a shammy..Maybe if you petition they might fix your faction under the circumstances, it doesn't seem fair to me either, I doubt they will, but hey it's worth a try. Other then that really, faction isn't as important as it use to be, I never go into halas my home city anymore.. except maybe for nostolga reasons. Just don't kill your faction in ot(no KC kaosara and howling stones), you get a nice proc hammer too that ports you too ot. If i were to start over I would certainly  start a troll, my barb was just a random class, were blind we don't really get anything good that other races can't get, so don't sweat it.. trolls are a great class</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If I had to do it all over again, from a purely powergaming standpoint, I would pick the race with the smallest XP penalty, I think. The 50s just sucked as a troll, especially since I did a lot of them when there were still &quot;hell levels&quot;. At 65, the regen just ins't enough to make up for the fact that I would probably have 100 more AA if I was a Barb or Frog. <br />
<br />
However, from a purely game-playing view, I love my troll. There aren't a million of us, we have more story behind our race than many other races, and we just look damn cool! <br />
<br />
What was that old saying? Be thankful that you live in interesting times. Apply that to your troll man. You wanna be a Wood Elf? How much you hear about Wood Elfs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You're a troll enjoy being kos. Go kill some frogs , go kill some druids , go kill anything. Losing starting city was kinda lame but as for the rest of it big deal. Comes with being a troll. Wanted to be loved be a barb. I actually enjoyed growing up an iksar and being hated. Hunted anywhere , anything and anyone that could give me exp if i felt like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kagbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I thought racial xp modifiers didn't apply to aaxp.  I've always leveled up with some human and halfling friends of mine, and one we hit 65 I gained aaxp just as fast as them.<br />
<br />
As for woodelf not having lore, what about Takish'Hiz. Woodelf/High Elves living in the Eldar forest which was burned to the ground by Soluske Ro (or Fennin I forget) forcing the elves to flee or be burned.  Then when the remaining geomancers were trapped in the city they began their investigations into turning their own biology to sand because the food and water resources were dwindling.  They first tested it on a bug, then a live animal, then the first of the Sand elves that currently inhabit the LDoN Takish'Hiz area.  And that doesn't even touch on how the elves were forced to leave Tunaria (Antonica) and move to Faydwer.<br />
<br />
Long and short of it, every race has had relocation, but this is the first experienced live in game.  All this lore is found in the game if you ask the right npcs or do the LDoN stuff.  I do hope however that Trolls are given a new place, maybe like Broken Skull Rock, the historical second outpost of Trolls (different clan though).  That or maybe a GM would fix your faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They dont apply to AA but a non penatly race will get to 65 sooner than troll or iksar and therefore get a headstart on doing aa's. Course i was just taking it that way with what blazz said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Bah humbug. Trolls rule. Regen IS nice, even at high levels. The exp penalty bites, but trolls look cool and unlike iksar and frogs they actually fit into the &quot;fantasy genre&quot; motif.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I forget, does Crushbone make you lose faction other than the DE warrior faction?  If not, then you're not really kos except at the warrior guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Only warriors, it's no big deal, I levelled partially on the Dvinn brothers (are they brothers, I mean Dvinn and his relative in Oggok?). And I walk carefully in Neriak, but I rarely (if ever) get jumped and killed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Trolls rule. Clear and simple. Maybe not our home city. But that will come. That WILL come.<br />
<br />
(AD from SOE: Please buy our new expansion, it will contain a new frog race the LOK (Not kidding go talk to the forlorn in PoS, I might have misunderstood tho) and maybe the trolls will get their own city.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Why the whinning?  Trolls are not kos in oggok.<br />
<br />
Except to the sk guild i think......been a while cant recall exactly.<br />
<br />
Personally i got sick of the &quot;rough and ready&quot; looks of armour on troll; chain looks esp bad imo.  Obviously this is a personal taste thing- others prob like that look.<br />
<br />
Not that chain of frogloks looks mcuh better!<br />
<br />
The regen at lvl 55  is just great(got an ikky bstlord)  it just takes a while +longer+ to get there.<br />
<br />
Just rember that gukta is still grobb acording to the denizens of POK; unless some frog goes and changes it with some paint )<br />
<br />
hmm can gnomes tnker spray cans?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">haha, look at all the Trolls trying to make each other feel good about being big, ugly and evil things. Oh well, at least your not frogs.<br />
<br />
I never go to Halas anymore either except sometimes to do alchemy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are correct, what I was refferring to was all that &quot;extra&quot; XP it costed me to get to 65 in the first place. I am not sure the exact number, does anyone have info on this? How much &quot;extra&quot; XP does it take for a Troll to get to 65, compared to a 1.00 baseline modifier race? Can you convert that into &quot;potential AA points&quot;? I am sure there is math, I am just too lazy to track it down.<br />

Um, yeah, ok. Well, I meant in-game lore that EVERYONE knows about, not just those folks who study the History of Norrath. Trolls pretty much have the &quot;known lore&quot; department aced :)</div></div><hr />

Regen is nice, and the snare necklace is awesome.<br />
<br />
I was kos at almost every old world city (especially grobb) long before the frogloks showed up.  Once I ding a few more levels, I'll go back and 2box in grobb again with my froglok paladin :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I play a troll shaman, and I sometimes felt the impact of the exp penalty.  I was curious, so I checked it out, and the total impact is roughly 4 or 5 AA's, as near as I can tell.<br />
<br />
Using an old exp calculator at http://www.geocities.com/sstair/EverQuest/  I figured it took a troll shaman 100, 440,000 more exp points to finish up to the end of level 60 than it took a Barb shaman.<br />
<br />
One AA is supposedly (roughly) equal to doing level 52 (rumor oft repeated, not trying to say that is a fact).  I used a human warrior on the calculator to see that level 52 took 23,396,670 to complete level 52, without any class or race xp penalties (the calculator still uses class penalties, so I chose a warrior to minimize this effect).  <br />
<br />
Therefore the exp penalty up to completion of level 60 is a little more than 4 AA points (100 million divided by 24 milion).  To reach level 65 would had a little more, so maybe (at most) one more AA point.<br />
<br />
so - not &quot;100 AA points&quot; but not insignificant, either.  Figure the Barb buying Canni 5 when the Shaman buys MC3, if all else was exactly equal.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT - some of the misspelling was not working as intended</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bubkuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The xp thing sucks for trolls. By the time your level 65 you've had to have gotten an extra 6 levels of xp over someone that doesn't have an xp hit. However, now that I am 65, trolls rule. There isn't many of us out there, the naturally high sta is nice, and of course the regen is great. On top of it I lucked out when I made my shaman 4 years ago and chose innoruuk as my deity so I got the snare necklace that I still use from time to time when I solo. :) <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dalarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I believe one AA is equal to the number of xp needed to go from 51 to 52, not to complete 52, but even so given the info currently available your numbers are close enough for guvmint work. :D<br />
<br />
Makes me feel a bit better about the xp penalty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">At 62 as a frog its about 2-3 kills per 1% reg. exp in a group setting at tier2 or higher. Using a 15% penalty on the troll say i kill 300 mobs in a group setting for each level at 62+, therefore the the troll has to kill 345 for each of his levels. That means that the troll has to kill 1380 mobs between level 62 to 65, and I have to kill 1200. That's a difference of 180 tier2 type mobs. Average net AA from 180 tier2 mobs at 2% each and you get roughly 3.5AAs.<br />
<br />
Flattening the curve to timespent, say I spend 1 day played per level on average. A troll will have to play almost 10 more days group/xping the same way I do. Not a bad tradeoff if you like trolls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Using a 15% penalty on the troll<br />
<br />
The numbers that folks usually quote are 20% for Trolls and Iksar and 15% for Ogres.<br />
<br />
Having said that, my Shaman is an Inny-worshipping Troll primarily due to the fact that they get a clickable snare necklace. It's not as good as Snare/Ensnare, and it takes a long time to cast, but it works well enough to get the job done in many areas where adds would be troublesome. Extra regeneration doesn't hurt either, but with the advent of Stoicism it's not quite as big a deal as it used to be for those who are/were too low or too poor to get Torpor.<br />
<br />
Shamanic races are failry well balanced when you consider all the ups and downs. Regeneration vs. frontal unstannability vs. higher AC vs. higher STA vs. JBB vs. Sneak vs. Snare vs. XP penalty etc.<br />
<br />
Play what you like - I like Trolls' appearance, other people don't. To each his own...</div></div><hr />
