<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
In the past week:<br />
<br />
I have fallen for 10k damage 3 times (none of which was my fault with max safefall).<br />
<br />
I have waited over 6 hours for GM support, none of which was served.<br />
<br />
A raid I was on was ninjalooted by another player who agreed to return the item with GM help, yet none ever showed up.<br />
<br />
I have been experiencing random eq crashes since the last patch (no I am not the only one).<br />
<br />
GD is still locking up when I zone.<br />
<br />
Undead type mobs are still ignoring FD.<br />
<br />
Keldar in Kael chain nuked me 4 times for 2100 dmg each time, if not for healing by our cleric I would have died (great new AI).<br />
<br />
I am still waiting for the new /bazaar functionality.<br />
<br />
My 3rd person view has been broken since the may 8th patch (the view is no longer locked on my character and stares straight into the dirt 5 feet above it.)<br />
<br />
AND<br />
<br />
There is so much character imbalance in this game it disgusts me.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
It is completely clear to me that Verant's &quot;vision&quot; has changed and is the reason why some of the previous developers left. Verant has changed their business model. Their new business model is to release as many new products as possible and milk their cash cow to the fullest extent. People who pay extra money per month are being given priority to test these new products when the people who have been playing on test should be doing so.<br />
<br />
Quality has been thrown to the wind as have free improvements to make US (the paying customers) happy and enjoy our gaming experience.<br />
<br />
They have made no effort to fix major bugs that are angering customers, and honestly have no realistic mechanisms in place for customer feed back.<br />
<br />
Their default response to all complaints is &quot;we are watching that, or as designed, or (no response at all)&quot;<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
It is clear to me now that the only way to make Verant listen to what WE want as players is to remind them that we pay their salary.<br />
<br />
From this point forward, I _UTTERLY REFUSE_ to purchase another EQ product until major efforts have been made to fix long time existing bugs, balance classes, and deliver on previous promises (bazaar).<br />
<br />
Additionally, Verant has a deadline of two months to reasonably convince me that they give a damn about what the PAYING customer thinks. Failure to do so will result in the cancelation of my subscriptions.<br />
<br />
This includes cost free added improvements to the game that were either promised before or to added as extra value.<br />
<br />
Verant also has to prove to me that THEY LISTEN TO US and do the things WE want since it is OUR money they are receiving.<br />
<br />
Last time I checked, customers bought a product because it was what they wanted. EQ is no longer what I want and I refuse to pay any more money to people who have only shown blatant disregard to wills of their customers.<br />
<br />
<br />
I post this here to all of you not to start a bickering match or upset anyone. I post this to express myself to the rest of the player base who DOES listen. Verant may not listen to me but fellow monks will I hope. My wish is that this will atleast move some of you to action and force change within Everquest.<br />
<br />
They know we won't leave because of the time we have put into our characters and our addiction to pain. But let me ask this: What good is a character with 200 days played in a game that is no longer fun or enjoyable?<br />
<br />
I will leave, I am sick and utterly to the bottom of my patience. I know I am not the only one.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
If any of you support this please atleast reply /cancel to the thread if that is the action you are willing to take in order to force change.<br />
<br />
If you disagree you are more than welcome to post your feelings here just please keep to the topic.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time and interest.<br />

<br />
Those are very valid complaints and I agree with most of them.<br />
Verant Interactive has horrible business sense.<br />
<br />
Now that's not to vindicate us, the paying customer, as we are so mesmirized by their product that they are screwing us over while we blindy keep playing.<br />
VI knows this and is milking it for all it's worth. <br />
<br />
Didn't AbsorEQ recently start a Crucible account?<br />
If it really was him, I hope he is reading this post and really digesting what it says (pft, yeah right).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">monks tend to be very upset as they have relatively low hps and they will tend to meet the mobs first when they have their full mana pool, taking into account that caster mobs seem to chain cast until empty now you can see why this is a problem to monks. pulling monk + 2 or more caster mobs = high chance of dead monk = boring game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I *wish* they would chain cast until empty.<br />
<br />
I've never seen a caster mob go out of mana.  I'm convinced casters all have maxed wis/int, internal mana preservation and efficiency III items (&quot;Here, Froglok_Yun_Shaman_01, you don't mind if we surgically imbed these, do you?&quot;), fists made of solid skyiron, and training at special Mob Monk-by-Mail courses.<br />
<br />
Yun and Tsu shaman hitting me with Malisement (yes, that one) and then chain casting E-bolt and Blizzard Blast.  Over, and over, and over, and over, after trying to root me. <br />
<br />
I tend not to whine... but OUCH.  I'm not too keen on Absor's reply that PCs know what we're up for, and can bring others if needed.<br />
<br />
Soloing just got far more difficult in some places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've seen quite a few mobs (low and high-end) go out of mana.  Many mobs will still try to cast when &quot;oom&quot; but nothing will happen; especially when they try to gate and nothing happens.  However, I sometimes think they go on a totally seperate mana pool system than pc's, and have more than they should.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I can vouch mobs DO go out of mana.  Remember back in the day when Desert Madmen in Oasis could be a pain in the ass?<br />
<br />
Well, this time around (level 15) I slightly..err...twinked.  Decided to let a Desert madman beat on me for a bit to up my defense.<br />
<br />
Well, after about 6 &quot;strikes&quot; and a failed attempt at root, he sstarted punching.<br />
<br />
Then I started in on  him.  For the ~1 min it took to kill him...he never once again cast another spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have plenty of complaints and problems with the game, but since I still enjoy the game, I continue to pay my 13 bucks and play.<br />
<br />
The poster makes lots of valid points regarding his complaints in the game. There are certain things that cause him displeasure.. that is not an opinion, that is a fact. Problems X, Y, and Z make the game less enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Of course, the original poster makes his complaints in such an annoying fashion that anyone would want to kick this person in the face, but that's besides the point.<br />
<br />
If you don't enjoy playing, then don't give Verant  13 bucks a month. Its as simple as that.</div></div><hr />

I too refuse to support any additional products, from VI/Sony, any EQ merchandise, of any kind, nor will I attend their fan events.  My point, VI/Sony might get my12 buck a month ( I cancelled my additional accounts) but they won't get any more.<br />
<br />
Should I desire to start over again, with a new character in a new game, you can bet your sweet bum that it won't be VI/Sony that gets my cash.  Why would anyone want to purchase more services/product from a company with such a rotten track record?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">These complaints fall into one of four major categories -<br />
<br />
   1. complaints about bugs in the game<br />
<br />
   2. complaints about unimplemented or poorly implemented <br />
features<br />
<br />
   3. complaints about poor customer service<br />
<br />
   4. complaints about SUBJECTIVE phenomena in the game (&quot;They aren't making the game work like *I* want them to!&quot;)<br />
<br />
I got news for you - #1 and #2 are opposites.  You make changes to add or reimplement features, you WILL add bugs.  You can't have your cake and eat it too unless you are willing to spend hella money on software testing.  The only applications that make this economically worthwhile are medical applications, some military applications, and flight applications - basically applications where human life is at risk.  Ain't gonna happen for EQ.  Want to spent $100/month on the game?  I didn't think so.<br />
<br />
From what I've seen Verant has changed since November in that they are trying to address #2 harder than they did before.  This has a natural affect of increasing the number of bugs in the short term.  Before the VI employee purge, they placed a higher emphasis on stability and gained a reputation for being unresponsive developers.<br />
<br />
As for customer service, I haven't seen any evidence that this has gotten better or worse in the last six months.  I know I have seen more GM events.  Again, economics rears its ugly head here.  Paid employees are EXPENSIVE.<br />
<br />
And #4 is just whining.  Pay your money or get out.<br />
<br />
$13 isn't the ransom of kings, folks.  Software is difficult and expensive to develop and support, and sometimes murderously difficult to extend.  VI is working on a four-year-old code base and keeping it running under full use pressure.  Yeah, there are some things that could have been done better, but in general they are on the right track doing the right things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Let's give the guy a break, some of us feel that part of that 13 bucks a month we pay to VI includes a modicum of bit*hing on the different web boards. <br />
<br />
Why else would VI make it so easy?<br />
<br />
<br />
Now I'll go back to play with my cabbages.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I watched Velketor the Sorceror go OOM Saturday.  If you disagree with this, he stopped casting Rend 2 about 50 seconds into the encounter.  Oh.. and we won too :)<br />
<br />
<br />
But I agree the Casting mob crap is total BS.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I love when I see &quot;Vi has poor buisness sense&quot;.. they provide a non-finished product that people buy and have bought for 3 years now, continuing to sell new options without ever fixing the old and GET AWAY WITH IT.  That's not bad buisness, that's GREAT buisness.<br />
<br />
As for a shoddy product, $10 a month for an average of 20 hours entertainment... um.. that's a pretty good deal.  I WISH I could get amused for .50 USD an hour otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Don't know how you are falling through the world 3 times in one week, but it happens.  Happened to me maybe once my entire EQ career.  The bazaar doesn't work because it's a waste of time to make it work.  They pretty much just shouldn't have said it was ever going to work.  They said &quot;Look what we're going to do&quot; and nobody really cared. I could care less if they ever make it work.  I'm sorry you won't be able to click someone and use them as a vendor. I really feel for you.  You are getting cast on by high level nukes? God forbid you aren't able to run circles around mobs with pathing bugs and that cast up to their level.  Nothing funnier than a monk believing he's the greatest puller in the world because he runs up to a mob and throws a shuriken at it and runs really fast back to the raid (Look how well I pulled!)  Bad business? Show me one business of this kind of grand scale that doesn't operate this way and I'll be amazed.  To be honest, if you understand business at all... To give the level of service you are talking about, I bet you'd be looking at doubling our monthly subscription for a few hand full of people with urgent problems.  I _NEVER_ have to petition.  I died in a weird place to an orc pawn wielding an ice pick? Big deal, pay for a rez and move on. I fell for 10k at a wiz spires? I'll live. Rez and keep playing.  The amount of petitions that GM's get is absolutely insane. People petition for EVERYTHING. There are thousands of people on at a time and people petition for more things than you could possibly imagine, believing that they are sitting there with their own world of problems that nobody else could possibly be petitioning about.  I'm not saying that Verant doesn't owe us Customer Service, because they do.<br />
<br />
You're quitting? Have fun and remember <br />
<br />
ITS A VIDEO GAME<br />
<br />
Bakkal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">True.. I take it back.  I've seen them stop casting ages ago, when I was young.<br />
<br />
I should have said &quot;recently&quot; in my original post.   How many 15th level druids could root a 15th level Ranger (with Harness of Spirit) and nuke nuke nuke nuke him to death?<br />
<br />
Upon reflection, it's quite possible the reason Shandy doesn't see things go OOM more when I'm soloing them is because I tend to interrupt them most of the time, and kill them before they CAN go out o' mana.  <br />
<br />
It should not, however, take a creature like a Yun or Tsu shaman 4 or 5 high-mana spells longer to go OOM that it would me.  Bad enough that they're casting e-bolt, but to chain 9 or 10 300+ mana spells?<br />
<br />
Everquest perhaps has the best original design and is the most intricate game video I've ever seen.  I got full value from my subscription before, and expect to, still.<br />
<br />
VI has asked for info and discussion, and by Crackey, the Crucible provides an excellent place to do so.  Do hate the general whiners, tho :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Akhilles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Very valid points. One reason I love Morrowind so much.. it's what an online version of Everquest would be like if it worked and was complete. Oh wait, there IS an online version of Everquest... all quests littered with vague inferences, poor implementation, idiotic spawn times...<br />
<br />
And it's true, they continue to release new software, and they don't have the staff to upkeep that many divisions of the software.. and their servers have to be on the point of being stressed out with all the expansions they have running for a single server instance..</div></div><hr />
