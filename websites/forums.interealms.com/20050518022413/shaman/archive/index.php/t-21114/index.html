<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Where in the heck is this or what is this.  I'm assuming that it's an effect based off of an item, but the only thing that I've seen about it is the name. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That would be a focus effect on an as yet undiscovered item, or not yet assigned to an item. There are quite a few of those in the spell base.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is an armor hand in quest for each class through Abysmal Sea, pretty similar to old Velious armor by the sound of things.   Pretty sure these will wind up being effects on that armor once found.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yar rumor is echo of anger is on abysmal gloves for wars   <br />
<br />
<br />
thats why BP dosent have echo of anger  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yep.  Found it.<br />

Kanleku's Gauntlets of Spirits (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68887) <br />
<br />
Also this is what i'm really really excited about.  <br />
<br />
Kanleku's Vambraces of Spirits  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68886)<br />
<br />
Here is the other two decent, but not as exciting pieces.  Still missing what our boots look like, but if they follow what other classes are getting, we'll prob be seeing Discordant Ice or Poison:<br />
<br />
Kanleku's Helm of Spirits (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68885) <br />
Kanleku's Bracer of Spirits  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68889)<br />
 <br />
and for the first time in his life, Gangas is right about something:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">die bl main that cant heal in poj trials</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Excuse my n00bness, but those items all have 'Slot 8' as augments. Time acquired? Or GoD trials? Neither?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They're items similarly quested as ornate/velious faction armours but from GoD. Type 8 is presumably because of there quality (which is comparable with PoTime gear).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Qvic is my guess.<br />
<br />
Slot 8 is just Time level+ stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah, sorry, to let those know.. these are all armor that is tradeskilled in a sense from Qvic.  You loot the piece of armor, then make it in Abysmal.  Just like the ornate and elemental armor is in PoK.<br />
<br />
When augments were introduced, the only gear that had type 8 on it, were from Time and Hard LDoN raids.  When GoD was introduced, stuff that dropped in Kod'taz on has type 8 slots, and the augments are some type 8, but for the most part, they have all on it, meaning it can be stuck on augment slot.<br />
<br />
Guess one thing that is interesting too.. is that the Gaunts are only affected by Daluda's Mending.  This is great and dandy, but I hope that those that don't have the spell yet manage to grab it soon.  I myself have one, but I'm the only main shaman in my guild that has it.  In fact, I only know of one other shaman on the server that does, and she's a bot in my guild.  Mine was from a Crematory named, while the other was from a named in Vxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As is the case with most caster class specific armor quests the focus on the gloves is all but useless, much as our ornate and elemental gloves (this does not only apply to Shaman).<br />
<br />
The focus on the arms has me quite excited =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">err.. the quickest way for me to ever burn mana is to chain heal something, so the focus on the gloves is pretty ownage for me.  Especially since I have daluda.  I can see if you don't, yeah, it would suck, but 25% is better than any beneficial mana savings right now so I'll take it.  Besides, I dind't think that the elemental gloves focus was bad, although I don't use poison nukes much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah the focus is nice, but you'll probably have 20% on bloodlink if you can get these. if it was 25% every time I'd be all for it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">yeah, though I have both, I wouldn't make the switch from Time bp to Bloodlink until I find a detrimental focus extension to replace it though.  Don't even say HoH cause that weapon doesn't even compare to TA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The problem is that on July 27th you will probably get a new, better heal which will make the glove focus outdated. HPS &gt; efficiency.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">i sure hope that we get a new better heal.  I'm getting sick of wearing these elemental gloves (we've had real ****ty lucky with glove drops in time.. a total of 3 tiger padded skin and only one since they changed the loot table on them, and only one gloves of airy mist)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">At least it doesnt suck as bad as necros either, thier focus is WORSE than conservation of Bertoxxulous and only works on Night Fire &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Wow. Just wow.<br />
