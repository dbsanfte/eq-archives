<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've read several good posts here on different class builds and equipment recommendations, so I'm curious to see what everyone's profile looks like.  The best thing about WoW is the ease with which you can level a toon, so most folks, including myself have alts.  I'm very interested in seeing the profiles of the rogues and mages on this board.<br />
<br />
I'll start.</div></div><hr />

1600+ Aimed Shot crits on level 59 and 60 elites, with 500+ autoshot crits 3 to 5 times during a fight. Combine that with a beefy pet...I like my DPS. Even in my ghetto gear. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
A couple of points:<br />
<br />
- Try playing one <br />
- Clarify &quot;AH and crap loot&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">HP's are important only if you're getting hit, and even then I'll argue that they're not as important as you're making them out to be. Even with my measley 2.5k'ish HP's I still survive elites just fine for the short time I'm getting hit because of other stats I've focused on.<br />
<br />
There are other stats in this game and they actually do something here. This isn't EQ Mill. Get passed that. Move on. Welcome to today. :)<br />
<br />
And FWIW, there's a reason you need the HP's. Just look at your armor compared to mine. I'm betting you get hit a LOT more than I do. Especially considering AE's (that won't affect me since I'm not close enough to them) and your close quarters combat. Shaman can wear mail too, so have the luxury of being able to sacrifice HP's for other more important gear since they'll have higher mitigation due to the higher armor. In WoW it seems HP's are really only important to classes without some sort of decent ranged abilities.<br />
<br />
But hey...whatever floats your boat. There's no 'right' way to play this game. Only the way that brings ya the most fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Rogues can't wear mail =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Never said they could.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">HPs (sta) is great depending on what you are doing. But it depends on your playstyle and how you are talent specced. I looked at Walruss's profile, he is elemental and restoration, of course he is going to want as much mana as possible. I value stamina more usually because I am mostly enhancement. However I do carry around several pieces of gear which increase mana and mana regen so if I have to play healer i can put them on. I dunno what kinda gear your friend is wearing but I am strugging to get much past 4300ish hps and that is sacrificing a lot of int, run about 4k mana even with that. I have all instance gear except BP and legs so I wouldn't call his gear crap if he can get stats that good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
no reason to not have both is there? 4200 hps, 4600 mana, plenty of intel there.<br />
<br />

<br />
- Try playing one <br />

<br />

<br />
<br />
Valgoth and others, might want to read my post again, no where did I say ignore intelligence. Then again on a blue server, you never have to worry about death much anyway I  spose. Valgoth, if you were on a pvp server, your stats would be a joke, so I might have to clarify when i post I suppose about blue-non-blue servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Oh gawd, here we go with that argument again.  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Not me. Nope. Not getting into this one again. Not gonna do it.<br />
<br />
Get use to it Mill. HP's just simply aren't as important to everyone as they are to you. I'm sure there are some that DO play on PVP servers that might take up that argument with you too.<br />
<br />
I swear Mill. Sometimes you sound like a broken record. :)<br />
<br />
I've said my peace. I'm out. Have fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Could you link to his profile maybe?<br />
<br />
<br />
- I have a 42 shaman<br />
<br />
Have you tried both a max sta setup and a max int setup with your shaman? If you have what could you do with the max sta setup that you couldnt with the int setup and vice versa?<br />
<br />
<br />
- AH, auction house, crap loot, stuff found in the world, not uber dungeons.<br />
<br />
It was your buddys 4200 hps/4600 mana profile I would like to see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">first of all, didnt mean to offend anyone, I get pissy when people skimp hps, I know it is rude, sorry. I deserve the flames :)<br />
<br />
Have you tried both a max sta setup and a max int setup with your shaman? If you have what could you do with the max sta setup that you couldnt with the int setup and vice versa?<br />
<br />
once again, why not have both stam and intel? High end eagle stuff and special blue gear.<br />
<br />
It was your buddys 4200 hps/4600 mana profile I would like to see.<br />
<br />
if I was able to get his profile here I would, my roomate has a 60 shammy too, and is about 4000/4000, his gear not quite as good, no ubuer ther either, just patient Ah watching and world drops. Hell a hunter of ours is on par for 4100-4200 hps at 60, we have a warlock with 4200.<br />
<br />
Then again, I am on a pvp server, so you need to max your stats as much as possible, it truly helps. I can get my rogue now to 4358 with soem gear, but I lose a little too much agility, so am at around 4250 or so standard. Max stamina at the expense of other stats is not good, never.<br />
<br />
Have a good day.<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Warlocks are sort of special. They usually have a lot of hps, I struggle to stay ahead of them.

<br />
I've noticed quite a few green items that are at least &quot;as good as&quot;, if not sometimes better than, some blue items.<br />
<br />
I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt that it's very possible to achieve similar stats as that profile using AH/quested/random dropped gear.<br />
<br />
Still not gonna debate the necessity of STA/HP over other stats though. :p<br />
<br />
And Litch, you're correct. I work with a guy who plays a 60 Warlock as his main. They can, indeed, convert HP to mana, but he says he has other abilities that he uses on a more regular basis. Even so, considering he's a cloth wearer (IE, low armor), he does focus on STA gear to help cushion the hits he does take and INT to increase his mana pool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Still not gonna debate the usefulness of HP/STA over other stats though.<br />
<br />
Once again though man, for a caster, I would never go full out stamina at the expense of mana. Stuff he has is mostly eagle, like 17-19 intel and stam, full enchants, some blue crap, think he has an epic axe but dunno if good stats.<br />
<br />
tell ya what, I will go home tonight, and replace my profile on allakhazam with his, I have his account info.<br />
<br />
Tough, tough shaman too, I just barely beat him in duels :)<br />
<br />
That shaman above, profile not impressive, alot of room there for more stam/intel. He has some weird crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Yeah, sorry Mill, but have to side with the masses on this one.  4k/4k is by no means a &quot;crap&quot; gear profile for a shaman.  <br />
<br />
As Val has stated, and since I'm a hunter on a PvE server I can confirm, I rarely get hit, and when I do, it's not for long.  Therefore, the hps are usually just wasted insurance for those occassions.  Sure, I want a nice cushion for when I do pull aggro or get an add.  However, as a dps class, that is my focus.  Agi and Int, then sta and hp.  I think I have a pretty good balance at level 58 with AH and some low level instance gear.  Hope to be at 3500/3500 once I hit 60 and start farming DM and the other instances some.<br />
<br />
Enjoy, whatever style you prefer to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Tough, tough shaman too, I just barely beat him in duels :)But, haven't you posted before with something along the lines of...<br />
<br />
[paraphrased]: &quot;1v1 duels is not an indication of how well a class performs in open PVP&quot;<br />
<br />
?!?<br />
<br />
I'm willing to bet if I got the drop on you in PVP I'd whittle your HP's down in short order.<br />
<br />
Granted, and likewise, if you got the drop on me you'd have no trouble getting through my low HP's so long as you could keep me in melee range (but I have lots of tricks up my sleeve to prevent you from accomplishing that. :))<br />
<br />
Maybe you and I should copy our toons over to the PVP test server sometime and try it out? Prolly be fun! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Hey Phurion,<br />
<br />
Was looking at your profile and talents, and it seems we have similar builds (except right now I'm more Marksmanship and less BM than you).  Am just wondering how your pet does in instances?  I've considered going to a more BM build, but am not sure, since post 55 the pet seems to get owned a lot.  I have the 10% pet hp talent, but do not imagine that the 10% AC talent would increase his survivability much.<br />
<br />
I ask because I will be doing a lot more instances now that I'm close to 60 and want to focus my build around that.  Also, a friendly suggestion, you may want to consider putting the 5 pts. in Bestial Discipline into Frenzy.  I hear very good things about how much it adds to pet dps and aggro.  Just a thought, very interested in your experiences and advice.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">You are correct, however, I have no way of telling how I would do in real pvp because I am horde of course. We have started duels further away and it sucks, if I cannot close distance, I am dead.<br />
<br />
That being said, the difference between myself, and most rogues for instance, is pretty amazing, they pull every trick in the book out at me and the best they can hope for is to be able to vanish and get away if I do not have deadly poison going. I am like a tank, they a humvee without armor kits. I got alot of stamina sure, but my agility is not half bad, I don't sacrifice a whole slot for a 1% crit chance piece of gear for instance, that is just silly talk. I have on average, probably 700-1000 more hps than most rogues, that is alot of time to fight. That goes for any class.<br />
<br />
By &quot;crap&quot; gear guys, I simply mean not uber dungeon loot, stuff average Joe can get from the world or AH or questing.<br />
<br />
If I was on a pve server, I would be less focused on hps, probably have a set of gear more towards attack power. I can control my aggro well in dungeons and stuff, but if I get attacked I want to be able to have time to fight and use all my tricks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Thunderwolfjr,<br />
<br />
For now I'd stick with MM spec and only use your pet in absolute dire need. Don't put him in any situation where he'll be the focus of mob damage (in instances anyways) because they just don't have the mitigation abilities of a true tank. Relegate him to sacrificing himself to pull agro off of a healer, or as a minor DoT on mobs that don't have AE's. Other than that, I keep my pet by my side and focus on ranged DPS.<br />
<br />
When they implement the upcoming changes to how pets work (their forums are down right now, otherwise I'd link to it) they might be a little more effective depending on what options are available and how their master distributes the training points.<br />
<br />
Honestly, if I were focusing on the higher instances I'd respec to more of a MM build, but I mainly run around helping my wife or lower level guildies for now. Once we get a few more peeps up into the mid 50's+ I'll probably respec, but for now the pet is doing exactly what I need him to do, MT in some situations, MA in others.<br />
<br />
I have on average, probably 700-1000 more hps than most rogues, that is alot of time to fight. That goes for any class.Hate to break it to ya mill, but those extra HP's are nothing more than a couple of extra autoshot crits for me, which I get 3 to 5 of during practically every fight (IE, 1500 to 2500 dmg). If I get an Aimed Shot crit (if I get the drop on ya), almost half (or better) of your HP's are gone. Considering I can get 1600+ crits on mobs with anywhere from 40% to 70% more armor than you, willing to bet I could land 2k+ on you due to your lack of mitigation (22% based on your profile). No, I haven't run the numbers, and admit this is just a W.A.G. :)<br />
<br />
Yeh, I know, those crits aren't guaranteed, but neither are yours, nor is your ability to keep me in melee range. :)<br />
<br />
FWIW, I agree with you on the &quot;sacrificing AGI for +crit% gear&quot;. I'm an agility whore I tell ya! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Valgoth,<br />
<br />
you would never have time to get an aimed shot on me, you would not see me :) that is the whole point of my class, the only time a hunter can kill me is if I am engaged already, and heh, I have no problem with that. If I am caught out of stealth, tough noogies for me.<br />
<br />
Against hunters, I try to have crippling main hand, and either crippling off as well, or instant, open with cheap shot, cram two SS, they are almost always snared, I have sprint in case of anything weird. If I get the jump, it is pretty much impossible for a hunter to live.<br />
<br />
And by the way, for 12 seconds, you are also a leper gnome!! Man I love discombobulator, pass em out to all my guildies, it rules, knocks people off mount too.<br />
<br />
Envious of my brothers hunter now I must admit, such an easy class to kill critters with, and pretty damned powerful in pvp to boot. When we work together it is pretty cool, I simply guard him and if anything gets close it dies, rogues like to jump him thinking he an easy mark at only level 56 hehe, boom.<br />
<br />
Yesterday at the lake in WS, a 60 mage, 60 druid, and 60 rogue kept trying to kill us, we killed the mage maybe 15-20 times, rogue 10-15 times, and druid several times, they got my bro three times and me once. I used 15 charges of discombobulator hehe. My buddy the billy shaman joined us late, and then we drove them out completely, shaman is funny, mages are a pain in the ass sometimes, shaman likes nothing better, he says mages taste good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Mill,<br />
<br />
Very entertaining, you are truly a madman.  Sounds like a lot of fun.  I might have to try a PvP server soon, you seem to be having too much fun without me.  Since you are horde, I guess I'll make a rogue killer (have to figure out what class that is) and come looking for ya.  Start watching your back in about 4 months (I'm a casual player, will take me at least that long to get another toon to 60).  <br />
<br />
I know you're scared now.  :)<br />
<br />
Val,<br />
<br />
Thanks a bunch for the words of wisdom, much appreciated.  I've played solo for the most part up to my current level, but am getting into the instances more and more.  My guild is 80+ strong (with over 20 level 60's), so I should not have a problem getting groups.  I see this as the second half of the game, farming instances and group PvP.  So I'm reviewing my current build to make sure I am optimized for this environment.  I actually think I'll go with more Survival skills and see how that works out.  Nice to be able to respec whenever you want, gets expensive, but it's better than not having the option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Survival spec in PVE is pretty pointless in my opinion. It seems that talent tree was really a very late afterthought, though it's currently under review for possible tweaking and fine tuning.<br />
<br />
Honestly, if/when we start doing more of the end game instances I'll be going full MM with only a few points in BM. The only few Survival skills that might be worth a damn require too many points in lesser skills to get to them. So until it gets some love from Blizz, it's not a realistic primary talent option for me.<br />
<br />
Give it a shot and see how it goes. Respec's are easy to come by here. No stupid trials (a la CoH) to contend with. :)</div></div><hr />

Most of the droppers are from Scholomance, Stratholme and Blackrock Spire with a drop percentage lower than 1. A level 55 item. If these are not among the hardest dungeons in the game there must be a lot I havent seen yet.<br />
<br />
Dont get me wrong though I am still having fun with my worse-than-crap stuff :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Val,<br />
<br />
Am not planning to put many points into survival, I agree, not worth it at this point.  I feel the same about BM, after the first 5 pts. for the 10% hps, the next few pts. are pretty much wasted.  Oh well, that's what happens when your class design is rushed.<br />
<br />
Am thinking of keeping 31 pts in Marks, through TrueShot Aura, and putting 20 into Surv, to include improved wing clip, deterance and improved freeze trap.  A bit more survivability and cc for instances.  Just a thought.</div></div><hr />

I'm about as ghetto-geared as it gets and I find I'm extremely effective in both PVE, and what limited PVP is available on a PVE server.<br />

I think a big part of the fun comes from the fact that there (so far) doesnt seem to be one correct way of winning most battles. In EQ I pretty much had to try to slow anything I fought and the higher you got the harder it would be. In WoW I use my fire-dot as much as I can but some mobs (fire elementals and like that) are immune so I use other spells againts those. This is much more fun and rewarding than EQ ever was where you knew that fights would be much easier if you could slow and dot but often highend mobs would resist/mitigate/ignore this but very few mobs were outright immune. So you more or less had to try to cast spells that got resisted most of the time. In WoW fights seem much more &quot;logical&quot; - either you come up with at way to kill the mobs quickly or they kill you. Never seen any root-rot or whatever it was called in EQ hehe.</div></div><hr />

Also, this is the &quot;happy time&quot; of a new MMORPG where there is zero mudflation.  Right now it's &quot;possible&quot; for a hard core (or very lucky casual) non-raid player to get as good gear as the raider, for the most part.  Gear doesn't really make as much of a difference as it did near the end of EQ.  There's not a doubt in my mind that a skilled &quot;ghetto-geared&quot; player has the potential to really outplay high end raid geared characters.  It is harder for even the most skilled non-raiders to do so, but it is very possible.  This will not be the case after mudflation sets in and we'll be back to two tiered systems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">As long as they keep adding 5 man instances, such as Dire Maul, where the loot is as good as most of the stuff that drops in raid instances, this will not be the case.  However, I doubt they can sustain this, since at some point, you have to give folks a reason to go to MC, etc.<br />
<br />
But heck, even some of the Beaststalker gear, top end hunter armor right now, can be bought in the AH, since some of the set pieces are PoE.  I may never see MC, but I can surely save enough to buy the Beaststalker PoE set pieces over time.  :)</div></div><hr />

Considering re-speccing my 20 points of beast mastery into survival as well.  Pets were weak before the last patch, now they are approaching EQ shaman pets in utility in raids/groups.</div></div><hr />

that is the shaman I am talking about, all easily attainable gear, he upped his hps slightly and reduced mana slightly since posted before. Tough as nails. No reason a level 60 shouldn't be similar or better, we a small guild.</div></div><hr />

Immediately noticed a considerable DPS increase, but will need a little more time to get a true feel for whether or not it will be a viable build for my playstyle.</div></div><hr />

Any special reason that you skipped Riposte in favor of getting a single point in Imp. Evasion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Not really Jenoe, and to be honest I want riposte back, might respec yet again. I wasn't using it much, but I am more calm in pvp now, before was al panicky and always forgot to use it.</div></div><hr />
