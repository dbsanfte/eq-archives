<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ashenshugar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm doing some research on some mobs we're currently working on. In Lucy's (http://lucy.fnord.net) the info is taken from the spdat file. There are three items in particular that it is critical that I understand. <br />
<br />
1. The range - is the range in loc ticks or some other range?<br />
2. Recast - Is this in ticks or seconds?<br />
3. PBAE - My understanding is that a point blank ae is centered on the current target (the person with aggro).<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance in your help in unraveling my confusion :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valedhel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From my understanding of the matter, a PBAE is centred around the caster, and not the target. That's a plain AE. I think the recast is in seconds, but i'd suggest a second opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aluaden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">PBAE stands for Point Blank AE, i.e centered around the caster.  There are also target based AEs, whose radius is centered on the mob on which it was cast (Like old harmony)<br />
<br />
Recast time is in seconds, and range is in loc lengths.</div></div><hr />
