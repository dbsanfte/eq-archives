<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This kept coming up on the &quot;Skrew shammys&quot; thread, so I thought I would clarify things in a new thread.<br />
<br />
People keep stating that beastlords buff better than shaman. I think there is some truth to this argument, but there are situations in which a shaman is a better choice.<br />
<br />
(All spells listed as if cast by a 65.)<br />
<br />
Shaman uses:<br />
<br />
Focus of Soul/7th = 544 hp and 70 str/dex<br />
Talisman of Boar = 60 STA<br />
Spirit of Bih'li (outdoor only) = SoW, +15 ATK<br />
Swift Like The Wind = 60% haste (or ToA, 50% group haste)<br />
Ferine Avatar = 140 ATK/STR/DEX/AGI<br />
Talisman of the Diaku = 45 STR, 35 DEX<br />
<br />
<br />
Beastlord uses:<br />
<br />
Spiritual Vigor = 225 hp and 40 ATK<br />
Talisman of Kragg = 395 hp<br />
Infusion of Spirit = 50 STR, 55 DEX, 45 STA<br />
Spiritual Dominion = 9 hp/mana per tick<br />
Celerity = 50% haste<br />
Ferocity = 40 STA, 150 ATK, 65 MR/FR/CR/DR/PR<br />
<br />
<br />
Please note that Talisman of Kragg and Spiritual Vigor STACK. That is why BLs often prefer their buffs  (Kragg/SV/IoS) to Focus - the 40 ATK and 76 additional HP are really much better than 20 STR and 15 DEX you would get from Focus. Ferocity and Ferine Avatar stack, but clearly Ferocity is better. We have no analog to SD, but it's obviously a great buff.<br />
<br />
Some things to consider:<br />
<br />
1) SV doesn't stack with the paladin Brell's line, so when pally buffs are available, Focus is a better choice for max HP.<br />
<br />
2) All those buffs are pretty mana intensive for BLs, who generally have smaller mana pools than shaman and do not have access to the cannibalize line.<br />
<br />
3) The beastlord buff series takes up 2 buff slots (SV + Kragg) vs. 1 for shaman (Focus).<br />
<br />
4) Shaman have the SCR/SCRM AAs, while BLs do not. This makes it possible for us to keep FA on a lot more people than a BL can keep Ferocity on.<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally, I think it's inappropriate that a hybrid can outbuff us in so many situations, but it's not the biggest issue we have right now. We haven't been the &quot;King of Buffs&quot; for a long time, unless you count stat buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Focus stacks with Spiritual Vigor.<br />
<br />
Ferocity can only be kept up on 2-3 people full time, compared to 9 with FA.<br />
<br />
Oddly, beastlords get no agility buffs (except Frenzy, a self-buff).<br />
<br />
If your choice is between just a shaman or just a beastlord for buffs (but a chanter or bard for 60% haste), then beastlords are better if you have the buff slots available.<br />
<br />
The 9 mana/tick buff is insane.  Shamans have no useful caster buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Personally I think it's kind of lame that BLs get so many of the shaman abilities AND get an awesome pet and pet related spells AND get other cool BL specific spells like beastie crack.<br />
<br />
Beasties may not get canni but they do get beastie crack which is helpful to more than just themselves.  In fact, I love it...KEI + spiritual beastiness + canni = me drowning in mana.<br />
<br />
I demand that shaman get beastie crack, at say, level 53, and then I'll this issue will no longer bother me!<br />

Lol I was getting all steamed again until this post. This really does bottom-line it for me pretty fast. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>dmuscat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thats an impressive set of buffs for a hybrid.  Add in their 15 a tick regen to this and they are permanately at 24 a tick hp / 9 a tick mana regen.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I actually buff people similar to a beast lord, partiall cause I'm only 59, and partially cause its a better line, however<br />
<br />
Kragg + IoS + Sta + single target stat buffs as asked<br />
<br />
Give you more hps, and more stats.  A high level BST can do similar to me.  That set up is only 9hps less than Fo7 and offers far better stats.  Obviously not a raid line-up as its icon intensive, however for adventures (which is mostly all I do anymore) its very effective, particularly at the level I'm at where people aren't even ToV equipped so the stats really shine.  I also have carnage which stacks on all of that (+40 atk, +40str, +40dex, +40agi) which I use on the MT like some people use avatar/primal avatar/ferine avatar, but I can keep it up on more if mana (ie 16 secs where I don't need to canni) and time permit.  To put us more in line, I'd love to see a group IoS, and a higher level Talisman spell that gives Fo7 hps.  Then I could start to approach cleric hps when buffing (105sta, and 750hps) when I hit 65.  I'm envious of some of the BL buffs, but I'm just as envious of the ranger atk line, and the Brells line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Roxxanne, that was a very nice whine-session derailment.  *grin*<br />
<br />
BST is my melee alt of choice, and provides a phenomenally fun alternative for when I don't feel like shamaning.  I DO think they're spastically overpowered, but this doesn't make me enjoy playing my shaman any less.<br />
<br />
I've learned that if I group with a beastlord, don't buff them or their pet, they don't want it.  The others in the group prefer my buffs because they last a long long time, and everything is a group buff, or I have it timed off dogdog, and they never have to ask.  If melees are clicking off my buffs and sending tells to the bst for other buffs, that's fine.  I'm not hearing anything from either of them about it.<br />
<br />
Beastlords are phenomenal soloers, which results in there being a lot of high level toons with no grouping skills.  Which leads to some BIG PR problems for beastlords (ala druids, and necromancers).  If anything balances out their power as a class, it's that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Lol I was getting all steamed again until this post. This really does bottom-line it for me pretty fast. :)<br />
<br />
hehe, /agree.<br />
<br />
Just the simple things in life:  not having Malos and Paralyzing Earth/Virulent Paralysis for instance.<br />
<br />
And canni, and quiescence, and tnarg's mending, and tears of saryrn, and velium strike, and spear of torment, and blood of saryrn, and breath of ultor, and bane, and gate.<br />
<br />
Then there's levitation, everlasting breath, group stat buffs, group sow, chain armor, two different kinds of slow with resist debuffers for both kinds, and canni.<br />
<br />
Then there's canni.<br />
<br />
Oh yea, and not being able to sustain your activity indefinitely.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">buffs that shaman cast all time time : <br />
-Focus of Soul/7th = 544 hp and 70 str/dex<br />
-Talisman of Boar = 60 STA<br />
-Ferine Avatar = 140 ATK/STR/DEX/AGI<br />
<br />
buffs that Beastlord cast all time : <br />
-Spiritual Vigor = 225 hp and 40 ATK<br />
-Spiritual Dominion = 9 hp/mana per tick<br />
-Ferocity = 40 STA, 150 ATK, 65 MR/FR/CR/DR/PR<br />
<br />
now, let see :<br />
1, all above 6 buff stack, Spiritual Vigor have problem with paladin/ranger buff<br />
2, Beastlord better in Atk/mana/hp regen buff, and we only better at hp/stat<br />
3, beastlord also have weaker version of our HP/stat buff which pretty close to uur best hp/stat<br />
4, during raid, cleric cast 2 buff(Virtue, BoR for caster), chanter 3(VoQ, haste, SV magic), druid 1(SV fire), shaman 3(FoS, stama, avatar), beastlord 2-3(SD, Ferocity, and maybe SV)<br />
<br />
as you see, Beaslord is very strong buff class, they have more importance buff than druid/ranger/paladin, close to shaman, and behind cleric/chanter; that is -- they are top 4 or 3 buff class while maintance high melee dps(melee + pet outdamage monk)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The fact that beastlords can slow 10% less than us, and buff at a good 3/4ths capacity is ridiculous. The beastlord will never take my spot on a raid, but will consistantly take my spot in an LDON adventure or BoT group.<br />
<br />
The class is a powerful one, I'd venture as far as to say a ridiculously powerful one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rastik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Problem with beastie buffs is that they're mostly single target, short duration, take tons of mana which beasties don't get much, and are tedious to cast. Buffing everyone in group with IOS and Kragg is 6*(375+200) = 3450 mana, heck most level 65 beasties don't even have that much, plus another round of buffs for the pet; SV, SD, Stamina for whoever needs. Ferocity at its 600 mana for 6.5 minute duration is outright luxury. What's really the most annoying is haste. Celerity at level 65 helps, 15 minute duration yay, but doing Alacrity every 10 mins is super annoying. Beasts get SCR AA but not SCRM, and extended duration items are quite rare for them; the only really accessible one is Ceramic Shield of Valor, but since it sucks for a ranged slot and beasties need weapons in their primary and secondary, they need to swap it in every time they do buffs (such as Ferocity if they have mana for that), which adds another level of tedium.<br />
<br />
That's why, I believe, few beasties would mind having a shaman in group taking care of all their buff problems with neat group spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">This was not intended as a whine thread. When I am whining, you will know it.     :) <br />
<br />
This topic has come up repeatedly, along the lines of &quot;Why does that BL say he buffs better than I do?&quot;. It was meant more as an explanation of buff stacking than anything. I do think that a BL being able to buff more raw HP than a shaman is silly, but the whole concept of game balance in EQ has been gone for quite a while.<br />
<br />
Oh, and give me rez, Ensnare, Complete Heal, and Strike of Solusek!   :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Does root, canni, malos, Q = their insane pets, SD, ferocity, melee with appropiate AAs?  In some ways yes, but in some ways no imo.   I think shaman have a legitimate beef about BLs, but monks probably have a bigger beef.  I'm still waiting for BLs to get feign death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rastik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Looks like a lot of people keep forgetting that shamans are a priest class, with great heals as well as everything else. <br />
<br />
Beastlords can slow, do damage, offtank and tank, they can easily replace shamen as slowers in groups and more... but too few people realize that in places where beastlords are able to all that, eg LDON Normal adventures, shamen are also able to replace clerics.<br />
<br />
There's a cleric I sometimes group with who's, for fun and as the main healer, trying to finish adventures without casting *any* heal spells, using only Divine Arbitration and Celestial Elixir AA abilities. Last time I think he did it, too. :) Methinks it would take a really sucky shaman not to be able to do more healing than that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Do clerics have to malos and slow mobs as well?   No, if they did they woudln't be able to keep up the mana.   That cleric most likely had someone slowing mobs (you?) correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">give us a rez0% xp and people will begin to consider us as main healer in LDoN dungeons.<br />
Oh and btw, Beastlords have SCR 3 AAs, but not the SCRM</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">What really bothers me about beastlord buffs?  Savagery vs avatar.  I wont even get into the debate of who is better.  Primal avatar and feral avatar are only available in one raid zone each, off a couple mobs.  The ONLY version of avatar that is available to most shaman @60 is plain old avatar.  You have to use an emerald to cast it, best price I've seen is 13pp.  Gotta recast that dude every 6 minutes, can hold it on two people at a time.  Thats 260pp per hour.  Now beastlords, being the spoiled sort, saw that shaman 'get' two!! versions of componentless avatar, and demand that the gem use on their spell get removed.  Voila, bst spell is now componentless.  Add to the fact that a beastlord can just walk into the damn pok library and buy it!<br />
So, ANY beastlord can own a great componentless spell that can be aquired for ~150pp.  Shaman, however, need to be able to raid to aquire such a thing.  The only other alternatives are to a) be rich and eat the cost -or-  b) just dont cast it.  Either way bst's come out on top, again.<br />
This being said, I have a lower level beastlord on another server from my main, 61 shaman.  They really aren't looking for the same slot in a group.  Of course, due to the enormous over abundance of shaman, mine sits lfg often for hours.  Usually with another 4 or 5 waiting at the same time.   My bsts dps always seems to be wanted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please note that Talisman of Kragg and Spiritual Vigor STACK. That is why BLs often prefer their buffs (Kragg/SV/IoS) to Focus. <br />
<br />
SV stacks with focus aswell.<br />
<br />
4) Shaman have the SCR/SCRM AAs, while BLs do not. <br />
<br />
Beastlords have SCR as an AA choice.<br />
<br />
Ferocity can only be kept up on 2-3 people full time <br />
<br />
Max possible for fero is almost(very close) 5. 2-3 is much more realistic though.<br />

<br />
hehe not true in my case, and im sure many other beastlords. :) <br />
<br />
Problem with beastie buffs is that they're mostly single target, short duration, take tons of mana which beasties don't get much, and are tedious to cast. <br />
<br />
Very true. It really is a nightmare playing the &quot;shaman&quot; role in a group as a beastlord.It's very possible but it slows the group down and is very much not fun for the beastlord. I LOVE grouping with a shaman because of this. ;) <br />
<br />

I think you are somewhat mixed up on your facts here. Savagery does cost a peridot, Ferocity doesn't. Ferocity is not sold in the PoK library, It is a rune word turn-in. I paid 50k for mine after camping the bazaar for 2 months actually. :( <br />

<br />
<br />
Don't forget we Beastlords get Regrowth for even more regen loving. ;)<br />
<br />
Oh and class envy posts are stupid. Shaman are Shaman and Beastlords are Beastlords. They are different classes that perform two totally different roles. Neither class impedes the usefullness of the other. So why so much hate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I think a shaman can still buff more efficiently than a BL.  Look at all those buffs a BL has to cast.  It doesn't take much at all for my 15 buff slots to get filled up in groups or raids.  I simply don't need ATK buffs, nor do half the classes out there.<br />
<br />
Focus o/t 7th, Group Boar, Group Replenishment.  With just those 3 buffs, you're increasing everyone's hps by 700-800, and their regen by 25/tick.  That's really all ya need, and you only took up 3 buff slots.  If the group wanted, you could throw in Bih'Li, which adds some ATK, but not a big deal.  Group Agility is a junk-buff.  And if the melees in my group are weak in the gear department, I might through Diaku on them.  Most of the melees I group with are already maxed in str/sta/dex with just focus and boar...<br />
<br />
On raids, I buff everyone with Fot7, Boar, and Replen.  If we're fighting a disease/poison area... everyone gets T of the Tribunal.  Takes me about 1 min to cast that on everyone, and soon after I'm able to start contributing nicely in other ways.  A BL would have a helluva time keeping their buffs on everyone, and would have to cast twice as many buffs to achieve the same effect.<br />
<br />
I don't think BLs can MGB.  Not sure on that, but don't think they can.  On a raid of 40 people, we can MGB Fot7, and increase the raid's hitpoints by 40 X 544 = 21,760 in about 13 secs.  Not mention that it gives 75 str and 70 dex wrapped up into it.  It's a buff-slot saver.  Don't under-estimate the uberness of Fot7.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">You know, I never really thought of BL as competition. I know most of the people that I group with want both. The benefit of having a Beastlord and a Shaman in group is enormous! It seems our 2 classes work extremely well together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Rastik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Beastlords got MGB about 6 months ago. That eventually gave them a real if formal raid role with AE Paragon for healing and mana.<br />
<br />
I really can't figure out the envy for Ferocity though. Well, resists on it are cool. But other than that - FA adds almost as much ATK, has a 1 minute recast vs 2 min on Ferocity, and takes 350 mana vs 600. Much better in a normal group setting, especially considering superior shammy manaregen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gawkmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Why do some of you feel threatened by the Beastlord spell lineup? The buffs BL's get are much lower level spells than shaman get and as such they shouldn't be used as primary buffs if a shaman is around. All these buffs do is allow some flexability when forming a group. No longer do you find groups sitting around waiting for a specific class. Now you can build a group with what is available and do nearly as well as that so called perfect group. <br />
<br />
Besides that I don't seem to remember reading much from some of you when the clerics were crying that the new percentage heals were going to make them a useless class. Nor did I hear much from you when the enchanters cried foul when most every caster class was getting some form of a mana regen spell. Just stop the class envy posts they are really silly and make the poster appear as if they no nothing about their class or the game of EQ.</div></div><hr />

In an instant. Better buffs, better dps, better tanking, no secondary heal role.<br />

HI!<br />
Ferocity has recently had its peridot requirement removed.  I might be mistaken in saying its already been implented on live, but its been on test, and is coming to live.<br />
Avatar, however, still has the emerald.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Neferbastet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Question, does ferocity and ferine avatar stack? If they do wouldn't that make for some sweet dps ;) It seems to me that our spells come together very nicely and that having a Beast and a Shaman in a group together would bring so many more benefits than choosing one over the other. I have looked into Beasts and have known a few. I will try to persuade a group I am in to pick one up if I see one lfg. I love them and I have never felt threatened by them in anyway, primarily because I know my own class and do my shammy things while they do their Beastie things ;). Never have had a problem with stepping on toes.<br />
   About the deal with avatar. Don't waste your money on it, the expense of the emerald and recast time make it so inefficient it isn't funny. Get Primal essence (can be researched) wait till 65 and get Ferine ( No component, YAY! ). These days it should take you a couple weeks if not a week to get there from 60 :P.<br />

err, did you read my post?. The peridot requirment has been removed from ferocity for months and months now, it's not a new change. Best I can guess is you once again mixed the spells up and ment savagery not ferocity.<br />

Actually ... we did.  Most, including myself, chose to complain that druids got the better ICH, while others simply sympathised with clerics a little.  The cleric PoV was brought up.<br />

Nor did I hear much from you when the enchanters cried foul when most every caster class was getting some form of a mana regen spell. <br />
Yeah, thats plain stupid.  Our mana regen is self only, can cause low health aggro, even kill us, it's active and requires us to spend time where we cannot cast other spells or move, but most of all it's self only.  A chanter being threatened by our mana regen is like a bird that's afraid of heights.<br />

 Just stop the class envy posts they are really silly and make the poster appear as if they no nothing about their class or the game of EQ.<br />
I couldn't agree more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Brat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Ferocity  &amp; Ferine stack just fine.  Ferocity is 600 freaking mana tho, 10-20% of a bsts mana pool.  So even if you could keep it on 7-8 people like Ferine, you could not keep on 7-8 people.<br />
<br />
As to bst buffs being better than shaman? I have never undstood why anyone would think that, and have argued that point over and over on eqbeastlord.  Why would you want something filling up 4 buff slots vs the single one focus uses?<br />
<br />
Wanna know beastlord hell? When for some odd reason there are no shaman on a raid, no pallies.  Happened to me in Fire once, so much fun buffing 6-8 groups with SD, SV, then single target buffing every melee with Kragg, and a few with IoS and/or stam.  Less hps for everyone, more buff slots filled, and a &quot;dps&quot; class sitting on a lizard begging for twiches.<br />
<br />
Bst get most of the shaman arch aa, and MGB, just don't get the super duper SCR/M type stuff.  Still dont know why beastlords &amp; necros don't get Spirit Call tho /shrug<br />
<br />
No need to h8, go download EQW, make a beastlord &amp; play the two together, that's where the fun is - no need to ditch the shaman :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Why do some of you feel threatened by the Beastlord spell lineup? The buffs BL's get are much lower level spells than shaman get and as such they shouldn't be used as primary buffs if a shaman is around.<br />
<br />
So you don't think a BL should use SV, SD, or Ferocity when a shaman is around? I don't seem to recall having higher level versions of those spells in my book, but maybe I should look again.<br />

Some people enjoy discussing class balance, if the views on this thread can be taken as evidence. There have been no flames and minimal whining here... I don't see what your issue is. Really, though, everyone else who has posted knows nothing about EQ. Thanks for the valuable input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Gawkmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Sithrax you made my point. Beastlord buffs do not take anything away from the shaman's role. Those 3 buffs you pointed out are in noway infringing on anything the shaman has to offer. In fact those 3 spells compliment the shaman buffes quite nicely. <br />
<br />
Class envy is whining whether you like it or not. When someone makes posts like this one and the other &quot;Shaman suck&quot; posts they are clearly stating that they want another class nerfed so that their beloved class is stronger. So if you believe this thread or the others on the first page of these forums has anything to do with class balancing then please give my your phone number because I'm sure I have a bridge or two I'd love to sell you. <br />
<br />
I have played a shaman since EQ beta and it remains as always a very enjoyable and desired class and their aren't many other classes can say that they have been that desired since day one. The constant cries that this class has been nerfed into uselessness clearly make my point that they know nothing of EQ. This game has evolved over the last 5 years into a game less about specilization classes into a game with a collection of jack-of-all-trades. At one point a group had to have a warrior, cleric and shaman before they would consider hunting in nearly any zone. Those days are long gone and I say good riddance. Now we have real choices in how we build our groups and we don't have to sit on our butts waiting for the holy trinity to decide they should lower themselves to group with the rest of us peons. <br />
<br />
So please don't delude yourself into believing these threads are anything but a cry for a nerf bat.</div></div><hr />

I like to think there is a middle ground which allows for rational discussion of class balance issues. Did anyone really think manaburn was balanced? It was a real joy having to fight the MB squad on your server for content (back in the days when Kunark mobs were non-trivial). Sometimes nerfing is warranted.<br />
<br />
Can you honestly say that EQ is a better game with the revamped lull lines put in? How about plate hybrid aggro locking? I think these are bad for the game - period. If hybrid aggro lock was nerfed, I would get weaker, not stronger, due to the high aggro of shaman spells. Nonetheless, I would support a nerf of this ability (I think hybrids should have the ability to lock aggro, just not at trivial mana cost, btw.)<br />
<br />
It's often said &quot;Don't nerf, just bring all classes up to the level of X&quot;. This can only lead to rapid mudflation, something we already have enough of. Sometimes you need to remove an ability for the overall health of the game.<br />
<br />
Do beastlords need to be nerfed for the health of EQ? There are certainly worse issues out there, in particular the 2 I mentioned above. I do wish for a bit more separation between BLs and shaman in terms of buffing and slowing, especially since mitigation brings all slowers much closer together anyway... and darn near eveything mitigates slow in the elemental planes.<br />
<br />
So if this is whining, then so be it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">ok, so in identifying the problem; i think it is seen as two fold.  <br />
<br />
BL's may or may not get better buffs than Shaman; coupled with a slow that is dangerously close to our 'area'<br />
<br />
BL's consistantly out DPS shaman.<br />
<br />
Now, this is not generally seen as a lvl 65 shaman problem.  it is more in the 50-61 crowd.<br />
<br />
the solution was posted above.<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=2158<br />
<br />
make that a shaman lvl 50 spell.  lvl 50 is the &quot;lvl to attain&quot; listed on Allakhazam.<br />
<br />
it makes no sense that shaman get an ATK buff at lvl 39 (which cannot be cast indoors) Spirit of Bih'Li; which only raises atk by 15. Then Shaman get the next atk buff that raises atk by 100 at lvl 60 (Avatar).<br />
<br />
start at 50, give shaman carnage, make us the buff master again thru the upper mid lvls and pump our atk without having to change the table we melee at.<br />
<br />
sounds great to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Strange. Before level 60 the beastlord has no haste buff, only 30% slow, and lousy single-target buffs with the exception of Spiritual line. There is simply no comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">You know, I never really thought of BL as competition. I know most of the people that I group with want both. The benefit of having a Beastlord and a Shaman in group is enormous! It seems our 2 classes work extremely well together.<br />
<br />
At my level we coexist very well and I never feel threatened by BLs (I'm only 53).  I've had one BL say they could do some slowing and one necro who always wants to slow undead in MM adventures.  To both of them I have said &quot;I'm here to slow, don't steal my thunder&quot; and something like &quot;I'll take care of slowing, you take care of doing DPS&quot; (since you don't usually add a necro or BL in LDoN with shammy with the intention of either of them slowing - you want them for massive DPS).  I haven't had a problem with either once roles were clarified.<br />
<br />
My thing with BLs is that they have an awesome pet, they're decent at melee, they have some BL-specific spells that are damn sweet, and on top of all that they are almost as good a slower as a shaman and get lots of other shaman-like spells.  They're strong in several areas.  I think BLs are a bit overpowered.  &lt;shrug&gt;  I guess that's why my LDoN groups will add them without hesitation.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">If you want to see a speed killing group, get a beastie (puller, slower), 2 mages, 1 necro, 1 chanter, and any healer. Mobs drop so fast that the lower level beastie slow is hardly ever needed, and you have chanter slow for named. <br />
<br />
You get pacify and FD for pulls, 4 monster pets. Mana regen out the @ss. In most cases CC is not even needed since good players can manage their pets well enough to offtank mobs while still keeping them in rain spell range. Actually a shaman works pretty well in this group. Superior heal is nicely sized for robe classes and an extra pet never hurts. With beastie crack, C2/KEI, modrods and necro manapumps, everyone can chain cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">err, did you read my post?. The peridot requirment has been removed from ferocity for months and months now, it's not a new change. Best I can guess is you once again mixed the spells up and ment savagery not ferocity.<br />
<br />
The reply you have to that quote of me makes zero sense haha, did you read what you were quoting?.<br />
<br />
My apologies, I did reverse the names.  My beastlord is nowhere near 60, so I'm not using them every day.  I'm rather curious to know how mixing names up affects the validity of my complaint.  A shaman can STILL either cast a (nodrop)spell that drops from a very few mobs in raid zones, or spend a ton of plat on emeralds.  A beastlord can STILL just walk into pok, buy a spell for chump change, and never pay a reagent cost.  Whether the name is ferocity or savagery matters little.  Of course, speaking of high spell prices to shamans is rather redundant :)<br />
<br />
This is the kind of thing that bugs me.  I dont much care about hos/focus/ios/tok/whatever.  I have a personal pet peeve about reagents.  What is 'balancing' about making one class pay plat to cast their spells?  Avatar does absolutely nothing for me, yet I have to pay for it.  The same goes for every class that must spend reagents on spells, whether optional or not.  They add to the group, not the caster, in most cases.  You shouldn't be punished for using it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Incorrect - the spell that can be bought (Savagery) DOES use a reagent - a dot.  So the one any bst can get does indeed require a bag of dots.  Ferocity does not, but that's a rune turn-in &amp; pretty pricy.<br />
<br />
On the flip side, I was always pissed that my shaman never had the chance to get primal avatar &amp; had to spend for the regents, but at least that was corrected, somewhat, with Ferine.  Then again I traded a totemic BP to get a copy of cani 3 back in the day hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Okay, I see.  I didn't realize it was the 65 runeword spell that went componentless and the 60 version still was.  Heh, probably got that mixed up when I switched the names, my thanks.<br />
I still HATE reagents though :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Merdenoms</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I see a common trend to compare buffs... which makes for good debates and all but, why not compare debuffs as well?  Its the #1 reason a Shaman is in the game.  Not for buffs, for debuffs!  Bestlord's can't compete with us there at all.  Why?  Because their only debuff is a higly resistable slow!<br />
<br />
Ask a Beastlord how hard it is for him to land that slow.  He'll tell you that he gets resisted atleast (emphasis on the word atleast!) 40% of the time.  Compare that to our occasional resisted slow (say 10% of the time at most?), I'd say that we're far more superior.  <br />
<br />
Ask a Beastlord how much they envy us for Malos and Malicious Decay which are UNRESISTABLE (but you already knew that)!<br />
<br />
A Beastlord will never replace us in an adventure or experience group.  A group may settle for a Beastlord at best.  If you would take the time to quit crying about how great Beastlord's are you might just realize how great Shaman's are.  <br />
<br />
I'll say it again, the #1 reason a Shaman is in the game isn't to buff, its to debuff! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I played a beastlord on beta buff server the amount of dps they can pump out is amazing, but their buffing sucks and crowd control is non existant in a situation. The only thing I do think is they possibly step on some group roles which SoE so conveniently put together in a class. Ie mana regen+dps+atk buffs+melee+resists( in ferocity). <br />
<br />
I guess they are also enviable in the sense they can lfg as a slower and a dps. When say a ranger, he lfg as a dps, a rogue lfg as a dps, and a shaman as a slower. However this thought process can break down when you look at chanter.<br />
<br />
(I did think enchanter was too multiroled and I guess beastlord was the solution in a way since it would have been too overpowering to give away any of the roles to any of the existing classes. But as a new class it would be the incentive to play a new class having so many multi roles.)<br />
<br />
In retrospect I don't think they should have given ferocity so much near attack, it should be around 70, and mana regen possibly should not have been given also. Thats just my opinion and not suggestive of a nerf so beastlords that come here complaining this is just my view not a collective shaman one. <br />
<br />
Anyway interesting topic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How much?  A ton.  Beastlord debuffs (the two we have) are only good for aggro purposes, they're not worth casting otherwise.  That and better buffs (I'd rather have 7th/Soul than IoS and Kragg any day) are why I started my Shaman.  (Of course, after getting my twink frog shaman to 29 I decided that it was time to start a troll shaman instead...)<br />
<br />
As a Beastlord, I don't consider myself a replacement for Shaman in groups. (There's no substitute for Shaman on raids.)  I only serve as slower and buffer when there's no Shaman available - I'd much rather use that mana for DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Murkk Dakruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Exactly how Eatbugs put it.I very much prefer to have a shaman in my group.

That's because the shaman was always tauted as the &quot;primitive battle priest&quot; in original EQ. When level 50 was king.<br />
<br />
We could melee better then the other healers, and aside from CH, we healed fine. Level 60 and every expansion thereafter changed all that.</div></div><hr />

I really hate weighing in on threads like this, but hello I do this all the time with my shaman.   Me + 5 dps classes = dungeon pwnd.   I pull, I slow, I heal, I nuke ... I can't see a beastlord pulling that off sorry.<br />
<br />
As for the class envy thing, get over yourselves!   Beastlord is a great class, they can do great things, but take over ALL the shaman roles?  No that they cannot do.  I feel pretty safe with my shaman and I've never had trouble finding groups or soloing.</div></div><hr />
