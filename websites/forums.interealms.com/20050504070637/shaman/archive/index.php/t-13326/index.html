<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can anyone recommend a decent guide to the trials, and not just the Trial of Execution?<br />
<br />
Everyone seems to do the Exec trial, it's accepted as the easiest, but shamans aren't the best class to take through this trial, and I'm wondering if any of the others are more suitable for me and my guildies.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, assuming mostly levels 60-62, what's a good group to take through Exec, including a shaman?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not really a trial, but the Maze in PoN was fun and I enjoyed helping people through there over and over. In the maze, three shaman aren't overdoing it, it's more like life insurance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ridik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Trials Hotkey<br />
/target MT<br />
/assist<br />
/pause 5<br />
/pet attack<br />
/cast 8 (IceStrike)<br />
<br />
Then pretend your a Wizard with Warrior sized nutz and just consta blast.  Modrod after first wave, and again at 4th for best mana efficiency(if you donthave Cana5).<br />
<br />
Have mage ring and bracer, for Icestrike.  I felt retarded when I realized that ring and bracer do diddly for Spear of Torment and Icestrike is MUCH more effecient DD with those items.  I also had a bag full of Yaks and WoFSs for extra pet damage, but only needed 2 cuz I passed on first try, that night(we wont talk about the other 4hours I wasted trying and learning prior).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">To do Exec, you need a good focus point Tank: Ideally a Paladin, next best a good SK or Warrior. The tank's job is to try to keep aggro on all the mobs at once.<br />
<br />
If you have a ggod tank, it doesn't matter too much what class you take (I have seen 1xPaladin +5xDruid stroll thru trial).<br />
<br />
The important thing is short term DPS, and although some classes are better for DPS than others, provided you havegood teamwork and everyone is ont the case, you can get through (I did the trial with 58druid, 59shaman, 59shaman, 58cleric 65Paladin 63Ranger, which is not exactly optimum class selection or level selection, but we worked well and got it done.<br />
<br />
As a shaman in the trial, forget everything you know.<br />
<br />
You will NOT have time to slow (except final boss)<br />
You will not have time to DoT<br />
<br />
You will use your inefficent Direct Damage spells<br />
You will send pet (remember you can make pet, buff pet to the max, etc before entering the trial, and then cast &quot;summon companion&quot; before trial starts).<br />
<br />
Basically, if you can get your hot keys set up as listed in an earlier post, you are set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Maybe I should explain a little.<br />
<br />
I'm in a small family guild with not many 60+ people, so the ones we do have are an odd mix of classes. Let me think, 60+ we have 3 warriors, 1 cleric, 1 enchanter, 1 beastlord, 2 magicians, 2 wizards, 2 druids, 1 ranger (my alt). They're scattered over the world so it's unlikely to get them all together at the same time.<br />
<br />
I'd like to get through trials with my guild, not with a pickup group, to get myself flagged and to help as many as possible get flagged.<br />
<br />
I have a 61 ranger (basically retired now) and I've tried the trials a few times with him, never with my shaman, (though grouped with a shaman once) but never succeeded.<br />
<br />
If we don't have enough DPS with my ranger, we certainly won't with my shaman, and I would want to help as best I can anyway, not to be carried through (to whatever extent) by others.<br />
<br />
I don't need to know WHAT to do as a shaman in the trials - I know it's all about DPS.<br />
<br />
I want to know if there's any alternative trials where I'd be contributing more. Or if there's an unusual but effective group configuration where I do more than be a second rate wizard.<br />
<br />
I'm not even going to try until I'm 60 (59 now), but would like to research them somewhat to see which would be best for my guild, depending on who we have available at the time.<br />
<br />
So, I'd like to know if anyone has seen a set of good guides for all the trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">With that guild config, just take one of the warriors, the cleric, the two mages, a wizzie and the_sixth_person into the exe trial.  Mages are THE class for DPS in that trial, you should be fine.  When you're not in the trial, spend your time buffing the guild group going in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">60+ we have 3 warriors, 1 cleric, 1 enchanter, 1 beastlord, 2 magicians, 2 wizards, 2 druids, 1 ranger (my alt). <br />
<br />
You have all the right classes to get through exe trial in no time.<br />
Tank + Cleric/Druid + Shaman + 2 Mages + Whoever adding DPS.<br />
<br />
Tank tanks.<br />
Healer heals.<br />
Shaman nukes and heals the healer and does downtime healing with Torpor.<br />
Mages banish the summoned rocks and use pets for CC and nuke the hell out of the main target.<br />
Last slot in the group can be anyone you want who is having problems getting through the trial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My guild runs cleric/chanter/warrior/dps/dps/whomever for the trails, and get most people through in 1 shot.  Warrior has the advantage of defensive on the prime executioner, that guy hurts unless you have a very tough pally/sk. You might risk to loose in the waves with a warrior due to reduced dps, but usually you don't wipe if you do, so you can just start over (and you're not blocking the trail waiting for the corpses to puff to GY after wipe).</div></div><hr />
