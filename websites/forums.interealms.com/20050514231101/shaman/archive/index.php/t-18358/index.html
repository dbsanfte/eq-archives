<br />
Example, I bought and sold thousands of plat worth of items for a profit last month.  All legitimately bought in the bazaar.  Now, the fact that I COULD sell them at a profit may have been because Joe Cheater wanted to launder his illegally-gotten plat.  Perhaps if Joe hadn't been around I'd have had to lower my prices.<br />
<br />
How are they going to fix that?  Retroactively reduce the amount of plat I have?  Refund the items that I sold and remove the plat?  Just remove the plat?</div></div><hr />

I disagree.  There are SEVERAL ways to re-value platinum in the game by slowly siphoning it out.  Earlier methods have been to use horses, tradeskill matery, tradeskill related quests (then later letting the people who actually DO tradeskills master multiple tradeskills to 250), and even more recently with illusion potions.<br />
<br />
What I believe SoE could to do is come up with methods of getting people to give platinum to NPCs where the returns will just vanish.  Items never deteriorate, and tradeskill quests / skilling up - once it's done, it's done.  It's not ongoing.<br />
<br />
If they can develop an ongoing, DESIREABLE, platinum sink in game, they can better balance the amount of plat coming in vs. the amount being spent. Currently, FAR too much platinum that's put into the game never leaves the game.<br />
<br />
I see 3 main areas where this could be accomplished:<br />
<br />
1) Alchemy:<br />
Alchemy IMO - is the PERFECT sink since our potions are all expendable.  The problem here is very few of them are actually desireable for players, especially with a 20 minute or so duration on most potions.<br />
I'd also like to see a LORE instant-gate potion for 700ish plat and possibly a LORE 50% rez potion for the same price.<br />
<br />
2) Player Housing/Player Boats:<br />
Construction costs, ongoing rental fees, Construction merchants, etc.  SOE could easily add new &quot;player town&quot; zones to the game, and even player ocean zones for boats.  Maybe even make some new adventure zones that are only accessible via player boats?  It could be done, and would generate an ongoing platinum sink.<br />
<br />
3) An NPC run &quot;Casino Zone&quot;:<br />
Much like the bazaar, except an in-game NPC casino.  Set up different games, have odds, it could all be controlled via server-side code.  There's lots of (oftentimes shady) PC &quot;casino&quot; guys throughout zones in every server.  This would accomplish the same effect for those wishing to gamble, however the net effect would remove plat from the game rather than lining someone's pockets - and you could be SURE they weren't going to cheat you and steal your plat.  SOE could develop different in-game card games inside a new window similar to the spell-book window with rules, placements, etc. - I'm thinking similar to blackjack or even the card game that one of the final fantasy console RPGs used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">SOE could easily add new &quot;player town&quot; zones to the game ... I don't think so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well, I'm not any type of an economist, but I would think that eventually the duped plat will get siphoned off the ecomony via tradeskill components and so forth. Once that happens, wont the economy level off again?<br />
It may take awhile, but I would assume that prices will level off again.</div></div><hr />

In RL this is easy to fix .. in EQ .. well we don't have a court system and stuff like that.  You can bann as many people as you want .. it will not fix broken code.  <br />
<br />
I personally think that sony should have stuck with their guns about transfering accounts/selling accounts.  Then again its a conflict of interest for them since they only make money by people sending them money.  This wrecked UO and now its gonna wreck EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">As long as the bugs get fixed, the market will settle back in eventually. Its still supply and demand generated. I will give you an example. <br />
<br />
I was trying to raise my smithing during this period of crazyness. Enchanted Velium Bits is a fairly cheap, easy way to do it. Before the madness, small pieces of velium were around 40 pp each. During, they skyrocketed to 150+. Because of this, I went to farm them myself, and almost always found other people there farming as well. The result? Lots of people trying to get 150 for their small veliums, but no one buying. Now, the prices are dropping and droipping, and soon they will settle back in to the point where folks will buy them instead of farm them. This will soon apply to most sellable items across the board. The only things that MAY take a lot longer are the HUGE ticket AoW drops (why that crap is tradable is beyond me, BoC, barb mask and legs should all be NO DROP).</div></div><hr />

Most people WANT a horse but decide not to since it either is a) 9k for a horse thats extremely slow. b) 30K for a horse that is slower than a 2p to 10p sow. So you might use the same money for this horse or you can buy buying 3000 SoW potions...<br />
thats ridiculous and pointless to get the horse. c) 100k+ for bard speed. Most peope will never see this type of cash, and hence most will not see this horse.<br />

Make these things worth their cost and they will become a better money sink.</div></div><hr />

As to inflation, to inflate it needs to be a general effect,  ie many people gaining platinum. It is possible for a few millionaire ppers in the system. People will only buy items for what they are prepared to pay for them. Millionaire_duper001 may own a lot of the items and hold them at a very inflated price, but not many will be able to buy them. So gradually the prices will come back down presuming he wants to sell them. Although it maybe turned into an exclusive ebay player items market. It could be bad in another sense with the banned accounts taking certain rare items out of the economy which is a further gradual increase in price over time.(inflate with actual demand) However other people will still own items, and certain items can easily be refarmed with the incentive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
10K per AA<br />
<br />
1 K per Adventure point in the Camp of your choosing. Does not increase Faction points tho. just purchasing power.<br />
<br />
300 plat (component cost) Single charge Res potion. 90% (Lore) Alchemy made<br />
<br />
An item much like the solstice earring quest. Detailed in game. Useing many store bought items that will give you an Augment for the solstice earring. Varible reward Like added FT for the Casters. Good amount of worn attk or regen for meele. <br />
<br />
MAke the ability to scribe known spells. But cost components to be like 10 K Vendor bought. For the harder spells.<br />
<br />
Like someone else said. Make Boats. And a lake zone. With Ship cost in Upkeep to have it. You can pilot canoes already. Expand on that with a group of vendor sold ships for goofing off.<br />
<br />
Make houseboats. (Ducks and runs for cover.)<br />
<br />
Hell SOE could do any number of things. <br />
<br />
A Tent revival to let you change religion... For a heafty donation.<br />
<br />
Vendor purchased buffs. But make them quadruple cost of the rate people are doing in PoK and such. Like 100 plat for a virtue. 100 plat for a Kei. 100 plat for a focus. 100 plat for a Nine. And scale it down for lower level buffs.  Non Extended as well. so PC Buffs are better.<br />
<br />
Purchased Titles.<br />
<br />
Any of this could be for a limited time. So that the money is drained. <br />

Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but I don't see what point you're trying to make with that statement. How does purchasing plat with real life cash equate to a bug in game?<br />
<br />
Plat sinks are a HORRIBLE solution to this problem, because they only punish people who didn't cheat.  If you add new fun or useful things for your sink, then someone with a billion duped pp's gets new things to buy, and everybody else gets the shaft.  If you increase the prices of the current sinks, again the duped billionare won't even notice 100 pp peridots.  It will soundly screw the legitimate player, however.<br />
Not to mention it would only encourage more people to start buying plat from auction sites because they would feel that they are even more behind than they were before. Auction sites exist because MMORPGs, by nature, are timesinks. Most of us don't mind the timesinks so much (that's why we play), but some people want to use cash to get around those time sinks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Your point is true - anything done to remove platinum from the game will hurt legitimate non-cheaters more, since they've got less platinum to spend.  But in the long run, removing significant amounts of platinum in this way will return item prices to more realistic levels, which will help the non-cheaters.  <br />
<br />
There isn't a pain-free solution, but I like some of the suggestions made in this post.  Very creative and legitimate ways to siphon platinum out of the game without being unbalancing.  Does anyone believe SOE will do anything along these lines?  Once they fix the loopholes, they may wait for natural causes to siphon out the cash.<br />
<br />
Another good point someone made: platinum is flowing into the EQ economy a lot faster than it's flowing out.  Especially with LDoN.  I really think SOE would have needed to do something about this problem even without the recent platinum dupes.  The inevitable result of that situation was always going to be rampant inflation - it's just been accelerated by the dupes.  I hope SOE hears about these suggestions and seriously considers them.<br />
<br />

p.s. Just thought of another possible platinum sink.  Vendor-sold rezzes, either via potions or just straight-up exp returns sold like soulbinders.  As long as it didn't make the clerics/paladins/necros too angry.  I would think clerics get tired of getting asked for rezzes all the time.  Maybe a series of increasingly-powerful rez potions that scale dramatically in cost.  Just a thought - I think someone suggested it earlier, and I personally like that idea because I hunt in some out-of-the-way places where getting a rez is a pain unless you want to make someone run across multiple zones to get to you.</div></div><hr />

This is nonsense.  Recently a favorite among some alarmist hybrids, the idea that adding something new and exciting to the game HURTS you rather than helps (or doesnt affect) you just doesnt make sense.  How does adding new ways to spend PP hurt players?  Did horses hurt you?  Actually it HELPS a lot of players who are sitting on tons of pp that they have nothing to spend on (high-end players).   Yes, it might help people who duped pp, but it also benefits everyone by stablizing the economy.  Also, no one said anything about increasing the prices of existing stuff (like say doubling the cost of horses or dots)- that would be hurting everyone and a pretty stupid way of fixing the problem.</div></div><hr />

The point is that it benefits the cheaters MORE than the rest of us who have played by the rules. Would you solve the Warrior problems by adding a mitigation bonus to all classes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I've always thought that a perfect plat-sink would be a vendor that would recharge any item.  Charge 100K to add 1 charge to a Staff of Forbidden Rites, for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">The biggest problem I see with the whole situation is that alot of the rare items or items that no longer drop were bought up by these people with duped pp.  When Sony banned their account/deleted their character, those items left the game with them.  I wonder many manastones, fungi tunics, amulets of necropotence, etc were removed from each server through this process...  <br />
<br />
The rare items will most likely stay higher than they have ever been, the rest of the economy may return to normal pretty quickly.  I have not noticed much of an increase if any on alot of spells and mid-level items on my server.  <br />
<br />
If any sort of plat sink is introduced into the game, it must be something that players are not required to buy to function at normal levels (reagents, no drop spells, etc.)  The only way they should be introduced is to add something that is useful as a luxury similar to horses.  I do not like the idea of plat sinks mainly because I do not have plat to waste on expendable items/tradeskills/luxuries at the moment.  <br />
<br />
How many people here have acquired large amounts of pp in the past few weeks due to people paying higher than normal prices for your items?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">That isnt going to change at the moment.<br />
<br />
What my suggestion would do is Remove alot of the free Money from the system.<br />
<br />
In the short term the scum would benifit. But in the long term Money would leave the system and would actually be valued again. Then all the people that play rather than clock into EQ as a second job would have some value to all of it.<br />
<br />
As it stands now. People have to save 50 to 100K at level 65 to get most anything of benifit from the bazzar, (The non raiding people that is. I know the raiders have better.)<br />
<br />
By allowing people to spend a smaller chunk of change on something that allows them to inch towards thier goals rather than Make a giant step. would help players play more consistantly and keep goals ahead of them.<br />
<br />
All this would only work however if teh actual cheesy stuff is stopped. The dupers. Then Exploiters. and such. If those holes are not plugged then it gets out of hand.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is however justa  suggestion. Wiser minds than me will ahve to do something tho. Cause 100K for items is a bit silly. when with normal play you might actually make 300 plat a night after split. (Yeah yeah get a rare drop and get rich quick) (Sigh, all that does is support the farmers and jerks tho.)<br />

If necessary the option is still there to camp it, fungi tunic, or getting 2 groups or so to go to plane of fear and kill the plane and Cazic Thule to get an Amulet of Necropotence. Or for ornate to go to Bot and set up camp. Or tactics if you are keyed/flagged. Highend ldon items MAY be attainable with a good group, however you would most likely have to drop the chance of passing and just hope on names and exp.</div></div><hr />

You are 100% correct.  They should be spending all their time figuring out wonderful benefits to hand to the exploiters.  Give them superhorses, houses, boats, free AAs and LDoN points.  That'll really teach them a lesson.  I bet nobody would want to exploit after that.<br />
<br />
In any event, it is painfully naive of you to think that &quot;indirect nerfs&quot; are not possible.  If they add, say, superhorses that give double mana regeneration do you think for even one second that future expansions won't be balanced around that?  Maybe you can buy 200 hit points for a million pp.  Anyone out there think that the first thing they'll do is anything other than adjusting the raid mobs next expansion to hit just a little harder to compensate?  Because if you don't, I have a bridge to sell you.  Cheap.  I swear.  By your logic they could give druids a 100%, zero resist slow and it would not hurt shamans, because we didn't lose anything, they just gained something!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Kusala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Bah time to move on from eq anyway let the hackers have it.  Old technology and engine.  Why keep kickin an old horse?  It may not be dead but sure has a bad case of colic.  Makes it easier to leave a game that so full of hacks it not fun anymore.  People should move on and let the poor horse sleep.  Everything must come to an end or atleast end its prime which EQ has.  They can try to paint a new graphics engine on it but that like spraying perfume on a steaming pile of sheet.  As everyone knows customer service is WAY!!! down.  When they dp try to help the dont do a fricken thing besides they will pass it along.  Passed its prime yes and it should be.  EQ reminds me of the CB radio sure its there but who regulates it very well?  Nobody.<br />
<br />
 Customer service down the tubes only reason people stay is because they have made friends in game and like to play with them people and talk and have fun.  That I do understand.  But comes a time when ya all have to move on and quit paying for a dung heap game since customer service sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Personally I don't think EQ is dead, but it is under massive threat.  A long time ago it was pointed out that the pp to $ exchange rate, and the rate that pp is be generated at, meant that the world of EQ has a greater GDP than many 3rd World Countries.  That makes it an obvious target for every undesirable out there: including not only 'entrepreneurs' and stupid 11year old wannabe hackers, but criminal gangs.<br />
<br />
It was clearly necessary for SOE to nip this in the bud - by taking all the measures they are now putting in place, and more besides - but at the time SOE were more interested in getting SWG out the door.<br />
<br />
I think its too late now - the undesirables are established in the game - and they are probably here to stay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">You know its the relative rarity of nice stuff and the difficulty of earning money legitimately that cause the demand for people selling things out of game in the first place. You should not need to spend 100k+ to have your spells, you should not have to be equipped in the most uber armor or swing the most uber sword to perform your function in the game. Money sinks are fine, just make them, like others have suggested, luxuries. If you have money and are looking for something to spend it on, fine. Don't make the honest player frustrated at not being able to acquire the things they need to do their job well frustrated to the point that they need to look to EBay to get the those things.<br />
Another point, anywhere you have Human Beings, you have dishonesty. No way to do away with it entirely. Its unfortunate that people always ask for freedom to do as they choose, and that, given that freedom they choose to do some pretty unscrupulous things. There are no police in our game, it is up to us to choose to do the right thing. No wonder then, that so many do otherwise.</div></div><hr />

I sell lower end items in the bazaar so I seriously doubt anyone would bother to buy any to launder money, but if they did it doesn't make me guilty of anything.<br />
I agree, I have a trader up probably 3-6 hrs a day, making purchaes of lower priced mid range items to sell at a moderate profit.....I make a few thousand plat a day between that and various potions. If duped plat was used to buy any of that, how is it my fault? But like you I have to agree, I seriously doubt that 3-4k plat items are where people dumped this plat...AoN's, Flayed Barb legs, SoDs, etc are where it all went.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What the hell is wrong with yantis? Here's a guy that saw an opportunity and ran with it, He made millions off of selling items and plat. Sure, it goes against the ethics of the game but who cares if you have a bank account in the millions?<br />
<br />
So while your working at Burger King, living at your parents house, trying to get enough money to pay for your high speed internet connection, bitching about the ethics of a stupid computer game, ask yourself this:<br />
<br />
Who is the real dumbass?<br />
<br />
Yantis is set for life due to his own ingenuity. I still can't believe how obvious this is, even to those of you with limited intelligence but I guess that's what democrats are for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">plat sinks that make sense and hurt the big guys.<br />
<br />
summoning your mount should cost you plat everytime, as an upkeep fee for the thing.<br />
<br />
vendor sold buffs would rule as a way to take plat out of the game, as it is I know of 1 npc that casts spells for plat that I still use on my chanter, the shamy in halas that will &quot;bind your wounds&quot; for 1pp, its a 5% ish heal at 56 and well worth the cash to me when I dont feel like sitting on my ass healing up.<br />
<br />
you need items/sinks that continue to cost you cash over time just for owning/benifitting from them to really take cash out of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but I don't see what point you're trying to make with that statement. How does purchasing plat with real life cash equate to a bug in game?<br />
<br />
Its ok, you just missed the point.</div></div><hr />

I agree.  It is one thing to make money off EQ by providing a service, i.e. Allakhazams.  It's another to just flat out ruin the game by being a greedy bastage.  Ya he has his millions.  Ya lots of us don't have millions, but we have our honor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Actually, what you do is add super horses, super items, etc for say 750k - 5 million in increments of 500k<br />
<br />
Then, when people buy these items, you do a detailed analysis of their account. Ban any account that is suspicious, such as somebody who gained hundreds of thousands of plat in a matter of days or weeks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">IM (unpopular) O, if the guy is making plat in game selling it IRL that's cool with me, it's against the EULA, but there is nothing wrong for performing a service. There are rich people out their who make $500 an hour, they want to enjoy the game they don't want to spend hundreds of hours hunting plat, so they get someone who is that is all totally fair. <br />
<br />
The only time it's not fair is when someone uses an exploit or dupe to make that money, that ruins the integrity of the game. <br />
<br />
If there are 5 old men 67+ who do nothing but play this game 16 hours a day because they get enjoyment out of it, and would like to make some money maybe to buy their grandchildres something, then I say more power to them. They have the time to farm or xp in nice places to make plat so why not be able to make someone else (rich guys etc) happy by letting those people do what they want with the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Stareff2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">To say that he is making Millions is naive in itself. Im sure he does quite well but Im nit sure its millions. Maybe im wrong. Yantis dont worry me unless he is botting or Duping. IM saure he was exploiting some stuff becuase his Powerleveling promo has changed completely.<br />
<br />
The people who worry me are the hackers, and the camp hogs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To the best of my recollection, Yantis stated that the third party company that he had farmed the PLing process out to was using XP cheats (imagine that!), so he canned them.<br />
<br />
Having said that, if you check the prices at  http://www.mysupersales.com/powerleveling.html, he currently charges over $1,000 to get a character from 46 to 65. Thinking back to that Epiced 65 Frog Cleric with 2 days /played, I am sure that's pretty good money for some 14 year old 65 Necro or Bard even if he only gets 50%...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Well, I'm not any type of an economist, but I would think that eventually the duped plat will get siphoned off the ecomony via tradeskill components and so forth. Once that happens, wont the economy level off again?<br />
It may take awhile, but I would assume that prices will level off again.<br />
<br />
That would only work if the net plat dropped from mobs and flowing into the game is less than the net plat flowing out from purchases of components and gear.  This will never happen IMHO, because players will not accept it.  They simply will not go to places where they can't get a decent return - look at how empty many of the old-world zones are now.<br />
<br />
Plat sinks like prismatic dyes are the key to getting plat out of the game - hundreds of these are sold every day in the bazaar.  I don't know what the next big disposable commodity will be, but something along that line would be what I expect EQ's Allan Simon to do to control the economy.  Boats and houses are one-time fixes.  Not enough turn-around to really have a long-term affect I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">I accidentally went to &quot;Mysupersales&quot; dot com. (Clicked from Monkly Business). So I decided to poke around. <br />
<br />
Of the 3 servers I checked - AB, FV and Xev you can buy plat on each. Note that in the &quot;Christmas spirit&quot; the plat has been marked down from (approximately) 2 U.S. dollars per 1k to 1 U.S. dollar per 1K.<br />
<br />
IOW for 500 bucks you can get 500k plat on the server of YOUR CHOICE.<br />
<br />
Now lets imagine that the individual running the site sells 500k each day on each server, whether it be in one fell swope or smaller increments. EQ has 40 servers. <br />
<br />
That's $20,000 a DAY income. <br />
<br />
Even if I overestimated by a factor of 100%, that's still $10,000 a day EVERY day. $300,000 a month. <br />
<br />
That is not chump change fellow posters.</div></div><hr />
