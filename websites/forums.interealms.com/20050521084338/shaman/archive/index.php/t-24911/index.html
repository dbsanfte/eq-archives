<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was thinking about what would up shaman servivablility and I came up with this buff as an idea. Add +7%avoidance+7%mitigation self only buff. Maybe add it to our completely useless rage line of spells? This would also stack with SoSense. This would really add some survivability to us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Actually, it wouldnt. The effect of such a buff (at those magnitudes anyway) would be trivial on any mob that was capable of killing us (ie had dps that was such that we couldn't CC or self heal fast enough).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whos us?  We don't all box a warrior.<br />
<br />
I think it would be pretty nice idea to give us a self buff.  Are shaman the only caster without a self buff?(useful)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Have to agree with Tugela. I don't think any kind of buff is going to solve the issue(it's an issue for me anyway), unless it's limited by time or amount of damage mitigated/absorbed.<br />
<br />
As I have said, Vindictive Spirit is a nice spell, the problems I have encountered with it, though, are that it has a cast time(not long, but still long enough to be interrupted), the recourse usually lasts less than the Slow and the fact that after you have cast it, you still need to take a huge risk by chaining the &quot;real&quot; slow before it fades.<br />
<br />
The recourse from Vindictive should be lasting longer than 3 ticks(I have yet to see it lasting more than 2 ticks) as it is also limited by the amount it absorbs(this should be doubled as well imo). 4 ticks would probably be sufficient, maybe 5. After that, the cast time should be lowered to 0.5 or 1 second tops. On slow immune mobs, the spell loses all it's attractivness btw, which should not be.<br />
<br />
If that happened the spell would be pretty close to what I'd like to see in making Shamans be on par with the other slowers in terms of survivability again.</div></div><hr />

What stage of the game are you at and where are you grouping?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">sounds like pre ele to me, I can take a couple wacks from most pop yard trash ok but any of them will kill me fairly fast if I dont get them slowed, pretty much any named, even the minis are mobs I would just as soon not get hit by</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What stage of the game are you at and where are you grouping? <br />
<br />
Here is the problem.  How could the original poster offer a suggestion about how to make shaman more survivable then have people come here and say the suggestion won't work, all without defining what stage of the game we are talking about?  How could anyone determine that the percentages are too low to be of any use?<br />
<br />
Bottom line, this buff will make shaman more survivable by definition.  Whether or not it is enough, or practical for where you are personally at in the game is almost irrelevant until play level is defined.</div></div><hr />

It takes me about 15 minutes at the most to figure out what I can routinely get away with for a particular tank. After that, I usually only die if the 'stuff' hits the fan.<br />
<br />
Do I have to wait a bit longer to slow sometimes and maybe leave a DoT out? Sure, but everyone else is having to make the same adjustments to what they do.<br />
<br />
While I certainly wouldn't turn down some kind of boost to survivability, I don't find it's too much of a problem. I do better than most other casters, it seems and I'm not all that well equipped compared to some. Most places I group, I can off-tank without much difficulty. (OoW exps, Sol Ro, Ele trash, although RCoD mobs are kind of dangerous now that just about everything is now only partially slowable)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Nevermind, it's pointless. <br />
Maybe a year from now, people will understand. Just like it took 2 years for people to realize that the Shaman class was going to hell(pre-Omens).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">if you're tired of being naked, stop getting agro.I'm puller a lot of the time (go malos pulling) which usually means I soak up a round or two of melee from clicking my TA as soon as the mob hits the camp, or because I'm always rampage. All I can suggest is you max those defensive AAs.  It's really not too bad, the only time I really get in trouble is if I get a lucky round + 3 chaos claws procs, but that would be enough to hurt any real tank too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have to agree, if you are dieing alot it is because you are not a good player or because your tank is horrible. I almost never die, and I have horrible, horrible gear for the stuff my guild does. I raid and group in GoD / Elementals / Oow (mostly mpg and rs), btw. The warriors in my guild are mostly using BoW or BoC + epic / Xana hammer, the knights are mostly using elemental dps 2handers, and I never have a problem.<br />
<br />
In exp groups I malos before the pull hits the tank, and almost immediatly cast slow, and sick pet. Then I either nuke, rain, or stack poison and magic dots on the mob. I also patch heal the group when needed, and root for CC, and with all that I almost never die. I buff up to close to 6k hps, if I think a pull will be an issue I toss Q on myself, but other than that there isn't much to it.<br />
<br />
Basically the same thing on raids. With my hps being so so I have to patch heal myself a decent ammount with AEs going off, but still not that big of an issue. I don't think we have a survivability problem, but we could still use a small heal upgrade and a bigger dps upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If you never die you are not pushing your limits.<br />
<br />
Like Grizlor i pull all the time. So guess what. If I screw up I die. So I try my damndest to not screw up.<br />
<br />
Only differance is. I probably have over half of grizlors hitpoints. And pull in RCOD all the time. <br />
<br />
Root is by and far your best friend. Root it and step back a sec. Doesnt save your life all the time but can save it alot more than you think. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Huzzah for sham pulling ~)_^<br />
<br />
Everyone *loves* having a mob malosed before it's even in camp.<br />
<br />
So much funstufff you can do pulling the mobs into camp.<br />
<br />
And there's nothin' fineer then gettting down to 2% on the pull and living cause you remembered to Q yourself before pulling  = )<br />
<br />
<br />
As to the surviveability...<br />
We'd all want more of it. <br />
But hey,, everyone dies. It just sooks :-/<br />
<br />
Personaly, I'd like to see an upgrade for the rage line.. but instead of melee stuff,, Have it give us healing focci ... mmmm, yum<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>The Judge, Alchem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I find that with my current 7k Hps, the defensive AA's up to LR5, Voice of the Berserker, Haste, and regular buffs, I can do very good damage and mitigate a lot of damage even in WoS.  I can basically off tank in any instanced zone there in DS and getting Q off before the pull isn't a concern.  Skillfull of use of the keyboard solves that.  During battle I F1 then Shift 1, immediately F8 back to mob during cast and I'm gold.  The Ykesha proc on my Greatstaff of Power is exactly what I need to keep agro in a danger situation to let the Cleric breath.  I'm still amazed at how they use DA so they can die 30 feet further from us . ./tisk tisk.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day Clerics will run, Rangers will die, and where the mob was slowed, the Shaman shall lye . . .</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think Vindictive Spirit is weak because it was supposed to be a group recouse AND it was supposed to stack with Shroud of Erana.  However, since the devs got too lazy, too stupid, or too forgetful, they never looked at what a piece of crap the single recourse from VS is.  It hardly saves you against one round of combat from 1 mob, there's no way it would help against multiple mobs (what PB AEs are meant for) and their melee.  And they left Erana to rot for whatever reason.<br />
<br />
I guess it doesn't matter much to me anyway, because I'm already hooked on WoW for the time being and will end EQ billing on Nov. 23.  I'm tired of 3 years of overlooking design issues with spells, raid encounters and AAs. In a few months I hope these forums will be filled with discussions of WoW quests and playing strategies and not more complaints about EQ and its shoddy design and gaping flaws.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If you read my post carefully, you will see that I adress the weaknesses Vindictive Spirit has. The recourse was never meant to be group, not sure where you are getting that from, but it should be doubled at least. <br />
<br />
On top of that the recourse should last 4 ticks, since it isn't instantly activated, but needs to be cast before hand, which usually means the recourse will be gone by the time you actually get aggro.<br />
<br />
The idea of the spell is what we wanted adressed(me anyway). I still think it's the best spell we have gotten in a long long time, but it needs tweaking to serve the purpose it was designed for.<br />
<br />
So, if Grimbear or Gloriana read this post and we assumed for a second that I know what I am talking about, I'd like one of you to see, if you can get a reply from Rytan, possibly directing him to this thread(and any others adressing Vindictive Spirit).<br />
<br />
A man can hope.</div></div><hr />
