Just as a note, in THE HUNT forum section a very good series of hunting guides can be found, Wolverenes (sp?) Where to hunt lvls 38-43 is AWESOME since he updated it to include more than just those levels, also Artican has a great list of responses to Where to Hunt 23-60.</div></div><hr />

one reason i missed this forum for so long was the main rangers page had broken links and seemed sorely out of date.  couldn't tell and didn't realise that it had an awesome forum underneath it until last month.</div></div><hr />
