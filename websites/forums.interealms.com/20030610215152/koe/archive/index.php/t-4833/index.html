<br />
Mobhunter has reported that Jeff Butler has resigned from Sony Online in order to work on a new gaming project in development by Brad McQuaid, who also left Sony Online late last year.<br />
This has been confirmed by our sources.<br />
<br />
Jeff Butler was one of the founders of EverQuest with Brad McQuaid and Executive Producer on a number of EverQuest expansions. He was also involved in a number of other titles being developed by Sony Online.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Adelrune Argenti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">To clarify, Jeff Butler was never a founder of EverQuest. He started as the head of Customer Service back when EQ first went retail. I remember that. Later, he became a producer under Brad for EverQuest. I think he co produced Kunark with Brad and then he did Velious and Luclin on his own. At least that is what the manuals say. <br />
<br />
All in all, this isnt any big surprise really. I mean you had to think some people from Verant were gonna go work with Brad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If I remember right, he was the Man who was responsible for the design and implementation of the various magic classifications(?). If so I met him at EQFest in Houston at Renfest in 2000. Rumours that I heard, were that Butler was as hardheaded at times, as McQuaid, and that while he professed to be a &quot;gamer just trying make a great game&quot; (and getting paid to do it :p ), he didn't like ideas for change that came from other places.<br />
<br />
I guess the question is, will this mean anything to the game? At this point, I think SonyOnline/V.I. should be able to recruit enough knowledgable people from their team (possibly recruiting people from the player base if needed) to keep the inertia going. Me, I think EQ will be impacted more by its up and coming &quot;competition&quot; (a la the graphics changes and DAoC, etc) more than a handful of people leaving Sony...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nolani Silvermoonbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Also saw that it was mentioned Kendrick left also.  He did a lot of the zones in SoV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ryptagudn Gobbleguts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This is pretty normal.  When a head honcho leaves a place he usually takes a bunch of people with him.  There are a lot of MMORPG's in the pipeline but out of the current crop EQ is really the strongest and should be impacted the least by the new competition.  (It's probably got a few years left in its life cycle.)<br />
<br />
On the other hand, Verant is easily in the best position to launch newer games.  As EQ's popularity starts to wane they'll be able to phase EQ server hardware over to newer games.  It's the initial investment that's keeping more people from entering the marketplace and even when they do there's no guarantee that they'll succeed (Anarchy Online, anyone?).</div></div><hr />
