<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, this might sound a little strange, but does anyone know the minimum level to enter the sewers expeditions?  Tonight, I went in there with some guildmates on my 59 bard.  (long story short, already had shaman in group, and no chanter/bard, so they said they wanted mana song over another shaman)<br />
<br />
Anyway, we got the expedition ok, but when I went to zone in (to the instance), I was kicked to Quinimi zonein with the message I required more experience.  So, it seems I have to get some more levels, but I'd like to know how many.  i.e. is 60+ enough, or do I need to push to 65.  My Bard is the only GoD-able one in the guild; the other bard is a hydra, and unlikely to buy GoD any time soon, so it's in my guilds (and my) best interests to have at least one bard, even a gimp one, when we go playing in there.<br />
<br />
Anyone that can help me out on this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I can't say what the minimum is, but I have done expeditions with a lvl63 in the group, so I know 65 isn't required anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Saw a level 62 in the sewers last night, guess we can limit it quickly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Regardless of the level limit, should level to 65 to be effective in there as a bard, in my opinion.  There are mobs that are even to 65, to CC them you will need the level 64 mez.  Particularly the Plant expedition comes to mind.  <br />
<br />
Other songs that are very useful in GoD are also on the road to 65.  The song, Psalm of Veeshan (63), alone is very valuable in this expanion.  With half the damn mobs proccing Chaos Claws on your ass every swing, resists are very valuable for saving on healer mana.  Bard debuffs, in Harmony of Sound (65) and Requiem of Time (64) are at the top.  Damage increasing songs, Rizlona's Call of Flame(64) and Warsong of Zek(62).. and even the manasong upgrade, Wind of Marr (62).   The only sub-60 spell the bard I group with ever plays in these expeditions is Niv's Harmonic, super high AC makes a striking difference in this expansion.  Anyways, maybe you can get PL'd in the expeditions, but I can think of easier places.  Get 65 to be an effective group member for your pals.  :)<br />
<br />
Oh, and I have been into a trial with a level 64 char, though we already know you can be lower, so /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just regards the off-topic part, yes, I am well aware that a 59 bard is just a mobile dot with some ok songs in the sewers (I've done it with my shaman many times) but like I said, that was the short version of the story.  Put it this way, they didn't need a sixth person, but they thought it would be nice to have mana song, and nivs, and overhaste.  Only three songs you say?  Well, to make Nivs worthwhile, I have to throw in an Amp (gives about 70ac, as opposed to only 40ish with epic only) I appreciate your comments, but I (and my group members) were well aware of these issues already.<br />
<br />
To the other posters, thanks a lot for the replies, at least now I know I'm looking at lvl 62 at the most, hopefully only level 60 if they want to drag me in there again.<br />
<br />
P.S. I am levelling up as fast as I can, I was xping in Natimbi at the time they ran through and grabbed me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zeddgara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Saw mentioned in another thread either here or another site (cruise a lot of them so not sure which one) that you have to be 60 to enter the instanced content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What level was the expedition? I have grouped with a 59 mage in lowest sewer level (same reason, had a 6th slot in group open so invited a friend.) He actually dinged that night to 60.<br />
<br />
We presumed the lowest (easiest) versions were based on the LDoN 7 level limit model.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, good question.  We were doing an xp version (rogue got it from Ganesh)  Everyone else was 65.  We at first thought it might have been because I hadn't hailed either the priest or Ganesh, but the cleric had never been there before, never hailed either mob, and she went in no problems.  I looked at the instance screen pretty closely, and noticed nothing to show a particular level of difficulty; was I missing something on the screen?  <br />
<br />
If I recall correctly, the message on attempting to zone into the instance was (close to) &quot;You require more experience before you can enter this zone.  Returning you to safe spot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Could this simply be some kind of bug?  I mean, it allowed us to get the expedition in the first place, with me grouped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The exp dungeons just have kind of an innate difficulty difference.  I haven't done them all yet, but the Crematory seemed the easiest, with mobs hitting in the 400's up front, ramping up to mid 900's in the back.  The mobs in the Lost Souls one seemed to hit in the 1050 range, while in the Purifying Plant, everything hits for 1200.<br />
<br />
So, not sure, but you might try a Crematory one and see if that lets you in.  I think the mobs in that one are definitely lower level anyway, based on the exp rate vs the other ones I've done.</div></div><hr />
