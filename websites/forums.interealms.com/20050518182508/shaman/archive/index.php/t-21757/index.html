For a class that is supposed to be able to do a bit of everything, but nothing extremely well, druids aren't sitting too bad in the nuke department.  Maybe I'm mistaken or not catching something, but I would think that a mage should be a not so distant 2nd behind wizards, with druids at the back of the pack.</div></div><hr />

Nice to see us getting a nuke that does some decent damage finally but it's still 7.8 sec casting time...</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yeah the Shaman nuke takes too long to cast.  I think the right approach to balance shaman nukes would be have moderate cast times, like 4.5 seconds, but long recast times, like 30 seconds. Some might complain but at least then they are good in an emergency instead of being useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ROFL....7.8 seconds.  And yes, we are STILL paying for Canni all the way through OoW.  Why even bother SOE, just give us some more non-DD DoTs and exile us to soloing pls :P<br />
<br />
Edit:  Wanted to add something.  BLs look like they are going to get a 65% DIS based slow, yet nothing has been done with ours yet, they are still copies of PoP stats as far as I can see.  I wonder if they are looking into some resist check modifiers that will top BoN?  They haven't raised the slow/haste for any of us, so thats all they can improve IMO /shrug<br />

Please dont talk about balance, when you ask for 4.5 sec cast time, I bet they will give you 6 sec version, then some poeple think they did some improvements and thinking they are listerning to us. <br />
<br />
OMG.<br />

LOL - normally I'm in your camp Hyena, I just think this is a very unique situation.  But, if you want to go ahead and look at the stuff now, go for it.<br />
<br />
By the way, after thinking about how much SoE has screwed up recently (dx9 and GoD), you may be right that we should start yelling now and not wait till after the conference.</div></div><hr />

I'm glad you asked!<br />
1) if a mage brings out their pet on a raid, they get to listen to the paladins say &quot;hey, are people allowed to have pets out?&quot;<br />
2) melees love to blame push on pets<br />
3) mages don't get root, snare, or heal.  Druids, you might remember, have all 3.<br />
4) since they can't use their pets on raids, mages get to do exactly one thing:  nuke.  Should they REALLY be outdone by a class that has the 2nd best healing in the game?<br />
<br />
I guess my question is this:<br />
If SoE is going to consistently (mis-) design the game so as to make guilds basically ban pets from most encounters (especially when they're being tried by a guild for the first time - which for our guild, was constantly...) they really need to compensate the pet classes in other ways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Bleh, I don't like the long re-cast on Bane. You can't retry when it's resisted and you can't apply it to more than one mob.<br />
<br />
Enchanters have long re-cast times on their nukes and I don't think they like them.</div></div><hr />

There are no pets that push worse than Beastlord pets in my view.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Mages do better sustained dps than wizards in extremely long fights. Wizards do far better burst dps. Basically, if the fight lasts long enough for bost casters to go OOM and have to med for the next nuke, the mage will start to get ahead in dps because of their pet. But this isn't the point of the thread, the point is to compare mages with druids. I gotta agree something is wrong when the 2nd best healer in the game is also the 2nd best nuker. And in a game where nobody &quot;likes&quot; long fights, their dps is every bit as desirable (and possible more so considering their healing ability) as the mages. If I understand correctly this is why mages are getting the shaft in GoD today.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are incorrect here.<br />
<br />
Long fights = raid mobs = rare use of pets.  When you compare Wiz to Mage on straight nukes, Wiz wins.  Not only do they have better nukes, but they have a means to drop aggro that mages dont (via Concussion).  Also dont forget that beyond buffs/mod rod (which all classes can have) mages no longer have any sort of mana regen since the pet canni nerf while wizzys can use harvest and gather mana so they can keep nuking long after the mage goes OOM.  Even when you add in the pet, the wiz still wins for DPS.  <br />
<br />
2300 points is a lot for a nuke, but the Wiz ancient nuke w/ crit and focus can hit for over 11k<br />
<br />
Discordant Flame (45%)<br />
Echo of the Trusik (25%)<br />
Crit (100%)<br />
4274x2.7 = 11539</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Actually, Mages DO have Xegony's ( http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3031&amp;source=Live ), but 8m/tick really can't hold a candle to the wizard combination of improved familiar/harvest/concussion.  Other than that, 100% echo of RedChief's statement.  <br />
<br />
Mana regeneration really isn't any mage's problem on a raid (outside of mana-draining AE's).  It's aggro (a foreign concept for me, as a shaman - since I can't possibly chain-nuke hard enough to get aggro from a moss snake).  All well-played mages are immediately summoned when the MT dies, but they're still outdamaged by well-played wizards - who can use concussion.  Mages are stuck under-nuking because they don't have that aggro-reducing spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">One good thing about our new nuke (Ice Age)<br />
<br />
At least it no longer has the same annoying landing message as those rusty-equivilant weapons from Velious!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Perelandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">While as a Mage I appreciate the sentiment expressed here, there is quite a bit of info here that isn't accurate.<br />
<br />
Mage DPS:<br />
We rank below Wizard, rogue, and (rangers - I think). It is true that on very long fights our sustained DPS is great - but we haven't really seen those since Luclin. With the addition of Protection of Calliav, pets now survive most raid fights. However pet dps goes down significantly as the level of the mob increases.<br />
<br />
Mage Nukes:<br />
Mages continue to be the second in all out nukes. While it is true that Druids have nukes equal to most of ours, we have a couple of nukes which they can't touch: http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5474&amp;source=Live. If you look at PoP spells - you'll find the exact same situation between Druids and Mages that you are seeing in OOW.<br />
<br />
In summary, as a primary damage dealer mages are a little below where we should be right now. However, we usually don't look at Druids when comparing to another class.</div></div><hr />
