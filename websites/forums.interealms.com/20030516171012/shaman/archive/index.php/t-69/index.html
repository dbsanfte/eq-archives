<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was in BB last night helping some friends, so I decided to start my epic quest.<br />
<br />
I'm up to the test of patience. I printed out the guide from EQ Shaman and have been following that pretty closely. The guide states that the test of patience could be completed at an earlier level with invis. to animals kept up while sitting in the ocean (along with enduring breath). Has anyone tried this?<br />
<br />
I'm currently level 24, am I nuts to even consider this part of the epic?<br />
<br />
Any other info I should be aware of for this part of the quest? Just how long is the wait for the 5 spirits?<br />
<br />
<br />
Secondly, what is the minium level/party composition needed for the test of wisdom? How hard do the knights hit?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lacka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think 24 is pretty low to do this part of the quest but:<br />
<br />
The test of patience invis vs. animals does work except on the maneater shark (forget the exact name.) You could luck out if the pathing works in your favor. I did this in low 40's with 3 other people. I think in hindsight it would have been better to go alone and use the invis vs. animals. We had no troubles until invis vs animals wore off on one person and as I went to reinvis them, I of course lost my cover and the two of us were attacked. We were swarmed with sharks and I believe we had two deaths and two near escapes on what should have been a fairly easy part of the epic.<br />
<br />
The knights...again I have a very supportive guild and had more than enough people for them. I had one group at one knight and one at the other.  We were all low 40's.  I used two groups in case someone came along in the middle of the quest and killed the other knight before I could get to it. They were &quot;guarding&quot; the other knight.  They both went down easily with a group of 3-4 low 40's.  <br />
<br />
Black Dire: we had 2 full groups of low 40's for him.  We cleared the entire corridor that lead up to him, then waited at the zone line. We then had our highest level person pull him to the zone and we wasted him.<br />
<br />
We did this all when epic first came out so we were being very cautious since we didn't have much prior knowledge. I think one group of low-mid 40's could take out dire.<br />
<br />
I would wait until at least mid-30's if I were you. I'm not sure what level you have to be for sow boots to work. I think I was 44 or 45 when I got them and they worked. Not sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>fudorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did the test of Patience, solo, at 25.  Invis to animals worked just fine.  If you are careful, you can take the RM mobs at 30, although 35 is probably safer, solo.<br />
<br />
The Black Dire, on the other hand, is a bit much to do solo... a well balanced group of mid-40's will have no problem with him.  Once you have your pelt, and need to go to EJ, I really recommend a druid or wizard along with evac, just in case.  First time I went, at 39, I got the boots (and they worked) but never got to finish the dialog with the spirit.  I have re-started the quest again in the last few days, and was able to pick up the dialog right where I was when I died, and got the binder for the CoM pages.  You are going to want to be at least 45 for this part, and would be a lot better off with a group in any case.  It CAN be solo'ed, but even at 51, I had to zone out more than once doing it.<br />
<br />
While you are there, might as well grab the High Scale Icon while killing in the temple area.  It's location is listed in all the walk throughs, and the advice works quite well.<br />
<br />
As for Lord Ghiosk, haven't gotten there just yet... everything I have read indicates 3 mid 50's groups, but somehow this sounds like overkill.<br />
<br />
<br />
Luck on your travels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its definately possible to get the shield of falsehood at 34 solo, just dogdog kite both of them (get your rm up a little for the sk) if your not up to tanking them, the pally is a little tougher as he heals/lohs making it quite hard on the mana pool, but its trivial to keep ahead of him and let the pet do the work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The thing about Lord Ghiosk is that you need to kill Black Reavers to make him spawn.<br />
<br />
Black Reavers are about level 50, immune to almost all magic, and when they die, another mob spawns. This new mob can be another reaver, or a special quest mob (Ghiosk, Neh or Rak), or a regular phantom.<br />
<br />
We did a reaver raid at the weekend, with 3 groups ranging in level from 45 to 55. We never really had any problems except when someone agrod Lord Rak! If we had had more time, I think we could have go to and killed Neh'Ashir, but our puller had to leave :(<br />
<br />
Anyway, Ghiosk is about as hard as a Black Reaver, you could kill him with one goup of 50+, but getting him to spawn probably needs more people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Urda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I managed to complete up to the test of wisdom solo just fine at level 35.  But from what I hear I was lucky.<br />
<br />
I did use invis to animals and enduring breath during the test of patience, but only a few things pathed by me and none of them were the aforementioned killer sharks.  No attacks.  Took about 40ish minutes to complete.<br />
<br />
The test of wisdom took a little bit longer since anothr shaman had recently been through.  I had to wait for the spawns (about 2 hours).  But I had a level 54 Necro with me (fiends in high places;) )  Galron took longer but not much.  And we hunted giants while we waited.<br />
<br />
Will be doing the test of might in the next month or so with a group of friends.  I'm still only level 36.<br />
<br />
Now again I was lucky.  I was also ignorant.  I had no idea that the Killer Sharks saw through invis to animals.  If I had known that before I went down there I probably would have brought along a few friends.  It's your call.  There was a much younger shaman who tried to attempt this as soon as he got invis to animals and he perished quickly.<br />
<br />
But it is a game.  I say go for it.  the worst that could happen is you'll be doing the quest and a cr:).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&quot;I was also ignorant. I had no idea that the Killer Sharks saw through invis to animals.&quot; <br />
<br />
I am confused. I didn't think the sharks could see you if you have invis vs. animals up, although I have read that if you sit while waiting, they will aggro on you, regardless as to whether or not you have invis vs. animals up. Am I totally off base? ;) Thanks to anyone who can help clear things up for me. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Will the spirits not spawn if you are invised?  Why not invis, then invis to animals when you are talking to the npc's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Urda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">OK...here it is...<br />
<br />
You can do the Test Of Patience at a lower level but beware because apparently the Killer Sharks can see through Invis to Animals.  If no Killer Sharks go by, then you are golden.  Other creatures in the water include Pirahna, basic Sharks, etc.  Those will ignore you if you have Invis to Animals up.<br />
<br />
As such, you can try to do the Test of Patience as soon as you get the spell Invis to Animals (level 14?).  BUT, you have been warned.  Luck is when opportunity meets preparation.  So make sure that you have everything in order (your bind, gate spell memmed, a /loc hotkey, and all necc. spells up and running) and that you have a decent evac plan if something goes wrong.  that way you can pick up where you left off without much backtracking.<br />
<br />
All that being said, I fully encourage y'all to take the risk:).  This is a game after all.  If everything were fully predictable then the 'adventure' aspect would poof.  Take the chance knowing you might have to do a corpse run anyway.  When you succeed it should make it pretty sweet.<br />
