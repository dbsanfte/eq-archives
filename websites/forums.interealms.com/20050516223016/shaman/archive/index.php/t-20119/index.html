<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello.  I have a level 57 enchanter and level 61 shaman that I've been 3-boxing with my monk. I'm getting tired of the monk, because he can't hold agro at all. So I'm ready to make a switch, and need your advice.<br />
<br />
I've got a level 56 warrior and level 47 shadowknight, but I haven't played either character in probably a year, so I'm not exactly up to speed on class changes. My question is this: in a 3-box trio with an enchanter and a shaman, which character makes the most sense?<br />
<br />
I won't be raiding, just mostly 3-boxing or maybe joining some exp groups/LDoNs (as a single - won't 2 or 3-box an LDoN). The problem with my monk is that he can't generate enough agro. When my shaman throws a slow and even a single DoT (Bane of Nife), agro switches and I usually don't get it back. I've got some good gear on my shaman, so it's not a huge problem now, but it will only get worse as I fight tougher mobs.  My monk can usually hold agro through the slow, but as soon as that DoT lands, the mob switches every time.  And I hate not using the DoTs - otherwise my dps is pretty poor.  I couldn't hope to win an LDoN without using my fast-acting shaman poison DoTs, for example.  <br />
<br />
So I need a tank that can hold agro and still put out some decent DPS. With good agro, my shaman can generate very decent DPS via his stackable DOTs and dogdog. With the enchanter, I can handle adds without too much problem, and can lull/pacify, so pulling isn't a huge issue. I don't charm with the enchanter, so he doesn't really do much for DPS right now.  But my shaman is swimming in mana, with constant Clarity II and eventually KEI.<br />
<br />
I just haven't played either the warrior or shadowknight in so long that I don't know which character makes more sense. I know warriors got an upgrade to their taunt, but have no idea how effective it is compared to SK spells. I also don't know which character will put out higher DPS - I assume the SK would with a lot of spells, but casting lots of spells is tricky while 3-boxing, especially with a constantly-canni-ing shaman. <br />
<br />
So I'm leaning toward the warrior, but don't really want to jump back into that if the SK is a far superior option.  With the enchanter (have clarity II now at level 57), my SK would probably always have mana, so maybe that option makes more sense. I have some decent gear on warrior already, and have about 60k in the bank, so I could probably score a CHoS/Bloodsworn combo for agro - unless there's a better option. I've already got a Greatstaff of Thunder for 2hb agro.<br />
<br />
I'm posting here mostly to get the advice of shamans who've either 2-boxed/3-boxed similar setups with either a warrior or sk, or who regularly group with one and know their strengths.  I've already posted this question on both the shadowknight and warrior boards; amusingly, both class boards seem to think the other class is a better option.  The grass is always greener, I guess.<br />
<br />
Any advice or similar experience you coud give would be appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Go the SK - SKs will bring far more to the party - SKs are great pullers (pet pulling or FD pulling), SKs can hold aggro easily. SKs have that useful ability to HT if things get messy, they can Snare, etc. Go SK I tell ya!<br />
<br />
(Note: I don't 2 box, but I duo with SKs a lot)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vulash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't feel like looking up dps parses of each class, but I believe that your total dps of the trio with shaman dotting + warrior or SK wouldn't exceed the dps of the trio with shaman NOT dotting + monk.  In other words if your dps is lacking to much with the monk, and you not dotting it will still be lacking with a better agro tank even with you dotting like crazy.  Simply my opinion with no numbers to back it up :)<br />
<br />
It sounds more like your tired of the monk too, and wanting to play one of the others.  I'd pick the SK because of pulling capabilities and snare.  If you do go with the warrior I wouldn't anticipate agro problems as long as you are not just chain casting dots immediately.  I duo alot with a SK and we are able to do pretty much anything we want that a duo/trio can typically do without problems.  <br />
<br />
Also with a SK you can pretty much Malo/Slow on the pull without fear which helps your healing very early on hard hitting mobs (typically the dangerous stage)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would go with SK if you are 3 boxing. The problem with a warrior, particularly on hard hitting mobs, is not so much holding agro, but staying alive long enough for you to malo/slow or whatever. With an SK you can pull with snare and that will give you time to do whatever debuffing you need to do. The other advantage of course is that if you accidently make a bad pull you could just FD. With a warrior you are pretty much pooched if multi-boxing since controling multiple toons while trying to CC isnt easy ;). And of course, mobs running on low health is allways a problem unless you use a snare whip, allthough relying on procs is iffy at best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You want an SK.  Damage should actually be comparable between your monk and a similarly equipped SK, plus the shaman and the chanter should be able to do pretty much whatever they want to the mob.  Make a hotkey to cast Clinging Darkness repeatedly and you should have no trouble with aggro.<br />
<br />
Gearwise, you'd probably find the war a bit easier to find good armor for and the sk easier to find a good weapon for.<br />
<br />
Tanking ability-wise, wars do have a small advantage over SKs in their ability to take damage.  This advantage largely dissappears in your situation though, since you don't have a cleric (no CH) and you'll presumably be fighting xp mobs, not raid level stuff that would require disciplines.<br />
<br />
I twobox a shaman and an sk, sometimes threeboxing with my cleric, and it's an extremely effective combination.  The only downside is, it's hard to go back to grouping with other people once you start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You could just pick one character and play with other characters.<br />
<br />
Nah!  Who'd want to do that!?<br />
<br />
I'd suggest SK.  Warriors are nice for damage absorption but have to actively work at holding aggro.  If you're multi-boxing you probably don't want to have to constantly fiddle with the warrior to retain aggro and chase down ping ponging critters every other time you land slow with the shaman.  All a SK has to do is cast snare/dot and they have instant and long lasting aggro.  And as stated a successful snare/dot has the critter coming into camp at snare speed which gives you lots of time to MR debuff and slow (with no fear of aggro).  SK can also FD which gives you more pulling options (even though you have a chanter to mez it's nice to have options).<br />
<br />
I know a lot of really good warriors but SKs are still my tank of choice - snare/dot is just too good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd go with the SK.  Darkness is great for holding aggro and this is helpful especially when three boxing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Snare, dps and tank all in one nice package (haven't I said that before?)<br />
Check sig ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Simple  SK all the way.<br />
<br />
The new stuff the warriors got helps them alot, but nothing can comapre to the SK's abilities i still feel. The warrior will be easier to 3 box though, so thats your choice, cause int he end theyw ill both do ok, but if it were me, i would go with the SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I use a SK for my two-box tank.  I find it works well for me.<br />
<br />
When you two- or three-box, you can't give 100 % attention to any char.  I expect that it is rare that the two are equal partners.  Instead, one of them becomes the Main that you give the bulk of your attention to, and the others become Pets:  you can give them more complex instructions than what you can tell Kenober to do, but your basic plan is for them to do their job while you are actively working your Main character.  <br />
<br />
For me, the shaman is the main and the SK is the pet.  I pull with the SK, and then I hit his aggro hotkey:  he will now stand there, hold aggro, get pounded on, and do decent dps, while I switch to the shaman to do slows, heals, and damage.  <br />
<br />
That two-box combination is very workable.  I like it a lot.<br />
<br />
You're working three.  But it sounds like your chanter demands very little of your attention:  it tags along, provides buffs and occasional crowd control.  So I would expect you would have no problem with the SK as the third member of the trio.<br />
<br />
The advantage of the warrior is that it is an easier pet to bot than the SK.  But you probably don't need to have the easier bot:  you can probably run the SK as a bot reasonably well.<br />
<br />
The advantage of the SK is that it can do more things for you.  Because it is a bot, you won't get the dps that an aggressive SK can generate:  but even as a pet it will give you more than a warrior bot can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I decided to give the shadowknight a try.<br />
<br />
I fired up my old shadowknight last night.  He's only level 47, so the level difference is going to be difficult for a while.  But it seemed to be working out ok.  I pulled with clinging darkness, and if it stuck I had time to throw another on before the mob hit camp.<br />
<br />
Once I engage in melee, I have a macro on my shaman to target the shadowknight, assist him, tell my pet to attack, and cast slow.  Even with my monk, at level 58, I'd occasionally get agro just from the slow and sending in the pet.  With my monk, the minute I cast the shaman dot Bane of Nife, agro would switch to the shaman and I'd likely not get it back.  <br />
<br />
Last night, with a level 47 shadowknight (11 levels lower), I never once got agro from slow.  I would be chaining CD on the sk while waiting for slow, and would then immediately cast BoN on the shaman.  If I'd gotten off 3 CDs by then, I wouldn't get agro.  After about 10 pulls, I had it figured out and could sit immediately after the BoN (or canni-dance).  It worked quite nicely.  3 CDs was enough to pretty much guarantee agro throughout the battle.  My enchanter can cast his stunning nuke (can't remember the name) without fear of agro.  My shaman can canni-dance right in front of the mob, without getting agro.  It was quite nice.  <br />
<br />
And, because I had C2 all night, my sk never got below 80% mana.  I could chain CD and my little lifetap all I wanted without problem.  <br />
<br />
My gear is ok for my level - mostly cultural (I'm a Cazic-Thule worshipping ogre, so it's fulvous darkscale for me).  A good old sceptre of lightning for 1500p in the bazaar, and I'm good to go.  I have a diseased greatstaff for 2hb - I don't understand why that weapon is so cheap.  It's quite nice and is a fraction of the cost of a windblade or war marshal's bladed staff - I think I paid about 2000p for it.  Anyway, it was great fun.  <br />
<br />
I can't wait to see how things work out when I get a few levels on the sk.  Right now the mobs I was fighting were right around my level - some db, white, and yellow.  They're all db to my level 61 shaman.  When my sk gets a little higher, he should be able to generate more dps and agro, resist more spells, and things should really start to click.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice and opinions.  <br />

Oh I vote for SK too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Smohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Those are ignorant, but not stupid, answers. One might think that because knights are better at aggro in groups, the same advantage would be true during two and three boxing.<br />

I three box a warrior, shaman, and cleric sometimes - the other times Im two boxing a warrior and shaman.<br />
<br />
It doesnt take much practice to learn the aggro level of your particular warrior and therefore you'll be able to know when to cast slow and get away with it.<br />
<br />
I do have a SK also and I know that warrior's tanking ability is superior to knight's, although that's traded for in aggro generation. Since you will have a good idea about your own warrior's aggro and when you can slow, that wont be an issue. Assuming you're not fighting light blues, you will spend less mana healing a warrior which will free you up to dot your targets (again, I know exactly when I can cast dots because I know my when my warrior has built enough aggro)<br />
<br />
I find that combo really workable. I can count the number of times I've pulled aggro from my warrior on one hand - and that's through many levels and now AA points. I usually cast dots and don't have much downtime when I'm in HoH and 2 boxing, no downtime when Im three.<br />
<br />
I can even bring two mobs and use a discipline and be fine - with only a shaman healer and me tanking both. I can keep aggro off the shaman by switching targets.<br />
<br />
Give it a try and I think you'll be happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The difference in aggro between a warrior and SK is the difference between having a virtual guarantee of it and hoping for it.  Playing your warrior and shaman well won't change that.<br />
<br />
If you want to do the toughest mobs around, go for a warrior.  They have the defensive disc and lots more hitpoints and better mitigation.  They are also more needed for most raids, if you like raiding a lot.  You'll never come anywhere close to the options regarding pulling that you do with a SK though.  Or have the ability to just FD your tank and gate your casters, letting you try things over and over, as long as it takes, without absorbing a single death.  With the warrior, once you engage, you're pretty much looking either to win or for a rez.<br />
<br />
Another great thing about shadowknights is that you can summon your corpse with them when you DO have a bit of bad luck or screw up.  And they're great for exploring -- they can invis to undead and to use regular invis.  If you get a pre-nerf circlet of shadow, they can re-invis right in mob's face practically and not get caught doing it.  That combined with FD means -- and the final escape hatch of corpse summoning -- means you can do a lot of exploring and messing around with a SK -- something people with monks often enjoy a lot -- I know I do on both my monk and SK.<br />
<br />
The SK pet and your shaman pet add a fair amount of damage over time.  It's not a huge burst, but over time it's a nice little addition.<br />
<br />
You won't be duoing/trio'ing mobs that are as tough if you use your SK, but overall, you will have much more flexibility in pulling and fighting, and I think a lot more fun.<br />
<br />
My SK is up to a bit over 7700 HP with raid buffs wearing only his general bazaar stuff including ogre cultural fulvous darkscale and ornate on hands, wrists, and arm.  I actually have to give up hitpoints to wear the ornate over the fulvous -- it's very good stuff.  You can get a pretty decently geared tank pretty cheaply these days; cultural prices have plunged, and a war marshall's bladed staff costs about a quarter to a fifth what a windblade does on my server -- yet it outdamages the windblade.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, good luck.  I loved my monk who I played as a main for a while, and I love my SK now.  Either makes a good match.  I wouldn't want to give up FD pulling, so I abandoned my own warrior at 52.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">sk = fd, snare, better agro control.  might be a little harder to box, but if you have the skills and the mindset, it's not even a question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">To put it bluntly, a Sk with a rusty dagger has more aggro potential than a warrior with Uber_drop_001 sword/dagger/mace/etc....anything that has a mana pool has the potential to overtake something that doesnt....DPS over a long period of time will generate a lot of aggro, but often on EXP mobs, they dont live long enough to really see that...<br />
SK's are aggro masters and I really dont know another class that can get snap aggro as well as they can...just remember that a level 65 SK usually uses 3 things for aggro: Clinging Darkness, Clinging Darkness, and Clinging Darkness.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also 2 box a warrior/shaman Smohg, so i'm quite familiar with the issues involved. You are correct in that playing that combo you get to know when to slow and when not to, and that works fine for stuff that hits up to about 500 or so, as long as you get single pulls. If you get multiples, controlling them and healing your tank can be an issue if they are hitting that hard, but is doable if they hit for less (200-300). It is not that simple for stuff that hits for over 500, is resistant or quads. You just can't heal and debuff at the same time fast enough (well, you can, but it is very risky, though exciting, trying to do that while controlling 2 toons).<br />
<br />
Usually if I have to work with those sorts of mobs (when doing work on the aid grimmel quest for example) I basically bot my warrior and do most of the work with my shaman. Ie pull with malos or slow at distance, then haul ass to the fight spot and root it on inc. Final debuffing takes place while it is rooted and then I send my warrior in. That works fine, and you can take on some pretty significant mobs that way, provided that they root and are not too resistant. It's not really very practical doing it the reverse way though. When you are fighting 65 or 66 mobs, an SK is a lot safer to work with because of the tools they have that allow you to control the engagement.</div></div><hr />
