<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Think about it. <br />
<br />
A person with ADD suffersw from short attention spans and lack focus. They tend to have a very broad knowledge base, but very shallow specialization capabilities. A ADD sufferer tends to change jobs a lot, which is the reason for their broad knowledge base.<br />
<br />
What is a shaman ?  A shaman is a toon that can heal, produce DPS and tank and perform CC all in equal degrees of inability. They can perform all of these functions to a extent, but is defiently a master of none of them.<br />
<br />
<br />
So i propose a new AA that all shaman will find useful.<br />
<br />
For 9 AAi propose a ritilan AA. It will last about 4 game time hours and during that time you will be able to focus on one of these abilities and enhance it by 50%. So if you wanna be a nuker on the raid, at the start you will hit the AA hotkey and select Nukes. Problem sovled.<br />
<br />
Downside will be that if you use it too much in a row you will begin to talk to flowers and believe you are a druid and will forget that you have a spirit companion.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actualy, past the joke. Is it that bad of a AA idea?  A focus AA that will let us nuke better or heal better, but will decrease other abilities.<br />
<br />
Like if im on a raid or a group that i need a lot of DPS on, i could activate this AA for a mild boost of abilities, which would decrease my over all healing abilities and vise versa. This would certainly help us fill roles in groups and raids more wouldnt it?<br />
<br />
Call it spirit focus. Once the AA is active you cant deactivatei t to switch to healing, you cna only deactivate it period, then itll have like a 1 hour refresh. I know some classes might bitch if we got something like this, but the fact is that we are not like any class. We are uniquly in the middle of so many abilties, but nothing is done well enough to be a primary at it. Atleast if we can use this AA for healing and DPS we can fill in roles that are 1 hard to find people for and 2 vastly desired.<br />
<br />
The shaman was designed to be a strong character, dont nerf us cause we are built well. Some characters are just stronger then others. Enchanter is a prime example of this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would be really great, for instance, if you could activate a slowing improvement that Knocks down 2 levels of mitigation at the cost of maybe cutting your heals in half.   Or perhaps increase your heals by 50% at a cost of all your stat/HP buffs decrased by 50%.<br />
<br />
I like these kind of seemingly rare posts where people are at least thinking of things &quot;outside the box&quot; of just improve this stat/heal percentage/ability or nerf the other's classes ability.<br />
<br />
I say keep 'em coming.  Perhaps someone at SOE will read one of these kind of posts and find a way to boost us up a bit without breaking their seemingly fixed healing/slow ideas for Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Actualy, past the joke. Is it that bad of a AA idea? <br />
I actually like it. As long as your &quot;locked&quot; into your choice for a set time, I think its awesome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i certainly like the idea of a spirit focus aa that increase healing,dd, buff etc depending on what you are doing and decrease the other aspects. whether they could do it as one buff or need serval differnet aa that can be activated but only 1 at a time?<br />
so<br />
spirit focus healing.  increases healing spells (including hot`s) while decreasing dps spells<br />
spirit focus damage. increase dps spells while decreasing healing spells<br />
<br />
both linked can only use 1 at a time, last 90 mins recast 100 mins?<br />
<br />
for a start:)<br />
<br />
wish list one<br />
spirit focus pet.. increases pet to beast level, decreases dots (or stops you using some depending on balance) basically pet would do same damage as dots if you stacked bane,poison and desease. (or one of the new spirit call pets and balance dots to it, ie 135 hits and 625 dd proc)<br />
with this one with zoning pets now it could have a long recast time like 2 hrs or more.<br />
or<br />
<br />
spirit focus (dd) .. increase dd (possible to druid level) drecease dot damage (to what ever balances)  <br />
<br />
only problem i really see is the need to do mana adjustments which might be to hard to code unless they can do a % to them too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">See you all laugh at me, but this silly thread cultivated a good idea :p<br />
<br />
<br />
cudar, why do you think mana should be adjusted ? I mean part of the nerfing trade off for the advanced healing or DPS could be the cost of casting that spells being affected. Unless you mean the mana cost of abilites being affected in a positive way, in which case it hink the answer lies in how much focus we are talking about. Obviously a 50% increase in healing requires some mana changes, but 10% or 15% i dont think deserves it, especialy considering you siffering in other areas to gain the ability. It would just be another perk of the Spirit Focus AA.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 The shaman is a bit of a jack of all trades, i know some people dont like that description, but to me they are. I will agree we are less of a JoaT's PoP and post-pop, but a skilled shaman who knows his abilities well can do so much, from healing ( pre-god) to CC, to pulling to debuffing to tanking ( again pre-god ) and even provide a atleast noticable contribution in DPS to the group. Not saying he can do all the well at the same time, but if focused on 1 ability he can make things happen.<br />
<br />
And isnt about sharing abilites Adonn. This is about having a &quot;focus&quot; to the abilties we all ready have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well for my idea of 50% increase , the mana for healing would pretty effeceint, therefore might need more mana to adjust. for instance daluda mending 1550 for 490 mana , would become 2325 for 490 mana. 4.7 rating, cleric are 5. (at th same time bane would do only 210 a tick and dd 412) which i think is pretty balanced.<br />
<br />
actually that still slightly less effecient than cleric heals so maybe not:)<br />
<br />
nuke would be 1387 for 300, which would be 4.5 compare to druid 3.4 (better than wiz best at 4.2) so in this case a slight increase in mana to 400 cost might be needed to balance. (course help if our nuke was only 6 sec to cast:))<br />
on side note bane for 630 a tick is nice too. though i can forsee summoned deaths if dot agro not corrected:)<br />
<br />
the pet one ofcourse wouldnt matter for mana.<br />
<br />
ofcourse if it only  20% difference then no mana adjustment, but i think to really be effective 50% or higher needed though 50% seem to get about the right level i think .<br />
<br />
i also like the 50% idea as it means you can stay as not so good at all, or good at 1 aspect which gives choice and means that you could get a shaman for 2 different roles. (other than debuff)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yea, 50% in my mind seemed like a lot, but now im seeing with the numbers your giving that its not really that big a deal, to me anyway. Though i do wonder how long the recast time is on that wizzy nuke that would be a lower rating then our VS.<br />
<br />
I wonder what happens if we take it further. With levels of choice of focus. 3 level of 33%  66% and 100%<br />
<br />
<br />
100 percent would mean that your nukes would be uncastable, they would just remain a grey gem while your healing would be greatly boosted and the same with the reverse, your healing would be greyed out while your nukes were increased greatly.  Hmm, i dont know if thats too far, but never know till you push the edge.<br />
<br />
I think 50% sounds about right too though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Aye Lit, but what if they gave &quot;focus&quot; to other classes?

your probably right , but  the idea is that it is only shaman that can focus their soul due to thier ties with the spirit world:)<br />
<br />
i didnt actually take cast time into consideration only damage/mana<br />
heal/mana. and it was mana effeciency. and it was only the 50% imporved one that was better. vs by itself is about 3.<br />
<br />
100% would be great, though it would mean you become a cleric or  wizard, which probably just wouldnt be accepted. 66% maybe, as i said 50% gets about to where  it should be. and depending on if soe correct other things would depend on the %.<br />
<br />
if it affected hots too, breath of trushar 630 per tick for 420, would become 945 a tick for 420 mana, which would be amazing. this again might need a mana adjustment<br />
<br />
and on a similar note tear of saryn 650 *3 for 450 mana would be 975 *3 for 450, mind with the built in resist this might not need a mana change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>jeyche Deychundei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I think tho as a &quot;Spirit Focus&quot; you should use it as a pet summoning slot,  so if yur in a group with another shaman, you can see what focus he has up<br />

(e.g. no focus = dogdog, Melee focus upgrade = Bear (+ pet DSP upgrade) er healing = cat Dots = scaled wolf... etc you get the idea)<br />
<br />
other than that i would say it sould be around a 33% increase, rather than a 50%... that'll mean that even at 33% it'll make ppl stand up and realise that YOU can have a full 6 slot shaman group <br />

yep that might work make our pet the focus, click the aa next pet becomes that focus, though not sure how that would work?  or make it go in the song buff slot, like a ward, but self only.<br />

<br />
<br />
Thats my whole point though Adonn. This is a good shaman AA cause we have no class defining skill really. Other classes are naturaly focused, they are designed that way.  wizzy is focused on DPS a cleric is focused on healing a warrior is focused on tanking, to point out the obvious ones.<br />
<br />
This AA would give us situational focus to help us do what it is we been doing since day 1. Fill the role that is needed for the situation at hand. <br />
<br />
Dont focus on if SoE would give it to us, focus on the idea itself and help refine it. Later we can bitch why SoE wont give it to us, plenty of time for that ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm if im getting it right this is also a interesting idea. Though as i sit down and think about it in this reply i got halfway through and had to back track cause i wonder, how would the balance work?<br />
<br />
The idea behind what i was thinking was a trade off from 1 ability to the other. Gain in healing, lose in DPS and vise versa. With a pet im having trouble figuring out how to make it worth while and still staggered enough. From my angle it really is pointless to associate it with the pet cause you cant really hurt him for it. If your not hurting or helping the pet directly then why involve it.<br />
<br />
Though on a side note, a reasonable upgrade for the DPS AA would be that puppy gets inate dual wield and a proc. Basicly whent his AA is activated we get a weaker BST pet at this level. Now im not one for taking other class abilites, but we did have a pet before them and they certainly took enough of ours, i dont see the problem with getting this since our healing would be dimished for it.</div></div><hr />

.<br />
<br />
think of it this way, the pet is our spirit guide, its our link to the spirit world (allegedly) and the reason why it should affect our pet is that, its our normal pet but with the extra focus (cos lets face it dogdog sucks) so when we summon the Pet/melee enhancement dogdog we lose out on the healing/dot/dd/debuff bonuses we just get a 33% increase in DPS.<br />
<br />
and also having him as our focus allows a) somthing special for us b) gives us a reason for casting dogdog rather than the speed bump he is<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The idea behind what i was thinking was a trade off from 1 ability to the other. Gain in healing, lose in DPS and vise versa. <br />
<br />
sure yu can summon the normal pet but everything is at base shaman lvls<br />
and have all the other focus counteract each other either like;<br />
summon the Healing focus =  +33% healing increase -33% Dot damage<br />
summon the DD focus =  +33% DD increase -33% Melee damage<br />
and  Debuff focus  = +33% debuff increase (dont ask me how) -10% Melee and -13% healing<br />
etc<br />
<br />
OR<br />
summon the Healing focus = +33% healing increase -33% Dot damage<br />
summon the Dot damage = +33% Dot damage -33% DD <br />
summon the DD focus = +33% DD increase -33% Melee damage<br />
summon the Melee focus = +33% Melee damage -33% Debuff thingy<br />
summon the debuff focus = +33% debuff increase -33% healing<br />
<br />
however as i write those i feel that the debuff capabilities maybe should be exepmt from this or possibly create -ve's for the other 4 aspects as its a powerful tool<br />
<br />
the increases should include cast times recast times as well im not to sure about mana pres... but yu get the general idea</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I think the idea is great, but you know if SoE ever did implement this for Shaman it'd be a 5min aa with a 1.5 hr reuse timer :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
i could see the pet link thingy working if the pet DOESNT do damage.. no matter what focus you use the only time he does damage is when he is normal dogdog.. it has a bunch of uses<br />
<br />
a) it means you cant summon a pet for dps while doing this<br />
b) it lets the group know what youre using<br />
c) it provides &quot;lore&quot; to the AA.. hes our link</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
why cant he do damage? be the normal dogdog... cos it'll mean /pet hold is worth something and if the old pet does get sent in and dies, yur a little buggered for a little while until the timer refreshes... and if its the Melee  focus, the ole pet will be tanking away (like Beastlords) while yur laying some smack down with yur spear... (could also mean that any heals yu do to yur pet (this is melee focus) are at double the effectiveness )</div></div><hr />

<br />
But bards and druids have seriously more advanced abilities to offer a group. Obviously a druid can already heal and is the second best in the game. They also offer serious DPS from their nukes.<br />
<br />
Bards i dont think we need to explain. Their self power and group enhancement is incredible, though it does come at a physical cost to their hands working well in 5 years heh.<br />
<br />
I dont see it as overpowering at all. I think thats a term we have had pounded in our heads to accept and now for some of us its a default mentality. I believe that this could be implimented in a way where it would provide power to us without going too far, i mean you have 10% to 60% or more to chose from on these ratios, so all it takes is a proper ratio choice. All this does is solve the problem of the shaman not having a unique role.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What you all think ?  Should we try to actualy make this formal and work out some numbers and present it to SoE ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I don't see it as overpowering either, but the &quot;Coolness&quot; factor of having such a nifty ability be choosable, would definitely open up a can of worms in the realm of class envy.  <br />
<br />
I think it'd be perfectly balanced, I just worry about what would happen if it were given to us, I think the cross class flames would be horrendous.<br />
<br />

druid already do heal and damage effectively. but that doesnt mean that a lower version existed they couldnt have it, it just depends on balanceing all preist classes.

I got 2 words ...<br />
<br />
<br />
Tough  **** .<br />
<br />
I fhave no sympathy for any of the classes in EQ these days cause almost all of them have had very &quot;cool&quot; upgrades while we sat back in the shadows and were left behind cause we were thought overpowered.<br />
<br />
You want cool ?  How about a dvine rez AA that is 100% rez, or how about a change that if you die you are instant rezed back up with a chance of that happening again. How about a disc that would let you take half the damage a mob is giving to you when you got aggro from a slow or how about being able to charm a 800dps for your group. Or here is a good one .. a group heal AA that has a mana regen componet. Those are all very neat ideas that can cause class envy and there are more to example as well. I dont see anything wrong with giving a  &quot; ewww wow&quot; factor to shaman. Im bias i know, but i think we deserve it at this point. <br />
<br />
Just think of that poor shaman in the other that got left out of the quarm raid cause he couldnt offer anything &quot;critical&quot;  This would help out that situation i feel.<br />
<br />
BTW, dont mistake my anger as directed at you, its directed at anyone that would be petty enough to bitch about us getting this.</div></div><hr />

I would have no issue with this being a priest thing more then just a shaman thing. Would increase the peace thats for sure. But honestly i dont see druids deserving tis as much as shaman and clerics.<br />
<br />
Druids are very broad in their abilties, they make you think they suck cause theyc ant slow, but i think anyone that played this game for a while knows thats a myth.  Shaman are too weak in their broad array of abilities to be of use at the smae level or more of the competing classes and clerics definetly are 1 dimensional and would add a fun factor to them.<br />
<br />
The problem is, you know if clerics and shaman get it, then druids will have a coniption fit and i think we all know they do it better then any other class in the game. That being said i think it should be kept in the realm of shaman only cause no offense druids, but you dont need it i feel.<br />
<br />
<br />
If im wrong dont flame me, tell me how im wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">i agree that druids are at the moment the most balance of the priest classes. and the most powerful.<br />
<br />
my rating would be shaman at 50 to 66% focus to all types.<br />
<br />
cleric  50% ish to dd, posible some buff one if seperate, no healing<br />
<br />
druid 10 to 20% depending to dd or heal.<br />
<br />
depending on exactly what shaman do and cleric do respectively. gotto rem that if a cleric can nuke as well as a druid  and only heal half as effectively he still be heal as good a s a druid nearly. so i could se druid being alittle bit pu out.<br />
<br />
best result if where the priest classes all heal about the same or do the same dps (or close) when focused. druid are though i admit tricky and maybe just need some other aa to help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>jeyche Deychundei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">ok, i was thinking about this somemore lastnight as i couldnt sleep...<br />
<br />
lets give it a name<br />
<br />
Spirit Focus<br />
how many AA's i dunno i dont care... but enough so that its an achievement to get.. a milestone like canni 5 (as in NOT A CRAP LOAD like CA 3 is) so about 5 or something<br />
<br />
useable lvl?? 59 cos from lvl 55 things go down hill for us.<br />
<br />
how does it work well there are 5 aspects to a shaman, and because were so diverse a community there should be 5 different focii<br />
<br />
one for each shamanic race (damn forggies dont count.... bloody clerics and wizards and shaman!!! i dunno *shakes head*<br />
Duration - perminant (why not.. if yu want to switch yu desummon the pet and summon again)<br />
<br />
recast time - 1.5 hours (seems fair to me, make yur choice and have to stick with it maybe)<br />
<br />
how does it work... ok<br />
<br />
this line made the final piece fall for me<br />
<br />
<br />
how about making them accessible via a shaman-only potion, rather than boring old AAs? <br />
<br />
<br />
upon activation of the AA it summons 5 NO DROP LORE potions into yur inventory <br />
<br />
(as an example theyre called and do the following)<br />
<br />
attunement of the Khati sha - DD<br />
attunement of Cazak Thule - dots<br />
attunement of Innurouk - debuffs<br />
attunement of Rallos Zek - melee<br />
attunement of the tribunal - healing<br />
(i hope i got the 5 gods right - i know the spellings wrong on one, apologies)<br />
<br />
yu pick potion yu want to attune to drink it and just like MGB after yu drink it yu summon yur good ole true spirit/spirit of the howler, and he becomes the animal of attunement that yu chose: - <br />
<br />
Bear<br />
Cat<br />
Aligator<br />
Scaled wolf<br />
Raven (the raven always makes me think of &quot;the raven&quot; by egar allen Poe so that can be fear)<br />
<br />
and normal Dogdog is yur standard swiss army shaman. what does this do fir all yu shaman out there? i hear yu ask... well here comes the science part, concentrate!<br />
<br />
it affects yu in one of the following 3 ways (we have to decide which one)<br />
1)  - the colour wheel style<br />
summon the Healing focus = +33% healing increase -33% Dot damage<br />
summon the DD focus = +33% DD increase -33% Melee damage<br />
and Debuff focus = +33% debuff increase (dont ask me how) -10% Melee and -13% healing<br />
etc<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
2) - the staggered style<br />
summon the Healing focus = +33% healing increase -33% Dot damage<br />
summon the Dot damage = +33% Dot damage -33% DD <br />
summon the DD focus = +33% DD increase -33% Melee damage<br />
summon the Melee focus = +33% Melee damage -33% Debuff thingy<br />
summon the debuff focus = +33% debuff increase -33% healing<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
3) the big benifit minor losses to all others<br />
summon the Healing focus = +33% healing increase - 5% loss to DD, Dot, Debuff, Melee<br />
summon the Dot damage = +33% Dot damage -5% loss to DD, healing, Debuff, Melee<br />
summon the DD focus = +33% DD increase -5% loss to healing, Dot, Debuff, Melee<br />
summon the Melee focus = +33% Melee damage - 5% loss to DD, Dot, Debuff, healing<br />
summon the debuff focus = +33% debuff increase - 5% loss to DD, Dot, healing, Melee<br />
<br />
thew bonuses need to be worthwhile otherwise it'll be like rabid bear.... worthless. As an example 33% on Tnargs mending, with the healing focii up (at 33% increase) it'll heal 1789 HP's Base, before imp healing 4 etc<br />
<br />
33% on velium strike (spell haste and damage and recast) damage = 1230 cast time 5.9 (seems better now dont it!)<br />
<br />
the Pots as theyre lore yu can only have one of each type every 1.5 hours... and yu cant stack them, it does allow yu to change yur pet tho if yu need to and the situation arises<br />
<br />
hows that?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: as fot the clerics, they can kiss my furry behind, and go have their FT fish abilities, this is shamanism baby! its where the Mojo is at!</div></div><hr />

I think we are over doing things a bit, making it too complex and hard to implitment.<br />
<br />
<br />
Im thinking of simple changes, to DPS and healing. Forget the buffs, cause i dont think they would go for it for starters and again, its opening the door to too many complexities.<br />
<br />
<br />
So lets put it in simply terms.<br />
<br />
<br />
First off i personaly feel that 59 is a lil low for this AA unless its staggered through the level 70 progression path, then i would go for it. Otherwise i think 63 would be a good start.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, my personaly idea would be direct trade offs in DPS and healing, 33% more DPS = 33% less effective healing. It can be done through the puppy i guess as was mentioned in this thread, but it think the core abilitiy needs to remain simple in its implimentation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
does not have to be puppy pet , could be a whole new type of pet like wizard familar. but ofcourse you can only have 1 pet up at a time.. or a personel ward, buff in the song buffs and linked to yourself so follows you around.<br />
<br />
but yes dont over think this it mainly for improve healing or dps, both stackable on a raid or in a group. and probably not so helpful for soloing, even the increase to say dots wont kill things that much quicker soloing though it will be quicker , but i doubt faster than any other solo class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">could be a whole new type of pet like wizard familar. but ofcourse you can only have 1 pet up at a time.. or a personel ward, buff in the song buffs and linked to yourself so follows you around.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now thats a great implimentation of the pet idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>jeyche Deychundei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">i thought spirit focus was a Bst ability... cos that was what i was thinking of but thought it was already taken. spirit focus it is then<br />
<br />
<br />
I think we are over doing things a bit, making it too complex and hard to implitment.<br />
<br />
<br />
in what way, the potion bit or overall?<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Shamans are like any colour int he rain bow... take green for example, there are MANY forms of green from a almost blue -green to a yellow green, yet they all come under the same colour 'green'... and with that in mind i wanted this to reflect the shaman ways. Hence why there is 5 different choices.<br />
<br />
besides, yu ask for a little yu get nothing, yu ask for alot... yu get something... personally i'd like to see all 5 aspects as i have written be used.<br />
(the 3 different implimented ways was expamles of how it could be implimented, we just neeedd to pick one and go from there)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
First off i personaly feel that 59 is a lil low for this AA unless its staggered through the level 70 progression path, then i would go for it. Otherwise i think 63 would be a good start.<br />
<br />
<br />
To be honest maybe 59 staggered thru isnt a bad idea, at 59 yu get acces to the healing focus, 61 the nukes, 63 the debuffs, 65 the melee, 67 the nukes... that would be a nice little thing to get<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
i just thought using the puppy and morphing him a little would ad a bit of variation to the shamans and be a visual indication, without losing the dogdog useage... and from that quote above, it looks like yu go for implimentation no 1<br />
<br />
<br />
the quoting wasnt in any way to pull yur post apart, just an easy way for me to explain my thought process... cos we gotta be thorough if were gunna suggest this<br />
<br />
also<br />

everything cept the raven is probably ok, the rest are beast pets so in the gobal file already.<br />
mind a competely seperate type not used by others be nice, and u/g form of the old dire wolf model maybe..i liked the old model better than the new one:)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Achzizra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">It's a good idea. It's different, it's catchy, and it's bound to get us yelled at. It's a win win situation =)<br />
I especially like the idea of implementing it as a familiar-type, similar to what the wizards have. <br />
Give it a long recast time, so we gotta stick with what we choose, and give the familiar-spirits unique looks. We're not a flashy class, and the familiar-spirits wouldn't have to be either.. just different. <br />
Permanent duration would be too much imo, but it has to last a while or it's pointless, like RB. Either long duration and long reuse, or short duration and short reuse. Short duration and long reuse is not an option, and long duration short reuse is probably too much to ask for. <br />
A short duration version would make the AA very situational but you'd be able to switch strengths more often (assuming short reuse) - which is something we already do to a lesser extent. A long duration version would make your choice more important. Agg.. i can feel the ADD settling, must.. continue.. I'd pay lots'o AAs for this, I'd even buy OoW for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Glencannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">This is a fantastic idea, Lit.  It fits right in with the original Berzerker Line (increase ATK, Haste and AC, but it used your entire mana bar).<br />
<br />
I'd love to be able to DPS like a warrior or knight, or nuke like a druid, on a raid when I'm the 7th shaman there....<br />
<br />
Make it cost a certain number of AA's for each--say, 10 or 20.  You could do Nuking, Healing, Meleeing, or Slowing/CC for an hour at a time, and would be unable switch to the others until time expires.  <br />

Secondly how do you impose only one style of play. People will want flexibility. One moment a shaman has a raid and then is grouping, he has to alter styles of play. Then there is the casual player who maybe plays 15 mins, logs for say an hour then comes back and plays another 15 mins. One mode will be restricted on him?<br />

Well what i was saying is 2 different types, healing or DPS. Personaly it if we start bringing in slow and other fascets into this AA idea, it becomes too powerful sounding, even if its not. We have 2 big bitches, we cant heal when we wanna be pure healers and we cant nuke when there is already a shaman in the group or 3-4 in a raid.<br />
<br />
 Shaman have been versitile from day one. Druids are kinda in the same boat to a extent, so its not a oncommon theme in EQ. The things with druids is they can heal well or they can nuke well. This would just bring us in line with that and would even be less powerful in a way cause we would have to chose which we wanted. A druid can just cast which ever they want.<br />
<br />
I mean lets face it, in the long wrong the only thing different at the core abilties is that we have slow and they dont. So i dont see why allowing us to be more versitile in a situational enviroment is a bad thing. I think this would make shaman happy too cause its unique, which is something our class lacks, plus no one has really expressed a hatred for the idea thus far in the thread. <br />
<br />
If it keeps favor with more shaman here i think ill make a new thread in a week or 2 where we can tune the idea and present it to SoE.</div></div><hr />

you can rep bump those who helped too:)<br />
<br />
shaman used to be able to mellee (about 1/4 war) , dot , dd , slow all in one fight which is what made shaman so wanted, not only did we buff good, but we added alot to group, and we did do some decent dps.<br />
<br />
this just rebalances us for faster fight by giving a boast to one type of spell, while the down side is the (rough) opposite spell are decreased.<br />
<br />
also if rabid bear meant we became &quot;a mellee class&quot; for 60 mins, at a loss of our dots maybe? (ie double attack, attack increase , better defense, mellee stam to hp ratio,  probably pally like but in chain armor?)</div></div><hr />

Definetly, i just stumbled on the idea, its everyone that shaping it http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/images/icons/icon14.gif<br />
<br />
<br />
Well in all fairness we never really melee'd well. We just had some ok weapons and overall damage to a mob was so low cause everyones abilties were less powerful, that we seemed closer.<br />
<br />
Think of it like this. If you start 2 lines and run them 1 mile next to each other, but change the angle on 1 line by half a degree, by the time you get to the end of the mile they will not be as close as they were in the begining.<br />

This is how i personaly percieve our melee damage. Its naturaly less and though i definetly would like to have more melee power cause i enjoy meleeing often ( i still call myself a battle shaman ) i think for how our class is, its just not in the cards and i dont think anyone wanted me for my melee ever, but i might be wrong. None of the priests can melee. The cleric can only melee through their hammer which is nothing more then a toy to keep clerics interested in their classes. When you look at how much shaman druids and clerics miss and over all suck at melee, you see that we just werent made for it. So just get yourself a big procing weapons and keep avatar on yourself, its very satisfying on with that alone.<br />
<br />
This is a big reason among others that i feel we should stick to simple healing and DPS ( nukes/DoTs) for this AA. Other then buffing/debuffing , which i feel shouldnt be touched by this AA, its our of our 4 main abiltities. And its so simple to impliment, a trade off in being a healer ( clerical role ) to a DPS ( nuker/wizzy type ) role. I feel trying to make it more then that is going to undermine the idea and make it look like its asking for too much. <br />
<br />
I dont need to be powerful, just useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">&quot;Well in all fairness we never really melee'd well. We just had some ok weapons and overall damage to a mob was so low cause everyones abilties were less powerful, that we seemed closer.&quot;<br />
<br />
to level 50 i have same caps as a warrior, i could hit as good as a warrior level 50 with my trusty 2hb i did roughtly half as good as a warrior, with the same 2hb. (untill kunark when warrior caps raise and shaman stayed the same, we where the only preist class with 200 in weapon skills.)<br />
<br />
we just didnt have double attack, duel wield<br />
<br />
that being said i would say a pally is above 1/2 warrior damage so you are right it would be a little too powefully as it is, but i think something that last 30 mins with a 45 recast that give us a better mellee and tanking would be nice, though maybe not as good as a true mellee/tank.<br />
<br />
just being able to hit more than 210 with my 50 damage weapon would be good too, my beast with a 45 dam weapon does 300 odd. but maybe that the extra 25 skill in 2hb?<br />
so maybe rabid bear should last 30 mins, add 25 to 2hb/1hb/priecing (or add mellee damage bonus?), double attack. no haste or attack.? maybe a 1 hr recast? as with other aa it last probably closer to 40 /45 mins? (handy if came shrunk bear form not big, could grow if wanted too), this mainly though a fix to an aa we already have.<br />
<br />
my other thought was to make rabid bear a short aa, but abit like defensive  skill (or block 90% of dmage or somin) so that for 5 mins (how long defensive last?) we can tank like a tank, might be handy for saving your life. but 2 hr reuse seems still bit long more like 1 hr.<br />
<br />
strangely if i could get mellee crits and stuff too i would get them, mellee get dd crits, why cant caster get mellee ones? (though obviously useless to casters in gerneral:))<br />
<br />
woot i got a bump i think it was positive but only grey :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>jeyche Deychundei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">i want all 5, because it allows us to focus one of the 5 aspects of a shaman, I like to melee, and i'd like to be able to nuke a little better at times, or when soloing be able to dot a hell of alot better cos it takes me too long to kill mobs in HoH (yes i try to solo there... chanters can so why cant i). There are times when im needed to be main healer but i cant do it efficently because my heals are lacking... Debuffing was there to ad a 5th side to it, and i'll admit its the weakest one out fo the 5... however, as most of us prolly wont even see our GoD spells this could go along way into allowing us to mitigate mitigation and land slows faster and malo quicker, allowing us to remain debuffer extrondinaare.<br />
<br />
There are definate times where im needed to be one of each and not a little bit of all, and a focus like this for each one (at current content) would be great... <br />
Yesterday when our pally died, i had to step up and MA in PoTacts and the melee focus would of helped me to an extreme amount (im not time flagged and im not an ornate wearer... still in my tae ew) but each one of these focus' would be beneficial rather than detrimental, so id rather have all 5 TBH</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Urgh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Excellent idea... Especially the version with pets, as this could easily be implemented along the lines of Wizard focus familiars.<br />
<br />
Maybe 30% would be more realistic, and a long reuse delay like 1 hour.<br />
<br />
Would also help so much with stacking on raids... some shammies can focus on heals, some on nukes, etc...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well let me see if i can dredge this up from memory ...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To my understanding true melee classes are in a different hit table ( forgive if the term isnt right ) then a caster class.  STR/ Atack and hit and miss function differently with melee and casters  because of this &quot; hit table&quot; or whatever its called. So even thoughy our &quot;skills&quot; are maxed at the same, you will miss a lot more then a true melee class, which is what im basing my &quot; we never melee'd well to begin with&quot; argument off of.<br />
<br />
Sorry for being a lil rusty on it, but im very positive that its a true fact.<br />
<br />
<br />
i want all 5<br />
<br />
<br />
I want them too, but you really need to step back and ask yourself if we really need more then healing and DPS, is it a question of &quot; i want&quot; or a question of making use useful. I mean i want to have the pet of  BST, the nukes of wizard and the heals of a cleric. But we dont NEED that and shouldnt have it.<br />
<br />
I stand by my posts that we shoudlnt have it all. I just wanna be useful, not a super uber powerhouse ( though it would be nice. Trying to stay within a realm that isnt goingt o blow the lid off other classes and SoE might actualy impliment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if yu look at the suggested shaman changes, how many of our problems does this aa cover?... all of them, melee is DPS, yur saying the damage table is different... ok how about when we get the melee focus it gives us bash at the same lvl as piercing? and it makes our Pet like a lvl 50 bst pet... thats not to unreasonable is it?<br />
<br />
i may of wais i want all 5... but let me rephrase that... we NEED all 5... <br />
<br />
even with this we wont nuke at wizard/druid rates, melee like pallys/warror's heal like clerics or druids, the only thing it would do is to bring us to the forefront of dots and debuffing... dots doing a greater amount of damage and debuffs with innate resist mods and mitigation mitigation... everything that we have asked for... as far as i see it this is what we need. Everyone says its the higher end shaman that is broken, well this would be for the higher end shaman  and it would go a great deal towards helping.<br />

<br />
Tough  **** .<br />
<br />
<br />
How would you feel if another class was given an ability that was as dynamic as this?  I'd personally say, hey, they have the coding for it, why not give us something like it?<br />
<br />
I think asking them to code something like this is like asking a fish to ride a bicycle... I'd rather them just pick an area and improve upon it to give us our group demand back.<br />
<br />
Based on previous changes to the game, I honestly believe that thinking up and proposing innovative spells or AA's is a lot less likely to see response than asking for something like heals comparable to GoD content, or faster nukes to contribute for when slows are useless.<br />
<br />
Sort of like someone on eq live boards who proposed the shaman's epic 2.0 as a shield that would have 8 versions that you could put in a box, pick something, then combine and each one would have different stats and effects.  Something like that is a fantastic idea, but so is skeletons popping out of the ground and surprising you, or mobs being smart enough to not run in circles chasing a bard who is afk macro swarming when they could sit still and hit him as he passes the same spot each time if they had any brains.  But I don't think those things will happen.<br />
<br />
Not trying to be a nay sayer, the skill is a cool concept.  But to be honest, in my opinion, each class is supposed to have a role.  This would make us be able to fulfill ALL roles better, even if we had to choose for every situation, and would most likely be a class balance nightmare in Sony's eyes.<br />
<br />
You're basically giving our class the ability to function effectively in ANY role.  This is nifty, but if not given to other classes, is potentially imbalancing IMO, not for one raid (since no matter what we pick, we'll still not be the best at it, just better).  It's the fact you could pick any one you want that is imbalancing.  Each class is supposed to have a main role.  We should get AA's to enhance that.  They should fix what is wrong with that leading game mechanic.<br />
<br />
The reason we act as nukers these days is because our slow is not worth it half the time in current content.  Asking for the ability to enhance the nukes is just a way to ease the pain of a wound that devs have hit us with in the form of mitigating our class defining ability.  They either need to pick a NEW ability to define us by, or make the old one (slow) substantial in later content.  <br />
<br />
Let's say they DID put in an AA that allows us to buff any of our abilities by choice every so often.  What, then, would be the developers' motivation to balance any one area of our skills?  Because if they made us good at nuking, the nuke choice AA would now make us &quot;overpowered.&quot;  If they made us better at healing, the healing AA would make us &quot;overpowered.&quot;<br />
<br />
Implementing this AA would lock us into the state we are at now.  Ability to cast Pet, Nukes, DD's, and Slows that pale in comparison to those casted by other classes (with the exception of slow, although that is mitigated later on and can be brought by a BST or ENC to a much closer to max game efficiency to turgur's than our heal is to CH, for example)<br />
<br />
And don't take any of this personally or anything, hehe... I just feel like this would take away slightly from the whole One Voice thread that asked Sony to improve one of our abilities from a list.<br />
<br />
And as for the idea about the five potions and stuff, well, that's a fantastic idea, but the complexity and fun factor of such a skill is years beyond our current EverQuest.  Like I said earlier, something like that would carry a &quot;coolness&quot; factor that all other classes would, righteously so, cry out about.  It's easy to say screw them, we are weak and deserve a bump up... that may be true, but this is not necessarily just a bump up, it's a huge new concept that is very, very attractive.  A potion summoning with 5 different focuses like that would basically fit into AA 2.0, and would be the only one of its kind around.  Making one for each other of the classes would take the devs a long time, so it doesn't seem to me like they will look at it unless they wake up outta their hibernation :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">it idea isnt to make us excell at anyrole, even with 50% to dps we will be no where near wizards for nuking and only just as good as a druid is without focus , but with a lot worse healing.<br />
<br />
with the healing focus on 50% we are still way below the cleric in amount we can heal, and only just better than a druid, who can still nuke great, where as our dps is down the drain?<br />
<br />
i think you have been fooled to believe the watered down version that shaman are now are what we where...it is not, for a long time of our lives (level) we heal,dps buff debuff extremely well. it is only for the last 10 levels of our life we begin to stand still and not move with the other classes.<br />
<br />
are you telling me that druid who can dps, heal extremely effectivelt have buff devuff transport spells ds, etc are not execelling at many roles?<br />
<br />
but at the end of the day desipte this being a great idea it comes down to the fact that shaman are way under powered and really we shouldn`t need this idea, least not function.<br />
<br />
but it is an idea that could be used as a balancing tool.<br />
<br />
lit, to be honest i not sure what damage table we are on, but i reasonable sure to 50 there is a standard table all classes are on except monks/beast who are on 1 higher. after that i know there are raise to mellee type  damage tables. where i belive caster stay on the old one. hence the difference in mellee is made even bigger. but i do know that with the same weapon before kunark came out i hit for same highest hit as a war with same weapon and now i dont:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">as a oow aa, who cares about pre god:) it gonna be trival with level 70 anyway.<br />
<br />
He's got a point.<br />
<br />
And Bara, I'm fine with any one of those things being risen 50 percent.  The bottom line is, if they give us ability to raise say, 50 percent in all areas (of our choosing at the time, of course), that would probably stop them from say, raising one of our abilities 75 percent without the AA.  And I'd take the 75 percent.<br />
<br />
Wow, amazing what I can say in one paragraph.  I really should stop being such a windbag lol!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">How would you feel if another class was given an ability that was as dynamic as this?  I'd personally say, hey, they have the coding for it, why not give us something like it?<br />
<br />
How would i feel ? If it was a class that needed it, i would feel great. I would go &quot; good for them, they sucked&quot; like when the BST's sucked and everyone got mad at the attention they got, i said good for them, they need it. It seems to me to be fairly common knowledge to all classes and players that we are hurting right now, i see it on the SK boards i see it on the warriors forums, people know we are hurting and i think the general reaction would be &quot; good for them&quot;, cause we are in need of a role. <br />
<br />
<br />
I think asking them to code something like this is like asking a fish to ride a bicycle... I'd rather them just pick an area and improve upon it to give us our group demand back.<br />
<br />
While i share your dismay about their past track record, at the same time im compeled to not give up hope. Its obvious to me that SoE will not think outside the box, hell its the norm for coders and big bsuiness, so I/we should be willing to do it for them and help the game along. Nothing else will change if we dont i honestly feel. Besides, you never know if you dont ask and it does no damage right ?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

This would make us be able to fulfill ALL roles better, even if we had to choose for every situation, and would most likely be a class balance nightmare in Sony's eyes. <br />
<br />
I disagree and this is why im trying to stress very hard here that there shouldnt be a focus for every abilties we have, just healing and DPS. Not melee DPS, pure spell DPS cause we are casters, not fighters, look to the BST if you want a melee class.<br />
<br />
The ability as i present it does nothing but make use versitile enough to fill a different role effectivly if we are not needed for the other. We are kept out of raids and trials cause we dont have enough DPS or enough healing. With this focus we can change to the situation and become useful again. If a raid has 3 shaman to buff, why do they need anymore right now? This will help us be wanted again IMHO.<br />
<br />
You're basically giving our class the ability to function effectively in ANY role.  This is nifty, but if not given to other classes, is potentially imbalancing IMO, not for one raid (since no matter what we pick, we'll still not be the best at it, just better).  It's the fact you could pick any one you want that is imbalancing.  Each class is supposed to have a main role.  We should get AA's to enhance that.  They should fix what is wrong with that leading game mechanic.<br />
<br />
<br />
Again, im NOT suggesting we fill any role, that was mentioned by someone else in this thread and i debated against it. Im suggesting we have the abilties to fufill 2 roles. Beyond that im asking that we have the abilty to pick a role to fill. Remember, this focus allows you to pick only one of these abilties and it will dimish the other. If you chose to nuke and add DPS, your chosing to lose healing abilties and vise vera, you are not fufilling all roles, you are &quot;  Focusing your Spirit and Channeling it into one ability. Shaman do not have a main role, we do not by design, i dont see why you keep thinking in a one deminsional perspective when addressing this AA for us. Shaman are not like a wizard, we arent like a warrior, we dont have a defined strength and never really have. We are multi talented and this would simply focus us on 1 talent. Really it fits in a roleplaying sense a game mechanics sense and a funplay sense IMHO anyway.<br />
<br />
The reason we act as nukers these days is because our slow is not worth it half the time in current content.  Asking for the ability to enhance the nukes is just a way to ease the pain of a wound that devs have hit us with in the form of mitigating our class defining ability.  They either need to pick a NEW ability to define us by, or make the old one (slow) substantial in later content.  <br />
<br />
This sounds nice in theory, but if you look at the direction EQ is moving and how its affecting us, i think you wills ee that making slow better is probably not in the cards and taking another abilty and making it our own would change who the shaman is and probably step ont he toes of some other class. I admit this might step on toes also, but FFS bro, has not our toes been step on tot he point of cut off? I see no problem with stpeing back just a lil to establish a desired role in the game.<br />
<br />
Let's say they DID put in an AA that allows us to buff any of our abilities by choice every so often.  What, then, would be the developers' motivation to balance any one area of our skills?  Because if they made us good at nuking, the nuke choice AA would now make us &quot;overpowered.&quot;  If they made us better at healing, the healing AA would make us &quot;overpowered.&quot; <br />
<br />
I simply disagree. The reason boosting our DPS is overpowering currently is cause of our other abilties, its not the DPS increase that makes it a issue, its the total package of what the shaman will become that will be the issue. Again, this is trading off abilties to suite the situation. I cant help that shaman were designed well for this idea, i cant help that a warrior cant solo anymore, its simply the way classes are. Some will turn out more powerful situationaly then others. I mean we sure cant tank like a warrior you know?  Again, just looking for utility for my groups.<br />
<br />
Implementing this AA would lock us into the state we are at now.  Ability to cast Pet, Nukes, DD's, and Slows that pale in comparison to those casted by other classes (with the exception of slow, although that is mitigated later on and can be brought by a BST or ENC to a much closer to max game efficiency to turgur's than our heal is to CH, for example)<br />
<br />
<br />
I think it would not lock us into this situation, but would simply move past what cant be changed and bring us into a new level of versatility.<br />
<br />
And don't take any of this personally or anything, hehe... I just feel like this would take away slightly from the whole One Voice thread that asked Sony to improve one of our abilities from a list.<br />
<br />
None taken, i understand your concerns, i hope i helped you understand my points a lil better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Ya, it does sound a lot better now that you've cleared up a few doubts of mine.  First quote by quote reply I've seen in awhile that wasn't all angry counterflames, lol.  I appreciate the intelligent debate.<br />
<br />
I suppose I might support the idea, given it didn't restrict us in the future.  Also, they could probably just give us two abilities, one for nukes and one for heals, that could be on the same timer, and it wouldn't be too hard to code.<br />
<br />
I'm also trying to step out of the box here and not only view what is right for our class, but how I think Sony would look at it.  They've got people paying money for the game that play all types of classes, and I think if they all got angry, SoE wouldn't be too happy.  Then again, I get angry when I duo with a Beastlord and he's pulling with a slow that is barely worth overwriting, pumping out crazy DPS, keeping his incredible pet at full health, and relying on me for a Heal once and awhile...  but Sony hasn't stripped those abilities yet.<br />
<br />
I suppose I was indeed shocked by how the idea was presented, and I sort of tend to roll my eyes everytime I see one of those &quot;dreamer&quot; posts.  I suppose what it comes down to is that I believe that we should all focus our complaints and suggestions into one unified area.  Otherwise, they might think that now that we've gotten their attention, we figure &quot;HEY EVERYONE, IT'S CHRISTMAS!&quot; and start asking for a ton of stuff.<br />
<br />
I'll have to assume that they are smart enough to separate the &quot;Triple our nuke damage and cut all our casting times in half&quot; posts from those that are more reasonable and effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>jeyche Deychundei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">I dont think we've asked for anything unreasonable here, i can see why litgruv wants 3 aspects rather than all 5, as it would hve more chance of being implmented that way... <br />
I still feel we deserve all 5 as being one of the top 4 shaman in my guild its visually apparent that each of the top shaman have different play styles, One likes to heal, One likes to melee, one thinks hes a wizard with his poison and cold nukes... and i like to DoT. This just seems too perfect (WRT all 5) for us.<br />
<br />
I have had Mages, enchanters, druids, rangers, warriors and beastlords all look at this thread and give me their oppinons, Each one without fail said<br />
<br />
&quot;that is such a cool AA ability, it would be awsome if yu get it... yu guys need something like that&quot;<br />
<br />
i say stick with all 5, but have them buy able per every other lvl starting with healing then dots and ending with melee... if they like it they'll whittle it down anyways.<br />
<br />
And is 30% - 35% (gotta be a range) boost in the chosen area fair and not over powered or should we try a lesser number?</div></div><hr />
