<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i maxed my faction with chadok this week, and so am not far from getting the second ring- however i have hit a snall snagg.<br />
<br />
On thursday i saw the shady gob in ww with my druid, but dint have time to take shamsn there, i chked the mob on thurdasy night, and its had gone.   I have chked 5 times since then and nothing there, i have even gone back to sarnak soy and repeated the words to try get gobby to spawn.<br />
<br />
can anyone help me on this?   Should i just wait for a patch day?<br />
<br />
lol if the shady is hard to get what will the angry ob be like :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Skek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shady goblin is on a 24hr spawn time, +/- a few %, despawns on turn in. Just gotta be lucky in passing or camp it....<br />
Angry is a 3 day spawn, also despawns on turn in, i got lucky and got mine on patch days, both spawn with server up.<br />
Good luck on the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">when a server comes back up after a patch will the shady spawn 24hrs afterwards??  or does it pop up immediatelt, or is it random 1 to 24 horus from server coming back up ????<br />
<br />
I am having REAL problems finding this mob up.   Its getting really frustrating:  i am starting to wonder if u have to trigger it from the sarnak spy bit, then it pops 24 hrs later in ww?<br />
<br />
I cant believe i am soo unlucky as to find i have been beaten to it every day for the last 5 days!!<br />
<br />
/cry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Batuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">He is up as soon as server is up.  Be camped there because I promise that other people are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">WOOOOOOOOT got it!!<br />
<br />

<br />
paked me druid there to track for it<br />
<br />
hard bit is getting a grp into droga before angry gets KS by someone else!    /bonkk verant<br />
<br />
<br />
YAY nailed Skargus today!  Angry was actually up for 90mins before i got to im&gt;&gt; folks are turning into slackers on my serveri guess! (had druid camped right beside spwn spot)<br />
LOL had 2 lvl 60 tanks come to help me, but they got torn up by a certain leeezard poping in DL!<br />
<br />
Fight was over so fast i was embarased for making any fuss over it; although the tanks well equiped.<br />
<br />
