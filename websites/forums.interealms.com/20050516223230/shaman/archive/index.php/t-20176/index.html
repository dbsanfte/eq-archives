After Turtle admitted of dropping his main in favor of another class, because shaman number 4 or 5 is basically USELESS for a guild raid and can NOT contribute sufficient healing or dps (paraphrasing a bit, but that's the core), his point that shaman are not in need of some immediate tweaking needs no further arguing. Actions speak louder than words.<br />
<br />
I rather discuss with some people here, that may disagree but stay with their arguments and toon.<br />
<br />
A small point to add - maybe your posts with the information were too long? I would have tried to focus on the central piece of data (shaman get hosed, while druids/clerics get significant updates). Your basic point would have come across a bit better then. Just my 2cp  :) .</div></div><hr />

Were still a strong class.. not as strong as we once were so what but were hardly crippled... you wanna quit your shaman becuase your not getting enough upgrades fine.  Do I think we need more of a healing upgrade yes, will we ever get it, maybe not. But im sure the devs have thier reasons.  If they ever did come and say exactly why we got such a small / non-exsistant upgrade, someone would throw it back in thier face anyways... whiners are always good at doing that.<br />
<br />
The GoD trials keep getting mentioned, here and other crucible rants, and they are MENT to be hard... I have had my cleric die on those unslowable golems and I the only other healer kept the tank alive.. and were not talking about a high end tank, hes a HoT, Ornate, type tank who I have as much AC as...

If you don't like it don't read it.  No offense meant to you, but your missing nearly the entire point from what I read in your post.<br />
<br />
Plus, you are not talking about the same trials everyone else is talking about.  Your alt woulda been pasted into the stone age doing the trials we're talking about, not to mention you wouldn't have a chance keeping someone like that up for more than 4 seconds yourself.</div></div><hr />

Good luck in Ikkinz (a zone you have to pass (for progression) in one way or another) healing your tank.<br />
What I relly don't get is why they keep making slow imune mobs, why cant they simply let them mitigate 4-5% and make me at least feel i made a little difference.<br />
<br />
As it is now I am not an asset to a group but something they drag along because I happen to be the Groupleader and they hope they can pass even with me around.</div></div><hr />

Im refering to the purifying plant the 1250 unslowable hitters, not the trials 5-7 where they hit a lot harder no.  Ill admit it took us 4 tries to get though, mainly from bad pulls and learning the zone, and have only looked in trial 2 to know its prolly easier as long as you have an evacer.  Obviously GoD progression is not top on my list from the ammount of time Ive put into it, were very close to EP...<br />
<br />
and no I prolly shouldntve read it and posted my opinion, is that what your hopeing everyone will do?</div></div><hr />

Ignores the player base?  That is in no way true.  We consider and make changes based on feedback from the community all the time the most recent of which are the tradeskill UI changes.  There are many more examples that long time players can point out as well, like NPC's that bind and more transportation options.  Please do not assume that, as we did not implement the changes you think are best, we are ignoring the community. <br />

For f u c k sake he didn't address the question.  Are they doing something about this or not?<br />
<br />
All of those changes he listed were the result of someone on the eqlive team giving a **** about those problems.  We HAVE no idea if anyone on the team even cares about shaman, and have evidence that they are ACTIVELY malicious in their intent and actions.<br />
<br />
You have gained a point in contempt for eqlive! (132)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Most of the shaman in my guild are still not flagged for koda'taz.   I have no ability to raid with my guild any more and that pretty much kills the whole purpose of playing. I barely log on anymore except for Time and on weekends, where I know I will have the 10+ hours needed to scrape together 6 ppl willing to help with tipt (who have all done it a dozen times) and attempt it yet again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Wow..an actual response from Brenlo now.  I'm not happy about what he says (glad i have quit my shaman for a beastlord but i digress).<br />
<br />
You list some issues which are being worked on and should be fixed soon.  I have posted that secondary forte should not be granting 200 to your secondary spec.  I will find out about the pet call AA and call of the ancients and let you know.<br />
 <br />
As far as what shaman want, I read the huge thread on the old Newbie Zone, as did others on the team and there were no conclusions.  I also read many of the threads on the Shamans Crucible.  What I saw was a lot of ,the grass is greener, and class envy.  One email, from a prominent shaman even stated, we don't know what we want, we just want something.  That's not much information to go on.<br />
 <br />
Even here in this thread, I see division among shaman players, where what some perceive to be broken, others think is just fine.  You ask for statements and communication, while it is hard to comment when the message you are receiving is not unified and for the record the &quot;What's a shaman&quot; comment was meant as a joke. <br />
<br />
As I stated when I started this position, I will listen, but that does not mean your ideas will be implemented.  It may be that nothing is changed with shaman in the near future but if you provide a comprehensive list of what exactly shaman think does not work, I will pass it along.<br />
 <br />
I have been listening and will continue to do so.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have to give props to Chutoi and Grizlor and others posting there for keeping calm. <br />
I haven't been able to make a well thought out post without cursing in a long time due to the frustrations when seeing clueless idiots arguing we are fine(there's like 3 or 4 names that should be put in here, but I am sick of starting a pointless arguments with you morons and you know who you are anyway) and then quitting a few weeks later for the flaws we have been pointing out.<br />
<br />
I will refrain from posting on TNZ, here or on any board where a developer or Brenlo have posted, because I simply would not be able to hold back my emotions and just tell them how ****ing stupid they are. If I was so imcompetent in my own job, I would have quit it long ago. My rage would just be detrimental to the community and the class, so there will be no post from me on this issue anymore. <br />
<br />
After all it looks like every effort is a waste anyway. Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I can kind of see Brenlo's point. When we ask for better dots we compare ours to Necro's. When we ask for better heals we compare ours to Druids. We compare our pets to SK's or the Chanter illusions etc etc. Unforunately thats the only way we can define whats wrong with us. The thing that really kills us is we are so diverse a class that everyone plays a shaman for a different reason, and therefore wants different things, hence no unity when it comes to what we need. We have no class defining ability/skill that sets us apart from anyone else.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Could we please stop warming up and repeating that old 'What's a shaman?'-incident?<br />
<br />
I can fully understand, that some shaman are upset about Brenlos 'not so wise' comment, but the continuuos revival of the same old negativity won't get us any further.<br />
<br />
Before the flaming starts, no i am not content with his answer to the topic and would wish for a more detailed summary of SoEs 'shaman view' and if they think, we are OK or not.<br />
<br />
What's worrying me a bit in the discussion is the current trend to label the current issues as &quot;GoD issues&quot;.  :confused: Of course the problems became clearly visible during GoD-encounters and are most troubling there, that doesn't mean they are GoD-specific or didn't exist pre-GoD.<br />
<br />
The problem is a GAMEWIDE problem with every fast paced, reasonable hard hitting encounter. Insufficient healing power, slow damage output, marginalized buff effects and slow mitigation will cause problems everywhere in that type of content (regardless if it's labelled GoD or not ;)).<br />
<br />
Our only plus in the past was, that this type of content was rather rare (hard LDoN, higher PoP - that's about it mostly). But i fear it will get more and more common in the future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Actually his comment about the fact that the cap is not 200 on sec forte is a classic pitfall.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Yes, Glori, I too am getting really tired of hearing the rote 'class envy' dismissal - both from developers and other players. Class comparison is how we chose the classes we all play. Class comparison is how we choose the people we need in our group. Class comparison is how we choose the people we need on our raid. Class comparison is a basic and major factor of the game design - you could almost say the major factor.<br />
<br />
And when you look at the class structures, you have priests, melees, robes, and hybrids. The priests are the healers, and we cant heal anymore. Dont tell me I'm suffering from 'class envy' because I can see that a paladin - a hybrid - is nearly equal to me as a healer. That's not envy, it's balance (or lack thereof, more specifically). <br />
<br />
Unlike the majority of voices here, I am not satisfied to be '75% as good' as a druid, as some have suggested. I dont need to be as good as a cleric, obviously, but there's no logical reason anymore for druids to have such an advantage over shamans when we are both priests. So what I have slow - that helps everybody in the group/raid. And why are only shamans being penalized for slow, when at least 4 other classes have it? So what I have cannibalize - druids and clerics have passive mana regen buffs, and any like-equipped and AA'ed druid or cleric can nearly equal my mana regen these days and not have to spend time casting a spell to do it. People who play other classes, throwing out these same old excuses (which did in fact have merit long ago during Kunark and Velious) need to catch up and listen to the people who actually play this class instead of speaking from ignorance.<br />
<br />
And those of you who say 'quit whining and reroll/quit playing/play another class/etc', you're cordially invited to go hump a rock. Some of us have played our characters since the beginning or nearly so, and are quite attached to them. Maybe you would reroll on a whim when you find something you dont like about a class, but that doesnt mean we are like you. We also enjoy our characters, in spite of the things we may see wrong so we will speak up if we think something could or should be improved.</div></div><hr />
