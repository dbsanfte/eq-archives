<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have seen the quests for those with Katta faction (Shield of Bane Warding, the EB amulet, some cloak and even the earring of veracity which is based in seru but need katta faction), but are there any decent quests for those of use on Seru faction?<br />
<br />
I havent heard of any decent ones based in Seru which seems a bit harsh of VI imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm not positive, but I remember reading that as an 'evil' race, you'll never be able to get seru faction.. I could be wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Evil races start out non-KOS in seru and KOS to katta.  I have maxxed my faction with Seru, Eye of Seru, Hand of Seru, Coterie of the Eternal Night and Hand Legionnairies</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Evil races start out non-KOS in seru and KOS to katta.<br />
<br />
That's too broad a blanket statement to be true.<br />
<br />
Oger Shaman (Rallos Zek, of course) is Dubious in Katta, Scowling in Sanctus Seru. <br />
<br />
I know that Dark Elves and Iksar are KOS in Katta, I believe that the are KOS as well in Sanctus Seru.  Dunno if it's both Innoruk and Cazic Thule worshippers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">bah - we know ogres are only pretend evil :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">so depending on which faction you want, you can raise either??<br />
<br />
so the EB item quest in Katta is doable by an Inny Troll???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Iscadia Starhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you're of high enough level, the best way I've found to get faction with Seru is to go into Mons Letalis and kill thought leeches (which you need to do for the Shield of Bane Warding).  Each kill gives you a whole batch of positive faction hits for there.  I'd never been MS before but just happened to stumble into the city after a week in ML and everyone practically loved me.  :)<br />
