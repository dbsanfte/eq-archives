<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arkus</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What and Why <br />
Well yesterday I decided to parse a few different weapons in hopes of finding out a few things such as:<br />
<br />
  --  How much extra damage does Avatar give you?<br />
  --  How do 2-Handers compare to Dual Wield?<br />
  --  How much are we hurt by CoP not stacking with WP? <br />
<br />
Results <br />
So I tested differnet weapon componations and came up with the following results which do not include procs, kicks, or damage shield.  It may be important to note that I have Combat Fury 3.  The number in parentheses is what the DPS would have been with 40% haste.<br />
<br />
  --  Earthcaller + Swiftwind  --&gt;  44.9 DPS  <br />
  --  Priceless Hammer + Swiftwind  --&gt;  48.0 DPS<br />
  --  Primal Warsword + Swiftwind  --&gt;  53.3 DPS<br />
  --  Primal Battleaxe  --&gt;  51.9 DPS  (54.2)<br />
  --  Primal Warsword + Priceless Hammer  --&gt;  50.7  (53.0)<br />
<br />
With each test I hit between 63.9% and 65.4% of the time.<br />
<br />
How I tested<br />
The test subjects were Mushrooms in Fungus Grove and I was selff buffed with Warders Protection, Natures Precision, Feet like Cat, Call of Flame (or is it Fire...).  When I did not have Avatar I had Storm Strength up.  I also had cleric buffs and resist disease (to hopefully minimize stuns, slows, etc.).  I also used the cleric to heal and to make sure my Stamina bar did not drop too low.<br />
<br />
I fought about 20 mobs per test and I put everything into individual logs.  The parsing started at &quot;Auto attack is on&quot; and ended at &quot;You have slain...&quot;.  In order to make sure the parsing was as clean as possible and again to minimize the effects of the Shroom spells I dropped the lowest 6 results and the highest 3 results.<br />
<br />
For haste with the 2-Hander I was stuck with a 34% haste cloak.<br />
<br />
I also had some previous tests of Earthcaller + Swiftwind and Primal Warsword + Swiftwind.<br />
<br />
Conclusions<br />
2-Handers are very viable options for those of us without some of the great 1-Handers coming out of Luclin.  With 40% haste my 2-Hander result would have been on par with my best Dual Wield result.  If it were not so un-Rangerly I would probably use the 2-Hander for the good stats, eye candy crits, and low aggro.  However, I am a Ranger and have no desire to use a big, bulky 2-Hander.  In fact, I &lt;i&gt;may&lt;/i&gt; go for Ambidexterity now, just to increase the gap between the 2.<br />
<br />
Avatar added 11% to my damage output.  That is how much more damage the Primal did over the priceless.  Locz, I stand corrected on my initial thoughts on Avatar.<br />
<br />
My prior results from when our buffs did stack were &lt;b&gt;exactly&lt;/b&gt; the same for Epics and for Primal + Swiftwind.  I did not have up anything more than WP and CoP on the older logs.  And apparently using Natures Precision this time around compensated.<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Misc.&lt;/b&gt;<br />
Also in my testing I found some miscellaneous things interesting:<br />
<br />
Double Attack percent ranged from ~35% with the Priceless/SW combo and the Priceless/Primal combo to 44% with the 2-Hander.  Assuming it is 40% that would put Dual Wield at ~80%.  I was sure DA would be higer :(<br />
<br />
With Avatar up 3.5% of my hits were crits.  With no avatar the crit rate was 2.5% .  My Dex without Avatar is around 160 or so.  Agility is 146ish.  This is another item that I thought, and was hoping, would be higher.<br />
<br />
Call of Fire procs were &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; interesting.  With nearly every combonation I was getting 1.7 to 1.8 proc's per minute.  That worked out to a measly 1.5% with the slowest combonation to an amazing 6.5% witht he slow 2-Hander.  What this means is that proc rate &lt;b&gt;is&lt;/b&gt; tied to the delay of the weapon and that Verant spoke the truth when they stated that weapons would proc about the same amount of times per minute regardless of the difference in delay.  I noticed no real difference in procs with or without Avatar, leading me to believe that Dexterity does not impact spell procs.  Tests I did ages and ages ago did show proc rate on weapon effects to be tied to Dexterity, but that information is long gone.<br />
<br />
Thats it, sorry for the lenght of this post.</div></div><hr />

1) you shold parse primal+priceless.. I think you will be pleasantly supprised. why? because it shows how much our epics owns.<br />
2) If you pick a mob with better ac I think you will find duel wield pulls ahead. It fact it tends to cream 2 handed on mobs with silly levels of avoidance. <br />
3) also, shrooms minimize the pay off from avatar when you fight them buffed. what do I mean? well shrooms lvl etc makes them easy to hit/damage with unbuffed levels of attack. The harder mobs you need more attack achieve similiar damage levels. In my parses, I have noticed that you will see a bigger &quot;pay off&quot; from having avatar when you fight shrooms unbuffed )</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would use a two hander if the dps were more, but begrudgedly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Locz</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So Avatar (133 ATK) increased your dps by:<br />
(53.3-48)/48 * 100% = 11.04%<br />
<br />
Your data thus indicates the effect of non-STR ATK was:<br />
11.04%/133 ATK = 0.083%/ATK<br />
<br />
I parsed a 250 variation in ATK, at constant ATR, on pre-nerf FG shrooms and got: 0.106%/ATK.  This study was published on the Glade a few weeks before the wipe.<br />
<br />
Arkus, did you exclude fights when you were slowed from the dataset to prevent &quot;skewing&quot;?<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, these two datasets are in rather good agreement.<br />
<br />
+++++<br />
I also have a comparison or a primal axe vs. priceless warsword + SW, at maxed haste (target was juggs and Seb shrooms).  I will publish this tonight when I get home, if I get the chance.  In gist though, the primal axe was about equal to the priceless + SW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arkus</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I realize that Shrooms are not the best to use due to the spells they cast and other reasons.  But what makes them decent subjects is the fact they they don't move, their level/hp is consistent, and there are pleny of them to fight without distractions.<br />
<br />
To minimize the effects of the stun I dropped the worst results.  Any time I parse I usually drop an equal amount of best and worst DPS figures.  For this I dropped a few extra low scores.  So after 20 fights I would wind up with 14 logs to parse after dropping the highest 3 and the lowest 6.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I might be the only ranger here who would rather use a 2hander. I don't, because I need swiftwind, but from my earliest incarnation, all I've ever wanted is a exceptionally cool 2-handed axe. I'm a Woodsman, damnit, give me axes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Locz</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Arkus, dropping the lows and highs was essentially what I did too with the datasets before averaging them all up.<br />
<br />
Good work.  I think the difference in our results was that I was working from a 1250 to 1500 range, while you were probably working from about a 1360 to 1490 range in ATK.<br />
<br />
I did not investigate whether dps per ATk was linear over that range.  In fact, I assume it is non-linear, with a declining return as ATK increases.  If you were working at a higher ATK starting point before Avatar, as I suspect you probably were, you would thus see less of an ATK benefit than I did.<br />
<br />
If you combine your dataset with mine (&quot;meta-analysis&quot;), since we both had the same target MOB, this would suggest that raising ATK would give these responses over these approximate ranges:<br />
1250-1375  range: dps increases by 0.135%/ATK<br />
1375-1500  range: dps increases by about 0.083%/ATK<br />
average: 1250-1500  range:  dps increases by about 0.105%/ATK<br />
<br />
It would be interesting to test this.</div></div><hr />

If that's the case, it kind of ruins the data set.  A suggestion that I would offer if you want to test against xp lvl mobs, is go pick on the bodyguards in EW.  I've used them in the past for DPS tests as they always spawn as the same lvl, same hps, same buff (daring from Berradin), etc.  Might end up with more accurate results.<br />
<br />
And I think you'll find that the results are a little different if you get a 40% haste item other than Swift.  The primal 2hs is actually better than warsword/swift from all testing I've done, and heard of.  Perhaps with Ambi that shifts back to make dual wielding better, or with proccing weaps like Salindrite or Bonechiller etc.  But with the weaps you listed, Battle axe or claidhmore would be the top dog for dmg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aralys</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 09:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good info Arkus.  If you get a chance please try those combos on a higher ac target. I believe we'll see that, in fact, the 2 hander will do better - opposite of what one poster put here.  Especially on mobs so high your offhand is hitting for lots of 1's.  <br />
<br />
The numbers make good sense though... not only would the 2 hander be slightly ahead of the primal/SW with equal haste, you also lose the attack of Swiftwind.  I know on shrooms moving from 1300's to 1400s had me hitting noticeably higher, so their mitigation is high enough that the increased attack still has good returns.   Due to the lost attack, I would say a two hander will do even better in situations where you reach the point of diminishing returns as regards attack.  In a nutshell, two handers take better advantage of the high attack effect than dual wield due to the wider range of possible hits. <br />
<br />
Did you record how many ripostes you had with the 2 hander? Curious what double riposte aa would add with that setup.  I had a pitifully low number of ripostes using dual wield setups. <br />

<br />
He just wanted to see the difference between different combinations, it will still show that as long as each test is about the same and the results are averaged out over a lot of tests.<br />
<br />
The slows and stuns would make a difference if he wanted to see the absolute max damage with each combination.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In a nutshell, the Primal Priceless combo performed admirable with 34% haste, and and would been almost equal to Primal + Swiftwind had haste been equal.  As many of you have pointed out the AC on Shrooms is not that high, which is why the extra 40 attack from Swiftwind did not seem to matter all that much for these fights.<br />
<br />
As I mention above, the results of Call of Fire proc rates were very interesting.  Basically I was getting 1.7 to 1.8 proc's per minute regardless of Dexterity or weapon(s).  So proc rate of our spell proc &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; tied to the weapon delay and not to Dexterity.</div></div><hr />

If you pick a mob with better ac I think you will find duel wield pulls ahead. It fact it tends to cream 2 handed on mobs with silly levels of avoidance. <br />
<br />
<br />
That's an excellent point for this thread, and it's exactly the reason why I have never used a 2hs/2hb for any significant length of time. Dual wield = more hits per second on average. If something has a higher avoidance rate, your low delay on the two 1-handers should more than make up for the hits lost with a 2-hander. Otherwise you may be wasting swings. In the time it takes you to recover from 3 misses in a row with a 2h, you could've missed the same 3 times in a row with your dual 1h's and come back swinging for more hits.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see if the same parse results would hold up on something that's much harder to hit (higher ac, red con, etc). I've never really trusted 2-handers for that very reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arkus</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Misses due to a higer AC make &lt;b&gt;no&lt;/b&gt; difference at all.  If you are going to miss 55% of the time then you will miss 55% of the time with 2 weapons or with 1.  The only thing that comes into play with high AC mobs is minimum damage.<br />
<br />
There are those that think 2 weapons are better for high AC mobs because you will get your damage bonus applied more times.  But other say that the damage bonus is so high for 2-Handers that it more than offsets quicker dual wield weapons.  That point has been made here in this thread and many others.<br />
<br />
For example, I can get 2 1/2 swings in with a Primal and if its minimum damage then I will do 2.5 * 12 or 30 damge.  Add 2.5 for the offhand hits and thats 32.5 damage.  Well one swing with the 2-Hander would be 38 damage.  <br />
<br />
Now, if it was a Revultant Whip then we would see ~39 damage from DW vs. the 38 from the Primal Battleaxe.  However, I severly doubt I will use that whip ever again.</div></div><hr />
