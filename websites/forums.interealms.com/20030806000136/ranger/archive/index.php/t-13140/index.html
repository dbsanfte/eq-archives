<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brannuer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Going up to Hate for the first time in a couple of weeks with guild group(s), and was wondering about a couple of things...<br />
<br />
First:<br />
How does the addition of the DeathRot knight change things aggro-wise in Hate now? I've heard several people say that they had him aggro to the breakin point, but I'm not sure if this is jus bad luck or what.  Does anyone know where he actually spawns?<br />
<br />
Second:<br />
It's been posted we will do a North wall break to the safe spot, sine there are fewer roaming mobs that way, even though it takes longer. My understanding is that we will run North from the portal on the wall all the way around, basically doing a big upside down U to get to the safe spot. Is this what the North wall break means?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mizar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My guild made her first hate with her own forces last monday.<br />
We followed the path Nord doing your upsite U (=P). I was in the first group and we aggroed nothing...secondo group the same but the third got aggroed and their corpse had to be retrieved.<br />
<br />
We had a wipeout when, apparently from nowhere, a huge train with the deathrot knight at his head arrived...fortunately a cleric managed to camp =P<br />
perhaps we had fought a mob too high on the wall...<br />
<br />
hope this helps<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lanearas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Deathrot Knight does have wierd agro, but has never been a problem for break-ins (so far at least)  We always just do the break right there in the port in room rather than trying to run to one of the old 'safe spots' .  IMO it's more dificult to do the break that way, given the greater odds for getting unwanted agro, and having to deal with a potential train when you're unprepared and spread out while moving.  Getting everyone to the port in room and just starting pulls there gives you clear control of the break right from the start.</div></div><hr />
