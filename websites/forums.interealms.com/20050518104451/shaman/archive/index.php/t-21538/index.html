<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi folks,<br />
<br />
it happened to me last night that I casted Malosinia on Magmaton after another Shaman had done Malos. The mob was tanked for like 8-10 seconds, and I did nothing else except casting Maolisia. What happened is, that Magmaton ignored all melee hitting him, and came straight forward to me and killed me. I never have expirienced that the Malos line has an aggro like this. Another shaman of my guild told me he got constant aggro in a PoE group casting Malos.<br />
<br />
Anyone else experiencing this? Or am I just paranoid?<br />

Sounds like one of your tanks was asleep.  The malo line is almost 0 aggro.  The first shaman to debuff him may have gotten rampaged and died, then you were next and got rampaged to low health and the aggro brought him to you.  Never do anything to Magmaton until you see the RT bow him and the MT engage him.  On rampaging mobs I usually wait until a couple melees move in so I'm still covered if the RT was asleep.</div></div><hr />

I was getting some weird aggro in Sol Ro last night.<br />
It seemed to be Malos related, but things were happening so fast (exp group) I couldn't pin it down for sure.  I chalked it up to the Paladin conserving mana or being lazy.  I wasn't using malosinia at all.  Malos on inc (enchanter I believe was tashing on inc as well) would get me hit alot more than in the past.  I'll keep watching this, but I really don't think anything has changed.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

Ok ... 2 things:<br />
First, it was not rampage. The mob was tanked for a few seconds, malos was casted on inc by another shaman (who died too, but maybe due to rampage). Mob ignored all melee around and ran up to me.<br />
Second, this never happened before yesterday, but I had not played for like 3 days before that. It really looked to me like an aggro change.<br />
<br />
Edit: I have never before pulled aggro with Malosinia from a tanked mob. Even if taunt fails or no proc, Maloxxx-line was so low aggro I could cast it right away after melee got on the mob. So I am just curious if it happened to others too. Will run a few tests tonight.<br />

I was getting clobbered for simply casting malos.  This spell use to have an aggro cost of 1, but now...who the heck knows...it seems to me that it was aggroing as much if not more than turgurs...<br />
<br />
I was unofficially the tank in PoE the other day.  An sk had a hard time taking aggro away from me after I casted malos, turgurs, and bane....<br />
<br />
Aggro is fubarred!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
More than likely you casting Bane and Turgur's gave you aggro more than Malos.  If you're also casting DDs with that, you will steal aggro away from an SK easily.  When I exp in groups I use Bane and Pox pants clicky and just canni until the mob gets to under 30% health, then I cast Velium Strike.  I can still steal aggro if I crit with Crit Aff 3 all while just cannying.  DoT aggro is broken and has been for years.<br />
<br />
There's nothing wrong with Malos.  Two days ago we did Quarm and on inc I malos him and chain malosinia until it lands, then I slow.  I never once stole aggro from the tank the whole time and I do play aggressively.</div></div><hr />

If your tank isn't an ogre, there's a good chance he got stunned shortly after engaging and that helped the events unfold like they did.  Someone near you could have gotten direct aggro and it ran toward them.  Do you have HoTT or did you assist Magmaton to see who had direct aggro?  If he came and kill that person (being one-rounded by him isn't uncommon) then you got proximity aggro since he was away from the tank and melees.  Or he was near you and rampaged you, since he rampages every round.<br />
<br />
This just sounds like unfavorable circumstances lining up in just the right way.  I don't think it's a problem with malosinia or malos.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aye, I'd agree with that. Did a hard LDON adventure yesterday, Malosed the inc mob before the paladin touched it with blade or spell, and was completely ignored. Cast Turgur's a touch too early, and the mob came right for me before the paladin stunned it again and pulled it back to him. <br />

It wouldn't be surprised if the aggro code has parts in it that cause the MOB to randomly switch aggro once in a blue moon.</div></div><hr />

THIS THREAD IS ABOUT HOW MALOS AGGRO HAS CHANGED!!!!<br />
<br />
He's an idiot because he points out you cast 2 known high aggro spells in addition to malos and got aggro? Yeah it must be that malos is now the highest aggro spell in the game not that bane and slow are high aggro spells which every one and thier mothers already know.<br />
<br />
Nitrox as far as magmaton goes I find raids to be a very poor spot to look at that kinda thing. Especially with rampaging mobs. There are just too many people and too many things going on to tell exactly whats happening. I've seen people get on rampage for just standing in the wrong spot before.<br />
<br />
My personal experience doing Ikinz trial three last night was malos was very low aggro like it always has been. I'd malos mobs on inc or often times to even pull off the monk and the warrior had no trouble grabbing aggro on the mob and I almost never got hit. I saw nothing to indicate that the aggro on malos was changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Malos doesnt have any aggro but from what I have seen malosinia does have aggro on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, I did some tests tonight with my bot ranger and me casting maloxxx on inc .. normal aggro stuff (aka once ranger was on the mob I didnt draw aggro at all). Main difference is that the Malosinia on Magmaton was resisted /shrug.<br />
Maybe I am just paranoid. But that's why I asked the shaman community.<br />

Interesting about the resist changes, I didn't notice they coincided. I don't know whether or not Malos/-sinia use in LDON hard adventures are worth anything to this discussion, but I'm willing to keep an eye on it for a couple of days.<br />

Malos agro hasn't changed, its just funny at times.  I've gone months without any agro from malos, then several days in a row of pulling agro off some of our best agroers.  and yes, I know all about tanks agroing first, bow'ing, etc and I still would pull agro at those times.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think its just flaky issues every once in a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Just weird bugs, cant really explain that. Happened to me sometimes to aggro with malos for no good reasons. Happened to many friends as well. Only thing you can do is to manage your aggro the most effectively (range, no spell tag on inc, no sit, etc... regular job), and pray to stay unoticed by mobs. Whatever when that happen on trash, i just run away few feets, and the mob forget me, without following me.<br />
<br />
There is one thing that need to be looking for : 'casting' aggro. Whatever spell you are casting, you gain an 'aggro bonus', not negligeable if you are next to the mob, and your tank lag / hasnt proc any ****s / chain miss (actually that is not that rare). Just like sitting in fact, but with less hate generation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Xabaras Soulsreaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Malos has about zero aggro, malosinia a lil more but not so much to justify the lose of aggro on MT.

The only way i get aggro casting malos-sinia is when fighting Time Gods (if i cast too soon).</div></div><hr />

THIS THREAD IS ABOUT HOW MALOS AGGRO HAS CHANGED!!!!<br />
<br />
The fact is malos aggro hasn't changed.  You just don't understand how aggro works and that is evident from your &quot;unofficial tanking episode.&quot;  Did you bother to switch your DoTs to other ones or stop casting DoTs at all to test your &quot;theory?&quot;  Or did you just continue to cast malos, slow and bane and think to yourself &quot;My, malos must have gotten an aggro boost!  That's why I'm getting summoned!&quot;<br />
<br />
Yesterday my guild was in Ikkinz and Uqua.  I cast malos on everything there, yet I never seemed to draw unwanted aggro.  Several times a tank bowed an incoming mob just before I cast malos on it and I didn't get aggro even before it got to the raid.  I cast malos on mobs that were being pulled and I only got aggro if the monk FDed and no tanks tagged it.<br />
<br />
When you ask for help, it's probably best not to deride people who offer it just because they say something that you don't want to hear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">After cleaning three BOT towers, doing four hard LDON's and two normals, I can verifiably say that no, Malos agro has not changed. Nothing other than the usual flaky pull every once in awhile ... tonight I took agro with Malos a grand total of three times. Two were in the normal adventures, one was in a hard ... which doesn't seem to me to be anything different than normal. <br />

What happened is, that Magmaton ignored all melee hitting him, and came straight forward to me and killed me. I never have expirienced that the Malos line has an aggro like this.

I saw someone post that maybe someone else got aggro and you were just in the bad spot at a bad time when Magmaton went after the evil aggroer.  That sounds plausable cause its happened to me on innocent lil spells like malos.  Sounds like you getting eaten on the raid was just a bad luck thing hon.<br />
<br />
As for PoE, i group there a lot I LOVE that place.  I dont get aggro from malos/sinia if the mob has been engaged in anyway by the tank (like tagged), but i have found that split second for malos to land right as the puller FDs and right before the tank tags, then i get aggro and eaten.  I think with a low aggro spell like malos its mostly a matter of bad timing when aggro happens like; that momentary lapse in tank aggro, tank getting stunned, funky bug, or someone else aggroing and you being in the mobs Line of sight.  I dont think its a malos thing, i think its just bad luck and timing.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, maybe read again what I posted in my 3rd post. My name appeared in 'target's target' window, which means I was at top of the aggro list (no, Landragoran, it was not rampage). I agree that it might just have been bad luck .. and since this incident Maloxxx worked the usual way.<br />

When you assist a mob you can get the rampage target if you do it while it just as the rampage starts.  It's tricky timing and not easy to get them (if you are trying too that is cuz it's to late if you see the msg), but i've done it a few times over the past few years, through coincidence.  Of course, being a backup healer, healing the rampage target and then double /as again was actually useful :)<br />

Yet, I get summoned and beat down pretty good. <br />

I never have till this day got aggro from malos or malo or malosinia. The only way i can get it is if i cast it too fast and get too high on the hate list, but thats not exactly pulling aggro, thats being a rampage tank :p<br />

<br />
The Malx line of spells was definitely modified in some way recently.  <br />
Whether those changes affect aggro or not is unknown, despite anecdotal evidence from various people.  I personally don't think Malos aggro has changed, but no reason to be obnoxious about someone asking questions.  The unknown values that went from ZERO to a rather large number (and one went way negative) probably means something, we just have to figure out exactly what that is. ;) <br />
<br />
Let's work together and try to solve this instead of bickering back &amp; forth. :) <br />

Why don't you try some controlled test like the original poster did. He concluded that it was just something wierd happening when he tested it. Personally between raiding and single group stuff since this thread was started I have seen nothing in my play to indicate any changes in malos's aggro.<br />

BTW insulting people is not a good debating technique and usually a sign of a poor debater or a weak argument.</div></div><hr />

I can't seem to pull Lucy up, and I can't find any sort of email address or forums for them so that I might cross-post there, and ask those folks about what the changes mean (if they'd even know). Anybody have that information?<br />

Huh? Would you mind explaining that to me? Are you trying to tell us that a moderator enforcing the rules of this privately owned board somehow relates to communism?<br />
<br />
Only one of the best shaman in the game....i deserve some respect, sorry<br />
 :rolleyes: <br />
You deserve exactly the respect you earn own these boards. Even if you are &quot;one of the best shaman in the game&quot; that means nothing when you come to another man's house, or in this case, boards.<br />
<br />
...and what language are you talking about...laugh!  Talk about the real world...laugh!<br />
Oh I see. Everything you hear in the real world is ok to say on a private board, even if moderators tell you to not do it?<br />
<br />
Even if ignoring the rules you agreed to when registering this account were fine you should at least consider respecting the moderators for all the work they pour into these boards. And to think you talk about people not showing you the proper respect . . .</div></div><hr />

I was once rebuffing and hit Fo7 as a couple mobs were inc.  Surprised the hell out of me when they bee-lined for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">there is something that gives you agro from mobs while buffing people while mobs are incoming or whatever.  We were doing a ldon adventure (one of those with death limits) when the monk was ahead trying to split something, and the beastlord in his group cast SD and the monk got hit with it, causing about 10 mobs to agro that wiped us and ended the raid.  Pretty much sucked, but you just have to be careful about these kinds of things.</div></div><hr />

Well yes . . the general assist code. Puller aggros a MOB (or several). You buff him, which adds you to their aggro list. Puller FDs (escapes, dies, etc.) and no matter what he did to aggro those MOBs, you are now highest on the list.<br />
<br />
Now, if the puller does not shed aggro pretty much anything is more hate then a buff (with the exception of hit point buffs) so proximity aggro should outdo buff aggro easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">You'd think murtak hehe.   Not sure, I've seen it happen to me a few times.  Then again.. I've been known for going off in guild over the ****ed up agro i get sometimes from malos.  So badly that there are times that I can't even attempt a slow on a mob being tanked, because malos gave me so much again.<br />
<br />
Then again.. i swear my character is cursed.  Everytime we do some event, at least one mob ends up popping on top of me.  Happened most recently in Uqua a few days ago when trap mob just despawned and respawned on top of me, and then last night in Kod'taz when the Hexxt Chaos dude as part of the summoner event popped and flurried me even before I knew the Grand Pixxt dude was dead.</div></div><hr />

Oh no, whatever will we do without the worlds best shaman on all servers forever!!!<br />

All is lost. The end is near, im going to end it myself so i dont have to suffer without your guiding light oh flowing fountain of knowledge. Please..... Dont lay that masked aggression on us. You might be the BEST SHAMAN EVHAR ! But we arent he stupidist people ever. The &quot;oh i was just trying to help, but since your going to hold me down with your rules ( /rebel on) im outie is really kinda old and played out. If you wanna be &quot;raw&quot; then sack up and dont play games with your anger. Bring it with authority and reason, dont just back out and shrivel up when its brought back to you. Either that or you dont realize what your doing and if thats so, consider this your moment of enlightenment.<br />

<br />
The Malx line of spells was definitely modified in some way recently.  <br />
Whether those changes affect aggro or not is unknown, despite anecdotal evidence from various people.  I personally don't think Malos aggro has changed, but no reason to be obnoxious about someone asking questions.  The unknown values that went from ZERO to a rather large number (and one went way negative) probably means something, we just have to figure out exactly what that is. ;) <br />
<br />
Let's work together and try to solve this instead of bickering back &amp; forth. :) <br />
<br />
Take care,<br />
<br />
<br />
My guess if these changes relate to aggro would be the first line is partically resisted aggro, the second landed aggro and the third resisted. But I've not noticed any aggro issues with the MaloXX line myself</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">I posted the Malo-xxx line numbers on the EQ Live shaman boards, and still have not gotten a response. Does anybody have contact information for Allakhazam's or the Lucy folks? I cannot pull Allakhazam or Lucy up, and haven't been able to for a couple of days. Perhaps they would have some answers, or could point us in the right direction.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Btw, happened today to another shaman in guild on FRo event, on some random non-rampaging mob (one of those 4 nameds that spawn after you cleared the trash). And it happened same as to me before, was a resisted Malosinia, after mob was tanked for like 5-7 seconds.<br />
So, be careful ... I don't bother anymore if I die on raids (happens a lot anyway), but you may wipe a raid when i.e. an AE casting mobs runs straight to you to beat you down and other caster get hit by AE.<br />
<br />
So long<br />
