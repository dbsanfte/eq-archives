<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stormrider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is the easiest way to get to everfrost from nexus? Is there any one who can port me there directly? and if not waht is the cloesest port? Thanks for forthcoming help<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tirwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you take the Nexus to Antonica, you'll run west through North Karana and West Karana before coming through Qeynos Hills. Wizzies can port to WK, but the closest is probably a druid port to Surefall. From Surefall, you'll run through QH to Blackburrow to Everfrost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Magrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Go west in the Nexus, click on the book on the pedestal.  Find the stone that says &quot;Halas&quot; and click on it.  Poof, you're in Everfrost.  :-)<br />

I frippin love the plane of knowledge!</div></div><hr />

A -freaking- men ...PoP is worth every nickle I spent on it; even if I never visit any of the &quot;Ubba&quot; planes, its worth it to be able to zone from nexus to FV in less than 2 min with little running.<br />
It's just broke :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Daeric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Being guildless and free time less I will never see the high end planes, but the travel in PoP makes up for the money I spent just in maximizing the free time I do have. The ability to get from Stonebrunt to Kelethin and back in under 10 minutes makes me weep with joy...</div></div><hr />
