<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Flat Tax program has been fought against by proponents of the current tax system with several cliche'd and old arguments.<br />
<br />
First misconception, Flat Tax system would still have the same overhead as the current tax system so no advantage there.<br />
<br />
Well simply not true.  Currently I read that the IRS is only able to Audit 1 out of every 256 filings.  Research suggests that a flat tax system in which you get rid of ALL deductions so that you only have the current income and the flat tax to figure would increase the Auditing levels to 1 out of every 50.<br />
<br />
Also depending on which Flat Tax system is proposed it is likely that the Tax information required to be turned would fit on a postcard instead of multiple forms.<br />
<br />
Second minsconception: A Flat Tax system would hurt the poor.<br />
<br />
Again not true.  The current tax system is already very harsh on the poor who still have to lose a certain amount of income each year so that it cannot be applied to living expenses then at a later time in the year get back after they had already accrued debt for previous living expenses.<br />
<br />
Secondly as of RIGHT NOW the IRS is MORE likely to Audit poor people and MORE like to actually go after them.  For a nice commentary on this please read this. (http://slate.msn.com/?id=1005162)<br />
<br />
And thirdly former leader of the United Way had this (http://www.heritage.org/news/99/nr042299.html) to say about Flat Taxes and the likelyhood of charitable giving <br />
<br />
Third minsconception: a Flat Tax system wouldn't be able to address the financial needs of the US government.<br />
<br />
Again false because:<br />
A) the Current system already doesn't cover the financial needs of the government due to our government not being able to control its own budget...<br />
B)a Flat Tax can still be adjusted each year as needed.  One year it may be 14% for EVERYONE and the next year it may be 20% for EVERYONE.<br />
<br />
Forth misconception: While certain small countries have used the Flat Tax program successfully they are of such limited size that they are not good examples for what the US needs.<br />
<br />
Well Russia is putting that in its place.  Russia has revamped its tax code and has I believe a 13% Flat Tax rate.  It is now enjoying its highest percentage of claimed taxes and generating more money than any time previously in Russian history.<br />
<br />
Fifth misconception:  A Flat Tax would hurt the economy.<br />
<br />
Again this is false.  First let me present a study (http://news.uns.purdue.edu/UNS/html4ever/010723.Wilson.flattax.html) from an Agricultural Economist on the likely outcomes of a Flat Tax.<br />
<br />
Also Russia has been enjoying a BOOMING economy (which is a complete turn around from just a year ago) and some of the lowest unemployment levels in its history.  Basically this last misconception has been one of the leading arguments against a Flat Tax but Russia is now showing us that in fact it can work wonders for:<br />
A) Citizen earnings<br />
B) Government Earnings <br />
C) National Economic Earnings.<br />
<br />
So now I have to ask.. Isn't about time we too started to enjoy the simplicity of a Flat Tax and truly achieve equal representation through equal taxation.</div></div><hr />

I think some plans called for about a 20% tax average per year and considering most middle class Americans pay I believe in the range of 25% to 35% in taxes.<br />
<br />
Also if you didn't see in one of the Articles interest rates would decline by around I think it said 25% so it would actually be cheaper to finance most loans.</div></div><hr />

Since wealthier people spend a higher percentage of their income on non-essential goods and services, it would naturally impact the poor less than the rich.<br />

<br />
Compare 1999 taxes to what they would have been with a flat tax and see what happens.<br />
<br />
To some extent, I think the biggest problem with instituting a flat tax is the wealthy.  Once you are obscenely rich, you get to be very creative with your tax shelters and all of that would go away under a flat tax system.</div></div><hr />

I made 20k last year.  20 percent of that is 4 grand.  Not all that much really on what I live on.  Whats 20% of 2 million?  $400000!  Thats right.  Sure sounds like alot doesn' t it? hehehe  I hate rich people and at the same time, I OHHH so want to be one! LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smokimon Trailblazer</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guess is that most rich would really PREFER the Flat tax. Read this and tell me what YOU would want:<br />
<br />
(Ref from Niel Boortz 4/9/02 (http://www.boortz.com/april9-02.htm))<br />
<br />
<br />
Here’s the latest.  These statistics are for 1999 and have recently been released by the IRS.<br />
<br />
To be in the top five percent of income earners you need to pull in about $120,846 a year.  The top five percent earns about 34 percent of the income, but they pay 55 percent of all taxes. <br />
<br />
The top one percent of income earners earned about 19 percent of the total earned income in 1999.  To be in this category you have to earn about $293,415 a year.  Though this group earned only 19 percent of the total income, they paid over one-third of the total income taxes.<br />
<br />
Now … moving on to the bottom half.  These are the people who earn less than $26,415 a year.  Even though they comprise one-half of the income earners, and one-half of those presumably eligible to vote, they only pay four percent of the total income taxes.<br />
<br />
<br />
For the record, I am MUCH closer to the Bottom Half than any other group. <br />
<br />
I thought one of the plans presented for a flat tax was based on Sales Tax, not income of any type. That is what I want to see, something like a 15% sales tax on EVERYTHING. I have heard it suggested that the &quot;poor&quot; (below a certain income I do not recall) would be given a &quot;Tax Credit&quot; for the taxes they would pay each year on the &quot;Necessities&quot; of life. Sounds fair to me. It would encourage those without much money to spend less and if you ahd TONS of money and bought TONS of things you would pay a TON of Taxes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aelitan</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I shouldn't reply, really.  I just get frosted when I see people saying &quot;the rich&quot; aren't paying their fair share.  A statistic for you, pulled from the Fox News website, quoting government statistics:<br />
<br />
In 1999, the richest 1 percent of Americans took in 19.5 percent of the income. But they paid 36.2 percent of the taxes. The figures are similar for the top 5 percent, who made 34 percent of the money but paid 55 percent of the taxes. So much for rich people escaping taxes with sneaky loopholes, sleazy accountants and offshore shelters.<br />
<br />
...and...<br />
<br />
In contrast, the bottom half of income earners — that's 50 percent of all taxpayers — bear just 4 percent of the tax burden, while earning 13 percent of the income<br />
<br />
&quot;The rich&quot; certainly pay their taxes.<br />
<br />
I personally would rather go to a flat tax.  But then again, I have no kids and my mortgage payments are low enough where I can't itemize.  I'd be much better off with a flat tax.<br />

<br />
But one step at a time Myrea :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kullaas</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh Please, that argument reeks of trickledown theory.  Hes basically saying that the flat tax will help the economy, which will result in more charity.  Left unsaid is the fact that as a prerequisite for this argument, you need to accept that a flat tax will help the economy, hardly a given.  A logically similar argument would be to say we should not tax corporations because they will give more money to shareholders and employees then, who will spend it and produce more tax revenue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well considering its working in Russia and several other small countries then why wouldn't it work here?<br />
<br />
Was a long time ago when I saw the figures but a poll done to guage American concerns over welfare had a very large number of middle class or higher americans stating that they did not approve of Government Welfare not because they didn't want to see the poor taken care of but because they believed that it was not the responsibilty of the government to do so.  <br />
<br />
Most those people stated they would likely offer up charitable donations if they could have the welfare portions of their taxes back whereas if they continued to be taxed they were less inclined to help the poor because they felt they had been forced to help and in ways that they didn't approve of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aelitan</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Apparently &quot;reeking&quot; of a trickledown theory is a bad thing then?  Hmmm...<br />
<br />
I certainly believe that a flat tax would allow for more economic growth.  You're welcome to your own opinions that disagree.  However, I also believe that motiviation is important.  People who donate because they feel a civic duty are more committed than donations as a tax write-off.  I'm guessing that before Sept 11, donations were WAY down.  People lost lots of money in the market, they didn't need charitable donations to reduce their tax burdens.<br />
<br />
Take away itemized deductions, the capital gains tax, and all the other complex code and you're left with a fair system that makes sure all people pay their fair share.  And charitable donations that people give because they feel it's right (i.e. more likely to continue when they don't &quot;need&quot; to give).<br />

<br />
It was caused by the British economy faltering due to its Imperialist ways falling by the wayside.  Britian at that time was like the US today.  EVERYONE was tied to Britain economy... Britain burped and the world puked...<br />
<br />
The Great Depression was actually an event that occured due to the fact that American Industrialization was overcoming British production power and even before WWII America was poised to become the world leader in economy... This shifting of power scared many investors both British and American and all over the world and that fear coupled with a reaction to withdraw investment away from British companies which in turn led to a bigger world wide panic to devest from ALL companies caused the Great Depression.<br />
<br />
Basically what happened is Britain had bad indegistion and the rest of the world was worshipping the porceline god.</div></div><hr />

In all honesty, the big problem in the U.S. is the runaway spending, and until folks realize that, we're never gonna get our house in order. Since the 80's, our spending has exploded, no better word for it than that. WAY too much money is taken from the citizens, in a misguided attempt at wealth redistribution.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL, that's the truth.  It's pretty sad when politicians scream bloody murder over &quot;cuts&quot; in programs that are really slight reductions in per-year increases.  Government spending NEVER goes down, and if it doesn't increase each year our beloved politicians get upset at the greedy citizens who don't want to give their earnings to the all-wise government.<br />
<br />
Funny that we couldn't &quot;afford&quot; tax cuts... after all, what on earth could Bush have been thinking to give money back to the people who actually earned it?!<br />
<br />
Welcome to America, comrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coryn</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 04:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Um, as I understand it, a flat tax is a set amount that everyone pays, the idea being that the money saved by downsizing the IRS by an order of magnitude, plus the money no longer wasted on services such as H&amp;R Block, would make up the difference.<br />
<br />
What you're describing is a simple scaled tax.. a revision of the tax codes to make them much simpler and straightforward, but it isnt a flat tax.<br />
<br />
I'd support either, really.   Would save me a huuuuge chunk of change, as I'm a single guy who works two fairly well-paying jobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Simas</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 05:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Runaway spending is a problem but it wont stop. Reagan did it, Bush did, and now Dubya is too.<br />
<br />
Cliton got us out of debt for the 1st time in how many years?  But the republicans try to put us so far in debt that when a democratic president takes office, or when democrats win control of congress, and try to implement plans that help someone or do whatever, the republicans can say no we cant afford that, look at this huge defeciet.<br />
<br />
Thats what Reagan did, and Bush is doing it now.<br />
<br />
As for the flat tax im against it, i think the rich should pay more.  They can afford it.  <br />
<br />
An example would be someone like Jay Leno.  He has how many cars? Im not sure but i know its a hell of alot.  How many cars can one person need, its not rhetoical.  Say you need a sports car for being sporty, an econmy car for commuting, a truck for hauling stuff, a van for commuting with a large number of people, and a luxury car for nights out on the town.  Thats 5 cars, and hell you need 2 of each kind in case on breaks and is in the shop. So 10 cars.  NO ONE NEEDS MORE THEN 10 CARS!  I dont care if its your hobby, **** your hobby.  People starve to death in the streets, people are homeless, one school system in alabama require kids to bring toilet paper to school because the school could not afford it (military i moved around alot).  How can a person be so selfish, that their hobby is more important then another man eatting? then another man having a place to live? then a child having toilet paper at school?  <br />
<br />
There are so many better uses for that money, give it to science, help cure a diasease.  <br />
<br />
After we have everyone in america living in a house and eatting, then we can give money to other countries and help them out.<br />
<br />
No one needs summer houses, winter houses, 20 cars, their own private island, etc etc etc.  Its bull ****.<br />
<br />
Im sure ill get flamed for this, its their money they earned it they can do what they please with it, what are you a communist, move to russia etc etc....i dont care.  Until everyone is taken care of, i dont care if the money is yours, you dont need it.<br />
<br />
So no flat tax, tax the rich more, tax the upper middle class more,  tax the middle class some, tax the lower middle class less, and dont tax the poor at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the rich should pay more. They can afford it.  <br />
<br />
That statement is NO different from the following:<br />
<br />
&quot;It's OK not to pay women as much.  Theyr'e just going to get pregnant and miss work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's OK not to hire black people.  They're just going to steal from you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's OK to exclude gay people from medical coverage.  They're just going to get AIDS anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
In each case, you're discriminating against a minority based on a VERY limited set of information.  Unless you're close personal friends with Jay Lenno,  you DO NOT know his situation, what he can afford, or what he gives to charity.  <br />
<br />
Discrimination of any type is wrong, isn't it?  Even if it's against a 1% who happen to be different due to the amount of money they make.<br />

Hmm, too much silliness and misguided-ness to comment on except one thing. Republicans are not the ones who fight for Bigger Government; it is the Democrats. Bill Clinton does not deserve much if any Credit for &quot;getting us out of Debt&quot;.<br />
<br />
Ven,<br />
<br />
The ideas I heard would take into account situations like yours. The government at the beginning of the year would issue a &quot;Tax Credit&quot; for the amount of tax you would pay for all the things you listed. Anything &quot;Above &amp; Beyond&quot; the necessities of life would be where the tax comes from.<br />
<br />
If you go out to dinner 5 times a week to expensive restaurants you will pay more taxes than people who grocery shop and eat at home. If you buy all your clothes from expensive specialty shops in the mall you will pay more than those who shop at Wal-Mart. IF you are Jay Leno and have 50 cars, you need to spend more on Taxes to store them, to pay to have them serviced, to buy parts, etc. for them. The more you have, the more you spend, and the more you pay in taxes. If you want to save money for your retirement, you don't pay taxes on it. Sounds like the MOST FAIR plan to me....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beryllin</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, Simas is right about one thing, Reagan did a lot of deficit spending. However, the end result was that much of it was in defense, the Soviets couldn't keep up, thus effectively ending the Cold War. To me, this is more than ample justification. <br />
<br />
What really eats at me is whenever a Republican suggests a reduction in spending, the Democrats start dragging out every straw dog they can, and turn it into a class warfare issue. I remember the school lunch issue, when Republicans wanted to reduce the rate of increase in the money going to school lunches, and a nightly news cast didn't go by but what there wasn't a Democrat on claiming Republicans wanted to starve children. <br />
<br />
And the Republicans weren't even trying to actually make a cut in the program, all they wanted to do was reduce the rate of increase. Since I don't know the actual numbers, I'll use as an example, from 10% increase in spending, to 7% increase. If anyone remembers the actual numbers, post them, please.<br />

Is it a stereotype that the rich have alot of money? No.  <br />
<br />
We did have the 1st balanced budget in X amount of years (dont know the number off the top of my head) under Clinton.<br />
<br />
Democrats want bigger government, but that doesnt mean bigger debt, as democrats tend to want larger taxes to cover it.<br />
<br />
It was actually stated last year that we had a &quot;surplus&quot; but instead of saving this money, or using it help the poor, or for whatever else we could of used it for, everyone got those checks in the mail.  <br />
<br />
Right not, sadly, our government leaves alot to be desired.  And i dont care if its the best.  If you got the best grade in your whole school, but it was only a C, should you be proud of yourself. No.</div></div><hr />

Now you're changing your statement.  Before you said &quot;They can afford it&quot;.  Now you say &quot;they have alot of money&quot;.  That's two entirely different things.  <br />
<br />
And what I'm saying is that your apparent hatred of &quot;the rich&quot; is a stereotype, just like any other.  You've lumped a group of people together based on their income, and using that to justify different treatment of that group.  That is no different than discrimination based on skin color, sexual orientation, gender, religion, or social group.  It's always easiest to find a group you don't like for whatever reason, then stick it to them.<br />
<br />
Don't generalize that &quot;they can afford it&quot; - unless you know personally that they can, don't assume you understand their financial situation.<br />

<br />
If they cant afford it its becuase they have too many unnessercy bills (read 50 cars).<br />
<br />
If an upper middle class person can live comfortably on say $200,000 a year   (making up numbers here they could be off).  Now say a rich person makes 1 million dollars in a year.  I bet they can live lavishly on $900,000.  The leaves $100,000 that could be put to better use.  Hell they could live comfortably like the middle class guy and have $800,000 left, enough for 4 other people to live comfortably.<br />
<br />
I dont hate the rich but i fail to see how they can not afford to pay more taxes then the rest of us.  Please explain the financial situation to me that precludes rich people from affording higher taxes.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beryllin</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Simas, I wonder why things like this have to be explained to you.<br />
<br />
If you work hard, and make 1 million a year, would you want the Gov't to tax you for $800,000 of it, redistribute it so 4 other people would have the same lifestyle you have, without working for it themselves? No, I doubt it.<br />
<br />
And why do you assume to decide what's necessary for other people? Would you like the Gov't to decide EQ is a hobby you shouldn't have, when other folks don't have PC's? So you'd like the Gov't to take your money for EQ to give to somebody else?<br />
<br />
If you want to examine a system like you seem to want, then look real close at the Soviet system that failed so miserably.<br />
<br />
If you'd like another example of bad things happening, look at Britain during the 70's. They tried taxing the rich at a confiscatorial rate, and the rich fled in droves, setting up residence in places that didn't confiscate their wealth.<br />
<br />
People who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Simas</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes it does.  You should give based on how much you are able to to those who need it.<br />
<br />
Like the quote says, the rich are not being penalized, they have been blessed with the ability.  Becuase of this they have a duty to pay more taxes then the others.  They'll still have more money the other people.<br />
<br />
The thing is it shouldnt even have to be taxed becuase people should just do it.  But that will never happen.<br />
<br />
No one needs 50 cars, 3 houses etc when others have none.  Taxing those that do have 50 cars and 3 houses more then those that have 1 house and 1 car seems perfectly fair to me.<br />

I could be wrong about this.  <br />
<br />
However when i worked at burgerking the owner would come in for lunch (11-3) on weekends.  He would drop checks off every other friday.  I assume he came in and double checked inventory that sort of thing, and he delt with pay checks.  He made the most money.  He did considerbly less work then everyone else there.<br />
<br />
As for the gov't deciding whats nessecery for people, i dont want that and i understand its a fine line.  For instance a middle class family really doesnt need to take a vaction, but i wont yell that they shouldnt take their vaction.  Do they need 10 vactions a year. No thats over board.  <br />
<br />
Is playing EQ overboard, i dont think so.  Im sure there is enough money in this country for everyone to have a house, everyone to eat, and everyone to play EQ.  <br />
<br />
I understand communism and socialism dont work.  <br />
<br />
Perhaps they could work, if you were to follow Marx, and have such a bloody revolution that everyone would be scared to go against it. And then if someone did you gruesomely murdered them.  Then it might work, but thats not right.<br />
<br />
But we dont have to be communist to give everyone in this country the bare minimum.  And there is no reason to not give people the bare mimimum, i dont care that they dont work for whatever reason.  Maybe they cant find a job, maybe they purposely abuse welfare, does it really matter?<br />
<br />
People need houses they need food, we have the means to give it to them and we should.  The rich have the greatest ability to do this so they should give the most, with the upper middle class giving a little less and so on down the chain.</div></div><hr />

Yes, it matters. It matters allot.<br />

Second, have you ever owned a Burger King? No. (I assume) Have you ever owned ANY business? No. (again, assume) Do you have any idea what it takes to own one? No. (Third Assumption) You have no idea what it took for him to get to the point of owning his own business, no idea what else he did, etc. Maybe the time he was away from your BK he was off handing out $20's to the homeless, maybe he was working at a Hospice (is that how you spell this?

Communism as an idea is not great, what it is, is destined for failure. It has NEVER worked.<br />

The ONLY person you have the right to decide what is and is not excessive for is YOU. Telling others taking 10 vacations a year is too much is arrogant and ignorant.<br />

Your school district was one of the top ten in the country?!?!?! And in the AP Government class you did not learn the basis of Communism and that it is a failure as a way to run a country?

What most of us have a problem with is being forced to give to those who are in need because of their own poor judgement, selfishness, and greed.<br />

Why should I have to pay extra taxes so that the single unwed mother of 5 (at age 24) can get money back at tax time?  Especially when all she is going to do is spend it on pepsie, junk food, and her nails.<br />
<br />
She is were she is by choice.  Not waiting till she was financially stable to start having kids and having more kids than she can support.  Having kids with someone before she knew enough about him that he wasnt going to have take off when he found out she was pregnant.<br />

Or the 35 year old who still works a minimum wage job because he dropped out of highschool, doesnt care if he gets his GED, and spends atleast 1/3 of each pay check on pot? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Simas, your so off base I could roll the ball to my firstbase man and still be able to tag you out.<br />
<br />
Firstly lets take this principle of why taxes are even around in the States.  It has to go back to the founding of this country in fact.<br />
<br />
Remember the line... &quot;No taxation without representation&quot;?<br />
<br />
The reverse works also...  When having representation then you should have a voice equal in accordance with how much taxation you suffer.<br />
<br />
So now we have two solutions to this problem.  Either we A) keep higher taxes on the rich but give them more voting power in compensation or B) we tax them at the same rates we tax everyone else but in turn they only get 1 vote like the rest of us.<br />
<br />
Most people don't know this but orignally only people who OWNED land could vote.  The reason for this was to stem greedy lazy workers who cared nothing for the country they lived in and who simply just wanted to set up the government for hand outs.  Well unfortunately cause politicians wanted to be able to BUY votes we now let anyone vote and more over Politicians can count on the poor masses for a voting block by promising them money.<br />
<br />
Secondly You say its the &quot;duty&quot; of the rich to provide for the poor.<br />
<br />
EXCUSE ME?  Where and who said this and when was this person made King?<br />
<br />
And Secondly EVEN if it is the duty for the rich to provide for the poor it should be something that is done voluntarily... NOT compulsury.<br />
<br />
I.e. The Rich are not GIVING money when they are being threatened with jail time unless they hand over the poor's check.<br />
<br />
So Simas get off the high horse with this whole moral &quot;duty&quot; thing.  And more over our &quot;poor&quot; are still in the richest 20% of the world.<br />
<br />
If its a communist system your wanting I highly recommend Cuba or China as they seem to be pretty embellished in it right now.<br />
<br />
Now in response to Kullaas on the history lesson...<br />
<br />
The Great Depression was close to 70 years in the making... I won't go into detail cause entire books can be written on the subject but essentially worked like this...<br />
<br />
The American Civil war made the US government borrow lots of money.<br />
<br />
After the war was over most European investors wrote off the debt as unpayable.<br />
<br />
However the US did the one thing no other country in history has done previous or since... they paid off their debt COMPLETELY and not in inflated paper bills but in GOLD.<br />
<br />
This in conjunction with Britain's falling empire made the U.S. dollar THE currency to have and brought the pound crumbling down.<br />
<br />
Also due to various other economic problems Britain's industrial lead was falling behind the US.<br />
<br />
US prosperity was fine til about WWI which could  really be marked as the end of British Imperialism.  The US economy for a myraid of reasons bagan to faulter and in response to all the soldiers who needed to be reintegrated into the workforce the US government increased inflation and there was all of sudden a lot more money but no REAL economic growth.  <br />
<br />
Casual &quot;daytrader&quot; investors thinking they had lots of cash (of which was worthless) started buying stocks.  The stocks became MASSIVELY over priced both in the American exchanges and foreign exchanges.<br />
<br />
After a few years of the US governement pumping the economy through inflation, some of the BIG investors caught on to what was going on and bailed... after awhile more bailed til finally there was a stampede and anyone left in the Stock market had NOTHING.<br />
<br />
BAM the great depression in simplified terms.  So you see in conjunction with some things at home the Decline of British power was another piece of the fuel so please run along now and buy a history book.</div></div><hr />

I dont agree with the vote thing, tax them more, vote the same.  They get &quot;more votes&quot; through lobbying etc.<br />
<br />
No one was king and declared it was your duty to help other people ( this could be debated but not on this board becuase of the nature of the debate and sunmoons rules) .  I cant understand why anyone wouldnt want to help people, but thats alot of whats wrong with this country today.  I did mention it should be done voluntarily, but its not.<br />

No. There should not be a flat tax in this country.</div></div><hr />

I understand your first point and guess I was trying to make a point to Simas. ;) I take that same comfort. What (s)he(?) fails to understand is that allot of us (speaking for myself here) help ALLOT with others, and the &quot;less fortunate&quot;. That does not mean the Government should make me, or that the government is better able to better decide HOW my money can help others than I am. :rolleyes: We can only hope that with age and education (s)he(?) will see where (s)he(?) is missing the point.</div></div><hr />

I think it does people good to help those less fortunate. I've spent time cooking in one of our local 'homeless shelters', and I've adopted families for Christmas, for my department at work. And I'm not rich. What I don't want is the Gov't deciding what hobbies are 'necessary' for me, or how many vacations are right for me, and taking everything that I work for, except what they feel is 'necessary' for me to have. <br />

If you would take a little deeper look into economic history you would learn that trickledown economics did work.  It just didn't work as fast as everyone thought. It was the end result of trickle down economics that created the economic boom that allowed the tax revenues to reach a point where Clinton could balance the budget. When you talk about the economy you have got to think in a different time scale than the &quot;where is my next paycheck&quot; mode that most people operate in. <br />
<br />
Just in case you doubt this, during the Reagan/Bush presidencies we had the lowest unemployment numbers ever in history and the highest levels of new companies created. You do the math, that adds up to more tax payers and more revenue. Clinton was the one who managed to turn this around and head us back into economic trouble. The economy of this country was headed into the tank before Clinton left office and it wouldn't have mattered who had been elected they would have been stuck with it. <br />
<br />
As far as the deficit budget we were fighting a war at the time. Reagan had a genus plan for winning it and he accomplished it. Once again it happened after he left office but I promise you it was Reagan's plans and policies that caused the collapse of the Soviet Union.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Likewise the deficit spending under Bush 1 and the new spending we are seeing under Bush 2 are because we are very militarily involved right now as then.<br />
<br />
Just to note Bush(now) is not only having to deal with the increased costs of waging a campaign but he is also having to refit an Army that was in HORRIBLE shape after the Clinton era.<br />
<br />
Clinton had this nasty habit of demanding the military to do stuff but then not allocate money and resources to help the army replenish its supplies.<br />
<br />
At one point in the Bosnia operation it was estimated that a 6 helicoptor gunship fleet operating there had only enough parts and supplies to keep 2 in the air at any given time and only 1 in the air for a solid 24 hours.  Standard operating procedure for those I've heard is that all 6 should be able to fly given optimum conditions and 3 out of six should be in the air in rotation over a 24 hour period if need arises.<br />
<br />
That kind of irresponsible funding of our military leads to deaths and body bags.  Clinton abused many programs including defense and security and look what it got us.<br />
<br />
Our military was ranked at its worse point since before WWII (when due to isolationism we were not interested in hosting a big military) and we allowed untolds amount of security information including design documents and schematics of nuclear weapons and more importantly ICBM MIRV delivery systems to fall into the hands of potential enemies (i.e. China who is an up and coming Nuclear power with a very aggressive stance towards several of our allies and has even threatened to Nuke LA and whatever naval fleet is in the vicinity of Taiwan should we interfere with the conquering and reintroduction of Taiwan to the Chinese mainland).<br />
<br />
So please don't say Clinton is so great cause he got us back on budget(which is debatable) when he sacrificed this country's safety, this country's World political stances and put this country's Armed Forces in danger.</div></div><hr />

And guess what, that is *because* of government spending!  Reagen had a genius plan for winning the war?  I hate to steal a quote from heinlein but, check yourself there bro, your slavering like pavlovs dogs.  All reagen did was throw money at defense and make third world countrys hate us.  The reason the USSR collapses is because centralized economics is A) a very unrobust system--the ripple effect of something not going according to plan is huge and B) It's suceptible to corruption way more than capitlism is.  Reagen throwing money at the problem did nothing except create a huge decefit--somthing people see fit to lambast FDR for, but not Reagen.

<br />
Both Carnivore and Magic Lantern were projects started under the Clinton administration.<br />
<br />
They were originally desired by the Clinton White House to help the War on Drugs.<br />
<br />
Also Clinton proposed acts which would allow the federal government to not only get a wire tapping order on &quot;suspected drug dealers&quot;  but also on all houses within a block radius of the Drug dealers residence because there was the &quot;chance&quot; that a drug dealer might use a neighbors phone.<br />
<br />
Sorry but again you want to point a finger then point it at the right guy which happens to be Slick Willy.<br />
<br />
The fact Bush and company are proposing to use some of the devices invisioned by the Clinton administration to fight a real threat in stead of this BS drug war isn't any surprise at all.  Its his job as Executive and Commander and Chief to propose methods of winning this war and note that in war time civil liberties CAN be suspended legally and last I checked while not under an official declaration of war we are on war status.<br />
<br />
Now if these measures continue to be proposed long after (i.e. possibly a few years) the terrorist threat is solved or at least put down then I will begin to worry about Civil Liberties.. but as of right now all steps taken so far are perfectly within bounds considering the situation.  And to be honest you still have not listed ANY infraction on Civil Liberties... Sure some liberties are not as easy to enjoy right now but to date I know of NONE that have actually been taken away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The average middle class person doesn't take 10 vacations a year. Most will get maybe two weeks per year for vacation. I have not taken an actual vacation in well over 10 years. Also, I don't think you can have things both ways. If you think that you can go around telling people if they can or cannot vacation. The same can be said of you and EQ. Sorry - you've exceeded your EQ allotment. Come back next month.<br />

Capitalism based on freedom is what made this country what it is.  The ability of someone to make something of themselves through a combination of skill, hard work, and luck is what makes America the most powerful, free and prosperous nation ever to exist.<br />

It's beyond me how any American can feel that the government should redistribute the wealth to punish those who are successful and reward those who are not.  That's socialism, my friends, a system that has never and will never work.</div></div><hr />

An example would be someone like Jay Leno.  He has how many cars? Im not sure but i know its a hell of alot.  How many cars can one person need, its not rhetoical.  Say you need a sports car for being sporty, an econmy car for commuting, a truck for hauling stuff, a van for commuting with a large number of people, and a luxury car for nights out on the town.  Thats 5 cars, and hell you need 2 of each kind in case on breaks and is in the shop. So 10 cars.  NO ONE NEEDS MORE THEN 10 CARS!  I dont care if its your hobby, **** your hobby.  People starve to death in the streets, people are homeless, one school system in alabama require kids to bring toilet paper to school because the school could not afford it (military i moved around alot).  How can a person be so selfish, that their hobby is more important then another man eatting? then another man having a place to live? then a child having toilet paper at school?  <br />
<br />
There are so many better uses for that money, give it to science, help cure a diasease.  <br />
<br />
After we have everyone in america living in a house and eatting, then we can give money to other countries and help them out.<br />
<br />
No one needs summer houses, winter houses, 20 cars, their own private island, etc etc etc.  Its bull ****.<br />
<br />
Im sure ill get flamed for this, its their money they earned it they can do what they please with it, what are you a communist, move to russia etc etc....i dont care.  Until everyone is taken care of, i dont care if the money is yours, you dont need it.<br />
<br />
So no flat tax, tax the rich more, tax the upper middle class more,  tax the middle class some, tax the lower middle class less, and dont tax the poor at all. <br />
<br />
Your heart is in the right place.  But you forget something.  Innovation/hard work generates more wealth = higher standard of living for everyone.  The reality is, if you don't give people the incentive to potentialy become more wealthy, they will not be as innovative/hard working.<br />
<br />
Let me give you an example.  Let's say you are not the uber ultruistic person you are.  Instead, let's say you are of &quot;average&quot; ultruism.  You give a buck to a bum.  Beyond that, maybe you buy a packet of girl scout cookies each year.  Maybe donate to the policman's charity.  Ok, a drop in the collection basket at church.  Not huge, but some.<br />
<br />
You also work hard at your job, striving to excell at what you do.  Because you want that promotion, you want to get recognized, move up the ladder of success.  You know that hard work and/or talent = success.  Therefore you give it all you've got.  This work = work put into the global economy.  Many benefit because you are working harder.  You too benefit because you are paid more/get that promotion (whatever financial reward you are seeking).<br />
<br />
Now instead say that I come up to you, and tell you that the more you work, and the more you produce, the more I will take from you, so that you will be left with exactly what you have now.  Unless you are among the 1% of the uber-ultruistic people on this planet, you will quickly realize that there is not much of a reason for you to work hard.  Now what happens to the world economy?  The farmer works less hours.  The maintenence guys that keep the water flowing from the water plant to his fields work less hard.  The folks over at the electric company that runs the water plant start slacking off.  Food production drops, people starve.    Those CEO's that make the companies you are invsted in run so efficiently decide that earning 30k a year is a waste of their talents --&gt; Your companies fail, you go broke.  The physician who is fixing you up after the car accident decides working 100+ hours/wk just isn't worth it any more.  Naw, you can wait a week or two for that &quot;emergency operation&quot;.  Etc. etc. etc.  In a few short years, everyone would pretty much be working at the subsistance level.  There would be close to zero innovation.  This of course would mean that we would be producing FAR less.<br />
<br />
Do you see where this goes?  Take away the POSSIBILITY of wealth, and you take away people's # 1 motivation for working and innovating.  You hate the rich, but forget that they are rich because they made a product we ALL thought was worth paying for.  i.e. they contribute something to society that others cannot.  <br />
<br />
Not flaming you.  Just trying to point out the greater implications of what you are suggesting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, I'm going back to Kullaas rebuttal of my points. First I would like to hear some sort of basis for Trickle down not working besides &quot;I know it doesn't&quot; <br />
<br />
As far as the breakdown of the Soviet Union you are way off base. It was the inception of the Star Wars program and continued development of such weapons systems as the Sea Wolf and Stealth air craft that caused the Soviet Union to abandon infrastructure and throw exceedingly increasing amounts of their annual GNP into defense which they could not afford to do. Nor did their system of education encourage the technical expertise in the work force that is required to produce such things as a nuclear submarine that is silent or an aircraft that looks like a bird on a radar screen. <br />
<br />
Make no bones about it, the increases in defense spending and the arms race is what brought the Soviet Union to its knees. By the end of the Cold War they couldn't even feed their own country. We are talking about the single richest nation in the world in natural resources and they didn't have the infrastructure to feed them selves. Why was this?  <br />
<br />
Sorry I don't have a funny movie to insert in my defense I'll work on it, You Hoser!<br />

I understand what your saying, but thats not what i was calling for. Everyone cant be equal because someone will always think that their job of milking 7 cows is harder then the next guys job of feeding the pigs, and that they are entitled to more money.  Im not saying take so much money from the rich that they equal the middle class.  I said tax the rich more then anyone else.  <br />
<br />
Say you had to make $100 (for simplicity) a year in taxes.  5 classes, the rich, upper middle, middle, lower middle, poor.  <br />
The rich should make up for $40 of those taxes, the upper middle should pay $30, the middle $20, the lower middle $10 and the poor nothing.<br />
<br />
The rich can afford to pay that much in tax, and still be rich.  <br />
<br />
To thornblade<br />
<br />
I dont care if poor people are poor because they got layed off from a job or becuase they dropped out of high school, started smoking crack, and had 18 children.  They still need food and shelter and we have (more then) the means to give it to them.<br />
<br />
Sept 11 was scary because of all the bandwangon patriotism.  Go back and look at what happened in Congress after the attacks, Bush wasnt trying to come up with anit terriorism measures, he was pushing his tax plan and stuff like that, because at the time if you werent supporting the president, well then by god you were a traitor and just as bad as the terriorists.  Later when he did push the new terriorism act it was insane, bordering on fascist.  <br />
<br />
When i go to the airport now im greated by 16 year old boys decked out in BDU's with M-16's.  A man in front of me had to throw a way his hair pick becuase it was a weapon.  I find this bad.<br />
<br />
Someone said our military is at the lowest point its been since our policy of isolationism. And? Last time i checked the cold war is over.  You can talk about the likely hood of a war with China in the furture but ill believe it when i see it.  We can mantain a force large enough to defend us, we dont need it deployed all over the world as it currently is.<br />
<br />
We dont need a naval bombing range in Puerto Rico.  (Which did has a chance of being closed down, but now after the Sept 11 attacks there is a &quot;need&quot; to keep it oppurational)<br />
<br />
Trickle down economics didnt work. Take a drive through the south, look at the towns where the money just never trickled down that far.  Giving more money, tax breaks etc to the rich and assuming well they have more money, theyll spend more, which will help companys, which will help the workers etc is foolish. <br />
<br />
But it doesnt matter my opinions are mine yours are yours.  The gap between the rich and poor keeps getting larger, and a very few amount of people hold the majority of wealth in this counrty.  We can try to help (like we should) or we can ignore the problem and let it grow.  If we decided to let it grow the gap will continue to widen, the rich will have even more money then they do now and the poor less, and it will be a matter of time befoe the poor decide to take it.  Will this def. happen? No.  Is it a possibility? Yes.  And it shouldnt be becuase we should be helping the poor today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kullaas</div><div class="date">04-12-2002, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Trickle down does not work because wealthier people tend to save a greater *percentage* of their wealth.  While they may spend more individually, they spend less of a percentage of there wealth.  This means great chunks of money gets essentially locked away and thats money that is not being productivly used in the economy.  Conversly, this increases the value of the dollar, and eventually can lead to a depression: see 1920's.  <br />
I want to clear something up:  I am not neccesairly against a flat tax.  Implemented properally, it could work well.  I think too many people just see at as an oppurtunity to get a tax cut while pretending to be benefiting some one else though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By your logic the more income you have the more you are responsible, to the point that you are responsible for others.  And if you have a low income that you are not even responsible for your own actions?<br />
<br />
I agree, the bandwagonism following 9-11 was scary.  To me, more so because of the flagrant disreguard for the seperation of church and state.  However over reaction is human nature and most of the knee jerk responses have settled down.<br />
<br />
Yes airport security is not much better than it was.  However who do you think wanted to federalize the security?  It wasnt the Rebublicans I can assure you of that.  BTW, 16 year old soldiers?  Whatever, exagerations dont help prove your point.<br />
<br />
I agree that we deploy far to much to nations that cause us more trouble to help than is worth.  However even the Japanese addmited a major reason we were attacked in WWII was because of the sorry state of our military.  Do you think Osama would have been as eager to try 9-11 if he had known we were going to carpet bomb Afghanastan in response?  Presense of force is stronger than you know.  Or in other words an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.<br />
<br />
Speaking of, prevention, Im all for government programs to help those in need help themsevles.  I am strongly against programs that give free service without effort on the part of the payee.  Give a man a fish you feed him for a day, teach a man to fish you feed him for a life time.<br />

There are no &quot;facts&quot; about this.  Learned, prizewinning economists have debated both sides of the flat tax issue for years.  Both sides have good arguments.  Economics is a mystery even to the experts, people, please allow those who disagree some credit.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm in favor of a flat tax for a simple reason: it's simple.  If we get rid of the complex tax system, we get rid of the army of people who make their living explaining it to the average citizen, or looking for ways to circumvent it, or convincing the masses that it's so complicated that they should entrust their financial decisions to someone else.  Let them go do something productive.<br />
<br />
The progressive tax system, along with itemized deductions, tax credits, and all the other paraphernalia of the current tax laws, are really social welfare spending in disguise.  The government wants to encourage people to buy houses, therefore they forgo some revenue from people who buy houses, and effectively pay part of their mortgage.  The government wants to make it easier for single parents, so they institute a lower &quot;head of household&quot; tax rate.<br />
<br />
Now, all these social programs may be good things.  Or, they may not.  But personally, I'd rather see social spending debated on it's own, for what it really is.  If we want to encourage home buying, let's talk about a bill spending X amount of money on home purchase subsidies.  Talking about spending as spending on one side, and taxing on the other, just confuses the issue.<br />
<br />
The charity stuff, that's bogus.  Regardless of what people say to surveys, human nature is simple.  If you reduce people's incentive to give to charity, they'll give less to charity.  To which I say &quot;fine&quot;.  If we want to support charities, let's give a certain amount of the government's money to charity.  We're already doing it, effectively, and I'd far rather have the choice of charities be done by a vote and openly visible, than have my charitable donations determined by the preferences of those who can afford to give the most.<br />
<br />
All this talk about &quot;communism&quot; is just a red herring, if you'll excuse the obscure movie reference.  Clearly, the progressive tax system represents a similar concept to &quot;from each according to his ability&quot;.  So what?  What the heck is wrong with the principle that those who have the most to contribute to society should contribute the most?  The &quot;who decides how much is enough&quot; argument is specious.  Nobody decides how much is enough.  Those who have more, pay more.  I support the idea.  But we can achieve the same thing by sending everyone &quot;tax rebate&quot; checks according to their income, without having the stupid games people play with tax brackets and rearranging their income.  <br />
<br />
On a personal note, I think it's pretty clear that communism is the most evolved of economic systems.  It's a shame we're not sufficiently evolved as individuals for it to work.</div></div><hr />

A bracketed tax system does not neccesairly imply complexity.  Our system is complex, but that does not mean all bracketed tax systems will be.  Coversly, a flat tax system could be just as complex as ours.  There will still be plenty of monkeying around with money to affect what money is susceptable to be taxed under this new system.  Just because we lose the brackets doesn't mean the system will be simple.</div></div><hr />

Taxes levied would go to the areas that they represented only, which would allow much easier oversight in my opinion of where the moneys were going.<br />
<br />
An easy example:<br />
<br />
Roads and highways would be paid for by gas, vehicle, license and similar taxes.  Any item that was related to a car/motorcycle/bus would also have it's taxes put towards the roads.  Those taxes would be adjusted to cover the costs of the road system.<br />
<br />
Don't want to support Urban sprawl or pollution by automobiles?  Don't by a car.<br />
<br />
This kind of a system would allow citizens to vote with quite frankly the only thing that anyone in America listens to anymore.  Your pocket book.</div></div><hr />

So if I am paying $2 per gallon just for the gas, but you pay $1 per gallon just for the gas - I would end up paying more gas tax just on the basis of the cost of the gas itself being higher. More than likely the tax rate on gas would be higher where I live (which is in CA near SF) than where you live. So now I am paying more tax just on the basis of a higher sales tax rate and a higher price.<br />
<br />
<br />
Similarly applies to just taxing everyone on purchases and not income - some of us are paying way more than you already in that area.<br />
<br />
<br />
If this ends up being too costly for buisnesses, they packup and leave the state. So there goes all our jobs elsewhere. Not to worry cause Simas will just subsudize (sp?) the entire state practically. He'll make sure we have enough money to pay all our bills for food, water, housing, transportation, clothing, EverQuest, etc by taking it from everyone else who is working.<br />

<br />
Just wait one freakin' minute.  You just said the above.  About a tax on a per-use system.  You said it would be way too exploitable.  Have you looked around?  Have you seen our current system?  <br />
<br />
When I go through the lines at a local grocery store, see a woman pay for 5 lbs of shrimp with Food Stamps, then proudly tell the cashier that they are for her husband because he's going fishing and needs bait, then go out and get into a chopped and lowered BMW, THAT is a freaking exploitable system.<br />
<br />
When I see a TV interview with high school girls, and when asked what they want to be when they grow up they say &quot;I want to be on the welfare&quot;, THAT is an exploitable system.<br />
<br />
When I hear about people who won't go back to work and keep living a decent life on a govenrment handout because work wants you to show up on time and not drink, THAT is an exploitable system.<br />
<br />
Yeesh.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Firion</div><div class="date">04-12-2002, 08:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A bracketed tax system, by definition, is more complex than a flat tax.  A flat tax has one number.  A progressive system has more than one.  That means it's more complex.  Of course, you can burden a flat tax system with exceptions and credits and additional rules, until it becomes more complex than a simple bracketed system, but you can do that with any system.<br />
<br />
Bracketed systems, in particular, have the additional disadvantage of charging relatively more for people at the low end of each bracket, and relatively less for people at the high end.  I'd prefer a formula-based system, where tax rates are a smooth curve.<br />
<br />
As for use taxes, the problem is that usage is not always voluntary.  For example many low income people are forced to reside far from their place of work, and make long drives to commute.  Is it reasonable for these people to pay additional gas and road tax for their commute?  They're already burdened by the simple expense in the first place.  <br />
<br />
The other question with a pure usage tax system would be who pays for essential services with no immediate consumer?  Who pays for the police?  Who pays for the medical examiner?  Do you charge some poor shmoe whose house just burned down for the cost of the fire department?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Firion, I guess your right, but we are not talking a lawnmower vs 747 complexity difference here.  In an ideal system, where all you have is income and how much tax you pay, there is one extra step involved in a bracketed system, and that it matching your income to a bracket.  Not alot of complex math.  Everything else could, and considering our political system, probaly would be added to both tax systems.  People like exemptions.  Any system created would have to be robust enough to undergo the myriad of exemptions and niggling changes that will be added over time.  Because, believe me, whatever system you chose, that cruft *will* accumulate.  It 's human nature.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps, just perhaps, you might consider why people have &quot;sniped&quot;.  Having a low post count does not make me less of a &quot;scarred veteran&quot;.  I have been here a long time, I have seen you and others before.  And honestly, your opinion of me matters as much to me as mine of you matters to you, more than likely.<br />
<br />
I should not have gotten involved here.  I understand that you won't see the difference, but there is one.  For you, this is a philosophical debate about &quot;the rich&quot; paying more taxes.  For me, this is a discussion about the government taking more of my money because someone of your mindset thinks that I make more than I &quot;need&quot;.  See the difference?  For you, it's a mental exercise.  For me, I see it taken out of every paycheck.  And when I hear that &quot;the rich&quot; are not paying their fair share, I get a bit angry.  Because depending on where you draw the line, you may be talking about me.  And I give up plenty of my salary to taxes, thank you very much.  <br />
<br />
I've seen a lot of anger in this thread directed at people because of their salary level.  And in my way of thinking, that's just as wrong as disliking someone based on any other characteristic.<br />
<br />
Everyone makes choices in their lives.  I happened to choose some pretty unpleasant ones in order to get where I am now.  I gave up a lot of things that I truly loved and wanted in order to get the education and career I have now.  I'm to the point where I have the financial independence to get back some of those things I gave up a long time ago.  So when I see people arguing that because I chose to work hard and do well, I should foot the bill for the people that didn't want to make the same effort, I tell you it's BS.<br />
<br />
But you've already made it clear that you don't care.  I'm a non-entity for you because you've only seen me &quot;sniping&quot;.  Enjoy your forum, but don't ever make the mistake of thinking it's &quot;Real Life&quot;, for it's not.  <br />

First of all, I want to clear something up.  My family, and me myself(for someone my age) would both be considered fairly wealthy by most people.  Not rich by any means, but wealthy, especially considering I live in maine. I know how much taxes suck.  I've bitched about it several times.  Sure I would like lower taxes.  But I feel that too many people want lower taxes for such purely selfish reasons as to be lacking in social responisibility.  Living in society means we have to pay taxes.  I've heard alot of bitching about welfare.  Every time our goverment spends money, to some degree or another, it's redistributiing the wealth.  Every time tax money goes to repairing a road, thats redistrubiting the wealth.  That is *part* of living in society.  Am I advocating the goverment should play robin hood?  No.  But for god sakes man, stop acting like your morally superior to someone who lives on welfare because they have to--not because they want to.   I may be wrong, but from where i'm standing now, thats what you sound like to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aelitan, I agree with you, man. People frequently have no clue what successful folks have to do to achieve that success.<br />
<br />
I am so thankful that it's a minority of people who think in terms of class envy. To listen to them, Bill Gates owes Jane Doe a living, even though he worked hard and built a corporation, while she sat around on welfare, popping out kids and watching soaps.<br />
<br />
Doing charitable work to help those less fortunate is a good idea, but claiming that the rich owe something to the less fortunate is, IMO, silly.</div></div><hr />

It might burn you up at bit a few years down the road when you have a son or daughter of your own who would have the perfect college fund if only you didnt have to pays so much in taxes.  If only there were not so many welfare DEPENDANT people.  <br />
<br />
As I said before Im not against aid.  I have just seen what its like to live below the poverty level.  I have the T-shirt hanging in my closet now if you want to see it.   I am leary about handing out money to people with the assumption that they &quot;need it&quot;.   Trust me from experience, most dont, and all it does it retard financial growth.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aelitan</div><div class="date">04-13-2002, 07:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is one hell of a tactic.<br />
<br />
Step one - dismiss someone's argument as selfish.<br />
<br />
Step two - insult them and attempt to put them on the defensive.<br />
<br />
My last try.  I doubt you're actually going to think about what I'm writing, as it's clear your mind is made up.  If I'm one of &quot;the rich&quot; and I don't want to pay more taxes than others, it's only because I'm selfish with the money (that I have earned for my family, btw).<br />
<br />
Here's the situation.  Your parents are concerned.  They think EQ is going to hurt your grades.  So you're only allowed to play EQ if  you have straight A's.  This means you have to WORK for it.  Your playtime is significantly reduced because you're doing homework.  Now you have a friend who's playing EQ ALL the time.  His parents don't really care as long as he gets C's or better.<br />
<br />
Now, you have enough points in Algerbra to get a straight A - you've worked hard for it, and haven't needed to do the extra credit problems.  Your friend isn't doing so well.  He looks like he might fail.  Then one day the teacher comes in and says &quot;I have decided that everyone DESERVES a C, and nobody NEEDS an A.&quot;  So to be fair, the teacher takes enough points away from you to get your friend up to a C.  That puts you solidly in a B.<br />
<br />
So what do you do?  If you want to play EQ, you have to work harder, do the extra credit problems, and spend MORE time doing homework and less time in EQ.  Your friend keeps playing EQ.  And every time you work your way back up to an A, the teacher takes more points from you and gives it to someone who &quot;deserves&quot; them.<br />
<br />
Does that make you feel good?  Like you're doing your civic duty?  Sure there are kids who don't get algerbra.  Maybe they need your points.  But your friend hasn't opened the book all term, and you've just worked hard enough for BOTH of you to play EQ.  That should make you feel good, right?<br />
<br />
Think about it before you answer, because this is the same thing that happens with the American tax system.  The system doesn't descriminate based on effort, it only sees people who &quot;need&quot; more, and people who supposedly &quot;don't need&quot; what they have.<br />

2) I have one child as a tax deduction and soon to be two<br />
<br />
Therefore, doing a little math, under the recently propsed flat tax rate of 15%, I would pay more in taxes than under the current tax system.<br />
<br />
However, I'm more or less in favor of it. I think 15% of my income going to the federal government is fair. George W. and Laura Bush paid 30% of their income in federal taxes last year. I would bet they would agree with me.<br />
<br />
There would have to be a minimum income level where no taxes are paid at all. I do not think that those living in true poverty need to be paying for social programs. They need every penny to live.<br />
<br />
On the positive<br />
* We could almost do away with the IRS. They would just need a few agents to search out people who paid no taxes. <br />
* We would do away with the financial penalty for getting married. The country's leaders say they want to encourage families and marriage, why do they make us pay more taxed once we do it?<br />
* We would make April 15 just another day<br />

On the downside<br />
* We would not be able to tax people like the Bushes 30%<br />
* Some people would pay more in taxes<br />
* Charitable contributions would decrease<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nekoken</div><div class="date">04-14-2002, 07:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Flat tax, eh whatever.  I'm a single professional without any deductions beyond the standard deductions for myself.  This last year that means I paid about 19% of my gross income in federal income taxes.  Most of the flat tax proposals I've seen are somewhere between 15% and 20%.  Since I would pretty much be paying the same amount I'm not all that concerned about it.<br />
<br />
However, I do have some issues with the ideas some people have thought of in this thread.  Let's say we went to a system where the rich pay a greater percentage of their income in order to subsidize the poor.  (Note: that's how it works now with welfare, medicaid, and such but some people seem to want this to be greatly exaggerated beyond the current scope.)<br />
<br />
Currently I'm an engineer who works my ass off, 60+ hours per week.  I more than earn what I make.  If all of a sudden the greater portion of my income was taken away from me to subsidize the life of people who don't make near as much I would move my ass out of this country hella fast.  This is America.  Hard work, skill, and intelligence are to be rewarded.  What is the impetus for working hard and driving forward if there is no reward for doing so?  Heck, I may as well slack off and not do a damn thing since I won't see the fruits of my labor anyway.  If I want to help less fortunate people out via charitable donations that should be my decision.  It is my money, earned by me.  That means I get to decide what I want to do with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Reason I brought up Flat Tax though is cause it actually has a chance to become a reality where as Sale Taxes look to be a ways off from coming to be.<br />
<br />
Also I'm REALLY REALLY REALLY impressed with Russia's turn around since using the Flat Tax system.  If the growth continues (which many economists say so long as the Dumas(their Congress) doesn't futz around with the tax system, growth should continue) Russia is likely to be an economic power to rival the US in about 10 years.<br />
<br />
Now I know Russia has some other problems but they look like they are trying VERY hard to get this democracy and capitalist thing right and should they succeed I wouldn't be surprised if Russia turns out to be the place to live 50 years from now while the US is foundering in its own bureacratic waste.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kullaas</div><div class="date">04-15-2002, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tel, you misunderstand me.  What I'm saying is that an argument for a flat tax will be simpler is a bogus one.  You should evaluate flat vs bracketed on there individual merits, not on some misguided notion that a flat tax will be a great deal simpler(it may be somewhat simpler, but not a great deal.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-15-2002, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now I'm not saying this is what would be passed into law and I don't have the actual Russian tax code in front of me but if I understand it right its pretty damn simple.<br />
<br />
A = income from work or other sources.<br />
B = percentage Taxed<br />
C = amount in taxes you owe<br />
<br />
<br />
B*C = D<br />
<br />
I don't see how much simpler it could get.<br />
<br />
Now if we start throwing on the extra fungus you mentioned then sure it can be as bad but why throw on extra stuff?<br />
<br />
Why should one person get to deduct for things while another doesn't when they both get an equal vote?<br />
<br />
See what I'm saying?<br />
<br />
Equal Taxation = equal voting rights.<br />
<br />
Or I think a sales tax would do wonders... Texas does great with one.  No income taxes here and I don't remember anyone complaining about sales taxes down here... probably cause they know how sucky a state income tax would be.</div></div><hr />

It also lessons the federal government's leverage to encourage certain behaviours that they like to see.<br />
<br />
They want Americans to own property, so they give you a tax break for your mortgage. They want people to go to college, so they give you tax breaks for tuition and student loans. If you send your child to daycare, they want you to use licensed facilities, so they only give you tax credits if your daycare payments were made to licensed people.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying a flat tax is wrong. I'm just saying it will take something pretty drastic to make it happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kullaas</div><div class="date">04-15-2002, 07:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah but tel, they've had it for what, ten years, and I doubt they've had much of an oppurtunity to have at it as far as exceptions go.  Do you really think the United Soccermoms of America is gonna turn down some pro children deduction.  Of course not.  As myrea said, everyone has this &quot;One deduction&quot; that MUST PASS OR WE WILL ALL BE DOOMED.  And once you've got that first deduction, everyones gonna be clamoring for deductions.  We have our tax policy in bed with our social policy(which may or may not be a bad thing) and it's gonna take a long time to break people of that.  A flat tax may very well be superior to a bracketed system, but I don't really think right now is the proper socioeconomic climate to be introducing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Other countries are catching on and when you start talking about countries like China and Russia who are RICH in untapped natural resources then the United States is going to be up a creek without a paddle.<br />
<br />
As I said its early yet but if Russia can keep doing what they are doing the United States is likely to find itself number 2(or worse) by the halfway mark of this century, and its all going to be because nobody is willing to give up their little special piece of greed whether its taxes or special interest or what have you.</div></div><hr />
