<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SomeDude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heh, remember how the SoL box advertised in plain print (to boost sales) about how the new bazaar and UI were included with it?  Remember how those features didn't become available to us until 8 months after the horribly botched sol release?  Well, you can't really blame sony i guess.. they needed to get the game out before the holiday season or risk losing sales.. so they sold a beta product, and we paid to beta test it.<br />
<br />
Do you really expect poop to be any different?  Come on, who are you kidding?  You buy this piece of crap, and you're setting yourself up for a mass amount of frustration, as nothing in it will work properly for months; remember, the poop buyers are the beta testers.  Notice how every patch takes 3 times as long as they estimate?  That's because they are completely incompetent and have no idea what they're doing.  I could throw a ball at my keyboard from across the room and write better code.<br />
<br />
Don't buy planes of power.  At the very least, give them 6 months to work out the bugs and include features that are listed as included with it ON THE BOX!  Lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're such an awsomely skilled coder, please go design your own MMORPG and market it to the world!<br />
<br />
Until then, give the rest of us a break. Go back to your cubicle, monkey, and throw your ball at your keyboard until something useful comes out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keldain Silvermyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">HAHAHA! Good one. :)<br />
<br />
Of course, if your theory of the paying players being beta testers were true, then you're an idiot for espousing that no one buy it... How will the bugs get found and fixed, braniac?</div></div><hr />

Something like this perhaps?<br />
<br />
You say: Hail a_plane_of_knowledge_librarian_01<br />
<br />
A_plane_of_knowledge_librarian_01 says: Greetings mr fiddlesticks would you be interrested in any of the very rare [shaman spells] that I have collected?<br />
<br />
You say: Show me the shaman spells<br />
<br />
A_plane_of_knowledge_librarian_01 says: Well i have a few copies of [torpor and malo] than I know what to do with, and dont get me started all of the [uber rare shaman pop spells]<br />
<br />
You say: Fork over torpor and malo<br />
<br />
A_plane_of_knowledge_librarian_01: Not so fast bucko, I cant simply give away these spells, no sirrie bob I need something in [trade]<br />
<br />
You say: what kinda trade you psychotic git<br />
<br />
A_plane_of_knowledge_librarian_01 says: Something from the snackshop outside would be pretty nice<br />
<br />
You return after getting a coke and and a snickers for 3 gold and 8 silver and hand them to the librarian<br />
<br />
A_plane_of_knowledge_librarian_01 says: Spiffy, here are your spells and since you got me some candy here is a copy of every pop spell jsut for the hell of it<br />
<br />
As you scribe the spells a_plane_of_knowledge_librarian_01 walks around muttering about how he will get someone and their little dog<br />
<br />
This quest is later changed so you have to give him 454354 items that drop all over and enter the game at the rate of one item every month or so. And when you finally have all the items A_plane_of_knowledge_librarian_01 simply teleports you to a small box with pictures of iguanas on the walls and beats the living crap outta you.<br />
<br />
You end up at your bindpoint having lost 43 levels and the gm's cant a) find where you died b) find any record of you every having a fully equipped lvl 65 char<br />
<br />
Btw this is me rambling at 1am so :)</div></div><hr />

Last night our poor gnome wizard got &quot;the corpse bug&quot;.<br />
<br />
Ok so this has nothing to do with pop but I'm rambling cause I want to know what's going on but I have to stay and work and anyway I went to 5 stores today and none will sell PoP today which means I have to queue up early tomorrow for it.<br />
<br />
So poor gnome wizard is naked, and when she clicks on her corpse, all that opens up is a black box. Her corpse is clothed by the way. <br />
<br />
We petition, but the server is going down in 3 1/2 hours and anyway, when was the last time you actually saw a GM? So we're sitting around with poor gnome wizard with nothing on at the zone entrance, in her starting clothes.<br />
<br />
And I just start telling everyone that if they hurry to the zone entrance, they can see HOT! NAKED! GNOME! PORN!<br />
<br />
Poor little gnome wizard had to zone after that.<br />
<br />
But it's all good, at least I THINK she's still talking to me. I'm not really sure :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ip check on isle 5 please =p<br />

red light special ooh ooh</div></div><hr />
