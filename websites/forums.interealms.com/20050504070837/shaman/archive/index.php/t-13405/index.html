<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I (59 almost 60 shaman) duo with a 60 ranger most of the time.  Once I hit 60 and scribe torpor, I was thinking that it may make sense for me to tank rather than the ranger, that way her attacks don't get blocked/parried/dodged/riposted and we do more damage (I don't generally melee).  Once she finishes her archery AA, it is almost certainly better for me to do the tanking.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any opinions on the general concept?<br />
<br />
Assuming it's not a totally stupid idea, what's my most mana efficient method of holding agro? <br />
<br />
My initial thought was that I should pull (probably with slow) in order to gain the initial agro, then hit the mob with Bane.  Then torpor / canni4 the rest of the fight, clicking JBB whenever it looks safe.  I doubt pull+slow+bane is going to hold agro for the entire fight though.  Is there something else I should consider doing to hold agro?  Maybe tossing in the occasional tainted breath or disempower?<br />
<br />
Advice from all you &quot;tanking shamans&quot; most appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Lately, I've been trying to work up my one hand blunt, and I'll plunk away at the mob while the MA is fighting, the damn mobs parry and dodge quite a bit, even while I don't have aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't forget that rangers have awesome agro control... can usually gain &amp; dump agro fairly easily, especially if you do the pulling.<br />
<br />
I have a 60 ranger that I am lvl'n my shammy up to 2-box with &amp; I never really thought of the shammy as tanking or pulling. My ranger has duo'd with a shammy buddy lots in ME &amp; ranger always pulled &amp; tanked with scooby while shammy slowed, dotted &amp; healed. That was one of my favourite combos (prolly why I started a shammy) &amp; worked extremely well.<br />
<br />
Still not sure why you (the shammy) would make a better tank/puller VS the rangers kick-ass DPS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">NM I just re-read your post &amp; I see what you mean, let the ranger attack from behind the mob while you keep it's attention... I guess if you can keep mana &amp; heals up nps it's something to think about.<br />
<br />
Still any decently equipped ranger can hold his own tanking... it's all a myth that rangers are made of paper, hell my ranger has tanked nps in POP tier 1 grps when nothing better was available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yup, I'm not expecting to be a better tank than a ranger.  I fully expect to be a worse tank.  But I can heal myself with the much more efficient torpor, where I'd need to use kragg's mending on the ranger. <br />
<br />
Also, the ranger will certainly do more damage from behind, where the mob's defensive skills don't apply.<br />
<br />
And of course, archery against a stationary tanked target is much better damage than archery against a rooted or moving target (at least according to my ranger friend).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmmm, I may be wrong but I thought attacks could be blocked, parried, dodged (not sure about ripostes) even if you didn't have aggro.

<br />
From behind the mob, at least some of its defensive skills (riposte for sure) do not apply.  I think block/parry/dodge are also less effective from behind.  Make sure you're always behind the mob.  Pretend to be a rogue.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This is how I duo, typically (a friend of mine is a ranger).<br />
<br />
He pulls with harmony and snare (a controlled pull is a good pull).  He runs the mob past me so I can malo it, slow it, and cripple it (if I am so inclined).  This is not normally enough for me to get agro (which is good).  When I am ready (after putting quiessance or torpor on myself) I cast bane of nife once -- and once is all it will take -- and have agro for the remainder of the fight.  If, by some miracle, I lose agro I can cast Bane Of Nife again and then nothing short of my death will make the mob look at anyone but me.<br />
<br />
I suppose I could pull, but honestly a ranger is much better at pulling than a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Toxox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I do this now at 56 with Stoicism. Trio with a bard and Paladin in PoI. Makes it more efficient than trying to heal the Pally with chloroblast and his attack is not slowed by Stoicism. Works well if you have the gear to tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Poisons and slow are the best way to get aggro and keep it. If the melee isn't actively trying to steal aggro, you will hold it the whole fight.<br />
Higher level spells will generate more hate because of their larger damage and poison counters.<br />
<br />
Giving the melee the back is the best for all the reasons you have mentioned.<br />
<br />
Alternately if it is too hard to tank straight up, you can do the traditional snare kite and ping-pong aggro as needed. You could ask the ranger's glade for confirmation, but from everything I have seen and been told, they can shoot any mob just the same rooted, snared, tanked...as long as it stays out of line of other objects/walls. The back positioning being the only factor that matters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">sounds reasonable.<br />
<br />
the best way to get and hold aggro is load our oldest version of cripple, takes like 20 mana, casts nearly instantly, same aggro as cripple</div></div><hr />

<br />
My ranger friend says there's a bonus for shooting at a stationary, unrooted target.  I'll double-check on the ranger glade to confirm.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  confirmed by looking at several forums on ranger glade.  Starting at level 51, arrows do double damage against stationary unrooted mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">We arent a tank class , the ranger will soak up less damage and you will be able to slap on DoTs and such, i think its just a question of bordem. I tend to tank cause im not that horrible since i have &quot;ok&quot; gear and HP and its more intresting for me to lay Q on me and pull aggro off and just deal with myself being damaged.<br />
<br />
I think if you parse it out though the truly most efficent way would be to let the ranger tank though.<br />
<br />
Now once she gets her AA up , thats another story, rangers are pretty nasty with those bows. I think id have to agree at that point it might be better to just tank it and let her poke away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My ranger friend parses everything.  I'll post back with a parse once I ding 60 and we try it (only 17% left in 59!).  We've had some pretty long sessions already killing executioners/punishers in PoJ basement, so should be able to do a decent comparison.  I think our current kill rate in there is about 30 mobs per hour or thereabouts.<br />
<br />
(I bring along a 2nd box druid for some extra damage - winged death - and patch healing on resisted slows)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Last night My 54 shaman spent some time tanking for two Warriors. Casting Ebolt, Cripple and sending DogDog in was enougth for me to keep agro for the whole fight. It was ok since the mobs didn't hit very often or very hard. One advantage was that both warriors where able to attack from the back where they get a bonus to hit and take no damage for reposts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Phinger Bang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have a rogue bot and personally perfer to use root to maintain aggro.  You simply have to stand closer to the mob then the ranger and it will face you through the whole fight ;)  I usually pull with slow, root it near where we will fight, back off and maybe malxx or whatever else, then get in the mobs face.  Move rogue into position and chew it up :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">don't use root if you want to tank for an archery ranger.<br />
<br />
Rooted mobs prevent them from getting the bonus of their archery doing double damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Poison dots and cripple line are our best agro spells, imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I haven't tried it since the last set of agro changes, but disempower should do the trick and it's only 45 mana.

The shaman will take more damage, but the shaman can heal him/herself a massive amount more efficiently with Stoticism now, pre 60 I duoed a lot with a 60 ranger and occasionally a low 50's rogue also in KC, the most efficient method for us was to share tanking duties and let regrowth do its utmost work on both of us.<br />
<br />
Now once she gets her AA up , thats another story, rangers are pretty nasty with those bows. I think id have to agree at that point it might be better to just tank it and let her poke away.<br />
<br />
It is far and away better for the shaman to tank, after we were both nicely AA'd up, we did a run on the ww dragons for giggles and twink loot, took us about an hour or so to clear pretty much the entire nest area and pick of a few valley dragons also.  A Primal bow with am3/eq is just plain disgusting against lower ac stuff, even now =)<br />
<br />
As far as agro goes, in an xp situation where mana is paramount, use Disempower for taunt, its quick and very cheap to cast, and taunts fantastically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">After you slow, chain cast cripple 1 or 3 times. I've managed to take aggro away from  everyone that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Purtyoogly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">consider getting CA3 and LR 5 as you can, it makes all the difference.<br />
even CS 3 and ID 5 make a difference (eventhough melee will laugh at you for spending 27 points on it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">and I tank alot in xp groups. Even into storms. (Giants Hurt!)<br />
<br />
I use E breath. The like 19 level Poisen dot And I just keep it on and recast if it turns. Or If I wish to apply damage I Bane it as well.<br />
<br />
Seems to work very well and 90% of the time there is zero downtime and I dont ahve to canni 5 all the time either.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">as said by others, the low level of our cripple line is the easist way to get cheap aggro.  very very very effective for very little mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Just to add, disempower generates exactly the same amount of hate as cripple, but is cheaper and faster to cast.<br />
<br />
Using dots for taunt is a bad habit to get into imho.  Its fine for duoing, but when you accidently get an ench killed on a raid or group doing it, you'll regret it =)  Disempower works just fine in any situation where you want to get agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">disempower</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Consensus is use disempower for taunt.  Check!  Now I need to figure out a reasonable spell lineup which includes burning a slot on an agro spell.  Since I'm always short on spell gems, this is a challenge.  <br />
<br />
My standard spell lineup:<br />
<br />
malo<br />
turgurs<br />
root<br />
&lt;swap&gt; bane/rain/buff/whatever<br />
torpor<br />
kraggs<br />
canni4<br />
chloroblast<br />
<br />
Since I'm usually on a horse, I can probably just stick disempower in my swap slot after I bane the mob, but if I can figure out a proper healing strategy, maybe I can dump one of kragg or chloroblast?  <br />
<br />
/hijack my own thread ON<br />
<br />
What healing spells would you folks recommend (at 60) if you were only going to keep 2 memmed?  And how would you use them?  I just got torpor and haven't yet gotten a feel for it.  I'm thinking that in a &quot;patch&quot; situation (group/duo, not raid), dumping a torpor on someone may be better than chloro.  Did most of you dump your fast patch heal when you got torpor?  Or should I be dumping kraggs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">If your duoing in the plains, one thing you will need to do is have your ranger friend stop duel welding.  DW is the death of rangers in planes.  I duo a shaman/ranger and did 4+ lvls on the ranger in PoJ (1st front rats, then back, then downstairs rats + goalers).  Switching from DW to a 2hs weapon (trained on a weighty polearm, moved to Widebladed greatsword then windblade).  reduced the damage i took by 50% because the repost damage is so bad.  I would really suggest that you let the ranger tank and you continue to dot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Jorgan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">A lot of good suggestions above.  I like poison dots for aggro and it will add damage (if you can remain efficient by keeping mana up while also having to heal).  Also, the ranger can pull with jolt if you're worried about her getting aggro.  If all she does is use her bow I doubt if she could out aggro you if you just slowed.  Despite all those claims to the contrary a few weeks ago, I haven't seen much difference in the aggro produced by arrows--it's still comparatively little.<br />
<br />
Once she finishes her aa's (eq/am3) she will definitely outdo her melee damage with a decent bow.  I also have a 62 ranger and at eq/am2 my melee is still slightly better than my archery (windblade v. twisted longbow).  <br />
<br />
Torpor &gt; chloro for casters, unless you're getting too beat on to get it off.  Kraggs is too slow for what you want to do--I can't imagine tanking and casting Kraggs on myself.  The cast time is too long.<br />
<br />
Tnargs at 62, on the other hand, rules.<br />
<br />
Yes, don't root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Mafdet de Leone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I suppose it depends on where you are hunting in general.<br />
<br />
I duo a lot with a ranger (Veteran 60 shaman, Veteran 59 ranger), and with all his AA's, he maintains aggro fairly well, and tanks very well too.<br />
<br />
When we were leveling in PoJ (pre 59/60), I was the best choice for a puller on the first floor. I cast SLOW on the mob, and run like hell back to our camp. I was able to chain-pull affectively, park a mob, then run off to get another one, while the ranger and the pet finished each mob off just in time for the next one.<br />
<br />
Of course, I'd cast maybe cripple, if so inclined, and 1-2 dots on said mob, and the ranger was able to keep aggro without a problem. Occasionally, I'd heal him every 2-3 mobs later.<br />
<br />
However, there were mobs that I could not single pull, and we'd leave those for last, so the ranger could go harmony pull them.<br />
<br />
In open spots, like PoD, he was the best choice for harmony pulling or snaring (damn rats run fast).<br />
<br />
However, if you're looking to maintain aggro: Slow, Cripple, Dot, Epic, Dot...all cast one right after the other.<br />
<br />
If I don't want to gain aggro, I cast the same spells, but with more time in between.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup, we discovered that 2hs was better than dual wielding for a tanking ranger when we were fighting sun revs in The Grey.  My ranger friend currently wields a windblade.<br />
<br />
I suppose if she's behind the mob (with me tanking), then dual wield may actually be better with sufficiently good 1h weapons (no ripostes from behind the mob).  I doubt she currently has good enough 1h weapons to outdamage a windblade though.</div></div><hr />
