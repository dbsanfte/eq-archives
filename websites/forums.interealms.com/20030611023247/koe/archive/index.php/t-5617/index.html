<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, after a few days of suffering, I spent an evening in the Tech chat room and an hour or so on the phone with tech support.<br />
<br />
<br />
It seems in the last patch, when they &quot;optimized&quot; sound in EQ, Verant created some serious issues with any card that is SB-based, and particularly SBLive cards.  <br />
<br />
Since this is probably half the PC's on the planet, I once again salute Verants stubborn refusal to consider their market when testing.  Fools.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, if you are having problems going LD while zoning, or randomly dropping to desktop, OR 1017 errors trying to log in to the game servers, go into the options menu before you log in and disable the sound option.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sucks to have to do this.  I was just enjoying having sound back after over a year of having it disabled on my old PC.  But, it beats the heck out of random crashes and a general inability to zone cleanly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lokes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have SB and Win XP and now I crash more often than before...I don't have sounds turned and never had so I think its the XP thing which is booting me and the most odd times.. <br />
<br />
Just my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What type of connection, Lokes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tinkalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was having problems crashing till desktop after the last patch also.  I did a complete file check and downloaded all the extra languages and I no longer have the problem.  I am using a SB Live in my machine atm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sparck Trueheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's a SB Live! issue alright, took me two days after that major patch to realize that it wasn't a video problem that was crashing me after I selected my server, it was a sound issue.  I disabled my sound and now I can play.....getting major lag spikes tho.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Windigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yep last night I would zone into enclosed areas like Netherbian Lair and Paludal Caverns and crash to desktop and/or my sound turned into screeches and blips along with the regular combat noises and jumping noises, music, etc.  The EQ board people mentioned turning /reverb off seems to work but you have to do that every time you zone.  All of this started yesterday for me.<br />
<br />
I really wonder what they are smoking over there at VI.  They used to release some of this code on Test before they dumped it on the general public or at least had computers to test configurations with in-house.  Last week they had 3 eqgfx8.dll file patches, each one causing me to call tech support for an hour a shot and the next day it being ruined because of a new unannounced patch.<br />
<br />
As for SB Live cards, like my own, I've checked for updated drivers but I don't think they support them anymore or at least feel their drivers are sufficient since there aren't any new ones.<br />
<br />
Now if tech support would just reply to me about the system information email they requested from me over a week ago... :)</div></div><hr />
