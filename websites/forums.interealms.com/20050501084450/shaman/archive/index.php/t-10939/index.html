<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nakukak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After 62 levels and 27 AA, last night I got my Spear of Fate!<br />
Did it the real way, not faction repeats.<br />
Used:<br />
62 shaman (me!)<br />
65 warrior (Ghulak)<br />
62 warrior (Mutters)<br />
63 mage (Gueman)<br />
64? cleric (Coridila)<br />
60 rogue (Inroad)<br />
<br />
It went unusually smoothly, reavers are a lot easier than I remember, almost no HP. Rak spawned off the reaver, we buffed up, buffed up pet, turned in tear, aggro-Rak spawned, his AE did a bout 1/2 my HP before I could back up from aggro. His AE dispelled the hell out of the mage pet, so that was fairly useless IMO, and half way through the pet ate it, so the melees tore in and put an end to him VERY quickly. Very fun, very easy, very epic'd.<br />
<br />
Also! Two nights ago I got my 8th cudgel! Long and fun quest except for the speedbumps (4th cudgel, 6th cudgel~).<br />
Used (for final fight):<br />
62 shaman (me!)<br />
64 paladin<br />
62 cleric<br />
61 shaman<br />
64 rogue<br />
<br />
It was scary doing it with only 5 people, but we got it done. Put people in the fake-hall, pulled the room, buffed up, medded to full, turned in Relics. Vauris spawned and sat around for a couple minutes then went to the platform, the arisens spawned, VS spawned, they punched eachother for awhile (Assiduous Vision works wonders here), 10 or so minutes later VS spawned (targetable one). Malo from max range got him and 2 arisens, he HT'd only once and it was fairly weak. Killed him, looted skull, no one wanted necklace so I gave to 61 shaman. Rushed up, turned in skull + cudgel, got 8th cudgel, 4 mobs on me, we all trained to zone-out. Very scary, very fun, very cudgeled!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Congratulations!  Glad to hear it went well.<br />
<br />
I am still disappointed with the last encounter for the 8th cudgel.  VS and Rile talk smack to each other, which you can't hear cause if you get that close then an untargettable VS will wipe you out.  :)</div></div><hr />
