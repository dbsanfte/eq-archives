<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As a side note;<br />
<br />
Disinfecting Aura removes 20 Poison and 20 Disease Counters.  Will take 5 casts to get those big DoTs off.<br />
<br />
Nife adds 10 Poison counters and Pox adds 9 Disease.<br />
<br />
Remove Greater Curse removes 45 Curse Counters; though, still don't know what spells are 'Curses'<br />
<br />
Also just noticed the Blind spells remove 5 attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Also just noticed the Blind spells remove 5 attack.<br />
<br />
That's why I always try and hit the puller's mob with Flash of light before they get to our camp.  Especially in dungeons. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
So really, we have a CoH type spell, and a group levitation.  nice, if only we could figure out who can cast these spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">How do you read level on that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Of course, the majority of these aren't going to be castable by PCs.  Look at the damage numbers.  These have to be for ubermobs.<br />
<br />
Summon PC seems to be a lower level CoH, though I don't consider that a good change.  CoH should stay high level.<br />
<br />
Levitate?  Bard song maybe?  Who knows?<br />
<br />
Cloud of deadly decay clearly won't be PC castable--insane damage.  3 hours at 667 a tic = 240,000+ hp damage!<br />
<br />
Rabies won't be PC castable either-- 3 minutes at 400 a tic = 12,000 damage.  At first I was excited about a possible new shaman DoT until I saw the numbers!  Damn VI!  :)<br />
<br />
Dislocation sounds like a Trak touch, which already sucks.  It's also tagged as an innate skill.  As is biomelt.  Hello, Mr. Nasty Mob!  :)<br />
<br />
I've got no clue about the gallenite stuff!  Sounds almost like more NPC stuff, kinda.  Flagged with mana costs, and casting times, though, so it's probably PC.  The heal looks large, but also has a 10 second cast time.  The yip is a lot like yaulp (upgrade maybe?).  The damage spell sounds sick--50 mana for 100-1000 damage?  With a one second cast time?  Sounds more like NPC again.<br />
<br />
Dunno.  Anyone else feel like speculating?  :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Oogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">99 disease counters and 3 hour duration?<br />
Gud use for abolish disease....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sound like some more fun NPC nastiness is on the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sartog1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">still don't know what spells are 'Curses'  <br />
<br />
Only ones i've run into are ones from Sun revenants (I think thats the right type) in Scarlet Desert - the DoT comes up as a disease counter - but it isnt only remove curse will get rid of it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">They've been patching the Plane of Power spells recently; lots of really really nasty looking ones.  Some new ones for Inny as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Baldaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'd guess those are the spells they've been using to test the focus items with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kabilis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Gallenite is the name of the wizzie that Scott Hartsman from VI was (is?) playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">who can cast those spell ? I think it is MOb's spell or trap</div></div><hr />
