One thing on your gear...I'm not sure how into trade skills you are but you could get your Shawl up to 5 or 6 with little money and just a bit of time.  The items are easy to solo.  I solo'd all the way up to 7 and I just needed a hand with the sirens.<br />
<br />
Any way  GRATS!!!!!  I'm still sitting at 63 =(.  4 years played.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">nice work beafly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Congratulations. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ah the shoulders. That's a long story. See what had happened was... I did a dumb thing. I left my Mantle of Distraction in a stupid mage summoned bag after a raid and logged back in the next day to find it missing. I petitioned about 2 weeks ago but have recieved no response what so ever (great customer service SOE, where I work we have something called a service level agreement, which we meet quite easily and we have many more customers than Everquest has players).<br />
<br />
I was working hard on my shawl (note the tradeskills in my magelo) when one of the two 65 shaman in my guild decided to move on to greener pastures. This prompted me to put the shawl on hold and do the grind 62-65. I decided that to motivate myself more to get to 65, I would wear my crappy 2nd Prayer shawl through it. Now that I'm at 65 I'm finishing my epic (just got tear this weekend!) and then moving promptly to the shawl work; where I will be rewarded pleasantly at each step with stat boosts.<br />
<br />
I'm also painfully aware of the holes in my gear at the wrists. It was either nice wrists... or Q. I chose Q. I'm not regretting it yet. : )<br />
<br />
I'm moving along, I'll soon be a respectable member of a worthless class (If the current sad state of these boards is correct). In the mean time, I'm king of Valor and BoT and when Valiant Spirit starts it's push to ToV soon, I'll enjoy the raw power of my pop level heals/buffs and monster debuffs/slows.</div></div><hr />
