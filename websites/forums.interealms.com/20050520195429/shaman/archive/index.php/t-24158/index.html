<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bengen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I gave my pet 2 heavy steel ulak to use and I noticed he still bit and kicked, no slash. The Ulaks are for Monks and Beastlords classes. Can our pet only use certain weapons for a specific class, or in other words, is our pet a certain class and it can only use weapons for that class ?<br />
If so, does anyone know what class our pet is ?<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Those must be labled as Hand to Hand weapons, in which case your pet would still show biting, kicking and bashing when using them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bengen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No, he uses rusty weapons and some others, this is the first case where he didn't use the weapon I gave him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't understand...what weapon skill is listed on those ulaks?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">He uses them, but shows bites as weapon, because that's his &quot;martial&quot; way of fighting. You'll seee the same when a mage gives your pet a hand of ixi, that'll have your pet biting, but also proccing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You perhaps meant Heavy Iron Ulak?<br />
<br />
What the other posters are trying to explain to you is that the Ulak is a &quot;Hand to Hand&quot; weapon.  Go here : http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=26802<br />
<br />
Notice the Weapon Skill is &quot;Hand to Hand&quot;  What that means is that the wielder of this weapon will us their hand to hand skill, i.e. their attacks will look the same as barehanded.  In our pets case, barehanded means it bites.  <br />
<br />
Our pets are Warrior class, BTW so I'm not certain that it'll even use this weapon since it is MNK BST only.  Then again, I've been retired for 6 months so I may not be correct on that point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As I understand it, the pet uses weapons that are WAR capable and are either RACE=ALL or RACE=NONE.  Someone can correct me if I am wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Also rogue weapons - I'm sure I read that here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bengen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Those must be labled as Hand to Hand weapons, in which case your pet would still show biting, kicking and bashing when using them.<br />
<br />
 Oooops, sorry, I misunderstood what you were saying. I'll check to see if they are labelled Hand to Hand, I think I still have some left over.<br />
<br />
 If pet is warrior, then I guess it makes sense, too, that it could only use weapons that warrior can use. I'll keep an eye on that and post it here if I find out, if anyone else might be interested.<br />
<br />
 Thanks for your replies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My pet uses hand to hand weapons, and shows as biting.  The proof I have that he is using them is that he procs :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I know for certain rogue weaps work - I used to equip speedbump with snare dagger all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Class doesn't matter for pet weapons. Yes ulak are usually hand to hand weapons which means they will show as bites for our pets.</div></div><hr />

But If the pets weapon skill is the same as a warrior. Then a hand to hand weapon will help less than a dagger or sword due to the warrior cap on hand to hand at what 75?<br />
<br />
Wish someone would parse this. A guild mage despite being told a few hundread times still gives Puddles the hand to hand weapons Like he was some sort of damned warder. I end up replaceing them with Daggers or something through sheer disgust.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">heh if I was a mage I wouldnt waste my time trying to fulfill special weapon-type requests for shaman pets either. <br />
<br />
Get a chanter to cast ndt on pet and you can see what he's weilding. They weild the h2h though if you give your pet rustys then get mage toys later, he won't necessarily switch to the good ones for both hands, er paws.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Best way to prove that the pet is weilding the weapons is to give him one slashing, piercing or crushing weapon then watch his hits.  You will see that he no longer bites but will only have the attack type of the weapon you gave him. <br />
<br />
Now give him a hand-to-hand weapon for his off hand(off-paw?) and you will see that he starts biting again in addition to his other attack type from the first weapon.<br />
<br />
I started saving some secondary only weapons when I find them so that puppy will dual wield with only one weapon and save myself some inventory space that way.  There are several secondary only weapons from luclin zones that you can find on merchants for under a plat.  One of the easiest to find is the Master's Eitchatka (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7152) .  It drops in Tenebrous Mountains and can be found in Katta pretty regularly.</div></div><hr />

My parsing a while back showed no difference between weapon types. Piercing, slashing, hand 2 hand, what ever. Didn't have any detectable difference on dps.<br />
