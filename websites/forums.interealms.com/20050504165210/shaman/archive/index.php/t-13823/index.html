<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yeldare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya, im actually a wizard but as I was looking into how to repair my true spirit faction and found that you can do the shaman prequest, I decided to come here and ask a couple of questions.<br />
<br />
Here's the story. I did the wizard epic prequest about a year ago (it involves spending 2k, but raises your faction with truespirit quite quickly). Just recently I tried to Hail a gnome that should give me a sprocket whenever I need it (I misplaced my old one somehow...) that is on truespirit faction. After doing the prequest I was amiable to him but somehow i was now apprehensive. He wouldn't talk to me, and when I petitioned a GM he told me that there is no proof that I did my prequest and no evidence of what happened to change it. He told me I could go kill a mob called Moltak in sol ro temple to reset my faction, then I could redo the prequest.<br />
<br />
On the wizzy forum people say that you can do the shaman quest beginnings to raise faction with truespirit. I went and killed Peg Leg and the lesser spirit wouldnt talk to me. Next I tried to kill Moltak. After 4 kills (checked after each kill) my faction remained at apprehensive. Next I got a chanter to charm the lesser spirit. I got the gem, but Bondl just ate it and said that he wouldnt help me (apprehensive to him of course).<br />
<br />
I read here about some Woe and Envy thing in your quest. I was wondering if I would be able to try this out, and if it would be any different than these. Im really stumped here on how to get my faction back up. From what I have heard from other wizards the starting faction is indifferently. Also I was wondering if any other shamans have had trouble with not being able to turn in their gem at the beggining of their epic? If anybody has had to restore their faction like i have and tried the Moltak thing maybe? I really cant find much info on moltak...Any help would be very much appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think that if your faction is below indifferent, you will not be able to do any part of the shaman epic :(<br />
<br />
As far as I remember, we start at indiff and work up from there as we do the quest.<br />
<br />
You could look into the SK epic, as that also uses true spirit faction, but I suspect everyone starts at indifferent, so you may not be able to do that either. And the first stage of SK epic involves handing over 900pp and 3 bits of darkforge armour to some Inky in Over There.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm not sure but I think the old invis trick still works. Open trade window with the guy in freeport, have someone turn you invis, then hit the trade button. BTW, I was clearing out the bandit cave in FoB recently, seeing if they dropped iksar blood (they don't) and had 3 of the trigger spirits spawn down there. Might be a quick way to run the quest a couple of times</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thurdar has it exactly right.<br />
<br />
Open a trade window with Bondl.  Get someone to invis you, while the item is in the trade window.  Push trade, rinse, repeat ... 6 times.<br />
<br />
Personally I find it to be just ridiculous that a wizard who has done his epic in order, and has never lost true spirit faction is unable to complete his epic without spending massive amounts of cash doing faction work or by doing other classes epics.  One of the lamest things I have seen in EQ yet.  I just recently helped a friend do the wizzie epic for his frog and found this to be most annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I know a wizard who did this, not sure if the quest changed since or not, but he used an enchanter to charm like you did. I'm not sure if you can charm Bondl, but you might be able to do the invis trick.<br />
<br />
The wizard epic had a faction shift - originally you could do it all through without working on faction with other quests, and now again you can do it all through... but if you were part way through the epic when the change happened, you were out of luck.<br />
<br />
My aforementioned friend did his final hand in without realising it, and lost all 3 staffs - the GM gave 2 back, but not the 3rd because it was MQd.</div></div><hr />

You can do Woe and Envy over and over to max your faction.  It is how I got my epic with a lot less hassle than most (no hole raid etc.).  I did not try to do the beggar one over and over, but it might work as well.  How to do each is written up in painful detail on the http://www.eqshaman.com <br />
<br />
By binding at a spot the wandering spirit crosses, and using my spirit stone (to use the book to get back to Ferrott and run to RM) I was able to solo this very efficiently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tragik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Problem with that Mspeedie, is that this wizard is below indifferent with true spirit.  So the quest NPC simply eats everything.<br />
<br />
Best suggestion I can think of (and the invis trick was nerfed a long long time ago) is to do what Mspeedie suggests but drag a bard/chanter with you to West Karanas and charm the wisp there for the woe and envy hand in.  Turn in the items and just keep doing that until you have the faction ya need.  Won't take long.<br />
<br />
You can also have someone charm Bondle but the wisp in WK is probably the fastest way.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Woe/Envy requires Amiable faction - the hand in of the gem from the test of patience brings you from indifferent to amiable. So charming the spirit to hand in Woe/Envy won't work. Charm makes a mob amiable to its master, indifferent to everyone else.<br />
<br />
If you could get hold of some Puppet Strings (it has charges of charm), that might possibly work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">the invis trick was nerfed a long long time ago<br />
<br />
No.  Open the trade window.  Have someone else invis you.  You become indifferent.  Now hit give.  This hasn't been nerfed.</div></div><hr />
