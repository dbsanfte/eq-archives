<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Filoranae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been saving for a JBB, and now have a good chunk of pp in the bank.  And what I've found is that I didn't NEED the JBB to get that good chunk of pp.  So, I've been considering the benefits of a cheap horse - mainly that of a constant state of meditation thru sitting.<br />
<br />
My question is, is the aggro after slowing mobs while on horseback the same as when I'm sitting on the ground, or more like that when I'm standing?  Because if I have to get off the dang horse or keep the Mob's rooted 100% of the time, it would be a definate factor in whether I choose to stay horseless or become one of the mounted.  <br />
<br />
Can anyone who has a horse or knows something about this help with this question?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Filoranae</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only issue I've found on horseback is that it really seems to murder my channeling ability, even with the new models and horses off, I just can't channel for toffee on horseback =/</div></div><hr />
