<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I logged in last night for the first time since the last patch and noticed that I couldn't type in any chat windows except for the one designated as 'Always chat here'.  <br />
I have 3 chat windows: main, combat, and guild.  I usually type to my guild in the guild window, where I have it set to the guild channel.  That way I don't have to remember to type /gu.<br />
I could right click on the chat bar and make the guild window as 'Always chat here' and that would let me type in it, but not in the other two.<br />
I shut down and rebooted my machine, and that didn't fix it.<br />
<br />
Just wondering if anyone else is having this problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kalander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had the problem the other day.  Opened to the always chat here box (in the window that allowed chat).  Clicked it again (maybe right clicked...not sure) and I could once again chat in any window.</div></div><hr />
