<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I really didnt want to put this out because I love this spot, but I got through 56 here and lotsa PP. If you have 2 accounts its better if you can keep a merchant in the Bazaar.I had to let a loop,and Gaunts rot =(<br />
<br />
Place is Torg mines entrance from Dulak. Exp isnt uber, but its not bad either.The biggest bonus is the PP to be made. NPC vendor junk are Gems,belt buckles,silver rings and ornate miner picks.Sell items include (and these are prices I got). Grobb hide cowl 6k, Grobb hide mask 3k,Worn Zan gaunts 1k,Twisted ring loop 2k,2.5k,3k. Sharpened mining picks 500x2. I usually leave w/ 300-700pp(in NPC Vendor Junk) + 1 Item from above.<br />
<br />
I always go w/ KEI because I can almost nonstop pull blues. Adds are very Rare and only if I screw up.(Like let them pop on me.)<br />
<br />
Park Dog at ZI buff , Pull w/ slow. Let dog tank till mob has about 3 bubs drop a Bane (if mana, if not Canni canni canni). On the Bruisers I pull w/ slow Bane ,root let dog tank redot and reroot. Thats my stratagy I am sure youll have your own.<br />
<br />
 I am alone in the Zone 80% of the time.When I am not alone in the zone they are usually farther in.<br />
