<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Halycona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm trying to raise some plat to twink an old monk alt of mine and having never had more than 4k in the bank I'm trying to work out what would be the best way to raise it.<br />
I've brought it down to either Seb, HGs at rathe or PoG. <br />
Which would be the easiest for me to do? I'm more concerned about what would be fast and simple rather than gaining exp or any kind of risk.<br />
I'm a 61 shaman, ok geared (magelo in the sig), no epic, no jbb, no fungi, no torpor/malo/pox/stoicism, i do have a horse though and could probably get a kei fairly easily. <br />
Just looking for some fast cash :) (about 20kish I guess)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've tried all 3. Here are my impressions.<br />
<br />
HG: The worst loot on average. It can be streaky though. Sometiems its GREAT loot. Problem is you have to put up with a ton of whining about KSing ect. If you are of teh mindset that you can ignore all the bitching, then this is the safest way to earn cash. Even if its not the best, its damn ahrd to die here. Set up camp smack in the middle of teh platue and pull everything, and I mean everythign that moves. Let pople know youa re doing this, then ignore them.<br />
<br />
Seb: Problem with seb is that its a freaking pain in teh arse to get to. If you have thurg potions or a spiritstone it makes ti easier.. you can bind at port in and potion/spirit out to sell/get kei. Another part that sucks is no horsie. You will cani alot. The best camp for cash items is teh bugs. ?Its almost always camped. After that its disco or some other froggy camp. The cash is mediocre, but there are a ton of them to kill, and you might get a ODS or some other uber cash drop. On average if prolly better plat than HG, its better exp (although ti still blow) but there is alot mroe danger. You can go afk ect.<br />
<br />
PoG: Same problem as seb with gettin into and getting out. Its outside so you can use horsie. The exp is better and nearly every mob will drop cash loot. The bears might drop some minor shammy armor too. Its dangerous as hell though compared to Seb and HG. Get an ageo or virtue and dont go afk. Fights are long, and mobs summon. You shouldnt have a problem singling them, but adds can be a pita and treants blow. Dont try to solo them if you cant easily solo rats/goos in PoD. Slow respawn so if there was someone there, the zone might be empty. Depending on how fast ya can kill, the cash might not be all that much better than seb. In that case bring a hybrid tank and the cash flow wil lbe better on average with less risk.<br />
<br />
It seems the best cash for me is a mixture of seb/pog. HG is good but the banter drives me nuts times. Problem is cash camps are boring as all hell. Its much more fun to go whack stuff in PoP and watch aaxp move :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">IMHO, PoG is much less dangerous than Seb. If you zone into a full respawn there is a safe spot in the SW corner to setup and pull. Can't remember exact loc but it's something like -3500,+3500. I've gone AFK there for 30 minutes once and never had anything aggro on me.  It's very high up giving you a nice view of that whole SW corner. Once that area is clear you can either continue pulling to the SW corner making for long pulls or slowly make your way up north but not too close to the wall else you risk the treant pathing your way. At this point it does get a bit more dangerous because some mobs path near the wall so getting an add is possible. With KEI and horse I can handle one add as long a it's not a named, treant, white horse or spirit stalker. If it's a wolf, black horse, or sanguine kodiak I can easily keep it root parked. 2-3 adds though and it's gate time :)<br />
<br />
You don't have to worry about any ice comet nuking froggies like in seb. The caster types in PoG are very weak and are easily resisted. The only danger in PoG on the west side is the tranquil treant and the 3 named(2 horses 1 wolfy). It's one of the few zones I have gate memmed so if you do get a tranquil or named add it's easy to escape. The other danger is getting rooted in the middle of a pull if your MR isn't high enough, easily prevented with 120+MR buffed. Just stay away from the east side which is full of nasty cullers and black panthers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I remember when PoG had mobs in it, that was cool.  Now I only bother going after a patch or a server repop.  The 24 hour spawn on the trash kills its farming potential.  I rarely see more than a wisp or two up when I check these days.</div></div><hr />
