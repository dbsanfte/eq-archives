<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, assume that i am killing a stupid green /con mob that is on a 15 minute spawn timer, and takes 1 minute to kill.<br />
<br />
This gives me 15 out of every 16 minutes to do something else. Preferably something else with a measurable reward - i.e. exp or loot or faction or something like that.<br />
<br />
I need to preserve my faction with the vendors on the upper level (currently indifferent) so killing anything that lowers their faction is out of the question.<br />
<br />
Am level 65 but gimp (coughthirtysixaacough), so nothing to ubah-leet for me.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Crash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You could kill the evil guards for loot.  They are green at 65. Light blue at 61.  They are in the building with Nathyn Illuminous (#3 building on eqatlas).  Its the building with the sonic wolf looking beasts in courtyard.  They always drop a sword for 5pp and sometimes a shield for 1pp and armor for 4pp or so.  Sell it to the merchant just next door on opposite faction.  The centurians would give you exp but they are pretty hard for the amount of exp they give and they give negative katta faction.</div></div><hr />
