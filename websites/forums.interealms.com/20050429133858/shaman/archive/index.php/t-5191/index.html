<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Del</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK Shammy, to solo from 48-54 easy,,,<br />
<br />
Grab an occational KEI in the Nexus and run your Shammy over to Dawnshroud Peaks.<br />
<br />
Start off killing wolves, they will be dark blue to you. <br />
<br />
At about level 50-51, switch to Stonegrabbers.<br />
The Stonegrabbers are 1 blue in 3 kills and you can pull 1-2 at a time when you get the it down.<br />
<br />
I did it and I didn't even have to use my pet!<br />
<br />
Enjoy...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thanks a lot for the advice. My shaman has been stuck at 47, but  I recently switch over to ikky shaman so now I'll know the quick way around :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was killing wolves in Dawnshroud from level 42-44 and can pull them almost non-stop for about 20 minutes before I have to sit and heal up.  The grabbers are harder but I can solo them at 44.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Setantha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Whereabouts did you set up camp in DP for the wolves and grabbers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I went to 44 on wolves and large Zelniaks in DSP. I set up dogdog at the base of the hill on the right just as you leave the dome and pulled to there. Zelniaks don't hit as hard as wolves, and are still dk blue at least till you hit 44. I hit 44 and went to make Pp in Rathe, but come back up to duo with a mage from my guild on Grabbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ribeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I set up camp for the grabbers/wolves here:  Coming out of NL go left, over first big ridge near zone edge, stop before the houses.  Theres a little meadow (awwww) before the houses where u can pull to.</div></div><hr />
