<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone have any advice on killing this chic? Like minimum raid force required and tactics? My guild is thinking of attempting her and I will probably be leading the raid, so any advice is appreciated. We barely managed to kill Vindi with 3 groups, we are mostly 55-65 in SS type gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know a while back my guild (in NToV gear at the time) killed her with one group. Took like half an hour though with all her HP. Think it was two chanters with charmed pets, a war, cle, mag, and rog.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">she has been upgraded at least once.  But you could probably take her with that force icebreaker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">She likes to charm so have melees keep there top slot open and have some junk buffs also.  What I did was swicth to a 3rd person mod and anytime someone gets the LD sign on there name, I cast annul magic (or whatever our high lvl cancel magic spell is).  That cancels the charm on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tat2demon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Im not sure how anybody else does it but we always had a monk pull and split her down in the open area near the TM zone line. It may be easier to just fight her in the church.  <br />
<br />
We usually had 3 groups and most were fairly easy fights. She has around 500k hp I belive so its a fairly long fight. Mana management is important because of that. She is magic slowable and I believe most spells will land.<br />
<br />
Her loot table shows a nice melee mask but in 20something kills we have never seen it. Her staff seems to be the most common drop, with the belt beinng slightly more rare. I was finally able to win it a couple weeks ago.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Used to do her often, set up in the room on your left just before the room she is in.<br />
Dont fight in the church, the pews will restrict melee.<br />
High MR is obvious<br />
Its a long fight used to take us about 15 mins with 20 people in pre HOT gear.<br />
Slow is important she does hit pretty hard be sure to refresh.<br />
<br />
Its a straightforward fight, but having her trapped in that room works well for us, I suppose thats my only advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My guild when we used to kill her was about 6 to 12 ppl each time.<br />
Go in unbuffed and bring a bard for haste and magic resist and it should prove easy as you annul her charms, just a long fight.<br />
<br />
We killed her maybe 15 times and not once did she dropp the mask,<br />
is she nerfed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We made a mistake the first time we fought her that you should avoid. We had a few enchanters with us and they said that they would just mez the 4 guards that are with her so we could concentrate on Lcea. Well, they had them mezzed for a while... but then they started to break loose, they killed the enchanters, then we had a rampaging group of 4 guards + katta + charmed guildies running all over killing our raid force. Since most of us had bound in that room, we kept repopping, looting a bit, casting a spell or two, then dying again. Eventually, we won, but I think everyone died at least 2 to 5 times. Soo...<br />
<br />
1) Kill the guards. Pacification/lull might work, but killing them is safer<br />
2) Binding in the building can make sure you win the fight, but if you start to wipe, you might die a lot. ;)</div></div><hr />
