<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am currently torn between maintaining my amiable faction at the Evil Outpost in the Overthere, or going and getting myself some Jaundiced Bone armor (which, as I understand it, will hose my Venril Sathir faction). The Overthere is great because (a) it's the only place I can bank on Kunark and (b) I have the hammer that procs a gate to the Evil Outpost, allowing me to bank/sell from anywhere in the world and then gate back to my hunting grounds. However, my armor absolutely suX0rs: mostly Ry'Gorr with a few Totemic pieces at Level 54.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions from someone who has been down the same path? I'm intrigued by the Cudgel threads regarding raising Cabilis faction, and wonder if that's an option to replace the Evil Outpost (though I'd still lose the hammer). Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Falyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I dunno, JB (besides bracer, legs, bp, of course) is going for under 1k, money may be an issue, but it will get you JB without killing your faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Oh yeah, I should have mentioned that I don't buy equipment :-P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hey House,<br />
<br />
I would advise just buying the JB armor if you don't want to trash your faction.  Boots and gloves are the only two pieces that drop in KC and they probably sell for around 500 each.   The only other nice shaman drops in KC that I can think of are howling harpoon, book of obulus (no AC, don't do it!) and JS legs (but if you're evil, you probably can't wear)<br />
<br />
Hat and arms are very common drops in OS and should sell for about the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Doh, simulpost.<br />
<br />
It's up to you, I would think being able to bank at the outpost and use your OT hammer would be a very very nifty thing and not worth messing up.  Bind at the OS orb, hunt for a night, hammer gate to OT, bank/sell, gate back to OS.<br />
<br />
Nifty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It would take a very long time to collect even a few JB pieces from KC without purchasing them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've had and used my hammer since right after they fixed it along time ago. I can tell you this...I would never, ever waste my VS faction...not even when we were killing VS. I made everyone understand what a plus this hammer is to all that can use it. It has been so valuable to me and at what...the price of a jade and alittle bit of faction work?<br />
<br />
<br />
just my opinion of course :) but Id say using that hammer -far- outways JB boots and gloves....g'luck to you in any case</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok thanks - I'll think I'll just stick with the hammer and try to start working on the Thurgadin armor quests.</div></div><hr />

You don't buy equipment?  How about your other recient post<br />
where you state that you have 10k to spend and are soliciting<br />
advice on what to purchase.  You even say that you can use your druid to farm for you.<br />
<br />
How are people to give you advice?<br />
<br />
Do you have some characters that you don't buy equipment for and others that you do?  :(<br />

WOW!<br />
<br />
Very respectable House.<br />
<br />
Wish I could say I had the time (and patience) to do that. I use to acquire my own gear, but somewhere along the lines I succumbed to the &quot;alluring aura of uber-phat lewts&quot; and started buying. One peice here, one peice there. Started off small.<br />
<br />
Damn gear is just like Lays potato chips. :)</div></div><hr />

That entire thread was a J-O-K-E.<br />
It was stated there several times...joke, not for real but to be funny.<br />

Hopefully I am not missing a joke somewhere in your post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">At 54 get into a good Kael Arena raid and get some quest armor pieces. Or vice versa if you're on Giant faction, get into a ToV raid. Or if you don't care about killing your faction, go to the PoG. That way you're not buying any armor and it buries JB armor hands down.</div></div><hr />

I work on a unix box and my brouser runs on an SGI O2000.  I can't look at his equipment but I will be sure to when I get home.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">On a side note, the hammer destination is next to a low low green mob, once I get some puppet strings I fully intend to do the quest for a hammer despite the fact my vs faction is pretty much as low as it can go, the stuff there didn't agro on a 60 bard so I doubt it'll agro me.  Just swim out of the outpost to be safe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">So what House needs is a shaman friend on this server to buy a set of the cheap JB armor and give it to him as a gift.

hehe, just kidding, I always have a tough time accepting gifts from friends, but Mojo has been working hard at curing me of that. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I only have about 11kpp, which I keep meaning to waste on Alchemy. One of the nice things about not buying gear is that I've never worried too much about money: I only killed one Hill Giant, just because I was passing through Rathe Mountains, and I usually grossly underprice every item I sell, just so I can dump it quickly and get back to bashing.<br />
<br />
Downside, of course, is that my gear stinks.</div></div><hr />

You must have decent VS faction then.  My 60 Monk gets aggroed on near immediately.  If I swim too close to the docks I can count on at least 1 HT.<br />
<br />
Ahh the good ol days when I could bank in the OT. (Faction rollover in HS)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Graal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Get your OT hammer and then slaw away at all those VS factioned mobs.  I have bottomed out VS faction and use the hammer to gate to OT all the time.  You get aggro from one green skeleton and thats it.  Kill it and just run out passed the cliff golems.  Even if you happen on the Dragoons leaving the outpost it should be no problem to run to a zone.<br />
<br />
I do my Kunark banking in FV. 600 or so goblins fixed my faction right up.  Of course I am a loveable Ogre so if you are a stinky troll this might not work for you.  A DE necro friend of mine topped out FV faction and was still KOS.<br />
<br />
I am,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Shamolite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">is it ever possible for a barb shammie to enter the outpost without being kos?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I hope so, I need a bank spot that I can port to whenever I want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Yes it is possible, but possible in the same way that one group chardok queen raids are possible.  It takes planning, hard work, and flawless teamwork.  Here's how you do it.  Get a monk to FD pull the quest guy out of the city . . . this part is difficult in the extreme since mobs there tend to never forget and chain aggro tons of DE guards with HTs.  Once the quest mob is outside, have your backpacks lined with tons of braids and get the chanter/bard to charm it . . . start handing in braids.   <br />
I've no idea how many times you'd need to repeat this to get from kos faction of a barb to non kos.  It's probably not worth it tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>zagal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">i miss my VS faction, but i dont regret losing it. <br />
<br />
<br />
to keep VS faction u cannot fight in HS either, which is my favorite zone solo/grouped<br />
<br />
it may be a hassle to not be able to bank on kunark but we are shaman! easy to max 255 str and if u run outa food u waste a whole 2 minutes summoning it for the day (i do hate summoning food too)  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I'm an Ogre Shaman, and my VS faction could not possibly get<br />
any worse. <br />
<br />
Most of my hunting is done in Sebilus (except for the occasional<br />
guild raid). I find that at least once per week I'm grouped with<br />
a porter, who's happy to take me to S. Ro at the end of the<br />
night. I sell/bank in Oggok exclussivly. With our strength, this <br />
hasn't been a problem for me. Occasionally I have to settle for<br />
a trans to North Ro.<br />
<br />
By the way, don't waste your plat on alchemy, It's just not<br />
worth it. The only potion worth stocking to sell was wolf but,<br />
since the aa ability to run came out, that dried up. It's highly<br />
unlikely that you'll see any return on your investment. I was<br />
hoping that people would by the port potions, but not on my<br />
server. Of all my mistakes, throwing my money down the alchemy<br />
toilet is the only one I regret. Probably could have had the fast<br />
horse by now.</div></div><hr />
