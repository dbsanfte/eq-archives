<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i'd like a little bit of information since i haven't heard much of anything about this. in passing, i've been told that each tier raises your chance to crit on a DoT by 3%, but i've also been told by a friend that he grouped with a 65 necro in BoT who was critting his DoTs left and right.<br />
<br />
additionally, does anyone have an apporoximation on crit modifiers? what i'm really after is specifics on how much this aa is going to change my dmg output using BoS, PoB, BoT, etc<br />
<br />
thanks in advance for all responses...trying to figure out if i should go ahead and get this right away, or hold off and finish all my archetype stuff (nice change of pace to switch to some of the more 'fun' aa's, rather than all the practical ones we get).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When I use Bane, it's not uncommon for me to crit twice during its duration.  Think only once or twice, it's critted three times.  For longer duration dots, like the disease based, it can happen a few times.  I don't use poison dots much, so can't tell you much about my experiences with them.<br />
<br />
I have the full investment in it.  Personally, I think it's one of our better AA's, at least GoD wise.<br />
<br />
Wanted to add, that with the AA, it's nice seeing any dot foci you may have given a push for extra damage.  That and with bard song, I've hit the 1200 mark with Bane.  Always neat to see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">well, back when it was first introduced, the crit % was closer to 9%.  I think that it's currently at (or at least was supposed to be) 14% or around that.  That is each tick.  So the more dots you have on the mob, the more times you could see the crits.<br />
<br />
Personally, I've had a few bane casts of over 5000 total dmg before.  It doesn't happen often, but it can happen.  <br />
<br />
As to overall dmg, i don't know how much it will add.  So much determines on how long the mob lasts and if bane runs the full length.  Part of the problem is that crit dots do bring extra agro, even though they aren't supposed to.  So, although you will be doing more dmg, you will also be getting alot more agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thanks for the responses, guys. <br />
<br />
the aggro thing doesn't really bother me all that much, because my interest in improving my overall dps is mostly for solo or duo purposes. when i'm in a larger group, i usually focus on slowing and debuffing. if the mobs are taking too long to kill, i'll throw in a DoT sometimes, but i'm usually doing so when the mob is around 65%, taking the approach that my job is to help but not to be the mainstay of the offense.<br />
<br />
i'm very excited at this point to pick up this aa through tier 3 right away. you guys are awesome.<br />
<br />
thanks yet again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Youichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As a side note, Critical Dots affect our Epic too, which BA and ET don't.<br />
<br />
I was well surprised when I critted an epic tic, made me smile for ages :)<br />
<br />
Why had no-one told me ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">. . . but i've also been told by a friend that he grouped with a 65 necro in BoT who was critting his DoTs left and right.<br />
<br />
What you have to remember here is that its quite possible that the Necro was running 3 or more DOTs per mob, and with that many &quot;tics&quot; happening, its quite possible to crit like mad. I have only the first level of CA, but I have noticed double-crits per tic (2 DOTs each have a crit on the same tic) when running 3 DOTs soloinig.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">more good responses...thanks, guys.<br />
<br />
<br />
ok...here's another question, then: <br />
<br />
for those of you who have critical affliction and either or each of Burning Affliction 4 and Extended Affliction 4 items/augs, do you find yourself using mostly the shorter duration DoTs soloing, or do you make much use of the disease DoTs? at present, i use Breath of Ultor and Pox very heavily (usually have a root parked mob 'slow roasting' while i'm dealing with another one by using my pet, my Delightful Orb, and a poison DoT or two), but i'm curious about the other ways people may approach soloing with an eye towards making the most of their time.<br />
<br />
thanks again, and thanks in advance for further replies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I use mostly Bane, Anathema, and BoS.  I ave BAIV and CA3 which i love, often see multiple critical tics with bane hitting 1k+ and BoS 700+.<br />
<br />
Just recently added Affliction Efficiency via tribute.  I'm not sure how much it helps, but at 29tribute points / 10 min, it is relatively cheap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I never bought Anthema (although I might for farming Veskar) so here is my main method of soloing:<br />
<br />
Mobs I can melee: Pull with Slow, use Bane, BoS, and BoU and beat em down with Sharkspine procs.<br />
<br />
Mobs I cant melee (Fire Tables, for example): Pull with Mal Decay, VP, Malos, Malosinia, Bane, swap 2 spells, BoS, BoU, canni up, refresh DOTs and VP as needed.<br />
<br />
Cash Farming (my number 1 cash spot is the wall in PoM for copies of Y73R to make RGC). These guys are very easy, they dont resist at all. Pull with slow, drop DOTs, VP if I want too go take a pee, no de-buffs on resists whatsoever. <br />
<br />
But I tend to avoid DOTs with a DD component completely, since I dont want to risk an early VP break. I use this method, even when I am meleeing, to keep the habit. <br />
<br />
I have CA1 and a BA4 aug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think I will go for this one as well, since I seem to be soloing more and more due to RL time constraints and commitments. I love the wall in PoM. RGC sells 40-50K on my server, and I can get a copy of Y73R every couple hours, max, and go AFK anytime I want safely there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">it's funny how many different ways there are to get the same end result using the same class.<br />
<br />
love this forum. thanks for the added input.</div></div><hr />
