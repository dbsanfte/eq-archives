<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I would like to know if some of you got the same problem than me<br />
yesterday, my RL bro ( magician 65 ) and I ( with a beast 65 ) decided to duo phiny. Everything was doing good but we got a room repop and we died. Then my bro died again during the CR cause someone entered in his room at work and he had to shut down the screen for severals minutes, just enough to let the invis fading  :D <br />
So, I decided to get his corpses. He used /consent but when I came to his first body, I couldn't drag it, saying that I hadn't the consent, it would only let me drag the second corpse :/<br />
I made a feedback for that anyway, but if it appears to be the same case for everyone, it is kinda annoying</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ya had the same problem yesterday.<br />
<br />
im assuming that if you have more than one corpse you need to /consent mulitple times</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kalaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've been meaning to feedback corpse dragging for a while; I'm not sure if your problem was the 2-corpse thing, but I've noticed that when you bring the Z axis into play while dragging a corpse, you can have a problem.  I imagine this could happen easily in Kedge.<br />
<br />
Basically, if you drag a corpse while levitated, and you get to high off the ground, if you drop the corpse, the Z axis position of the corpse can get bugged.  So, if you're on the ground at position Z=0, the corpse's position might still be at Z=300 (the last place you summoned the corpse to).  So, you'd be out of range to pull the corpse even though it looks like you're standing right next to it.  I've been able to fix this by hovering over the corpse while spamming /corpse, but it's not a guaranteed success. <br />
<br />
Happened to us in The Deep as well -- dropped a corpse off the invisible bridge, and we couldn't pull it any more, either from the bridge or from the pit. Had to just rezz in the pit to fix that.<br />
<br />
So, if a toon died on phinny's ledge, and the corpse sank, it might have bugged the position of the corpse.<br />
<br />
Just a thought...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I thought corpse dragging ignored the Z coordinate - but I may be wrong, haven't really noticed recently.<br />
<br />
I have had a bug where consent didn't work - I just ask the person to consent again and that seems to fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The corpse Z thing has been around a long time, I remember having problems dragging a corpse down the wall in Western Wastes.  Corpse APPEARED to be on the canyon floor, but I had to go up to the top of the canyon to successfully summon it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The z-axis corpse bug can give you a very nice shock: Fooled around with dragons in WW before a ToV raid, and wiped.  Dragged corpses to ToV for raid clerics to rez. Same funny thing, corpse looks like it's on canyon floor, but you can't drag it anymore due to out of range.  Now comes the tricky part- it was still in range for the cleric to rez.  Rez puts you next to your corpse - in this case half way up the wall. Luckily I had looted and was wearing my HP gear - otherwise I doubt I had survived a 600+ dmg fall freshly rezzed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, I had this happen to me as well last night. I kept telling someone to give me consent and he kept saying he had. It turned out he'd died twice and I was able to drag one of corpses but not the other.</div></div><hr />

Funny had that happen too, got rezzed above the entrance to HoT, fell for about 300, good thing i sat real fast, sitting i guess mitigates some of the damage from a large fall.</div></div><hr />
