<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The charms I have seen have, uh, interesting aspects.  I am intrigued by the idea of items that vary in effectiveness/power based on the PC's skills or whatever.  But I have not seen much in the way of useful or desirable effects.<br />
<br />
For charms to boost dex, or agi, or str, or cha seems kind of disappointing.  This board has hosted many a thread on how useless or marginal stat buffing is.<br />
<br />
In fantasy worlds charms can be items of great power (okay, everything in the fantasy epics has great power), or at least useful.  <br />
<br />
So - here we have a new slot, and a chance for a new concept.  I do not think we can reasonably talk about huge boosts in power, like a priest item that gives the wearer the warrior defensive discipline, or a wizards mana gathering trick.  So - what is reasonable (stretchy word that) and desirable?<br />
<br />
A big boost in WIS or INT sounds nice, but it is apparently not that hard to approach the caps on those stats now.  Flowing Thought is always desirable, but maybe too powerful.  But it does seem to be a natural place for focus effects, doesn't it?  or right click effects?<br />
<br />
Is this the way for shaman to finally get Improved Invisbility?  Or a non-potion Invis to Undead?<br />
<br />
Would a charm of cornocopia allow you to remove the food and drink from your bags?  <br />
<br />
Or raise the wearer's resistance to curses - not MR or Dr - just curses.<br />
<br />
or increase the wearer's resist to nukes or AE's?  pvp would love that - say roll twice and take the higher roll  8)'<br />
<br />
I just would like to see creativity on the effect similar to the creativity used to tie the effect to weapon skills or whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nice to have charm for its novelty factor, and for those little bonus stats. However they like superrare, and not worth camping. There is a extended range 3 charm that drops in torgiran mines I tried for 12 hours, and didn't even see named spawn, other people have tried with similar results. Given up on charms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah but I see what you are saying Charms could have nice potential. It could have been put to better use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shubert TZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Give me hp on one</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>toradorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Give me hp on one<br />
<br />
I got this http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=19710 in Dulak. It has ooooh 10hp and 5 WIS on it. <br />
<br />
 One of the best charms, because it isn't going to go down depending on certain requirements. Once your specialization is up, it ain't gonna drop so you get full benefit of the charm all the time, no matter what.<br />
<br />
 The 5 WIS is nice, frees up another slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree with toradorm and found this charm extremly easy to camp...might have been luck, but I didnt spend much time camping it....cant beat free stats :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hildaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I got a Charm Of Decption at the Shrine in Nadox, when in bearform it adds 10 Dex, 6 Sta, 10 CHA, now sure, the dex and cha really do not matter much, but 6 STA is 17 free hp. and I tend to use Bearform whenever I am indoors anyway.<br />
<br />
PS: Was not camping it, the guy just Poped, so I killed him. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The Shimmering Emerald deal from Dulak is by far the best charm I have seen and it is pretty much permacamped.<br />
<br />
It really does seem like SOE could have done more with the &quot;special&quot; charm slot.  They basically treated it as another straight stat item that changes in the same way that recommended level items do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I got a Crystal Dewdrop in Dulak off an Oceancrasher Deckhand. I wasn't even on the Oceancrasher when I got it, I was camping the boathouse just off the dock and the mob that stands in front of the building dropped it. <br />
<br />
It adds +4 to AC and all saves when it rains or snows.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind I've camped this spot so many times I lost count and only seen it drop once. I didn't even know it dropped. Allakahzams didn't even add it till a month after I got mine so needless to say it was a very nice surprise and a nice addition to what was an empty slot. :)<br />

&quot;&gt;Charms&lt;/a&gt;<br />
<br />
However, this convinced me that i won't waste even an hour to camp charms, they are goodies, nothing more...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">From the pre-LoY hype (and from the LoY website), I thought charm were going to be more personal (ie, you could create them specifically for your character - combine a few dropped items together in a forge/loom/brew barrel to create a charm).<br />
<br />
Sounded nice, but in reality it's just another camp/time sink.</div></div><hr />
