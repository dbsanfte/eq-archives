<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If your not too busy chasing the &quot;great pumpkin&quot; around in EQ this weekend, you might want to check out this free world preview of GuildWars MMO. It's already started, lots of fun so far.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm trying this, not bad. Can't believe how quick its downloaded too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the guys who founded arena.net did the networking code for battlenet and wow, it's streaming technology so all you download to start the game is a small client, the zones and everything constantly stream to your machine so it's updating while you play the game<br />
<br />
i remember one 4 team pvp battlefield in the last preview event (e3 for everyone) where one of the players was evidently on a dial-up.  after a 35 min battle our team was victorious but strangely we didn't get a mission win/lose dialogue for several minutes after the battle.<br />
<br />
a couple of min after the end of the fight, we got a heads-up message &quot;player XXX has entered the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
poor sap on dial up took 40 minutes to load the new battleground, which was less than a minute on cable...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">These guys are SMART - no monthly fee when it's released.  I'll defiitely have this on hand for when I don't feel like playing WoW or EQ2.  The game is good, fast, fun fluff.  Remarkably fun for what it is, which is a lot like wasabi or cotton candy.  You don't consume it to get full, just for the enjoyment of the stuff in itself.  Tho if I tried to have it every day, it'd get real old, real fast.<br />
<br />
Two thumbs up for a game to FINALLY provide a good quality replacement for Diablo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I thought that their business model was no monthly fees, but frequent updates which you paid for (if you wanted that particular update). It will probably generate the same revenue stream in the end, as long as people play. And if they dont buy the updates, the money stops and overhead costs cause the game to fall on its face :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One of the things I appreciate the most about it is that the model doesn't call for people to play every month in order for them to collect their money.  Content and encounters can be designed to satisfy the player after one or two run-throughs, because they'll continue to get money if they just design fun new stuff.</div></div><hr />

Totally unlike another company that we all know very well that continues to get money even though they release one bug-infested expansion after another.<br />
<br />
It actually kinda scary that you cant be sure which approach will make the biggest profits...or maybe you can and since its EQ its even more scary!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I don't think they will have a problem with their business model. Blizzard still continues to run Battlenet free of charge, as they have for years and years. They don't charge a monthly fee to play.<br />

I had a fun 3 days playing this game. I made a monk/ranger. Monk has many shaman like skills, and the ranger 2ndary allowed me to have a pet warthog to take with me...not the same as old wolfie, but fun.<br />
<br />
Things that I immediately liked:<br />
How they handle their buffs, mana regen, spell casting.<br />
In game cut scenes for missions makes it a bit more involving/fun.<br />
Pet warthog leveled up from killing, just like PC's.<br />
Fast paced gameplay, little/no downtime, super regen when all nearbye monsters are dead. Cosentual PVP.<br />
Travel is instant between &quot;areas&quot;....friends are just a click away<br />
<br />
8 skill limit is a blessing and a curse.....hard to decide what role to take before going on a mission. Can't change on the fly once you have started. Makes for a lot of strategic decisions.</div></div><hr />
