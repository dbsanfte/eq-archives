<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sooda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone, I'm a new Troll shammie on Innoruuk My Main is a 62 Enchanter, and a slew of other characters... I have managed to level up my lil troll to 29, and just found these forums (GREAT RESOURCE) I have searched thru, but didn't find my answer, when looking through profiles of level 40-50 shaman, I notice not many have very high wisdom at all, (110-120range).. My wisdom now (With kei) is a little over 200... Should I not be putting such a value on wisdom? am I hurting my character?<br />
<br />
Anyway, Will put up a magelo one of these days, just was looking for some opinions,<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

1) AC - less damage taken per hit = more hitpoints to convert to mana.<br />

I have noticed cannie just doesn't seem super efficient way to regen mana untill cannit 5 + Topor -- with regeneration/Cannie1 at level 24, and then Cannie3/Chloro/Stoicisom(sp) at a little higher level.. does it really &quot;Help&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Used to be difficult for shaman below 50 to get good Wis gear.  I think you'll find yourself carrying situational gear for downtime and initial buffing -- if you have that +7 Wis ring, put it on when you're done hunting.  It's OK if you need the mana for initial buffs, etc.  Like Glori said, it's one of many factors to consider.  Looking at some of the lovely (and cheap!) LoY, Luclin, and Planar items that are plentiful now, you should be able to do very well no matter what your playstyle is.<br />
<br />
What we have is mana regeneration -- we can get it back very fast.   Can1 and regen balance out nicely, and we come out right around Clarity-level mana regen if we Canni dance.  Worth it to me.<br />
<br />
Can2 and Chloroplast (or better, Stoicism!) tip the scales a bit further.  Can3 and Regrowth is lovely -- Can4 and Torpor is godlike.  Can5 and Torpor is obscene.<br />
<br />
Here's the rub, though:  We're filling our mana pool back up.  You can NOT cast as much as quickly as some of the other casters can, but you can keep doing it forever.  We are the masters of sustainability.  If we can root it and slow it, we can kill it.<br />
<br />
Weigh things carefully: <br />
- You draw a lot of agro when you slow and dot.  HP/AC.<br />
- You wincing in the corner trying to pull mana outta your arse for that needed heal cuz the cleric's a nuking fool:  Hm, maybe 14 more Wis might have helped a tad, but OH, I need HP or I'll cannibalize to where -- URK!<br />
<br />
I strongly suggest a target wisdom around 150-160.  Good solid mana pool there, and gives you lots of room for HP and AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">honestly i never use cani 4 unless i am getting rezed then ill cani 5 / quisc and then cani 4  quisc rince repeat till fm  it reallly depends on what situation im in  like earth rings i use alota mana heh   well anyways  i never used regen / cani till i was lvl 40 or so cause i was afraid id die during the process or not know when to cani   and when not to</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>howjan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Your alternative to can would be sitting to med.  At lower lvls you could sit to gain hps/mana stand up and can some, rinse repeat.  It yeilds less down time compared to the other priests of equal lvl/gear/buffs.  You could stand and gain mana back... It really depends on how you want to use the skill and what situation your in.  Don't sacrifice hps/ac for wisdom, but don't avoid it like a frenzied hooker either.  If you have the space maybe carry a couple of extra pieces of gear, stuff you can swap out depending on the situation, some xtra hps for this, xtra wis for that and so on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">one of the things i have noticed at lv 56 is that with 230+ wis is that it is very unusual for me to run out of mana , when i get to about 40% i start cann/sto and almost don't sit at all , and if i am in an outdoor zone i have my horsey up , but even in an indoor zone i very rarely have to say that i am lom (unless i have been screwing off ;) <br />
but self buffed i can still hit 3khp  :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Slissia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Apparently frenzied hookers don't want AC/HP?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">from my browsing the boards, what you focus on changes as you advance your shaman. in the early levels, wis items dont add that much to mana pool, so adding mana directly seems to be the better choice. i followed this advice, and also equipped myself with hp gear as well. from my own experience (42 now), i am now in process of dumping some hp gear for some wis gear (getting acrylia studded cloak for back for example -- +10 wis - also put away 6/65 ring for later and using fine antique ring now for the mana preservation focus effect). it seems that i blow through my mana fast, and have a ton of hp left after a single pull (i like to malaise, slow, weaken, VoS, root sick doggie-maybe i should look into that strategy as well)even with kei, so i am looking to up my wis (about 130 i think-check sig). someone said about 150-160 is a good number, thats about what im looking to get in the not too distant future, maybe about 145 or so in near future. <br />
<br />
also, post a magelo profile so everone can see what gear you have. 200 wis is great if you got some uber stuff, but if you have an AC of like 300, then my opinion would be to get rid of the wis for some more hp/ac.</div></div><hr />

Don't go outta your way to avoid it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wudoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Blast me later...but large mana pool is very important until you have Cann V and Torpor.  Stoicism may change that earlier now but it takes time to cannabalize and having mana when you need it is what's important.  At the earlier levels cannabalize really helps with downtime, however isn't a real practical answer in the heat of a quick battle.  With the easy availability of KEI these days, lower level characters rarely, if ever, run out of mana anyway.  I realize my advice is different than the norm, but with the changing times and the ease of the game these days, cannabalize just isn't used in the earlier levels like it was.  HP's and AC are still important, and once you have Cann V and Torpor, HP's rule all...but until then a large mana pool is the answer. <br />
<br />
G'luck with the shaman :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't go outta your way to avoid it.<br />
<br />
Frenzied hookers are something to be avoided?   /boggle!<br />
<br />
Higher Wis in a shaman of your level and at least till Can III is for how much mana do I have for this ONE particular fight and how much do I have in a pinch.  If a fight's going badly, the last thing you want your shaman to say is &quot;root and back off, so I can get more mana.&quot;  Higher Wis avoids this by allowing you to use more pure mana before you have to convert HP into mana on any single fight.<br />
<br />
I've said it before, concentrations change as your levels and functions change.  Earlier on, AC is king, because you're in teh face a lot.  Then Wis is good, because HP&gt;mana conversion isn't efficient at the low mid levels.  Finally, HP's are key because CAN is your clarity.<br />
<br />
Don't try to confuse your gear requirements with the gear requirements of someone 60+, they ain't the same!  You won't have a single piece of equipment that's the same once you make 60, that you're wearing now (unless you got twinked with something like a Solstice earing).  Gear yourself for the next 15 levels, not the next 30.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Gear yourself for the next 15 levels, not the next 30.<br />

Beautimus!  Fantabulous!  Something to bear in mind particularly in today's twink culture.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I equip myself as if I'm a tank, although maybe with slightly more of a focus on hitpoints and less on ac.  I've ended up with 161 wis.  I can't recall a situation, ever, where I'd have been better off with fewer hitpoints and more mana.  Hitpoints are a great buffer for when you bounce slows, get an add, etc.<br />
<br />
Perhaps there are types of gameplay, at lower levels, where wis is more important.. Examples are a shaman who exclusively groups, or someone who frequently has to go afk (can't canni while afk but you can med)  At higher levels though there is less of a margin for error.  Getting slow resists in PoV, which is only tier2 and where exp mobs hit relatively weak (550ish max), is downright frightening... but survivable thanks to a focus on ac and hitpoints.</div></div><hr />

Question (not a flame) on one of the posts above from Frostpaw,<br />
<br />
At L 56 with self buffs you have 3k HP.<br />
<br />
How are you doin that?  Could you list your gear or put up your magelo,<br />
at L 58 with my own buffs I usually hit 2200HP<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">This used to be a source for some substantial arguments.  One side argues that the larger hit point pool means more life to use for mana, and a greater chance to survive an encounter.<br />
<br />
The other side says the greater the mana pool, the more can be stored and used... <br />
<br />
Realistically (to me anyway) what matters is how often you have down times during grinding and raids.  Depending on how many, has it been because of deaths (too little hitpoints/AC) or because of OOM (too small a mana pool) or because of both (too optimistic of puller =))?<br />
<br />
My magelo's a bit out of date, but I have been tending of late to either get items that (in effect) extend the mana pool (Obulus Death Shroud effectively = 10% greater mana pool AND 10% faster mana regen) AND items that add AC, Wis, and Hitpoints (Recently acquired Coral Ring, working on the Luggald Flesh ring).<br />
<br />
My shaman is as much a pack-rat as my ranger... each has 3 or 4 bags of equipment always with them, swapping out as times require.  I usually trapse around with Wisdom over 200, buffed AC in the mid 900s, and buffed HitPoints around 2200.  I live, my friends live, the mobs die (and there was much rejoicing).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>gummox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Shandy was the only person to mention canni-dancing, which is very important at lower levels.  Chain casting canni 1 really isn't much faster than meditating.<br />
<br />
You need to set up a hotkey that looks something like this:<br />
<br />
/stand<br />
/cast 1 (or whatever gem your canni spell is in)<br />
/pause 20 (i'm just guessing on the pause time, 20= 2 seconds and should be enough time to finish casting canni)<br />
/sit<br />
<br />
To use it properly wait till you see your hp or mana tick then hit the button.  When you sit back down, you'll still get the meditation mana regen as if you were sitting the whole time.  This takes a little effort, but with canni and meditation being about equal mana regen speed, you're pretty much doubling your mana regen.<br />
<br />
Of course you don't need to do this with a horse, since you can chain cast canni and meditate at the same time.</div></div><hr />

but i can hit over 200 on most stats will kragg's and infusion and standard buffs yes i now that that is supposed to be fixed but ill deal with that when it comes up<br />
and i can hit 2648 hp and yes my ac is low however i have found that if i wait 5-10 seconds tops i can slow/malo and not get hit and i can also root/slow/malo adds and very rarely get beat to death (usually when there are3+ adds and they all agro off the slow) I'll try and update my gear somtime tonight  :rolleyes: <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">do you group or are  you solo?<br />
<br />
I think that this is probably the biggest factor.<br />
<br />
when I soloed all the time I was mainly worried about not getting hit at all, and then if I did, I wanted enough HP to be able to take the beating well, and enough mana to take care of what I was fighting, and if things went bad, I wanted enough extra mana to get me out of the situation. so in this scenario, I would say only have enough wis to make your pool big enough to kill the mob with about 20-30% mana left. focus then on AC and HP.<br />
<br />
but at this point in time I am grouping (2 boxing actually) and I am finding that I need more mana than I had needed previously, partly because I am fighting tougher mobs, and partly because I am fighting in tougher areas. so now I am going to target for 900 ac (cause I don't want to die when I do get hit, dying with a full mana pool sucks) and as much hp as I can get and still have about 190-200 wis. this should make my pool large enough to allow the warrior to tank 3 mobs at once both before I have slowed them (heals) and while I am slowing them. this is the cruicial part of the fight and after this the rest is just waiting to kill so that the warrior can get to full health for the next few mobs. I have found that with 160 wis that I can comfortably do 3 mobs at once, it is dicey, but challenging and fun, I think that with 200 wis and 900 ac that I will be able to slow 4 mobs, my warrior will be able to tank them, and the shaman will be able to take some agro while healing and slowing.<br />
<br />
I may find that I need more wis, or the warrior needs more HP, or that I need more HP and AC, but from my anecdotal trials, I have found that with higher wis I can do 3 mobs easier than I could previously. that was from 145 wis to 160 wis, so I think that going up to 200 will put me at the level I want to be at.<br />
<br />
of course stoicism could change this whole ratio for me (and likely will) but I want to get 49 before I go out to dulak, I can't effectively single pull them yet, and while I can do multiples, it really leaves me drained and the downtime isn't worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Wincer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">What about the soft cap?  If you have all the AC and HP you want, what's the max effective WIS for your mana pool?  It used be 200.  You could go over that, but you wouldn't get as much mana per point of WIS.  I heard that's changed, but I can't find out what's changed.  Is there any point in spending AAs to go over 255 WIS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Hitpoints are not more important than wisdom for shaman mana purposes, stop spreading that misinformation! HP regen is the key, not the hitpoints themselves. Hitpoints for us are just what they are for other classes- buffers for beatings/nukings.<br />
<br />
Look for mixes of ac/hp/wis in your gear. Going too low in any of these is just plain stupid- running around with 110 or 120 wis is just as bad as having 400ac at 60 or 1200 unbuffed hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Grull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">If you look hard enough you can find HP gear that has Wis. also. Check my profile. My AC is a tad lower than I want but not horrible. Almost none of what I have is no-drop and I have 2110 HP,932 AC and 204 wis (base of 90).At level 57 .

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">As an old school shaman, i have been through all the revelations as to what is best for the class.  Pre kunark it was wisdom all the way, and you ended up seeing shaman in gatorscale leggings and banana boots (shudder).  When Kunark came out and mobs all of a sudden started hitting for a lot more damage, the AC revolution came about, and suddenly you had shamans with 220 wis, have instead 1300 ac and 130 wis.  When Luclin and PoP came out and with it Cann V  everyone started realizing that they needed loads of hps do deal with the insane dps the mobs were putting out as well as making sure you had enough to cann V.  <br />
<br />
Personally, when considering gear you should take into account your play style as well as the style of mobs you are going to be fighting.  Personally, i think a balance of ac/wis/hps is needed with a slight leaning towards ac/hps post 50.  This is my magelo for my normal, non raiding equipment <br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=639124<br />
<br />
Notice I dont have globs of ac, nor do i have an insane hp/wis amount.  I have been trying to balance the three out along with magic/fire/cold resists.  Nowdays you can get decent hp/ac/wis gear in the bazaar for bargain prices.  <br />
<br />
One last thing, its not the gear that make a shaman its how he performs his duties.  Last night i joined a pickup group in PoN, and the enchanter in my group started advising me on when to slow mobs.  As it turned out the shaman before me got killed twice when he slowed too early and the tank couldnt taunt off.  After about 10 minutes or so of constant pulls and a few resistant slows the enchanter told me he felt a lot more comfortable now that i was in the group and later said i was the best shaman he had ever grouped with</div></div><hr />
