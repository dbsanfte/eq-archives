<br />
Being bored and not being able to find a group often leads me to POI. This may seem crazy but is extremly fun :D you summon alpha pet (haste mask is nice too) then u find a single DB mob near ent and pull with a malosi. run back to exit set pet on it a slow. when its slowed root, plague, EBolt then canni dance.<br />
<br />
takes about 3 rounds of ebolt to kill it along with pet and plague. also u need to heal pet so almost all mana goes. (may want to re apply slowhalf waqy through) This was highly fun and i received 3 blue dots per kill. which was nice.<br />
<br />
Youll need c3/4/5 and if possible a POTG,POTN. i dont have a horse but i see that would be god like. If you pull 2. zone..... so you will need a fair amount of mage weaps in your bag for pet.<br />
<br />
Tell me how this goes if anyone trys it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmmm. Never tried soloing in PoI before. I should think that it's not easy though, so nice one.<br />
<br />
I shall have to try that tonight. <br />
<br />
I've tried soloing in PoN before, but I've come to the conclusion that the amount of downtime just ain't worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">wow impressive!  i soloed a couple of the buggers at 55  and nearly died twice- had epic and horse  aegolism/crack.  <br />
<br />
i have a little cheat here-  *edited*  erm on second thoughts....<br />
<br />
anyway good work on the soloing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>throxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I tried an erratic model there at 51. With KEI and alpha pet I was able to get it down to about 30% health when Instill and Turgurs broke at the same time. Dog lasted just long enough for me to get my slow and first round of DoTs on the mob. Didn't bother healing him because he was going down way to fast and would have been a huge mana sink. When I zoned, I had 50% HPs and about 50% mana. I zoned because with about 1600 buffed HPs, an unslowed erratic model would have killed me in the time it took to reroot. It was hitting me for max 248X2 and without slow it was hitting me fast.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I thought that if I would have refreshed slow during the fight things would have been much different. So after medding to full HP/mana back I went for another round. On my second attempt I was unable to get a single pull the next three trys and decided it wasn't worth it to keep resummoning dog and having to canni/med after buffing him and decided to put it off until I am a bit higher. I am 52 atm and will probably head back when I get to 54 or so.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I duo'd PoI ent with a 53 mage one night and his earth pet had no problems tanking slowed models. We both got outstanding xp and there was a noticeable difference in the aggro radius for him at 53 than for me at 51 so pulls were a lot soother.</div></div><hr />
