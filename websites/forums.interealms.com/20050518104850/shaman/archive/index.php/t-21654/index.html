Wow, some nice changes in there for once, I think sony might have found somone who actually PLAYS on a zek to talk to this time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here’s another set of PvP changes we’d like some feedback on.  Right now the plan is to have a beta server specifically for the PvP changes set up sometime in the next couple weeks that players will be able to copy their characters to and test out the new changes.  All of the things on this list are subject to change, and we will likely be adding and subtracting things from it based on feedback.<br />
<br />
 -Stun effects will now cause a player to “fall off” their horse.<br />
<br />
-Horses will no longer be immune to movement rate effects such as root and snare.<br />
<br />
-The amount of damage done by archery in PvP will be increased to 80% up from 66%.<br />
<br />
-Player melee mitigation will be reduced to 80% in PvP down from 100%.<br />
<br />
-Spell effects will only be able to do a maximum of 40% of the target’s maximum HP.<br />
<br />
-Melee combat range will be increased 50% in PvP<br />
<br />
-Archery and throwing will work on the vertical access, allowing players to attack other characters who are significantly above or below them.<br />
<br />
-Rogues, Monks, and Warriors will receive new abilities for use in PvP.  This can and most likely will extend to other classes as the testing and beta progresses.<br />
<br />
-Resurrection effects will be more potent from a PvP death in order to prevent bind rushing.<br />
<br />
-Higher level spells will generally have a better chance of landing in PvP.  This is to balance the prevalence of resist gear at higher levels, and lack at lower levels.  <br />
<br />
-Certain spells will have a different duration when applied in PvP.  This is generally aimed at modifying the duration of severely crippling spells such as snare, enthrall, and root.  Coupled with the modified resist settings, this should allow those tools to be used in PvP in a more balanced way.<br />
<br />
-Dying in PvP will cause you to spawn in Shadowrest fully equipped.  You will leave a naked corpse at the location you died, similar to low level deaths.  We realize this would change the way Rallos Zek works, effectively removing item loot form the server, and are currently debating alternatives for that server.<br />
<br />
-Pumice stones will make a come back, although limited by a recast timer, and perhaps other down sides.<br />
<br />
-We’re considering modifying the way the team servers work to be more dependant on your guild associations rather then your race or deity selection.  Essentially, you could attack anyone that wasn’t in your guild.  This would address most of the balance concerns voiced over certain teams not having access to all classes, as well as the cross teaming issues that arise from the current team structures.  We’ll have a poll up shortly to get an idea of how this would be received.<br />
<br />
Again, this is an initial list and very much subject to change.  We thought it would be a good idea to get it up and get some initial feedback from you all as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
I took 500+ posts in the office pool.  Don’t let me down!<br />

<br />
the only one I dont like is the mitgation nerf, the last thing pvp needs is a large nerf to casters and a huge boost to melees swinging things from one side to the other all at once. I think the increased melee range is enough and if its not then add the mitigation nerf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">-Dying in PvP will cause you to spawn in Shadowrest fully equipped.

<br />
Uh... huh. Well, I don't really mind the &quot;respawn in shadowrest&quot; part, but, no loot for the guy that got ya? What's the damned point?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I bought my horse specifically for the reason that i could still move when i was snared, not the mana regen.  I can make enough mana whenever i want to, but being able to move while snared was the reason i got my pony.  Ill just sell it back if they are going to nerf my need for it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rangers are going to love the buff up to 80% dmg again.  I remember they nerfed this a while back to 66% and less if the ranger was moving, but it looks like i may relvl the ranjah.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think they need to relook over the melee mitigation.  Melees are already weaker in most PvP.  The only thing they can do is hit you when they get close.  Casters can root, and from the looks of this post its gonna be easier to root, and step back and nuke.  Why take away the only thing that a melee can do?<br />
<br />
I like the mitigation done on spells.  But my question here is will that also consider lifeburn/manaburn/DT?  If so there are gonna be some mad casters, and i like it :)<br />
<br />
<br />
The making of archery/throwing turn on a vert axis is way overdue.  I never understood why i couldnt stand on a wall or a building and throw stuff off it.  Maybe not be able to throw to the top of the wall if i was on the bottom, but yeah, i should be able to throw downward.<br />
<br />
Anyway those are my comment on the PvP changes.  I do like the idea of making the PvPteams servers changed into PvPguilds server, as in you can attack anyone not in your guild, but what about those that dont guild?  This is gonna force them to find a guild, even if they dont want to.  I still think it would be easier to hardcode the server and have people play the way the servers were intended.  I would love to watch all the whining after that patch hehe :) <br />
<br />
Just my 2cp...<br />

<br />
  By the way I read that, is it ONLY on RZ that you can loot your opponent for an item?  I thought that was on all PvP.  I guess this makes the point system more appealing though.<br />
<br />
  May have to roll a PvP character if the PvP only abilities are cool enough :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It certainly is improving.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was under the impression that you got cash on all PvP servers, cash + one nonbagged non-nodrop item on Rallos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As far as I know thats the way it works Murtak.  With the other exception being Sullon, where you loot a medallion of some sort for all pvp kills over level 20.  the Medallion can be turned in for something, and according to the previous patch to PVP you can aslo get tribute effects/armors for it (IIRC).<br />
<br />
Interesting set of changes.  I think casters are going to make a stink.  Reducing their possible dalage to 40% per cast will hurt a few classes (Wizards and SK'; I dont think anyone else could do that type of massive damage) while reducing the effectiveness of root/snare hurts most of the casting classes.  Funny that they will be easier to land now, but wont be as effective.<br />
<br />
I think the falling off your horse idea is interesting.  Maybe it could be expanded to any hit that takes off a significant portion of your total health;  I know getting hit with an arrow or an ice comet to the chest would probably knock me off my old nag.<br />
<br />
Increased melee range.  Hmm.  Ya know, I think with the changes to spells and melee that casters should get a melee upgrade.  If their spells arent gonna pack as much punch and thier avenues to keep away from the melee not as effective (root/snare. etc) that they should have some way to stand up and defend themselves.  Sure, one on one a robe is very doubtfull to best a melee, but they might be able to survive long enough to be able to pull someting out of their hat.  Again, I dont PVP aside from the occasional duel, so I may be way off base here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">on RZ, you loot all money and 1 item not in bag or weapon slot.<br />
<br />
On SZ you loot all money.<br />
<br />
Not sureo n others</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Vallon and Tallon = Cashloot only</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have reservations about LB, somthing tells me that once again this one will make it through unchanged. <br />
the mitgation is a BOOST for melees, not a nerf, you will mitigate 20% LESS than before the result is more damage taken from pvp melee damage. <br />
<br />
they could probably make you spawn with gear but leave your cash on the corpse, I know I would be pissed if I lost the ability to gank people for cash.<br />
<br />
but this list is surpirsingly good, much better than the previous pile of crap. combine the 2 and things will probably work out fairly well and god forbid just might be what it takes to get me into eq2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Too little, Too late... lineage2 is fun on Bartz because of the drama and the lack of hacks but i'm missing EQ.  Not enough to come back for this though.... Nothing is mentioned about LB/HT nerfing.  Nothing is mentioned about giving Shamans some type of 'lure&quot; spell.  Nothing is mentioned about getting the GM's off of evil team on Sullon Zek(heh i got this from reading SZ boards, never actually seen a GM on Hate's Nutz).  Most importantly though, nothing is said about taking care of MacroQuest and ShowEQ on sullon zek.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Do auged items add a nodrop tag to droppable items on RZ?  If so, due to the ease of getting simple augs, then I would think very few people would have un-augged items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Shaman spells STILL need boosting, even after malos I had a bazaar geared necro resist 2 BoS and 2 BoN while tapping me for 600 or so with ease.<br />
<br />
and yes simple augs make drop gear no drop on rallos. the sad part of rallos is the imbalance of item loot between casters and melee's, balance might be achieved if melees could steal spells from spell books instead of nothing from a naked caster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">&quot;Rangers are going to love the buff up to 80% dmg again. I remember they nerfed this a while back to 66% and less if the ranger was moving, but it looks like i may relvl the ranjah&quot;<br />
<br />
Archery was only useful against casters.  Against most melee, who had high mitigation, archery was pretty much pointless with my hunter.  Hunter archery in pvp was probably the greatest myth I can think of in my 5 years playing EQ.  Any ranger will tell you that EQ/AM3 is still misunderstood by most of the non-ranger community even today.<br />
<br />
Although a number of you are worried about mb/ht, I'm willing to bet that the 40% damage cap on spells will take care of that.  Although, like another person said, wondering how that'll affect lb.  This cap should be lowered to 30ish% in my mind, but of all the changes, this seems like the best one they've implemented so far for higher end pvp.<br />
<br />
Extending melee range and reducing mitigation goes a long ways towards helping melee.  80% mitigation seems just about right too.  But what I really like is the range modifier.  50% change is huge.  If you've ever been in mass pvp, you're always running around, ganking the stupid caster who sat down, searching for that cleric or enchanter, etc.  Increasing the range on my nasty 2hander by 50% is huge!  Now, about that animation on my 2HB...<br />
<br />
Horses were unbalancing.  People can bitch all they want about this one, but horses should have been affected by snare.<br />
<br />
I really really like the idea of letting more spells land (not that wizards needed the help) but mitigating their potency in a real way.  A creative idea to help with higher end pvp.<br />
<br />
Now, for all you who think this matters, you're all dip****s.  Once Sony remembers where the money comes from, Zek servers will become the red headed step child once again and be forgotten.  In fact, and this is a pretty solid prediction, the changes they make now will be in place for at least another year before they review how they affected pvp.  These changes could cripple 2 or 3 classes and nothing would be done for a long time.  Zek servers have the lowest population - they will never receive the attention they need.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not meaning to flame here so dont take it that way.  This is just the views a Zekker.  I know how it is on blue servers.  I play on Maelin as well as TZ.  I have a 64bst on maelin now and am progressing the planes.  The Zeks arent the &quot;red headed step children&quot; like you may think.  They are just servers where most of the population realizes that they are playing a different game.  Noone starts on the Zeks with the goal in mind to finish the end content of the game.  They may think it will happen eventually but it isnt their main goal.  The reason you start a Zek char is to pvp.  Play against a thinking person, not a computer with a known way of being defeated.  Anyone that starts on a Zek needs to realize the potential of their class in pvp in all the lvls.  And i for one am not one to complain when i dont get my way in pvp balancing.  I picked a sham and i dont complain about the fact that i cant pvp very well, i live with it.  Dont get me wrong tho, i love a good mass pvp fight.  That is a shams forte, imo.<br />

Sorry bro, but i dont think this change is going to matter in the slightest to SKs.  Sure they wont be able to try and DT at 75pct, they will need to wait for 40pct, but thats not too bad.  The rest of thier casting wont be affected, and now with the melee increase of 50pct better range, they are gonna be a HELL of a lot stronger then before.  I will not be surprised to see SKs rise to the top of pvp classes, along with Chants and bards (which are only good pvpers cause they wont die).  But Wiz, and mages, and yes chants will hurt from this change.  Chants will still be damn good tho from dire charmed pets, mez, slow, and their self rune.  Overall wiz will hurt the most from this change, and i cant wait for the cries to start up :)<br />

Thus making it impossible to loot anything anyway. So im not sure why not looting anyhting is that big a deal. <br />
<br />
I could be wrong ofcourse, i have yet to delv into PvP. Though its looking alot more fun lately.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfreakingbelievable!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Which is why I posted the comment about zeks being the red headed step children of eq, phattey.<br />
<br />
But the fact of the matter is, anything that takes away one shot kills with the click of a button is a good thing.  Lifeburn/Harmtouch/Manaburn/Trueshot/Spell Crits are all things that unbalanced pvp, and they're all things that need to be reformed.  Pvp shouldn't be about one shot kills, but it should be more about skill and experience.<br />
<br />
As far as Sony changing the rules on rallos, well, I think that's a load of ****.  Some of you may not understand what's the big deal, but log on to the server sometime.  For your first 20 levels, you'll rarely see somebody wearing gear.  And if they're a twink, you'll understand the attraction of the server when everybody tries to gank that person.<br />
<br />
One of my best memories in EQ was ganking some guy in kurns with my shaman.  Earlier that day, he had been beating up on me, and he stole 3 silly pieces of leather armor from me.  Guy was a few levels higher than me.  So, I waited for him to go into kurns (I was invisible, and hiding on the ledge, watching him in 3rd person view).  I then zoned in, grabbed a few skellies, and trained him as he was fighting a badger.  Kept him blinded so he couldn't run away and bag his gear, waited for him to get low on life, then I nuked him before the mobs killed him, all out of revenge.  Ran over, looted his body, expecting to get my leather tunic back that he appeared to be wearing at the time, only to find that it was a fungi!  I can assure you, few things are more satisfying than beating up on a bully and taking his favorite toy.<br />
<br />
Taking away memories like that for people is a crime.  Not only should they keep that system in place on rallos, but they should also fix the augments so that people can still loot the gear.  But that's just my 2 cp.<br />
