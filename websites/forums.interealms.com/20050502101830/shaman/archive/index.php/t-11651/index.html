<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering what the best 2boxable duo partner would be for taking down the biggest possible named mobs and helping get some of my guild members (not an uber guild by any means) get better equipped. I am thinking of killing mobs in HoT / Seb / WW / Kael, or whatever else is recommended and would be doing this between levels 60-65.<br />
<br />
Currently I am a level 60 shaman with no malo / torpor yet, do have epic and decent armor. The second char can be decently equipped, pretty much any class. While I would prefer to avoid a charm class, if that is the best way to go I could probly pull it off.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help  :D</div></div><hr />
