<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rygo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was thinking about creating a troll shaman. As we all know, TRL SHM can be of 2 religions - Inny and Cazic. They each get a seperate diety necklace quest, and I am trying to figure out which necklace is more useful.<br />
note: iksars can use the cazic thule symbols as well<br />
note: all troll shamen can obtain a mask via a quest in neriak that has 1 charge illusion halfling :D<br />
<br />
Regent Symbol of Innoruuk (neriak) (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1254)<br />
casts Clinging Darkness (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=344&amp;source=Live)<br />
magic based 30% snare that lasts over 6 ticks (36 seconds)(could be extended by focus items)<br />
also does a little damage, but that isnt important<br />
cast time: 6.0<br />
<br />
Initiate Symbol of Cazic Thule (paineel) (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1207)<br />
casts Spook the Dead (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=209&amp;source=Live)<br />
undead-only fear that lasts 3 ticks (18 seconds)<br />
cast time: ?<br />
<br />
Disciple Symbol of Cazic Thule (paineel) (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1238) <br />
casts Panic Animal (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=241&amp;source=Live)<br />
animal-only fear that lasts 3 ticks (18 seconds)<br />
cast time: ?<br />
<br />
Anyone wanna suggest some pros and cons of these two necklaces effects? I'm trying to figure out which one will be more useful and powerful in 'the long run.' Thanks for your input!<br />
<br />
I'll start with some:<br />
Snare - always great to be able to snare if you're in a group that doesn't have snare<br />
Fear - Possibly extremely valuable soloing tool</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Having done the Regent Symbol of Innoruuk quest. You can also go back and redo the Disciple Symbol of Innoruuk which is a siphon strength necklace. The halfling mask is part of the Disciple quest. On the mask, it is useable only by CLR SHM,  DEF, HUM, TRL, you have to have the right faction to get this mask. I'm pretty sure, but not absolutely positive that it's Innoruuk only, I will check next time in game and post here..<br />
<br />
I know that even as an Innoruuk Shaman, I had to work on my faction to be able to start the Initiate Symbol quest. It just ment killing more halflings...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SilverD</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I personly prefer following innoruuk.  The snare has been considerably more valuable to me than fear would, plus the regent necklase has some decet stats (7 AC, 3 Wis, 15 Mana).  As well, as Smell mentioned, you can get an illusion halfling mask for the ocassional trip into the good cities.<br />
<br />
Regarding getting the faction needed to start the quest, you can get a note from a human, behind and above the fire pit near the trainer in grobb, that you can turn in to I think the quest giver in Nek/3rd gate that greatly increase faction.  Doing this twice allowed me to start the actual quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Snare, you can pet kite soooo easily.<br />
<br />
Panic animal is of next to no use without a snare, and of very limited use with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Didnt know about this early on ... Got my fear neck in da early 40s...<br />
<br />
Head to BW giant fort.. park on the west side by that fallen tree...<br />
Pull an undead mob (skelly/apes) and head into the bowl under the fort.  Make sure you go down halfway (else mob tends to path out)... Pop fear and stick hasted dogdog on mob .. 99% of the time the mob will path back and forth under the fort...<br />
<br />
Heh .. fear kiting</div></div><hr />
