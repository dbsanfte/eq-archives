The base listings seem to just be notes though I can't guarantee it. If you compare nukes and roots there will be odd entries. For instance, the original &quot;root&quot; spell and several others have -10000 on base2. Which doesn't seem to reflect any EXTREME properties except reducing motion to 0. Since it varies in entry from spell type to spell type it doesn't seem to define anything in particular. Wizard lures have the nuke size on base2, and our own nuke size is base1. Compare dots, buffs, etc.<br />
<br />
Max2 reflects the maximum percentage attack speed.<br />
Turgurs max2: 25<br />
Shas max2: 35<br />

Resist and Resistadj are ALLEGEDLY the only variables in determining how well a spell lands on a mob.</div></div><hr />
