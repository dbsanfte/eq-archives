Although I really love Dawnshroud, sometimes I want a change, so where are some other good 39+ soloable areas, especially on the moon if there are anymore.  I am looking for exp only, I do not care about zone loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trelad</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 11:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would stick with dawnshroud.  I lvled there from half way through 40 - 47 fighting larg zelniaks.  I went from 40-43 in about 11 hours and 44-45 in about 4 hours.  45 is slow in dawnshoud but doable.  Also you can go fight ulthork hunters and walrus'(fearkiteable) in EW.  Also if you have good weapons and equip you may be able to do Icefang(fearable) in EW.  He is definitly a challenge at 40.  But once i got 2 centi LS's he was ez.  He sometimes goes into a resisting phase and u will take alot of damage, root back up heal.  Its dangerous at 40 but doable.  Once i hit 46 i jumped around from DS and EW(mostly in EW) and made my way to 51 in about 3 weeks.  I probraly only lvled a total of 10 days during the 3 weeks.  And now at 51 im stumped on where to lvl.  I hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

But then that usally leads to a gruelling 3 hour cr so maybe I will just stay put.</div></div><hr />

Started doing him at 39, and he is very doable.  Don't pull him near ghost and you will be fine.  He is a roughly 4.5 min timer for respawn, and alternate cons white / blue at  39, and straight blue at 40.  And there is no faction hit for killing him.<br />
<br />
As a woodelf the ghost was indifferent to me as was Icefang.  Target Icefang, walk around back, back off to max range of snare and pull with it.  Being at max range should give you a second attempt to snare if first one is resisted.  Once snared kite in an arc around front of the ghost, give him a good distance.  If you try to kite Icefang behind the hut, you will get an occassional walrus add, I have never had an add since I started pulling him to the front.  This gives you a chance to plunk a few arrows in him, get flamelick going, and here is the key: ( I don't know why Rangers don't do this more often.) Do not engage until fear has landed.  I always see rangers engaging and trying to fear at the same time.  This is why they get hurt, and end up having to root, back off and heal, and then go at it again.  This just eats mana, and life people, and in the long run, cuts down your exp time, due to heal / med breaks.  Just get fear to land, and engage, count to 15 and recast fear, wash/rinse/repeat. If he gets fear resistant, and it doesn't land, just back off.  Do not go toe to toe. Turn off auto attack, ake a small run back (using your bow as you go) , recast fear and reengage. I have done this numerous times with out getting hit but a few times at lvl 39, and usually end up with over 80% life, and 80% mana.  With no break, run over and do the same thing to a Walrus.  After the walrus, sit down med, and by the time your full mana, Icefang will be back up.<br />
<br />
I did 39 in a few hours here..and am half way through 40 after just an hour.  I was getting over half a blue each kill at 39, and a steady half blue per kill at 40.  If you can get here with one other person, it is a really good camp.  Ice fang and walrus's.  HQ Walrus pelt is needed for Ring quests anyway.  The occassional walrus tooth, which is an ok piercer.<br />
<br />
Gear at 39 is (2) SSoY, Trueshot, some Ivy Etched and Rygor armor.<br />
<br />
Just some food for thought.<br />

45-50 in no time flat... just about 51 now. And like  Wolveryn said i can't stress DON'T GET HIT! 45 and 46 i had to med about every other fight because on a partial res i would tank while trying to recast in the long run the 5 seconds it takes to run backwards and recast on ice fang or the walruses will save you so much time. And its better to throw extra fears on than risk being hit. 10 mana for a extra panic vs 60 mana to heal 90 hp... sometimes he can double hit 90 each.... <br />
<br />
the only buff i ever keep up is SoW, and you can just harmony Korrigan when he is up and snare IceFang while standing 2 feet from him. But he is rarely up, i have no clue why he despawns, but always be shouting for a group at the fort if you can find em. The elite guard there drop the Ry'gorr pieces, the chief the chest piece.<br />
<br />
One in a while i'll make the run through kael to WL, tiger raptors are decent exp too and you can grab the guts needed for the ice foraged shakels, still can't kill the holgresh yet for the stick.<br />
<br />
Tried the haze panther at 49 but he ressed 8 snares, 2 fears, 2 roots........ got me down to 30% hp so i had to book out. Gona head back at 51. and watch out for the corrupted unicorn! DD'ed me for 1010 and kicked my ass... can't see through camo so no real worry if you are careful</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darlatan</div><div class="date">05-03-2002, 01:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At 40, go to Wakening Lands.  Kill the static tigeraptor spawns.  The exp there rivals the exp from dawnshroud from 42-44.  Not sure about 40 and 41 as I didn't go there until 42.  But you should be fine hitting tigeraptors.  Tigesaurous type is far over your head though at that level with that equipment, and Rapticor should be even at 42, so I'm sure you don't want to fight him.  :)<br />
<br />
Also, I understand that foraging yew leaves there sells for big bucks, and you can enter skyshrine and forage drake eggs, and mass slaughter orcs in CC for small pieces of velium, and then find a master smith to make you some velium studs, and then find a really, really high level tailor.  180+ at least, preferably 200+.  See about making tigeraptor armor, it's great stuff, especially the cloak.</div></div><hr />
