actually this was changed a couple patches back. I don t know if there is a limit, but you can keep up several slows. Um, at least the lowbie one, don t have the upgrade yet.<br />

*grin* <br />

It was a much needed change, too.  I think they got sick of hearing me complain. =p<br />
<br />
They still need to update those spell descriptions in game, though, and I'm guessing these spell lists were pulled from the database since the descriptions are the same.<br />
<br />
Do you play a Defiler?  I haven't talked to any of the 25+ ones.  They sound pretty cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Horomen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Im hoping to earn my defiler title this weekend =D This spell list was a very welcome change.<br />
<br />
(now that I am done farming crap for mastery tests FINALLY hah)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Agrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes both wailing haze and keening haze work on multiple mobs so does the second debuff I have curse of shielding.  There seems to be no increase in % slowd but useing Wailing on a high lvl mob gets you a &quot;this spells is not powerful enough to effect this monster&quot;.<br />
