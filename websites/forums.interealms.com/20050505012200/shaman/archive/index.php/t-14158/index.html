<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Itun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Reading alot of threads about the changes that was found on Test and some of you had liked the changes and others did not.<br />
<br />
While the buff changes or NERFS had been made on Test to disallow all high level buffs from buffing newbies on up until lvl 46. <br />
<br />
One of the most popular buff is the KEI buff. Many castors are after this buff like candy in almost every single play, whether it be be grouping or soloing (the latter for most people). <br />
<br />
Enchanters is making an enormous amount of PPs selling the KEI buff all day long.<br />
<br />
Now,after looking at the pros and cons of these changes from not only this forum but many other forums as well, expecially the Enchanter forum.<br />
<br />
My only conclusion is that none of these changes is hurting those who are anti-PLers. You play whatever you want to play, however you want to play. If you like to play your character nice, slow and fair, that's your business.<br />
<br />
Then there are those that LOVES KEI and will use it. That's their business as well.<br />
<br />
What irks me is that Sony is willing to go so far as to piss off the player base that loves to PL, especially from those that 2-3 box. Sony is making extra revenue from the 2-3 boxers. Because of this NERF, this will kill their (future) revenues from the 2-3 boxers.<br />
<br />
Sony/VI has a history of making idiotic and stupid business decisions that hurts their revenue/profits from the players. <br />
<br />
Not only they are hurting their revenue/profit base, they are also pissing off their customers. For the last 4-5 years, almost half of their business decisions (if not more) has done nothing but piss off their customers than those that has made them happy.<br />
<br />
Another thing about their history is that the staff of SoE (including Abashi and Absor) seems to love pissing off their customers. I've seen so many negeative postings on the forums equals the positive ones over the years that had me wondering just *** is Sony doing?<br />
<br />
Then it gets really bad that Sony shut down their Sony board. Then reopened it with warnings that if any negative postings is made on their boards, the player's account(s) will be banned from playing EQ.<br />
<br />
Negative feedbacks from customers is part of the normal rountine in business, I mean not just Sony, but any kind of business, whether it be retail, restuarants, etc.<br />
<br />
Without the customer, there can be no business. When there is no business, there can be no paycheck for everyone. <br />
<br />
Listening to negative feedbacks and weighing what is said to see if the feedback is valid. If it is valid, make the neccessary changes ONLY if it is cost effective.<br />
<br />
Of couse, I do not forget the fact that we cannot please everyone in business 100% of the time. I'm not forgetting that. But what I am seeing here in these NERF buff changes is hurting their profit base, including the profit base from the 2-3 boxers.<br />
<br />
Wasn't Sony giving out free accounts from their website, encouraging players to open more than one account some months ago? I thought that was a great marketing strategy. Good business sense even.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the bottom line is this, from the history business practice of Sony, it seems that they have a much preferable way of running a business by pissing off their customers than to please them....<br />
<br />
I am providing you a quote from Kelly Flock, former CEO of SOE who resigned last year after having had joined up with the SOE Dev Team in 2001. A UK Gaming Magazine (I don't remember the name of it, sorry. Someone else who remembers this quote may remember the name of the magazine. I hope someone can provide the name of it.) interviewed Flock in the same year Flock joined SOE. Those quote is an eye opener as to how Flock and the entire SOE staff thinks of us as customers...<br />
<br />
&quot;When asked if he takes into account consumer input Flock is dismissive, relying instead on the expertise of his staff. 'No, we never talk to consumers - they just f--- us up. Someone asked for a copy of our market research which made us take the decision to do EverQuest. I said we hadn't done any market research. Had we done, the game would never have been made. We never focus on them. Gamers don't know what they want. We just want to know if they have a valid credit card.'&quot;<br />
<br />
Basically what Flock is saying is that we're a bunch of mindless drones and all they care about is whether or not we have a valid credit card.<br />
<br />
Lum the Mad got a hold of a copy of the magazine and he was the first to rip it from the mag and posted it on his website. (formally www.lumthemad.net, he shut down the website a little over a year ago to join the DAoC Team)<br />
<br />
The same said quote got reposted a thousand times over in many websites in months time.<br />
<br />
A year later, Flock resigned.<br />
<br />
All I am saying is that these buff nerfs is only going to cause a loss of revenue from the 2-3 boxers because they won't be able to do that anymore, let alone those who already have done it. It just hurts the future profits from the 2-3 boxers who is thinking about doing it. They can just forget it now.<br />
<br />
Sony can't keep their heads screwed on right and see what sort of damage they can do to the customer base.<br />
<br />
But Sony doesn't care.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I feel sorry for those who seem to need the KEI buff to level.  Yes, it does help at early levels, but it is not neccesary.  Too many people are spoiled with KEI and quickly forget how to play the game without it.  I think that making it available to only those that are lvl 46 or above is a good thing.  This way people will learn to play their characters a little better and wont need to rely on it as much hopefully.  However, you can always pick up a C2 instead of KEI if you really want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe, but what about the business side of things? Won't Sony lose out on the revenues from the 2-3 boxers if they can no longer PL their toons because none of the caster's buff works below lvl 46?<br />
<br />
They used to give out free account numbers on their website in order to encourage more sign ups from single players who is thinking about starting a 2-3 box.<br />
<br />
Now the nerf pretty much does away with that marketing strategy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There were plenty of 2 boxers and plers before KEI and there will be plenty after the KEI &quot;nerf&quot;.  The sad truth is there really isn't anything Sony could do to lose much business until someone actually gives them some competition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">To imply that you can't pl without kei or the other buffs is crazy. If your pl'ing a melee and your pl'er is a caster over 46 all it means is you have to heal more often, or bind wound or whatever. Also means that pl'ers will be more gear reliant, meaning hp items will rise in price possibly and regen items will as well. I've pl'ed plenty of toons using both my druid and my shaman and have never gotten a kei for them to level, I have gotten free kei's so I can sit in a corner and catch up on my casting skills. <br />
Pl will go slower, but its not a big deal really IMHO, the people being hurt are the true newbs who don't know how to play because they've been spoon fed virtue/kei/focus etc since level 1. Maybe now those newbs will save thier money and buy better gear and learn their class instead of buying buffs. Besides 1-44 isn't exactly difficult, and you can get those buffs above that level still when you really need them. <br />
Without any outside buffs I've leveled melee to 20 in well under 10 hours, with just a 57 druid for buffs, nothing outside. Also taken same toon to 30 in under 24 hours with my 51 shammy finishing from 20-30 in about 12 hours played, again with no outside buffs. Would have gone faster if I hadn't spent a few hours shopping for gear and a few more practicing spells. <br />
Wouldn't take to much longer to get the toon to 44 and buy high level buffs again, but they aren't needed. Theres lots of good hp gear out there, and plenty of decent buffs that aren't affected by this nerf at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">While I am a kei fan (no not 60 with torpor and can V or even can 4)<br />
I do realize just how unbalancing this spell is for the game. Below level 10 a caster can simply chain nuke and not run out of mana. After that it slows down a bit but still for that level it's bad.<br />
They needed to restrict this because people were simply levelign up WAY TOO FAST that means ppl burned through content which was a bad thing. <br />
Yes the change might suck for a lil while while we adjust and get used to actually sitting down and medding with our twinks (which is ok with me he he eh NECRO :P).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Loreddar Of Karana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">All I can say about SOE is that 400,000+ subscribers can't be wrong. Complain all you want about SOE, their business practices, changes to EQ, etc., etc. They're minting money from EQ, and will continue to do so. I think people that have 2-3 accounts and multi-box are going to need something far more drastic to happen than simple game changes like a KIE nerf to get them to cancel their accounts.<br />
<br />
It could be that Flock's opinions, as shown by the quote, were NOT what SOE wanted for EQ, and that's one of the reasons he &quot;resigned.&quot; I don't know. But considering all the different kinds of changes and whatnot constantly whined about or asked for by thousands of EQ players, there has to be some thick skin at SOE to make sure changes to the game don't get totally out of control.<br />
<br />
For whatever faults some of you might find with the game and SOE, I, for one, continue to be amazed that the whole thing works as well as it does. That's why there isn't much competition.</div></div><hr />

Does this change hurt you? No, it doesn't. Does it trivialize your game play? No, it doesn't.<br />
<br />
There's 3 kinds of players...<br />
<br />
1.) A caster does not want to sit and med for 10 minutes per kill. So they want to use KEI.<br />
<br />
2.) A meleer doesn't want to sit and heal every 10-15 minutes per kill, so they want all the best buffs that ups their HPs and other stats so they can continously kill for a longer period of time. Also a 2-3 boxers wants to be able to use their high end spells on their toons.<br />
<br />
3.) Those that likes to play a hard, boring and slow way of play w/o any kind of buffs.<br />
<br />
This is a matter of choice and none of these choices hurts anyone.<br />
<br />
Bigboyg elequantly said on another thread....<br />
<br />
&quot;BOOHOO! Learn to play the game! This game should be a struggle. It should be slow and frustrating. You WILL play it my way. HAHA I'm already level 60 I don't care.&quot; - Until of course you start a character and remember how long it takes to level. Then I doubt you'll be turning down KEI. Hypocrites.</div></div><hr />

They've been flip flopping on ways how to make money...one way brings about good money and another way pisses them off and quit, thus tossing out the dough.<br />
<br />
400,000 you say??? Prove it! Most of the peeps have more than one account, so minus that please. Others have quit a long time ago, minus that please. Remember they nerfed the status count on each server so we can know how many are playing per server. Now we don't know anymore.<br />
<br />
Sony seem to can't keep their heads on screwed right.<br />
<br />
HEY SONY! Make up your mind, you want to make money or toss the money out the window??</div></div><hr />

<br />
I find it highly unlikely that this bug fix(it was not intended that the spell could be cast on some one under 46, so yes, it was a bug that just got left in forever) will have a serious impact on multiboxers.<br />
<br />
Sony/VI has a history of making idiotic and stupid business decisions that hurts their revenue/profits from the players.  <br />
<br />
400,00 subscribers.  Aparently they have made more smart decisions than stupid ones.<br />
<br />
Sony can't keep their heads screwed on right and see what sort of damage they can do to the customer base. <br />
<br />
I simply cannot believe that this is going to have any  significant impact on subscriptions.  In point of fact, it might help as they are trying to restore some sense of game balance(this is a good thing).  If a handfull of people cancel subscriptions, or do not get new subscriptions, but the game overall is better and therefore continues to attract new players(as it still does), SoE comes out ahead.<br />
<br />
But Sony doesn't care. <br />
<br />
Wrong, SoE is a business, and they are out to make a profit.  I have yet to hear of one person threatinging to cancell their account over this(tho there are a few idiots who threaten to cancell their accounts every time SoE makes a change, so I am sure there are a few).  I seriously feel you are dead wrong on this causing them many customers.<br />
<br />
I am sorry you can no longer have KEI cast on your twink, but I think this was a fix that was long overdue.  If you are unable to adapt, then the problem is not with fixing this bug, but with your inability to play the game.  If you do feel a need to quite the game(and you are the one saying that it is going to cost SoE subscribers) over this, feel free.  You will be an excpetion, not the rule.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">*sigh*<br />
Flock was right.  We don't know what we want.<br />
Do you want a content-rich experience where you start from nothing and work your way up, growing in power with each level, or do you want a race to 65 so you can sit around grinding AA all day?<br />
I started Tigran to have the first.  I've started all my alts the same way.  The game is never any fun if it's easy.  It's also not fun if you're wiping on every second or third mob.  That's what balance is for, and I'll admit, Sony screwed it up real well.  Old-world content is still decent if you play through it without twinking and without pleveling the heck out of your characters just to get them up.  Remember back to when you first started, make yourself some patchwork armor, and scrape up cash for spells on a brand new character on a different server.  It's actually kind of fun if you can find a few other people willing to work with you on it.<br />
<br />
That's just my little explanation as to why this &quot;nerf&quot; won't cause major problems.  Besides, this is hardly a nerf.  They're finally getting around to fixing a grotesque exploit in spell mechanics.  That being said, I personally feel they should remove the 46+ requirement for all buffs.  Some people don't want to experience content and just want to race to 65 and grind AA forever.  Great for them.  Sorry Sony is putting a small speedbump in your path.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Having KEI at low levels (20s and 30s) is like putting a melee in VT level gear at that level.  It's ridiculous.  Wah, people won't be able to PL as fast...too bad they can still twink like crazy, and still PL fairly quickly.<br />
<br />
By the way...I are lovings my proper verb tenses!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">For the most part I have no problem with the Nerfing that SoE has done to EQ in the past.  I was a bit put off with the early DoT nerfs but all other classes have been subject to tweaking so I feel it has been fair in the total.  If anything I am more irked by the &quot;Dumbing Down&quot; of EQ.  But I repeat that overall I have no problem with the gameplay and changes to gameplay of EQ.<br />
<br />
My only real complaint is with some of the CODE that has caused technical problems like PL and other connection issues.  As long as I can actually play EQ there are enough options to keep me entertained with or without KEI.</div></div><hr />

<br />
KEI is pretty high on the list of things that bards find annoying.  And its not the faster leveling of casters.  Its the continual &quot;I have to go get my KEI refreshed.&quot;  I'd rather have a caster without KEI that knows how to manage his mana effectively.  Skill &gt; all.  PLed chars gots no skillz.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So what? Most of the people who are long term players remember having to level without the benefit of a clarity line on par with KEI.<br />
<br />
Characters can still be levelled without KEI/VoQ. People are just looking for something else to whine about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'd have to agree with flock. Most players don't know what they want. Like it or not, beleive it or not but the things people complain about the most are what keeps and has kept people playing.<br />
<br />
People complain about how hard this is or what a pain it is to camp that but yet they keep playing. Why do they do that? I think if you ask alot of people the answer is because they feel a connection to their character. Why do they feel that connection? Because they have spent all that time on the character that they complained about spending on them.<br />
<br />
Simply put if they implimented half of what most people ask for the game every class would be a walking god that would be able to solo everything in the game. You only need to look at most eq class boards to see this in place.<br />
<br />
KIE and other high level group buffs landing on chars to low a level is alot like the affliction focus nurf. A bug that has been left in way to long and should have been fixed long ago. Verant was right to limit these high level buffs from being cast on low level characters. It really is unbalancing in the game play. Unfortunately thier initial implimentation had some holes large enough to drive a mac truck threw.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It really becomes a question of casters vs. melee though. If they're nerfing kei, then some of the melee items with regen should have minimum levels applied to them.<br />
<br />
Instead of thinking of 2 or 3 boxers, consider a single level one twink, that wants to advance to level 46 as quickly as possible. With the nerf to kei and Aego, if you gave a melee and a caster 100k as a level 1 toon, the melee can gear up and level up very quickly compared to the caster. Pick up a few DS potions, a nice regen item, a decent dps weapon, and thats all you need. Mix in some armor with clicky effects for fun, but those aren't even necessary (and are level limited in most cases, but the AC is still good).<br />
<br />
Focus items and gear generally don't give casters enough capabilities to level as quickly on their own. A wise caster would buy some decent gear, then have put aside some money to pay for buffs on a regular basis.<br />
<br />
The end result is a big nerf to caster powerlevelling, and no change for melees.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is that lots of people that play low level characters also have high level characters. The reason that people twink and PL their low level characters is they don't want to relive what they've gone through over the past few years in the low level game.  Most of their friends will be high level, and for whatever reason they might have started a new class, they will want to get back up to a level so they can reunite as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
This &quot;fix&quot; slows people down who want to take this road in the game. I fully understand the consequences of people levelling too quickly and not learning to properly play their characters, but slowing the process down will only encourage people to look for &quot;other means&quot; of getting a level 65 character with a second class. This will only compound the player quality issue.<br />
<br />
SOE is nerfing the ability to get there quickly, but not the desire. In the end, I'm afraid that desire may triumph. (At least until they get around to making /testbuff a live command on all servers, my estimate: 4-6 months)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">It was a bug, they're fixing it.  Bugfix = good.<br />
<br />
And to some extent the Flock quote is right on the money.  Take a gander at some of the WL threads for various classes like say the current one on the Druids boards.  If SoE simply gave in to every request to make some players happy with their particular gaming experience, they would destroy all semblance of balance in EQ and ruin the game as a whole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Bah, I don't think it was a bug.  I think the thought process was this:<br />
<br />
&quot;Buff spells should be level appropriate.  We'll restrict them to 75% of the spell's level over 50, to leave the old functionality.  Oh but wait, there's a really big grouping range once you get up high ... bigger than that.  Even a level 40 can group with a 60.  And single-buffing those people would be a pain, so we'll let you buff your own group with it regardless.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now, that makes sense, right?   And it does make sense unless you're popping in and out of groups to cast group buffs.  But hey, it's no big deal right, because you'd have to follow the group around anyway, so whatever, there's a price being paid.<br />
<br />
Then they came up with a 2.5+ hour buff that everyone wants.<br />

So I don't think it's a bug -- I think that the duration of KEI broke the balance they had in mind for the restriction.  And since KEI was designed much later than the 50+ buff system, it's possible nobody was around from the first decision-making process going &quot;err, whoa.  Bad idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
BTW, I read the CR Enchanter boards regularly and they're in general highly in FAVOR of this nerf.  Why?  Partly due to the reasons above, that people don't learn to play without it.  But mostly because it reduces the desirability of level 1-59 enchanters -- if you have KEI, an enchanter loses some of his lustre.<br />
<br />
I'm of two minds.  I see those points and think they're valid, but I think that the mana and HP regen rates of the game in general are just too low.  DAoC was a lot closer to what i'd call correct, and a lot of the reason people are so horrified that it's going -- WITH KEI, downtime is what they feel is appropriate.  And I can't really argue that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I am very much a fan of old school , but the one thing i felt was not in correct balance was the rate of mana regen. Yea HP is slow too , but you dont use HP to do you damage do you. I mean for a caster that is there sword and such. Its only since KEI that lower level wizzies and pure casters are really wanted in what meager lower level groups there are. I think this was a bad choice cause they gave us a way to correct this issue , even though we had to pay for it, then take it away from us, its doubly bad cause we tasted it and now we are forced to not have it.<br />
<br />
I can say this, i wont be making any mroe pure caster alt. i mean they are alts, i dont have time to be sitting around meding on a alt, unless i dont care about doing anyhting and personaly thats not me. I was also thinking about getting a second account for a Wizzy and enchanter and various other toons i can make to 2 box with or let my friends play when theyw anna come to my server and play with me. I no longer desire this , so thats one account they lost fromthis change. It does make me wonder if i was the only one to make this choice, makes me wonder how much this one simple lil change to 1 spell int he game, has cost them in the way of real $$. Its a intresting situation.<br />
<br />
There could be good repercutions though , forcing people to group again and take their time with more limited rescources, this could result in any newer people coming to have more class understanding and actual skill, not ot mentionthe new grouping bonus could offest the clerical downtimes being re-introduced to the game. <br />
<br />
But to sum myself up, yea for me its a huge pain, i dont like it and have reconsidered giving them more money every month. Good and bad i guess, cant always be a winner /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Sony have done alot to make levels 1 to 30 a breeze. It took me months to get mu fist pre Velios character to 30, now its can take a week. (ok ok maybe 2 ) KEI and our High level buffs undermine the learning curve for lower level players. They just dont care about mana efficence or such things becuse quite simply the dont need to.<br />
<br />
I think fixing the group casting bug is a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">KEI is one of the most unbalancing screwed up spells in the game.  Like many of the issues in game, it has been in too long to fix now.  It is part of the game now and it would piss off like half of the customer base if they did anything drastic to it.<br />
<br />
  Any downtime reducing buff that lasts 2.5 hours is ridiculous.  It is identical in principle to giving priests a buff with 20 hp/tick regen + 500 hps and have it last for 2.5 hrs, be a group buff AND make it castable on level 1 characters.  I think even the classes that would benefit from such a spell would agree that it is very overpowering.<br />
<br />
The duration was the first mistake on KEI, which they basically admit by having the upgraded versions last half as long.  The second was the longtime sploit/feature/bug/phenomenon (call it what ya like) of group buffs ignoring level restrictions if the lowbie is not targeted.</div></div><hr />
