<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi again folks! Asyth strikes again with what may seem like a silly question. :)<br />
<br />
I juust dinged level 55 (woot!) And I find myself starin' at all thesse buffs wonderin' what are the actual best buff combo's to use.<br />
<br />
I figure, least amount of mana in the quickest amount of time.  While also givin' the max amount of benifits to my group (as usually i group).  I have no clue how i would tackle buffin' in a raid as I don't really know what stacks and what doesn't. Soooooo I decided to look these spells up as best I could to ascertain what would work best most often.  Heres the info i got.<br />

It would seem to me in situations where i had one group i'd use Infusion of Spirit and talisman of kragg on tankish melee types.  And would use Primal essence on casters as the extra agi would be good and its one quick buff as oppsed to a few diff ones.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any insight or tell alls on what you do would be great :) For groups and raids as I plan on raidin' much soon. <br />
<br />
keeping in mind that i am lvl 55 so can't be usin' no ubber ubber shammy buffs  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dont even bother with primal essence, only lasts a minute. I don't even have it I don't even want it for short duration. For the most hp, use IoS, Kragg, and STA. Of course, that's an extra buff you need to be doing, and an extra slot. And as you go toward 60, we get better single stat buffs, so if you always want to do the max, you'd be talking about a few extra buffs now, which is a pain and a lot of mana. IoS is nice as it stacks with everything IIRC. Depends how you feel about buffing. From my experience, unless they played a shaman, or really know the game, they probably won't know IoS/Kragg/STA is more hp, as I can barely ever remember getting asked for anything but HoS. If you dont mind dealing with a lot of buffing (and I get the impression you don't since you mentioned buffing casters with primal essence :) ), then by all means go for it.</div></div><hr />

Huh? Says an hour+... Personally I use mah Dragonborn hammer and click away when I'm bored!  Saves me a gem spot... (Wish I got my hands on the ol' group based procer too :/)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Primal lasts over an hour, you are thinking of avatar which doesn't last very long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tragik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you want to give the tanks maximum HPs then use Kragg's, IoS and stamina.  For the casters just use IoS/stamina if anything at all.  It stacks with their shielding line and can add a reasonable number of HPs from the stamina effect.<br />
<br />
Life gets easier around 57 when you start getting the stat group buffs and again at 60 with Khura's focus.  I always thought they should have added in a group version of HoS similiar to Heroic Bond for clerics and the group skin buffs for druids.<br />

Don't bother with agility.  It won't help a caster mitigate or avoid anything.  Throw it on a monk if he pesters you enough.<br />

Agility provides very little ac and it's usualy not worth the buff slot it takes up.<br />
If your defense is low and u need to raise it yes sure if not gettign 9 extra ac will simply do nothing it's too little ac to mitigate anythign when mobs hit for 600+<br />

Did you notice his signature?  I never buff agility because it's a waste of a slot and more importantly a waste of my time &amp; mana.  If I'm really, really bored and have an over abundance of mana, people have a shot at getting an agi buff from me if they ask really nicely and toss in a bribe, but that's about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">yea..my mistake on p essence/avatar. About agility, could someone please give the link (if they know it offhand) that showed the AC increases per AGi gain. It was ridiculous, in that if our agi buffs would amount to about 5 ac, which is crap even if your fighting sissy kunark mobs that hit for 100. But, there is the psychological effect, in that it makes them feel better, so I always give an agi buff (or any buff really) when asked, I don't want any unhappy pullers/tankers thinking they aren't buffed enough to pull/tank something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I believe its roughly 0.2 AC per point of AGI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">In an experience group, you want to boost HPs, and get going asap.  Downtime is bad.<br />
<br />
So, Harness on all but clerics -give the clerics Infusion and they can keep their self buffs up for mana regen as well.  Stamina on everyone.  Primal Essence is nice if you have extra mana.  Its not the absolute max hps you can give, but its a good amount of hps and it provides some good stat boosts.  Additional buffs like Agility are fluff -they dont provide much benefit for the amount of mana they take...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">On the AGI trip. I know I use it constantly. Gives me that extra little push to break 1250AC, and the difference IS noticable at that point.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shazzog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">CHA!<br />
<br />
CHA &gt; all.<br />
<br />
Get everyone in the group buffed out to max CHA.<br />
<br />
I was in a group the other day, and we all got buffed to about 400 CHA with buffs and gear (plus, we had all put all our points into CHA at character creation. That's key).<br />
<br />
We went to fight a MOb, and it apologized for being so offensive to us, handed us all it's loot, then lay down and died.<br />
<br />
CHA is UBER!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I use group agi because it costs almost no mana, and it breaks 1k ac for me. It doesn't help much but it boosts confidence and that makes all the difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sharlok_Bonespirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Which buffs to cast really depend on where you are and what people want.  Not everyone needs STR/AGI/DEX/STA all the time, but if they ask for it, give it to them.  It takes far less time to mem the spell and cast it than it does to argue about who deserves what buff, etc.  Your job is to keep everyone buffed, to keep the mobs slowed, and potentially, to heal.  I would strongly recommend against refusing anyone a buff.<br />
<br />
That said, I found that Infusion of Spirit, Kragg, Agility, and Stamina were very well received by everyone I grouped with in those levels.  Occasionally, I'd get the odd request for a STR buff from someone . . . tumultuous strength took care of that, and I don't believe I ever got dex buff requests from anyone other than folks proccing or folks working on combat skill increases.  Those base 4 spells just about covered everyone, though.<br />

<br />
<br />
HoS and Kragg don't stack; Kragg will overwrite every time becase of the higher HP component.<br />
<br />
Aslo, Kragg will overwrite the casters own personal shield type spells.  It does give them more HP, yes, but it overwrites the MR and AC portions of the shields.  I think all casters have shield of the magi by about 54, which is 250hp, 31AC and 24 MR if I remember correctly.  (it also bugs me that druids and clerics HP buffs will stack with casters shields, but shaman hp buffs wont.  I personally believe that it is a throwback to level 1 inner fire, which had an AC component to it.  However, none of the other hp buffs that shaman get have the same ac part.  annoying)<br />
<br />
I buff casters with IoS and Sta and Agi. Acumen if they need it, but most dont seem to care about that.<br />
<br />
Melee get Kragg and infusion.  Most are so near max str that I dont need a buff from me, but most request dex.  <br />
<br />
Sigh, oh yeah, and those meleeing clerics.  Curse them, cause they have more buff requests that melees, but they get IoS Dex and Str, and they usually pester me enough for haste that I give it to them.  I do have one cleric I group pretty regularly with trained though.  He went out and bought an RBG so that if I dont get to his &quot;Haste please&quot; right away he can still have fun smacking things with the Hand of God.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Asyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">hmm okay after readin' that I feel a lil' more confident about what I am doin' in relation to the rest of ya'z :)<br />
<br />
But now i'd like to redirect this a tad.  What if you are in a group with a higher lvl shammy saaaay 63, what would you do? What buffs would help him?  I haven't studied the higer level shammy spells over much as of yet.  But I have already found myself in this situation. . and the advice he gave was to go crazy. . eheheh. . . Soooo in a raid situation with higher lvl shammys how would you contribute? Buffs? Slow line spells? Frails. . . <br />
<br />
I attempted insidious mailidy thinkin 'it would help, the entire time. . and threw in a nuke here and there. . but basically felt perty useless lol<br />
<br />
I awiat the replies to this one very eagerly! :)<br />
<br />
p.s. yeah i can't spell ahhaha :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sharlok_Bonespirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If you're in a group with a level 60+ shaman, the higher level shaman gets buffs duty.  By 60, we can cast Khura's focusing, Group Stamina, Group Agility, Group Regrowth, and group poison/disease resist buffs.  Regular STR and DEX buffs do not stack with Focus.  Total time to switch spell sets and buff the group . . . . less than a minute, give or take.  If you're in an 'outside' zone, you can get SoW.  This speeds up the buff cycle and gives you a break from having to cast 5 buffs on 6 people.<br />
<br />
In a raid situation, you can probably work it out with the higher level shamen to get slow duty.  The way I always did it was to start casting turgurs just after the higher level started casting Malosinia.  The slow would land a split second after the resist debuff.  The higher level shaman will probably appreciate the help with the slows, since they're going to be getting all of the buffs, and you get a big contrabution to the raid.  Once you get to 58, you'll become a viable healer, so you'll have even more to do in groups/raids.  I found that raids went from barely tolerable to half way fun (to me) as I leveled up and was able to assume more roles.  It just keeps getting better, now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">After 60, buffing becomes much less complicated.<br />
<br />
All:  <br />
Group Focus (Khura's / Seventh)<br />
Group STA (Brute / Boar)<br />
Group AGI (Cat / Wrulan)<br />
Group Regeneration (Reg. Of Dar Khura / Blessing Of Replenishment)<br />
<br />
If the melees in the group are really feeble, I may cast Primal Essence (for the slightly gimp str/dex) or Strength of the Diaku (for those who must have started with negative str/dex to begin with).  On casters, I also tend to throw on Primal Essence just to let them know I care (the 8hp, insignificant AC, and undetectable improvement to channeling is likely not going to fulfil their wildest dreams, but they can carry more and everyone likes not being encumbered, right?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">undetectable improvement to channeling<br />
<br />
Yeah, things that don't exist usually are undetectable. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If I understand the melee's theory on AC:<br />
<br />
All AC is not created equally.<br />
Agility improves ones ability to avoid a hit so even if it does not have a great impact on the total AC score it does have a worthwhile effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The thing about agility is it doesnt add much.  I'll admit that every bit counts, but if a couple points of agility makes the difference in success/failure we are in the wrong spot/group.<br />
<br />
I tend to cast it, but I have group wrulan and maxed extended buff duration aa + usualy an item with more extension (summoned mage shawl), so I cast it a couple times in an evening.  Half the group clicks it off, the other half wouldnt notice if I didnt cast it at all.  If I were short on mana, it would be one of the first things to skip.  When I was casting single target agility, and refreshing it frequently.. well, I skipped it then.</div></div><hr />
