<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Galedil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I've finally managed to save up a little money for some upgrades but I have a little problem.  I got my first parchment the other night, handed it in and got True Spirit.  I've seen this in the Bazaar for around 10k.  So should I sell it and make some cash from it or keep it until 61?<br />
<br />
Second, I currently have about 7.5k in cash to spend with still some items that I'm going to sell soon, so max of about 10k.  In your opinion should I go for trying to buy a Thurg Legging MQ or should I save up for other things?  And if so what?  Here is my Magelo's:<br />

Thanks for any help in advanced.  Also note that the AC is obviously not correct on the profile.  It is maxxed out at 200 and I currently have a 896 AC.<br />
