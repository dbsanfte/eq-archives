/has flashbacks of disco room in seb with 10 mezzed frogs and a lot of adrenaline.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigcatt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hehe. The post above about 10 frogs mezzed brought back some memories. Remember that quiet moment, where everything was mezzed and the only one the melees were on, died. You had a chance to check your mana, which was often 20% or so, cuz everything had just gone to ****e. And you thought to yourself: Oh this is gonna get ugly in about a few seconds. Then mezzes start breaking and its balls to the walls again till it's all over 3-5 minutes later. Those were fun times. I loved the part where everyone was congratulating everyone else for not getting wiped out. Or the less fun times when it was a CR, cuz it didn't work out so well. <br />

Sorry, completely digressed from the point of this post. <br />

THE NECROMANCER saving your ass by AGRO KITING yet AGAIN</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Minor detaill ,those WoS mobs summon last time I got agro off anyone.<br />
<br />
Soo, that means no agro kiting, cause they'd snare your necro's bony A* and spank it.<br />
<br />
However,, that was from the citadel of anguish area, with slightly higher leveled mobs.<br />
<br />
And lastly, good god, that is sooo perfect. Just shared it with a bunch of friends, we loved it<br />

Its sad, but true, that those moments are gone forever from EQ.  The only place you'd find them now are in LDoN adventures, but I havent had more than 3 pulled in an adventure since I dont know when, even thats getting rare.<br />
<br />
Mobs DPS and resist settings are just WAY to high to support one person holding down more than one or two spawns now adays, because one worn off mez and you've got 420DPS of snarling furry (thats assuming you slowed the mob after mez) all over the enchanter.  Even the best geared chanters cant stand up under that for more than about 5 secs.<br />
<br />
This post just underlined the idea that EQ lost something magical when it stopped being about the adventure of the game and started being about flag x, mob y, and loot z.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Something similar happened to me in a City of Dranik group. Bard went AFK, stuff started repopping during a bad pull, and we went from a pull of 4 mobs to 5-6 roamers adding throughout about a 15 minute fight. After I died, the bard came back from AFK and mezzed 2, I got ressed, then the cleric died and ended up getting a druid res, and we eventually cleaned em all out a couple minutes before the first respawned. Good times!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Reminds me also of Disco room in Seb - about 7 adds and the enchanter decided to help out the group by charming a mob.<br />
<br />
Problem was he charmed a necro, one cast of fear from the charmed pet and the mob ran away and came back with about 20 friends - LOL, it was so funny I nearly cried.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not necessarily.<br />
<br />
Necros can incorporate tap-tanking to solo a summoning mob.  You just run, tap, get summoned, and run again.  Against any mob that hits for less than about 750, this is a viable (if hectic) strategy.<br />
<br />
Doing this, I can even kill some mobs on my necro that I can't on my shammie; it all depends on the summon timer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Correct me if I am wrong, but tap tanking != Agro kiting ?<br />
<br />
I wholly argee wiht yuo, that is a hectic, but effective, way to tank.<br />
And based on summoning frequency, wholly efficasious(sp)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Correct me if I am wrong, but tap tanking != Agro kiting ?<br />
<br />
That is correct, but what I'm talking about is kind of a hybrid. Standard tap-tanking is just that: you stand there and tank while you chain-tap; I'm sure you know what aggro-kiting is.<br />
<br />
Neither of these strategies works against harder-hitting summoners, so you incorporate both of them by snaring the mob and then kiting it as much as possible to minimize damage, while also timing taps in between each summons cycle.<br />
<br />
I've seen this referred to as 'summon-kiting' but I'm not sure how widespread this is as a definition.</div></div><hr />

Man those classic zones used to have you on the edge of your chair. Nowhere to run, try to run through exit gets ya ganked by golems. Man they really need to make zones like that again. Ahh those were the days.</div></div><hr />
