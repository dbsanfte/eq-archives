<br />
Looks like a good patch. :) <br />
Portal stone will add LoY zones to my farming spots.  I'm just too darn lazy to go over there otherwise very often.<br />
<br />
Wisht they would make our Greater Accuracy Potions (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=14271) more like this Eagle Eye improvement, but that's probably a pipe-dream.<br />
<br />
Epic drop improvements are probably to help alleviate the clogging that will occur once OOW rolls out with Epic 2.0 if they go forward with making them progressive quests (requiring 1.0 versions).  Feel sorry for those with PITA epics if that's true.<br />
<br />
The Berserker snare issue is a good fix for them.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this will be the long awaited (though minor in importance) fix to dogdog shrink.<br />
<br />
The high level stuff I don't know about, but sounds good if they do it right.  I'd bet they screw up the fixing of PoTime instancing.<br />
The mistakenly added LDoN armors will probably also get yanked from Wayfarers.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

I hope the quests are like this, but then again, they might be more like &quot;Turn in druid_spell_01 for random_shaman_spell&quot;. Just have to wait and see what happens on the 16th i guess.</div></div><hr />

No this shows me the way EQ goes.<br />
DUMB DUMB DUMB<br />
But you are right. why get upset. The Game is soon over anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nzaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Belinda it really comes down to how good your stack is.  I agree that the run is not that bad, but I would certainly rather do one zoning than four.  The run is just a pita. Although it is dumbing the game some, I would rather have the convience.  Why shoudl i have to suffer?  I was around when you unequiped everything to go on a boat because they were so buggy, and unreliable.  An ideal solution would be some quest or lvl requirement to activate or use the stone.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I make quite a few illusion potions and I try to hold off as long as possible so I can buy mass quanities of wormwood.  Another solution would certainly be place the herb on another vendor, but the stone will soon be there now.  Since illusion potions are one of the few cash potions I certainly happy to see this.  Maybe the price of racial meats and parts will come down now in the bazaar.  <br />

<br />
Been playing EQ about 5 years with breaks here and there and i cannot for the life of me see how making travel to Gunthak easier is dumbing the game down.<br />
I went through all the crap of running through the Karanas and HH to get from one side of Norrath to the other.<br />
Sitting on boat through oot and zoning without boat etc countless times.<br />
Running through EF and BB and dying countless times to those damn Skeles (composer etc) or getting mobbed by Gnolls or even lost in EF/BB tunnel because i was as blind as a bat in the dark.<br />
Question i ask myself about this is why the **** did they do this to me surely there must be a solution and now there is its called PoK books.<br />
<br />
I remember when i was a kid and my grandad would say &quot;when i were a lad we used to work down pit for 16hrs a day to earn 3s and sixpence enough for bread and dripping for a week&quot;<br />
And id think thank **** i dont have to do that nowadays.<br />
Damnit theyve dumbed down real life too :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Belinda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Sure times change, BUT why must EQ become like a &quot; You can warp to every zone in the Game &quot; Crap ?<br />
People cry cause they have to run 3 minutes to reach their goal, BUT on the other Hand THEY SPAM PoK with &quot; Looking for Kei &quot;etc for more then 30 minutes.<br />
Last week i got a group to hunt in Gunthak, guess what, the Leader was shouting 20 minutes for a port. I told him more then 10 times that we can run via  Warrens. &quot; that takes to long &quot; was the answer.<br />
I left the group after another 10 minutes.<br />
People get more and more lazy, and always want it easy.<br />
Im not Hardcore, but the game gets so trival.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ryam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have heard reports on test that the spell changes only effect KT and beyond.  So you will still have the crappy spell drops in Sewers etc..<br />
<br />
As far as I understand, currently the &quot;higher tier&quot; spells (Q upgrade and Ancient Canni) come from item turn ins (Taelosian Geomancy Stone and Chaos Runes?). The &quot;lower tier&quot; ones (heal and slow) drop as nodrop spell scrolls. Apparently this change will just change all the scroll drops to be runes that can be turned in to a NPC that gives you the spell specific to your class. So basically instead of getting useless_ranja_spell_001, you are quaranteed to get a spell that is useful to any of the caster classes present in the group (assuming they don't have it already of course).<br />
<br />
Not sure if they are going to modify the drop rate also, my guess would be that they are going to keep it at what it is now, or at least close. So the difficulty of farming spells is probably not going to change, but when you get a drop, it will not be wasted.<br />
<br />

Come on, can't you at least still spend 5 minutes walking SOMEWHERE?  Did you even PLAY eq classic?  <br />
<br />
Sigh...<br />
<br />
As long as you want people to actually spend time in different zones you will need to make traveling fast and easy. It is unfortunate that this shrinks the world but the alternative is everyone sitting in the three easiest dungeons to travel to.<br />
<br />
What?!?! This is backwards.  You're saying that if we are to expect people to spend time in different zones, we must provide instant teleportation access to them?  I believe you have it backwards.<br />
<br />
People forget, this is not &quot;Pick a Stage and Battle on It,&quot; it is &quot;Seek out a dungeon and adventure in it.&quot;  Meaning that you TRAVEL to the dungeon, and no, I don't mean the one zone mad dash to a LDoN, I mean the wonders that come through traveling through perilous mountains and swimming through streams, much like Morden Rasp does in the story.  They should have just made the story lined with the times and had it say &quot;So Morden took up his perilous quest, clicked the newly patched &quot;Portal to Mata Muram's Lair&quot; in PoK, and fought!  Then, they needed to go a few zones deeper, but they didn't want to, so they went back to PoK and started phoning Caillav to get him to log on and port them&quot;.<br />
<br />
If you want people to play in new zones, make battling in areas require travel.  I am sorry but it is just SAD that we have level 65's that have never even been to Guk or Kithicor Forest.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Er, explain the popularity of OS please :)<br />
<br />
OS (Old Sebilis I hope) isnt popular anymore. When it was popular it was so because it was one of very few high level dungeons.<br />
<br />
Sad thing is that I actually like OS but I almost never go there anymore because of the long travel to get there (and back).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I am sorry but it is just SAD that we have level 65's that have never even been to Guk or Kithicor Forest.<br />
<br />
I passed through Kithicor a few times on the way to Highhold when my very first character was level 27.  All I was told was &quot;hug the wall, run very fast, there are mobs there that can kill you almost immediately.&quot;<br />
<br />
I did as I was told.<br />
<br />
I never went to Lower Guk until the Fabled stuff came out, and helped a friend get FFBSS and Fabled axe.<br />
<br />
Why?  Because nobody else went there.<br />
<br />
I'd never even HEARD of Guk until after LoY came out, and I saw this odd little zone border I'd never seen before on my brand new map of Innothule, when I was out exploring one day.  I zoned in, immediately got lost, gated out, never went back because I forgot about the place.<br />
<br />
The moral of this story?  Yeah, there are 65's who have never been to zones like Dagnor's Cauldron or Splitpaw, because nobody else goes there either.  Not even the people lamenting about the &quot;good old days.&quot;<br />
<br />
That's why SoE needs to make old world zones like them attractive to people once again...they need to slap good juicy ZEMs onto unused zones, and keep changing those ZEMs every month to make new zones attractive.<br />
<br />
the idea of hotspots was a good one, but they need to make more hot zones, at least 2 different hot zones per level range, and change them often.  That gives people motivation to populate and explore rarely utilized zones.</div></div><hr />

         Fun zone don't need to have a high ZEM to be attractive.....but i don't want to lie , even in &quot;old time&quot; ,most have choose the facility over hard fun zone  ;) <br />
<br />
        I would beg sony for a stone to god. pok----&gt;freeport----&gt;ec---&gt;nedaria----&gt; natimbi  is not fun nor immersive ,no really not ,just long ,lot of zoning and boring.</div></div><hr />

 &quot;it is just SAD that we have level 65's that have never even been to Guk or Kithicor Forest.&quot;<br />
Lol yeah there was someone the other day who didn't know where oasis was, and she was like level 65. But in  perspective though, new players don't really have the incentive to go to old zones. The only reason I pretty much know all the zones in the game(except GoD) was because everyone was levelling up in these places at the same time. Nowadays, with the lack of new players and the massive exp bonus on Paladul caves, noone goes anywhere else when levelling.</div></div><hr />

Just wanted to give a head's up on these changes since they came up at the summit. This is currently on test and should go live with the next patch. This is just related to BiC quest drops, not other loot on the NPCs. <br />
<br />
The Qinimi and Barindu events now drop 3 pieces, rather than just 1. The Barindu event was lowered to a 24 hour-ish respawn. <br />
<br />
Sewer rares now drop their piece 100% of the time. The difficulty will be just in finding and killing the rares now. <br />
<br />
The cragbeast and kyv bosses in Tipt now drop their piece 100% of the time. <br />
<br />
Drop rates in Vxed were increased. <br />
<br />
The Primals and Mindrider in Yxtta will now drop their page 100% of the time. In addition, their pages are available off basepop as well, albiet at a much lower rate, to allow a single group path to this part. <br />
