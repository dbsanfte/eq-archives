<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Quies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hullooo. I've gotten myself in a situation to be able to pull off the final rak fight.. However, my chance of getting a tear are very slim. But... I've found someone with a tear. Problem is, they're an SK. (How they got to loot that, I'll never know..)<br />
<br />
Question is.. If we get their faction high enough, can they do the MQ? Or is the turnin only doable by shamans? Is that even possible? To class limit a quest?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have been in the same situation.<br />
A bard in my guild saved a tear for MQ on a guild fear raid.<br />
<br />
I think the SK epic shares some mob or faction modifiers but don't quote me on it.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the faction required is large, the only real way is for a shammy who has already done the epic quest to MQ the tear :/<br />
I had to go to fear and get the tear as a MQ would not be feasible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is an easy way to check, chief.  Have the SK con a true spirit faction mob.  They are easy to spawn.  Have him ported to EJ, run to FoB, and kill an iksar manslayer.  Or go to any of the starting cities.  Heck, run to one of the permanent turn-in spirits in EJ and have him con them.  Ally will clearly work.  Warmly (I think--not positive) works.<br />
<br />
SKs are on the truespirit faction up to the last part of their epic (Lhranc in CoM).  However, they go from ally to like max KoS after Lhranc.  If your SK friend has his epic, forget it.  If he is close to his epic, he may be able to help you.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Iynna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">for MQ of tear now NEED MAX ALLY.<br />
<br />
Tried an MQ a few days ago with an epic shaman.  Rak conned ally but ate the tear.   <br />
<br />
Check this by turning in another set of giosk books and seeing the &quot;your true spirit faction can not get any better&quot; message.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>DarkSidhe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wouldn't it be easier (combatwise) to get the small gem or even kill Tabien and Glaron than to take down Ghiosk again? (Then again, if you're there for Rak you probably already have the people...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Iynna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I suggested turning in another set of giosk books cause they are big faction gains and easier to get than the engraved ring from the hole.<br />
<br />
Like you said, because multiple classes need to kill Bllack Reavers for epic drops, usually ez to get a group or two together to kill the cycle.  I personally have seen the books go to several lower level shaman that were in CoM seeking the student's log.  And I've actually seen the giosk books rot.<br />
<br />
For me, all the epic faction was done the intended way.  Guild helped me kill High Scale Kirn and I turned in the ring to Neh Ashiir, then turned in the diary.  Knowing that a tear may be available for MQ, I went back to CoM and volunteered to help a reaver group.  They were without shaman and let me loot the giosk books.  The turn in of the books resulted in &quot;Your true spirit faction can not get any better&quot; so I know I was set.<br />
<br />
As a side note.  If someone MQ's the tear for you, you miss out on the faction gain from the tear turn in to Rak and may not have high enough faction to receive the spear from a turn in the iksar scale.  I'm not sure, but I was told the scale actually gets eaten.<br />
<br />
If you do MQ the tear, I would encourage you to do other factioning to get to &quot;can not get any better&quot; before the scale turn in.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Judlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have already turned in a tear to rak so i already have the faction i need to turn in scale.  Now I have a fellow shaman who happens to have extra tear in bank, he is already epiced, so will him turning in tear to rak cause hime to aggro, or is this not possible.  It would make since that this is possible, because say you got your epic and some how died and couldnt recover corpse, well you should be able to attain another epic right, and because your faction was good enough the first time it should be good enough this time right? well let me know what ya think.  thanks...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">First hand experience:<br />
<br />
The tear is only MQable by another Shaman with Max Ally True Spirit. Any other class will end up with an eaten tear. Also, the person looting Rak for turn-in will need to have Max Ally True Spirit to turn in the tear for Spear.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">So much easier to just right the coattails of a guild doing Fear. If they're doing the golems (those MOBs are *easy* and still drop some moderatly unique loo, like Amulet of Necropotence and the like), 2 of the golems will spawn the broodling. Just exchange your buffing, debuffing and healing that evening for the loot right on a tear.<br />
<br />
Last time we did the shissar wraith, we also did the golems and didn't bother killing the broodlings because no shaman online needed it and all the shamans present already had a spare tucked away in the bank :( Damn waste</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>BryeLLe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">little question on some of these posts... <br />
<br />
it seems to me an epic shammy should never have the tear eaten unless they changed it to reset your truespirit faction or said shaman somehow lowered the faction. assuming npcs now give back items, at worse, the tear should be returned but maybe this doesn't happen with epic turn-ins? <br />
<br />
i think the last faction hit is the diary turn-in. i don't think there is one for turning in the tear. you can still get max ally faction prior to the mq turn-in so that any faction hits given wouldn't matter anyways. or am i missing something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>kaladdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hail!<br />
<br />
How many tears could you expect to get out of 1 Fear raid.  I mean is there more than 1 per pop.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">2 tears per raid - 2 out of the 3 golems spawn a broodling, who drops a tear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">1) Not all NPCs are giving back items yet. Verant has said it's a slow process. Rak may not be fixed yet.<br />
<br />
2) I've only seen one Iksar Broodling per Fear raid. I believe you need to take down all standing golems to get the kid to pop. I may be wrong, but this seems to be the way it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>BryeLLe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">fright and terror will both spawn the broodling who drops the tear. was just there two nights ago. cleared most of the zone, did fright, broodling, dread, terror, broodling. then did some silly shissar thing and walked out of fear. it was a long night.<br />
<br />
unfortunately, i was the 3rd shaman in line for the tears. :( technically, i was the 2nd shaman but was overruled by the hosting guild who logged an alt. needless to say, i won't be raiding with that guild anymore...</div></div><hr />
