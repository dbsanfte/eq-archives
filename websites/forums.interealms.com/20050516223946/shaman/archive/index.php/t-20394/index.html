 :D  Exactly, I was under the impression that the ass, the face, the back, the wrist and the knee were the only places on the human body that got slapped.  Now, if Airtreader has been going around slapping people on the sternum or the achillies tendon, then I delightfully withdraw my extrapolation that an insulting slap to somebody is generally administered to the face...</div></div><hr />

I apologize for having a job that keeps me off eq from time to time. So it dropped. Does everyone have one? Did the slap appear in real life as a hand that walloped you across the face? Are you now blind in one eye and deaf from it? I mean, I am struggling to take this as seriously as you, but I really really want to. <br />

It drops from fabled mobs.  Nearly every named in original eq has a &quot;Fabled&quot; version.  ie Fabled Guk Ghoul Lord.  A Guk Ghoul Lord can still spawn in its place though.  Each fabled mob hits from 1k-2k and has greatly increased hp but remains at the same original level.</div></div><hr />

That could be hilarious surprise for a group of 50 somethings in Guk, if such a thing exists anymore.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">No, no fabled manastone. Each Fabled Creature only has one fabled drop and it always drops.<br />
The fabled mobs in LGuk hit for 1000~ and can flurry, summon, immune to snare/root. SolB giants are even harder. King Tranix hits for 2k, and lifetaps for 1500.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>slimb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The fun part is that Lguk, Sol B, Najena are all perma camped for the week heh, just like the old days!<br />
<br />
The nice thing is everything is no drop - so there is no &quot;farming&quot; of the items and it won't totally destroy the already hurting bazaar.<br />
<br />
However you will probably find a guild holding certain camps, etc.  Although many mobs even in the lowbie zones are dropping decent low/mid level gear (the BB wayfarers camp had many skellys wandering through it that dropped nice lowbie gear).</div></div><hr />

That said, i haven't exactly seen &quot;Fabled&quot; items flooding the bazaar. Hey, once upon a time there were Jboots, but no shaman epic boots. That's gotta be a slap to someone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Insta sow boots was like the last reason for playing a shaman on a pvp server.

Fabled Blue Diamond<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68286<br />
<br />
Decent range item...<br />
<br />
Alize hit for max 1998 and was partially slowable. Wiped my level 65 grp a couple times before we killed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Jtun Nahseer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Btw, the Fabled boots have already been nerfed on test.They will no longer insta cast sow, but Bootstrutters blessing, which is about<br />
5% slower than run speed 5 I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">AFAIK all Fabled is ND so you won't be seeing it in the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
Having said that, fabled is around LDON quality.  The fabled RMB is a SERIOUS upgrade (50 hp, 75 mana, 14 Wis, and more).  Note that it seems (at least in Sol B) that only one fabled item is dropping per named.  What's funny is the fabled RMB would drop as well as the regular.<br />
<br />
Insta-click SOW Boots drop in Najena.  The line on Xev was 6-10 horus long. Shades of old Cazic and Rubicite? (God I miss that zone for 25-35's).<br />
<br />
The Fabled Crown of King Trannix is better than the Ornate Silk one.  <br />
<br />
Good point about charming MOBs. They con green to my 65, and are pretty darned MR.  (They also mitigate slow) They are also immune to changes in movement speed.<br />
<br />
I Dire-Charmed the LB Nox Spider in Sol B and the Fabled Priest killed it in about 8 seconds.<br />
<br />
You know what is sadly ironic?  People asking where all these old world zones are.  That alone is deserving of a thread of its own...but I digress.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, they are already nerfed them on test. But independent of that, I could care less if someone can cast SoW on someone else. It might even have been an opportunity to get our Black Fur Boots targetable so I don t have to go mem SoW everytime I want to cast it on someone. Nevermind, that chance is gone now.<br />
<br />
Over all I think it is a neat idea with all the fable mobs and their fabled drops. As I have yet to see something that would be a serious upgrade to me I am not going to stand in line and can watch it all from a safe distance :)</div></div><hr />

Hey, that would be super! Won't happen however, not IMHO anyway. In any case fabled druz is a wimp, and at least on TT the campers have been nice and helpful. Sure I will camp for them myself since they are an upgrade from my BFB both in tragetability and stat-wise. WTH should I give a crap about our crappy epic anyway?
