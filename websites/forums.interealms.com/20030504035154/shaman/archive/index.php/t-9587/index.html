<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>umpaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently picked up replentishment when I dinged 61 and was very excited to have it due to the phat hp per tick increase. However, I've been kind of frusterated with the spell's duration. It seems to be a lot shorter than Regrowth of DK and I feel like I'm casting it constantly to keep it up on multiple party members (I play with several necros and I figure it's nice for chanters and main tank, etc.)<br />
<br />
I checked out lucy and the durations for these spells are very similar and it seems that they should be lasting the same amount (they both max at 20.5 mins @ L65). I don't have any extended enhancment items. <br />
<br />
Thought I put this out for others to coment on to see if they've noticed this. I suppose it must be in my head as I always rely on lucy to give me the 'real deal'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of corse your casting it constantly you casting 4 times as much since your casting a single target buff on 4 people instead of one group buff. The durations are the same, your doing more work cause your using a single target buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>umpaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks alot for your helpful comment Nytmare. Do you play a troll too?<br />
<br />
I was more looking for comments along the lines if anyone had noticed this. I guess since you can't cast it though you wouldn't have anything useful to add. Since you can't &quot;time it yourself&quot; and all.</div></div><hr />
