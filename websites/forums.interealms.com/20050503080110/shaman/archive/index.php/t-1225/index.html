<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mordrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I havn't played eq since summer but desperatly must get back into the game.  I found that to make up for the fun of eq I had to go out and buy new games all the time.  And still the latest things wouldnt be as fun.  So when I come back I will make a new shaman, I stopped playing last time with one at 39.  I'd like to know what major changes have been made since last summer and the changes made in luclin.   Also, do all the game graphics get upgrades if I get luclin or just the luclin world?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm, that's close to a whole year.  Let's see...<br />
<br />
A bunch of new spells were added.   Check the Spells section of the main Crucible page.  Bearform at 29 is nice.  Spirit of Bih'Li group SOW is actually an often-used spell, I though it would be useless.<br />
<br />
/targetgroupbuff option allows you to cast beneficial group spells on other groups.<br />
<br />
chat channels - /join &lt;channelname&gt; or /join &lt;channelname&gt;:&lt;password&gt; lets multiple groups chat<br />
<br />
Most slows now add disease counters, meaning they can't be dispelled with Dispel Magic line and must be cured with Cure Disease line instead.  This is great since the chanter/wizzys can be dispelling while you're slowing, and you can &quot;cure&quot; a slow off of a tank without dispelling beneficial buffs.<br />
<br />
Med by sitting at any level that can med.  No spellbook needed to med ever.<br />
<br />
No XP penalty or corpses under lvl 10.  You get res'd with full XP and gear at your bind point.  More food/water available at that level, too.<br />
<br />
Great new alchemy recipes with Luclin that give a relatively cheap path to higher skill levels.  Titan potion in particular has been cited as very useful.<br />
<br />
A whole lot of new gear with Luclin, use the Allakhazam gear search feature for your char.<br />
<br />
We get Summon Companion now to summon our pet if he gets lost.  Check in the EC tunnel, I think.<br />
<br />
Textures were upgraded in many old-world areas, but the geometry is the same (i.e. same number of polygons).<br />
<br />
Cazic-Thule is now a lvl 55+ dungeon.  The old inhabitants were turned out and now live in the Feerott in front of CT.<br />
<br />
Probably lots more older changes that I forgot about already.</div></div><hr />
