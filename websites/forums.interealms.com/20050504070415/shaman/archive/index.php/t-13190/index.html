<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">K, for the longest time I had the bug where all pets/wolves looked blue with red heads and white feet.  Then I reformat my computer, reinstal EQ start to finish and now pets look all better YAY!   <br />
<br />
Problem is now ALL dwarf/giant NPCs look human.  I had this problem before but only on select mobs.  Zland and the quest NPC for the 8th shawl are the only ones that I saw that problem with.  I did the 8th shawl quest 5 times now and every time I follow a little human around instead of the dorf.<br />
<br />
Another problem I have is that you dont really see the skin of my ogre through his SS armor... I look over at my gf computer and I see through the chain links of the green armor and see the skin underneath, I look at mine and it's all green skin underneath.  And on the armor pieces that show chest or something it makes it look like the guys have on long john underwear under their armor since their skin is tinted the armor color.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to fix any/all of these problems?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gubthup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I heard that deleting the zone file and logging into EQ so that the installer pulls it down will fix the problem.<br />
<br />
It has never happened to me though so this is second hand information.<br />
Hope it helps though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Usually going to the advanced options on the patcher and doing a complete file check will clear up the first problem.  For the second one, you need to do something like /dopropertinting on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For the armor try typing /dopropertinting on and then rebooting your computer.<br />
<br />
This was posted on another board as a solution for the other problem.  Be careful messing with the registry unless your familiar with it!<br />
<br />
Here is the solution: EverQuest: All NPC's in certain zones appear as human males. <br />
<br />
1. Ensure that when you start the everquest patcher that you go to the advanced options, and enable the downloads for any expansions you have by checkmark the appropriate expansions.<br />
<br />
2. Go to your everquest folder (usually c:\program files\everquest or c:\program files\sony\everquest) and look for files that end in .txc and delete those, then restart the patcher<br />
<br />
3. If neither of the above work then you can try reinstalling the game<br />
To safely reinstall the files, please follow these steps, in order:<br />
<br />
1. Use the Add/Remove control panel and uninstall ALL EverQuest and EverQuest expansion installations.<br />
2. Open the Find/Search command from your Start menu and select Files or Folders<br />
3. Type &quot;EverQuest&quot; in the Named field; set the Located In field to &quot;All Local Drives&quot;, click Find/Search Now, and delete everything that appears.<br />
4. Type &quot;*.s3d&quot; in the named field; set the Located In field to &quot;All Local Drives&quot;, click Find/Search Now, and delete everything that appears.<br />
5. Go into your C: drive, double-click the &quot;Program Files&quot; folder, double-click the &quot;InstallShield Installation Information&quot; folder. Note: this is a hidden folder and so you must be showing all files to see it.<br />
6. From the InstallShield folder, delete these folders: {2848FB25-CF81-11D5-B880-00A0CC58DEE4} (Luclin), {B769E280-9708-11D5-B880-00A0CC58DEE4} (Trilogy) and {DD494BAD-BA13-11D4-8737-00A0CC58DEE4} (Velious)<br />
7. Reinstall from the CDs starting with your Original, Kunark Full, or Trilogy discs, then your expansion discs, from oldest to newest.<br />
8. Do not start EverQuest until you have installed from all of your discs. <br />
<br />
<br />
Here is the problem or goal: <br />
All NPC's in certain zones appear as human males. <br />
<br />
Bald humans in place of mobs in certain zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The funny looking pets was a texture cache problem.  Reformatting and reinstalling eq wiped out the texture cache files and caused them to recreate the first time you zoned into a zone and fixed that problem.  <br />
<br />
For your other problem I'd also recommend a complete file check and then verify what graphics options are set compared to your GF's computer and see if her's are set higher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slissa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Don't forget to reinstall Velious.  With SoL you can install the new textures and it will install most of the Velious files but it is missing a few :) I did this once since my CDs are Kunark, Velious, SoL and PoP (I don't have the combo one.)  Also after reinstalling do not forget to recheck all of the expantion downloads as well as the optional for the patcher.  Otherwise you get a real treat the first time you zone into the hole!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There is a tree in Emerald Jungle that floats.... Anyone seen that?  :)  It is near the FoB zone and on a jutting of the zone valley wall.<br />
<br />
Well, this is what i thought of when I read the title.  :)</div></div><hr />

Heh not going to reformat this stupid computer again... pain in the ass down loading all the crap I want over and over again :)</div></div><hr />
