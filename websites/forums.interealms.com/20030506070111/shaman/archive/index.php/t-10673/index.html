<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I must say I'm a little concerned how few posts there are here compared to the 50-60 forum. I'm looking forward to soloing the necro/pyra area in Seb at 60 where I'll be able to single pull the bugs and maybe trying Plane of Growth but it sure doesn't seem like there's much more than that reading this forum :(<br />
<br />
I mostly group but I like having my personal time soloing. Are the solo spots really this limited at 60+?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sad but true.  There are a few spots mentioned on this board, but I'll never bother with them when the xp is so good when grouping with my guildmates.<br />
<br />
It's safer, It's better for your pocketbook, It's more fun (for me at least).<br />
<br />
I've hung up my soloing spear.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pfff! Im 58 and soloing like crazy! My favourite spot at the minute is root/dotting the lightcrawlers from the castle in PoD. I have my epic, a horse, but no JBB. I get 6% AA exp a kill and the recovering time is short due to KM.<br />
<br />
Plane of Growth is soloable at least at 56! 5kpp in one hour was the best money ive ever had. I solo necro too now, and bugs generally come in 2's but then i just root park them off... not a problem. I cant to gang, because Ikky Necros are too hard. <br />
<br />
I would suggest root dotting the Hobgoblins in PoN? I was planning to try it but the only area i could see that was safe to pull to was camped by a group.<br />
<br />
Basically i can solo anywhere, whether its IN TEH FACE or root/dotting... i dont see why people have a problem!<br />
<br />
p.s. before you vindicate me as a prissy shaman who prefers to run away then stand and fight... well i guess i should say something defensive here but what the hell, if it gets me good exp ill do it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wow PoG at 56? Damn I'll have to try that this weekend then.  <br />
<br />
I'm way too chicken to try the lightcrawlers in PoD, those things hit me for 350+. Ack a few bad resists and it's going to be ugly. I've done the diseased rats at entrance which only hit for 250 and while I land most my slows on them on first try I've had about 1 in 10 that resisted a couple malosini and a couple slows and poor puppy bought the farm real fast so I shiver at the thought of a lightcrawler :)</div></div><hr />

FYI, Hobgoblins in PoN are immune to root.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That person is a bit nuts about solo in PoG at 56.  Without malo/topor it can be a challenge at 60 (played around in PoG last night).<br />
<br />
Epics will stick, but entollings and horsies seem to have very good MR.  Root should work, but don't be suprised if you get more than a few resisted slows.<br />
<br />
Most of the shammy PoG guides that I've read suggest: &quot;If you get an add..gate&quot;.  This doesn't sound like a fun option, but your results may differ.  I'll probably head back in and see what I can learn.  Perhaps I'll write another 'step-by-step' guide if I can get enough strategies collected and tried.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aye, very limited at 60+ and becoming more and more limited.<br />
<br />
King Akanon (the gnome king) was a level 60 mob, hit for about 150, slowable, 30k hp, 6 min spawn, solo pullable, faction can be fixed by killin minos in steamfont, drops random gems. This camp would be perfect to get to 65 until they nerfed it. Not sure how they nerfed it but the king shows no hp bar when you target him now. If you do find a good solo spot, definately do not post it. All they will do is nerf it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hehe, i am nuts ;) PoG at 56 is not easy, mobs have high hp, but hit low and basically you need your epic for the damage, if anything else. Its also manadraining, but i found i could kill generally one mob every 9 mins, which isnt bad going.<br />
<br />
Thanks Ouga for the note on hobgoblins. Saved me a death or 2!!! :)<br />
<br />
I do PoG quite regularly with no opposition from guilds/server... if you would like ill write up a guide? Where would i post it though, here or the 50-60 part?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Found a sweet spot in chardok to solo at 60. I finished off my last bub there today in fact.  Wish I had known about it earlier. Going to make separate post about it.</div></div><hr />
