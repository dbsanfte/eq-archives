Do Shamans get a cannibalize type spell in their spell artillery?<br />

No but we do get a HO that regens power as we fight if we happen to get that HO. Blessing of Faith - Power Regen Buff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Cool things that shamans do get:<br />
-bear form and hawk form if a mystic, <br />
-Wraith form if a Defiler. <br />
-A stationary giant badger type ward at 45.<br />
-rez!<br />
<br />
Can anyone add to the list of cool things shamans get?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Heals that are good enough for us to actually do our job as a Priest.  Very cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I like our cold based dot. Stacks nicely with our disease dot for a true shaman-like soloing experience. Tank them &quot;in teh face&quot;, cast ho, dot dot, ho completes, wait for dot to wear off, cast ho, dot dot, ho completes for extra nuke....<br />
<br />
<br />
I was grouped with a templar the other day and she kept telling me to stop using dots. I explained they helped the ho's, she kept swearing they were breaking it. Bah. Stupidity. It's a-flashing, and I'm going to keep casting contagion as it's a fast ho spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Aye, sometimes when I'm in a group that's moving too fast to Co-Ordinate HO's I'll use Contagion and manage to get my own HO off in between their spamming lol. Super fast!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Group HO's make my head hurt. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You could actually both be right.<br />
<br />
Because Contagion casts so quickly, it is possible for you to (easily) break a HO chain by using it at the wrong time.<br />
<br />
It is also possible to quickly complete a HO chain (or advance one) using Contagion.<br />
<br />
It all depends upon the situation.  You should probably discuss it in your group as to who will start the chains and what each person's responsibility in the chain is.  There are definitely chains you can break by casting Contagion, just as there are chains you can advance by casting it.</div></div><hr />
