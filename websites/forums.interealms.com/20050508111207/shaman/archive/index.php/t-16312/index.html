<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Irontree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have some questions from a person playing EQ for 2 years, but a shaman for about a week.<br />
<br />
1) Shaman soloing<br />
<br />
I have root-dotted, I have fear-kited, I have kited, I have aggro kited, but on Shaman, I don't understand how to bring the pet into the equation short of agrokiting, which is not always doable or desirable.<br />
<br />
Can the pet tank a slowed mob while dots work? This is my quess at how shaman solo (short of aggro kiting with the pet), how far off am I? Moving pet in and out, between rounds of root/dotting?<br />
<br />
2) Dots<br />
<br />
I heard somewhere that all Shaman dots stack in any combo, that they dont have &quot;lines&quot; like druid or necro dots. Is there any truth to this?<br />
<br />
If you want to go all out and kill something bigger, do you just lay every stinking dot on it for a mega stack?<br />
<br />
I personally like Dots, and I am curious where Shaman stand in the Dot Heiarchy. Looking at lucy, it appears Shaman are #2 behind Necros, due to the stacking they can lay. I looked at efficiency of Druid Dots, and they appear to be as good as Shaman, but not as stackable and missing the dd &quot;bolt&quot; concept.<br />
<br />
3) Torpor line<br />
<br />
I am confused by the complexities that torpor line cause with the negative parts. Doesn't this cause an annoying drop in dps and ability to move? Do you auto-re-sow people that get toropored?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time, and I am sorry if I asked a question or made a contention that pissed anyone off =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Serv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1) Shaman soloing<br />
<br />
Generaly shaman soloing is root rotting or tanking a mob in teh face while using torpor / Q to keep hps up.<br />
<br />
2) DoT<br />
<br />
There are two types of shaman DoTs, disease and poison. Disease tend to be longer lasting, and poison quicker but more damaging. Every shaman dot stacks with each other.<br />
<br />
3) Torpor line<br />
<br />
When using it soloing and tanking you're going to want to box yourself into a corner anyways. I never really cast it on others minus during downtime (Q is much better for that), but it doesn't overwrite SoW, it just overwrites the effect. Once Torpor wears off, they run SoW speed again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1) Your pet isn't gonna tank even a slowed mob for very long andagro kiting doesn't work well without snare so (at least until you hit PoP) the only reasonable way to use your pet (solo) is to tank for him. That also has the advantage of letting you do some melee dps while your dots work. It also has the advantage that you don't have to worry about rooting. Standard pet soloing is to pull with slow (or mal-x), stack a dot or two and melee them down with the help of your puppy. <br />
<br />
2) Realistically, the only three dots I'd ever use where my best disease and 2 best poison dots, which ones and how many to stack really depends on the situation. Disease dots on big targets if you have to pace your mana, poison dots if you want to kill quick. And yeah, we argueably have the 2nd best dots. Necro is number one, druid dots aren't as powerful as ours but their swarms almost always land which makes them a bit more powerful than the numbers would indicate. <br />
<br />
3) Torpor doesn't overwrite sow, just negates it while it's active. ... and yes, the melees do get annoyed when you cast it on them. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vorkreider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">key here is:  Jack up your AC and HPs as high as you can, and with the mob slowed you generally don't CARE if its beating on you on anything resembling a reasonable target.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Before the 50's, the pet is too wimpy to tank.<br />
<br />
There is a phase of shaman life in the 50's (after you get Turgurs at 51) where the pet can tank pretty well against the slowed dark blues you are fighting (think COM), which works nice while you sit on a horse medding and blast away with your JBB, with maybe one dot running to speed things up.  This style of fighting worked well even in PoG soloing at 61.<br />
<br />
In the 60's in PoP, the mobs hit too hard to let the pet (or even the shaman, really) tank without blowing too much mana on heals.  Root rot is the way to solo in PoP.<br />
<br />
In the 60's outside PoP, in the face shaman tanking with Torpor/Q up is the way to go.  This is also what lets shaman, unlike the other big soloing classes, solo summoning mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">1) Shaman soloing<br />
<br />
Cast slow, cast dots, mob beats on you, pet chews on mob, heal yourself.  This is typicaly the most efficient way to solo until PoP (where mobs just hit too hard and we are forced to root/rot.)<br />
<br />
2) Dots<br />
<br />
They all stack.  I could cast every dot I have from level 1 to 65 on a mob... of course its not really mana efficient to do that.  Typicaly you wont cast more than your latest dot and maybe the one from the previous rank.<br />
<br />
3) Torpor line<br />
<br />
Torpor and Stoicism both snare and melee slow the person being healed.  Once torpor/stoicism wears off the person returns to their previous speed -no need to re haste/sow.  Torpor (and I believe Stoicism) is limited to your group only.  Quiessence provides the healing power of torpor without the drawbacks.<br />
<br />
These are very efficient heals, but until you get Q melee classes will hate having them cast on them during combat.  Excelent for use on yourself or casters tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">1.  Tank the mob in the face, to do this you need decent hitpoints and AC (e.g.  throw out all gear that doesn't have +50 hps on it or better, wisdom doesn't mean crap on a shaman.  Anyone who says it does is splitting hairs :P).<br />
<br />
Of course in PoP tanking the mobs in the face is tough because they hit so damned hard.  So in PoP you generally just root and rot (or get a pocket cleric :P).<br />
<br />
2.  All of our dots stack.  But in pratice you only toss a couple on.<br />
<br />
3.  Your info on torpor is out of date.  It doesn't remove sow.  It is basically a heal over time that snares and slows whomever you cast it on.  The ill effects go away with the spell wearing off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The 61 pet can very easily tank slowed non-PoP mobs like frogs in seb, grimlings in IA, goblins in Droga, golems in Veksar with you throwing on the occasional Torpor/Q. Heck that even works with some tier1 mobs like the yardtrash in PoN. Even when your dog can tank sometimes it's better that you do the tanking for him and let him hit from behind the mob where mob's can't dodge, parry, block or riposte. <br />
<br />
Torpor is a wonderful spell but melee hate it so I mostly used it on me and doggy. Quiescence makes life so much sweeter with no ill side effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have found, albeit a mana hog, at 65, with Quiescence, I can somewhat effectively solo in tier3.  Keyword being somewhat.<br />
<br />
if you drop everything you have into your pet, (focus, diaku, sta, agi, ac, replen, fa, sltw, etc) and then keep tnarg's and Q in your gem bar as they should be, if you can single pull the elemental mobs, sic pet while you slow (malos pull), then drop a  tnarg or Q into your pet, you can sit back and watch the fur fly.<br />
<br />
You need to keep Q up constantly, or nearly so on the pet if you dont want to take the hits like a man, and you'll probably either need c3+ or a large mana pool to accomplish this...I have taken several by dropping a BoNife(lack BoSaryn), and BoUltor into it, then running around a bit until the pet regains aggro, and it's all good...when the pet dies though..it's a whole new ballgame.. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">1. I use my dog when soloing easy stuff, like tier 1.  I make sure to SOW him, and send him in to fight the rooted mob.  Pull him off when he gets to 40% and let him regenerate.  He's a lot of work for not much benefit though so I've been getting to the point that I don't bother to use him when soloing at all.  Certainly he wouldn't be useful in Tier 2.<br />
<br />
OTOH if you're fighting a summoning mob you MUST tank &quot;in teh face&quot; and keep Torpor/Q up constantly, and in that situation you might as well have him chewing on the mob's behind.<br />
<br />
2. When root-rotting something I know is gonna take a long time I use Breath of Ultor, Pox of Bertoxxulous, Bane of Nife, and epic.  When I get Blood of Saryryn I'll use that as well for two poison + two disease + epic.  The issue is that epic, breath, and blood do NOT break root, but Pox and Bane DO break root, at least most of the time.  Bane has to be reapplied pretty often, too.<br />
<br />
There are some shaman more daring than I (or better equipped) but I can solo the golems in PoV without much trouble this way, and they are 6% AA per kill at 65 :-)<br />
<br />
3. Torpor is a wonderful downtime heal for tanks, combat heal for you and other non-melee, and self-heal for cannibalizing.  It's not a combat heal for melee, you have to use Kragg's Mending or Tnarg's Mending for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">1) Shaman soloing<br />
<br />
How well you solo and the method you use will greatly depend on your level and your equipment.  Until you get your first pet you are a weak warrior with a bag of tricks.  This is not a bad thing, as you have some nice tricks.  The ability to slow your opponent and haste yourself is very powerful.  Even the lower level versions of these spells makes a noticeable difference.  <br />
<br />
Once you get your spirit puppy you can deal with mobs even better.  Your first few pets are not tanks, but they are a powerful addition to your arsenal.  When soloing I would pull a mob with slow and root it near my pet.  I’d cast my dots and when root broke I’d tank it while my pup bit it on the butt.  This worked very well for me.  <br />
<br />
Currently, at level 61, I’ll pull a mob with slow and as it slowly beats on me I cast my dots.  My pet and I are both hasted, but to be honest I do very little damage to it with any of my weapons.  My puppy, on the other hand, does massive amounts of damage.  So basically I’m playing meat shield to keep the mob from slowing down the damage my pet is doing.  My pet and my dots are doing the real damage.  I could also pull with a lesser spell and let my pet get aggro and let him tank.  But the mobs I’m soloing right now cast slow on him and the fights take a lot longer that way.  With non-slowing mob I’m sure my level 61 pet will make a much better tank.  <br />
<br />
As you gain levels your solo options will broaden.  But how much so depends on your “stuff.”  I have never owned a JBB.  If you have one soloing becomes much easier.  I don’t have my epic.  If you do then soloing becomes easier.  With great effort, and expense, I now have most of my major damage and healing spells. If you don’t have these for your level then soloing will be more difficult.  I don’t have very powerful weapons.  If you do then soloing becomes easier.  But even the most poorly equipped shaman can solo; it’s just more difficult than it might otherwise be.  <br />
<br />
2) Dots<br />
<br />
Yes, shaman dots stack in any combination, except for casting the same exact spell of course.  But so do all druid dots.  And from what I understand this is true for all classes.  It didn’t used to be true but it was changed with a patch some time back.  The same exact dot will also stack on a mob if it’s cast by two different casters.  I almost feel sorry for the mobs.  <br />
<br />
When soloing I rarely cast more than a couple of dots in order to conserve manna.  I can canni it back of course, but it’s just that much more down time I’d rather not have.  But how many spells to cast will differ from mob to mob.  And I always get KEI, if possible, before leaving town, whether solo or grouping.  It makes life so much easier.<br />
<br />
3) Torpor line<br />
<br />
Stoicism, and later Torpor, are incredibly useful spells.  They allow us to heal back the damage we do to ourselves with cannibalize in an extremely manna efficient manor.  I couldn’t believe how much better life was as a shaman when I got stoicism.  And when I got Torpor, less than a week ago, I found myself in awe once again.  It’s simply an amazing spell.  <br />
<br />
Yes, it slows down your run to a slow walk and reduces your attack speed.  But when casting it on yourself it really doesn’t mater.  When acting as a caster in a group you don’t need to move anyway.  And when soloing, unless you have an amazing weapon, you aren’t doing a lot of damage with your swings so swinging a bit slower won’t really hurt.  You can cast Torpor when tanking for your pet and still cast spells while your pet is chewing through the mob from behind.  Granted, its not the best spell to cast on your group’s tank, but there are times when it could mean the difference between his/her life or death.  <br />
<br />
Shaman can be very effective at soloing.  You just have to approach it differently than other classes.  After playing a druid for so long I still miss snare.  But we do have root and that can be a very effective tool as well.  Try a few different methods and see what works best for you.</div></div><hr />
