<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How can we address valid shaman concerns with Sony?<br />
Is there someone to email or speak to?<br />
<br />
(please dont flame me - this imo is very valid and not just a whine)<br />
<br />
I have a shaman who I am trying to get canni 2 for. (I play 2 shamans and I had bought the strange ochre clay for the other one - no way at 39 he could get it either.<br />
<br />
It hasnt been for sale in bazzaar that I can tell on my server except for the first time I bought it.<br />
<br />
I have been camping CoM for 3 weeks now.<br />
<br />
Today I was there with 2 shamans (myself included) lvl 49 and 46<br />
3 rangers, one with epic lvl 52, a 48 and a lvl 49<br />
<br />
5 people!<br />
<br />
The Army Behemoth that drops the Strange Ochre Clay comes up on track but we cant get to him.<br />
<br />
Well never mind that we couldnt get to him even though he was on track - is there antoher way upstairs? Cause even if we could get upstairs the random adds of greens and light blues were killing us!<br />
<br />
never mind the reds and deep blues we would have run into.<br />
<br />
We got wiped once and had to zone almost dead 2 times. They agro thru walls very easily.<br />
<br />
I keep asking people how ty one know how to o get to army behemoth and they say he's a random spawn. If I cant do this with an almost FULL lvl 50ish party what the freak is this spell doing at lvl 39???<br />
<br />
/rant over<br />
<br />
I feel better now<br />
<br />
is there another lvl on the right side (temple area) when you first come in that allows you to get up on the castle walls?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hamenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I believe that CoM is another zone that is on the &quot;revamp list&quot; for upcoming patches.<br />
<br />
The zone's design was fine when it was first released, but they really need to go back and open up some of these older zones now, as there just isn't enough &quot;character skill balance&quot; to make them viable.<br />
<br />
So far, the zones that have been revamped have seen some pretty good results with regards to epic drops, and the accessibility of the mobs that drop them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The quest is totally ridiculous for a lvl 39. Another spell that should be addressed by SOE is the lvl 49 (i think? too lazy to check) spell IOS. Imagine the only way to get this spell if it isn't given to you by a higher lvl BST or you don't have the 3+ K to buy in the bazaar the very rare times it is up FS (on TP anyways) is to burn an EP (one EP if u'r lucky, I've tried about 10 sofar with no luck) on a lvl 49 spell... uggghhhh.<br />
<br />
I honestly believe these types of spells are an inside joke to the dev team as a laff. Honestly how st00pid can they be?</div></div><hr />

IoS is a Beast Lord spell that Shaman can use. At 49 HoS is a much better spell which is a vendor spell in Shadow Haven. <br />
<br />
That said I agree with the Canni2 quest being a sick joke but at 45 and duo'ing with a 53 monk we spent many fun hours in CoM and saw many clay drops in that time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You can generally get the clay by tagging along on any of the large scale raids needed for various epics - Jade Reaver for Druids, Neh / Rak for Shaman etc....These raids need a fairly strong force, and usually, if you tell peeps you just want the ochre clay, they will let you tag along (you might even get some pages or book for your epic!).<br />
<br />
I agree that this quest is difficult for the level of the spell, but Canni2 is a great upgrade from Canni1, and you should not just wait until Canni3 unless you absolutely have to</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the canni 2 quest.  Its rough.  I had canni 3 before I was able to finish the quest.  The army behemoth is not upstairs.  It tends to spawn near the castle, on the approach to the right or left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Several of the developers at sony play shaman as their primary characters. They do know whats going on. <br />
<br />
Yeah and their (SOE devs) shammys are &lt; lvl 65 missing spells right? Gimme a break, they never grind for **** &amp; don't play the same game you &amp; I do. They all prolly have 5K+ hps &amp; a 5K+ mana pool... and that's prolly a very modest guesstimate. <br />
<br />
Lets talk about the shammy trying to get this spell as a RL joe with regular gear. It isn't going to happen without some high lvl freinds &amp; well whats the point of that? Make a lvl 39 spell accessible to those that have the PP to burn in the bazaar on the rare occasion this spell is ever up (&amp; I personally have never seen it up FS on TP... imagine how much PP it would go for if it was up FS!!!) or  have high lvl friends that have time they wanna waste going after this quest. It's just a total joke if you think about it.<br />
<br />
IoS is a Beast Lord spell that Shaman can use. At 49 HoS is a much better spell which is a vendor spell in Shadow Haven. <br />
<br />
Yeah it is a lvl 60+ BST lord spell that you get from an EP turn-in that shammys get at lvl 49. Why would we get a spell at 49 that requires an EP turn-in? An EP turn-in btw that seems very rare? Like ***, it's really gotta be an SOE joke. Y not make it a lvl 49 shammy spell that BST lords get at lvl 60+... quest or whatever?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Its more like Shaman would be pissed if Bst got that Spell and we didnt, so they added us to that spell, and of course at a lower level.<br />
<br />
But obviously some of us like to hate Sony no matter what they do! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">on the clay ..... i have destroyed more clay then i even care to think about. and this is where i got it. oks since you where complaining about trying to get up staiers then i would asume you know what on my server ( or just me and a couple friends ) called the &quot; gazzebbos &quot; ( pardon the spelling ) . basicly its the small huts with 3 spawns in side them out in front of the castle. I was soloing here for most of 51 to 56 or so ( this was back before most of the quick lvling zones and CoM was even close to not being a ghost town, but wait it was just this side of it at any rate ) these 3 spawn points have a chance to spawn the high lvl versions of each of the 4 typs of mobs in the zone, plue normal spawn is the next lower ones. well now the army guys are also on the spawn list, so that is about the most frequent place to find them. and yes a group of around lvl 40 could take these people with a decent amount of risk to them selfs ( thay are around lvl 32 to 40 in lvl spawns ). so just like the spell research componets for casters ( int ) we have to look for our stuff on a lvl mob that is decently close to the lvl of the spell. the only reson people say that a 39 lvl shaman can not get it is becouse you realy cant go there and find a pick-up group of lvl 40 range that is even back doing the brige/gazebbo areas ever ( even back in kunark/veliouse time fram ). It can be done and the trick in spliting the mobs i am not sure can be done anymore after the pathing upgrade, but the los blocking stuff might still enable to let you single pull them, just need to adventer and find out. I found back then that CoM for the lvls i soloed it was better exp then group at the curent time or place for populare pick-up groups. I actull did not get can 2 tell around 51 and boy was there a difrence from can 1. most of the time you are not going to be able to go in and find it up you will just need to sit and kill for a couple of hours, but as long as your get some exp for it then great, and if your soloing  then you can practice soloing in a dungane envirement with very little space to realy move around in without aggroing stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">also the spell and most types of drops for the lvl thay are to be used are desinded with the idea that you are bring the backing of a near full to full group with oyu to the table, and a decent mix of people with people that are paying attention to what is going on and have some decent comunication skills and are not Ebayed or botted ( oks i have had some very bad instences of botted things killing groups becouse the person could not give there full attention to both charicters at once and help strech the limits of what the group could do, with botted clerics being the worse ). a decent group of lvl 40's could if thay wanted to take out stuff that was lvl 45 .... you dont just pick up that ablityiy when you ding to the high end game. but most people just dont want to RISK it and would just rather wait tell it was a trival encounter then go see what there capable of as a group and as a single. <br />
<br />
true while soloing for exp i stuck to low end blues around 10 to 15 lvls below me, becouse that was the most efficant, but numers times i went out insearch of stuff that was a lvl or 2 higher then me, and with the help of my warrior friend i was leveling up with we touch them out ( heck did practicly my entire epic by the time i was 48 with just me and him and a couple guild raids [ the hole, CoM, Dire being the raids ] was fun doing the stuff at the lvl you where supposed to, starting at lvl 12 and working it through -out your carreer )</div></div><hr />

What language is this?  What's &quot;up FS (on TP anyways)&quot; mean?  What's an EP and how do you burn one?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just kinda skimmed the thread, so not sure if this was mentioned.  The army behemoth can also spawn relatively near the zone in at the 'temple' to the right after you go through the gate (one of the spots in the bottom).  Its also pretty safe to pull outside of the temple and he spawns there pretty frequently.<br />
<br />
Pathing as always (as in any new dungeon you visit) requires a little experimentation to avoid trains and aggro through walls etc, including if you go back to the gazebos, all in all, a fun zone and I spent a considerable amount of time soloing and powerleveling there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The strange ochre clay is probably the toughest part, and it's droppable.  <br />
<br />
Yes, a group in their 40s can certainly go into CoM and get it, and that's what the quest is designed for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Angryor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I have to agree with Gart, this is not that difficult of a quest. <br />

The exp in CoM at or around 39 for a group would be pretty good if not great given the zone ZeM and full group bonus now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you speak to them re: this matter. <br />
<br />
As to some of the posters who said this is fairly easy for a full group.<br />
<br />
As stated I was in a group of 5 with lots of healing, dps and CC<br />
<br />
what else did we need? we even had a tracker to find the army behemoth - and we couldnt get to it because of the way the zone is set up - he was upstairs - a place correct me if im wrong you cant get to without a rogue with 200 lock pick and a mess of trouble.<br />
<br />
As too /oocing for it, sorry thats not how I want to get my spells, I dont want to buy it either, as far as getting higher lvls to help me, sorry the only people that help me are in my lvl range, if its for my epic thats another deal and they have to be scheduled.<br />
<br />
I just think these things should be doable by a group in the correct lvl range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">You simply had bad luck, Tiorr! The Army Behemoth can spawn downstairs, at the temle right of the exit (and I guess in other areas as well). Just kill around in the temple area and eventually an Army Behemoth is destined to spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">i solo with my SK a lot in CoM and ive noticed army behemoth often by the reaver castle, They spawn randomly and more than once.<br />
<br />
Try over that way, its good exp for  my 55 sk and usually deserted.<br />
<br />
Tiorr if i catch one of them on irc i can ask.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Angryor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Aye, go to the temple on the right at the first T after the gate and keep killing till you get the AB.  Likewise the AB also spawns outside the locked door at the Gazebo's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Tiorr, this may sound harsh, but all I can say is your group did not play with much skill or function well, or got flat out unlucky.<br />
<br />
I did this in the 40s, and I know plenty of other people who have.  In fact, I did it a couple of times to help other shaman in my guild get it.  <br />
<br />
It's simply not that bad, but like anything in EQ, the first time in a new dungeon can be a little rough until you figure things out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Submit a comment to Developer's Corner (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_feedback.jsp).  You may or may not get a reply other than the automatic confirmation, but I know that they get read, and quickly.  I send suggestions there on a fairly regular basis, occasionally get personal replies.  But then, I'm usually just giving my arguments and not asking questions, and don't know if asking questions is more likely to elicit a response.  I've never heard back from anyone other than Absor, but don't know for sure that he's the only one who reads it.  But I've read enough replies from him (most to various friends) to trust that he really does listen and try to help, and consults with their local experts as needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>GotSandDunes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">who need's a rogue?? <br />
<br />
Get upstairs via the &quot;back&quot; way :P<br />
<br />
and yeah.. keep killing he can spawn anywhere.. Seen him in the stables, in the temple, one of the front 3 mobs by the gate, in a gazzeebboos (heh), and certainly upstairs... <br />
<br />
if ya gonna complain, complain that you have to ruuuuun a long azz way in TD to get the diamond dust (WHICH by the way is a cheesy short-cut :P)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">what can also help is getting a ranger friend or  making a druid/ranger alt to camp in com and have them log in from time to time to see whats on tracking. i bet youll have a easier time finding him that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">What are the stats on that?<br />
<br />
Haha.  Funny :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Vorkreider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">It's more a matter of patience and the random pop.  Guildie's had been camping for him for 4 hours.  I went to help, pulled twice, and the second pull (from the temple) was the Army.  They had been there for four hours before I showed up.<br />
<br />
For another example that's even worse in my opinion is the wizard Concussion spell.  Also a level 39 spell that involves CoM and KC.  However, the part in KC is a turn in back in the Jail near the HandWarlord area.  The part in CoM is on the second level, not a random spawn.  With various tricks you can bypass the content of the quest, but if you did it the way Verant intended the only way to get to the Human Skel for the turn in is to pass through the locked door where the reavers are and fight your way up to the second level.  Once there, you can't just kill the guy, you have to do a turn in.  As he is KOS, that means bringing an enchanter or necro along to help.  Past the reavers at 39?!  Bogus.<br />
<br />
Having said that, I got canni II for my shaman at 39 with help of my friends.  Same with the concussion for my wizard.  I don't think I put 4 hours work total into either of the quests.<br />
<br />
Somedays I'm just lucky.  I got Raster for my monk after only 40 hours or so of camping, but I loved it down there because it was great exp.  Three days later I went down to help a friend with him, although someone else had the camp.  Next pop Raster was there and that guy got it.  Came down the next day, and again, 30 minutes or so after I got there Raster popped again and my buddy got him.  Random drops and being in the right place at the right time will do it every time, you just have to be there to take advantage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Badz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I have 2 shaman on TP (Tholuxe Paells).  One is lvl 50 barb and the other is lvl 30 ogre.  My shaman that is lvl 50 now completed the Canni2 quest in 4 hours on a Friday at level 44 just 3 weeks ago. I was very lucky to buy the Clay in Bazaar for 200pp.  I /ooc for the bone chips in KC and got them within 20 minutes, retrieved the diamonds from the ground spawn on Golra Island and with the help of a 52 warrior and 45 ranger got the powder in TT.  I debated about trying to kill and loot the clay but Bazaar was my friend.  BTW, I am not a member of any guild that has helped me.<br />
<br />
As far as IoS,  I bought it 2 weeks ago in Bazaar for 50pp.  I have seen the price range from 50pp to 4,000pp.  I should know because in the last 2 weeks I have bought it twice more for cheap and resold it.  This is how I make my money, buy low/sell high.  I am going to do a search now on this board and look into which is better Hos or IoS.  My informal testing shows IoS to be better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Sorry a bit side tracking.<br />
<br />
Xhosa said:<br />
<br />
&quot;IoS is a Beast Lord spell that Shaman can use. At 49 HoS is a much better spell which is a vendor spell in Shadow Haven.&quot;<br />
<br />
Xhosa, you do know that this spell stacks with Talisman Altuna right? The combined hp of IoS with Tuna is more than Focus Spirit your level 60 spell less the dex and str.<br />
<br />
Thats a hell of a lot of HP you miss out on. That's piss poor implementation on SOE's part.<br />
<br />
 I boggle at thought process of anyone who thinks it's ok that the only way to get a lvl 49 spell is to have a reasonably rare parchment that even level 55+ shamans find it hard to lay their hands on and then hope that the random spell turn in generator works in your favour to give you this spell.<br />
<br />
The argument that it's orignally a 60+ Beastlord spell and they decided to include shaman in it's usage just further proves their piss poor implementation process. They could have made it a quest reward like Stoism/Blood of Nadox.<br />
<br />

Thank you very much for your well thought out response.<br />
<br />
I am now lvl 48, havent been able to get the ochre clay, because quite honestly I can't get to where the army behemoth is.<br />
<br />
And yes I have ooc'd and yes I have had several rangers try to help me.<br />
Ranger keeps tracking it up top, which I can't get to, and quite frankly they can't either, without the rougue.<br />
<br />
I would RATHER NOT buy my spells, is the point of my post.<br />
<br />
I would rather be able to take a group of 4-6 people in to a zone, clear an area or as in the case when it is CLEARLY on ranger track go get it and kill it.<br />
<br />
MOST readers have ignored the fact that army behemoth is up in CoM on TP server, but it is positioned on the top part, where from every <br />
single person I have asked you can't get to without a rogue and a good sized force. With good solid lvls in your group.<br />
<br />
It is not a question of keep clearing and it will pop - it has.<br />
<br />
Next lvl - 49 I can USE IoS<br />
<br />
Please tell me how I can get Etheral Parchement in a pop zone?<br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is I CAN'T.<br />
<br />
These are 2 rather good examples of poor implementation on spell acquisition.<br />
<br />
This is the point of my post, I am not whining as some have pointed out, nor not willing to do the work as some people have pointed out. Nor not willing to ask others for help.<br />
<br />
I am simply trying to say is there a method of feedback back to Sony for Shaman issues, whereby players can say - heh this doesn't seem to make sense, can we implement this better.<br />
<br />
Anyways to the posters who have posted helpful replies thank you very much.<br />
<br />
I will keep trying to piggy back raids that are going in deeper. Just haven't been lucky enough yet to be on when a raid has gone through.</div></div><hr />
