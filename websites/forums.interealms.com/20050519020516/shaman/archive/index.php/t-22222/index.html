<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">About two weeks before I deployed I was down in the bazaar with my SK alt looking for a decent breastplate..I put out a tell..<br />
/ooc 41 SK LF decent Breastplate, have loot send a tell.&quot;<br />
Well, I waited for a bit and go the usual jokes, and bogus tells and continued scrolling through my search when a &quot;mage&quot; walked up to me and asked if I had found what I was looking for..I said nope, but Im still hopefull..He asked me how much I had to spend and I said about 10k, loot I had saved up and such..He laugh and handed me 20k plat, and gated out..I was shocked..I sent him a tell and asked him why he would give a complete stranger that much plat..He laughed and said because I didnt beg..To this day I remember his name.. Gustov...I have taken his generosity to hart.  Shortly after that I was PLing a group of complete stranger in MS, the poor cleric was doing ok, and I asked her if she had a mount..She smiled, said no, but was saving for it..As soon as they finished I asked her to follow me to the bazaar and promptly bought her a mount..I didnt know her, but I enjoyed her response emmensly.. Have you ever done as much in game for a complete stranger?  Im currious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">not necessarily complete strangers.. but when i left i gave about half of my droppable equip to lower levels ive talked to before, most of it was pretty decent for bazaar bought items, better than anything they had anyways /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tindaorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">a few years back when my bard was my main i was sitting in Kelethin and i got to talking to a lower level bard and i gave him all my old lambent gear ( i just upgraded from it ) and mistmoore battle drums i still talk to that guy when i see him on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I commonly practice random acts of kindness. Its very gratifying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yah one time a thief was in Firona Vie during Kunark expansion. he was like level 25ish and was fighting spiders and getting owned . I helped him and his friuend out some. And they thanked me nicly but when I asked if they needed any buffs they replied that they shouldnt take any high level ones It would make it unfair. <br />
<br />
I looked over his gear real fast and gave him a new weapon and a couple other small decent upgrades That were not out of reach of him if he had a few slightly higher level friends. <br />
<br />
About two and a half years later he comes running up to me with a huge emote hug and reminded me of the time I helped him and such. I remember who he was and asked about his friend as well. They were still playing in a Roleplaying guild and having a ball. But he took the surname Silvergift in honor of my actions that day. And my surname of Silverhammer. <br />
<br />
That was a very cool day for me. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I never seen to have any money, cause I blow it on all my alts, but I like to go back to newbie zones and become a buffing station  for new peeps while I read a book for a couple hours:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eci_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There was a girl who took over her brother's account because he went into the miltary.  The brother deleted his characters, but she still had the account already paid for.  Therefore, she created a character to try out the game.<br />
<br />
One day, she asked a friend of mine for help.  He had to log but instructed her to join a high level raiding channel to ask us for help.  Well, she joined the channel and was asking newb questions, of course.  Everyone thought is was someone playing a joke and, basically, everyone was very rude to her.<br />
<br />
I sent her a private tell asking if it was a joke or if she was really new to the game.  She gave me the above story.  I felt very bad because she deserved to have the answers and not be made a laughing stock.  So, I gave her about 2 hours worth of instructions on how to play the game.  Then I explained how most people in the game are really nice, and others are really mean.  I told her to not let the mean ones get to her.<br />
<br />
Then I took her to the bazaar and bought her about 3k worth of gear.  She was very greatful and it really felt good to do something nice.  (Some mage gave her an entire set of summoned gear... poor thing would have lost all her gear had she logged out!).<br />
<br />
Anyways, its been a few months now and I still check up on her from time to time.  She's already level 35!  She says that without me, she would have quit the game.  Its always good to do random acts of kindness, don't you think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Saffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just yesterday I was in Shadowhaven taking all the gear off my monk alt, I decided that I didnt wanna play her anymore.  Well she had some damn nice gear, Fungi etc.  I see a level 9 monk and tell him to come to the bank, so he does, and I hand him everything that she was wearing.  He almost fainted!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Some mage gave her an entire set of summoned gear... poor thing would have lost all her gear had she logged out<br />
<br />
heh.. i remember in my first day of playing a mage gave me some pretty awesome stuff.. i thanked him for like an hour straight, i played for awhile.. then logged off for the night, came back the next day and *GASP* all my new stuff was gone! i even petitioned.. i dont think a guide answered me though, i cant remember but i think i thought that the mage had taken all his stuff back.. but eventually like 30 levels later i realised that he had given me no rent things lol<br />
<br />
damn them mages.. they sure do like to tease the newbies... i think i died 3 or 4 times when a mage kept giving me mod rods at lvl 5ish in freeport.. he said theyd make me stronger if i clicked them :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wudcei, a beastlord, gave me a copy of Tumultuos Strength  (value in the bazaar 10p max) when I was a lowly level 19 or so. <br />
<br />
I guess it's easy to forget how hard it is to level your first toon, because thinking about it now, sometimes having that spell in the bank was about all that kept me going through the grind to 39.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure I've never ever cast it :)<br />
<br />
I've given away bits &amp; pieces here and there, like the paineel steel breastplate that a troll shaman named Beutiful hidieosly overchaged me for back in the day - It did have an uber plate look like Jaundiced Bone or Totemic though...<br />
<br />
Thanks for this thread Ghost, reminded me how much fun it is to get stuff like that. Time to clear out some of the lowbie stuff from my traders satchels &amp; go play santa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It's hard to find someone truly in need for a lot of low-mid level gear. It seems a good 90% of people below level 50 are someone else's alts. And quite a few of them are better geared than I am!<br />
<br />
I do try helping out the youngsters when I can. However, it seems the vast majority of the items I've got sitting around are too low a level for most of the lower level crowd; it also doesn't sell in the bazaar. Looks like the best place to use it is for tribute...<br />
<br />
Buffs, on the other hand, are universal. Many times there are level 1s looking for HoS, haste, etc. And it is ALWAYS a rare treat to find someone new to EQ who can truly benefit from both generosity and guidance. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i tend to give stuff away. specially if it only sells for a few pp in bazaar (ie less than 100) , a long time ago a gave away a bronze bp and some crude i had got going through runney eye or somin , made a frined there, and i had  apally twink that had lots of spare stuff which i gave away to this rather undressed char i can across:)<br />
<br />
its always fun though to just go to a newbie zone and buff random poeple:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I remember the guy that gave me 5pp when I started the game then I went and died in qeynos sewers and lost it!.<br />
<br />
As to generosity, I've only really ever buffed people. As far as giving away stuff I'm not really sure if people are playing twinks and sometimes it can semiruin the game if you give them an item too good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i give low level characters (true newbs) wife, husband duo's and random people loot i find/plat, once gave out the arms from chardok to some lvl 5 shaman, he started bugging out and then i handed him REIF and he almost died lol, yea i enjoy seeing people get all worked up botu little things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Peroxide</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You don't see this happening much anymore ingame.  Its good to hear stories about the kidness of people every once in a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Every so often when I'm at the Shar Vahl bank I ooc free stuff at bank. It helps clear out the clutter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">When I started 5 years ago as a warrrior...I was clueless.  I got outside of Halas and attempted to kill guards.  Well, that didn't work.  So I went back and ran around a little bit but I didn't really know where to go.  A paladin happened to notice me and he asked if I needed any help.  I told him I had no idea what I was doing and would really just like to know where things are that I can kill.  So he showed me and then took the time to explain how to do everything.  I didn't even know how to use any other channel but /say  LOL!  When I finally got the hang of it he took me to the vendor and bought me a whole set of leather armor and then handed me 50pp.  That might not seem like much...but back then...I aws just completely baffled.  To this day I still see him occasionally, and every time I do I always thank him for being so kind.  Had he not been around then I would have logged off in frustration and probably never played again.<br />
<br />
Back when there were still &quot;new&quot; players I would sit in Halas and buff them and help them.  I put all my bags in the bank and but 8 slot ones and fill them with armor and food and hand them out to anyone who I thought deserved it.  That was back in my nice days.<br />
<br />
Now I just tell people to piss off.  Heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I remember what it was like to be a newb.  My first main was a gnome wiz, and I remember being in steamfront not even realizing what buffs were.  I though people were casting spells on me.<br />
<br />
However, around the sixth or seventh level, I ran into higher level wiz that had just ported in with a druid.  He came up to me and handed me a loam encrusted choker, a levi ring, and about 200 plat (back when plat meant something), and told me to go to EC and get some equipment.<br />
<br />
Hell, I didn't even know that wiz's needed to wear silk.<br />
<br />
I remembered that gesture, and routinely give away things from Droga, Seb, Nadox that really don't fetch much.  My most recent charity gift was a Lumantic Heraldic BP, that I traded a Compass of Khati Shah for.  The guy really wanted the compass and offerred it, so I took it.  That thing sat in my inventory for weeks, so I just wandered around the 30-45 zones for a bit and found a pally that was MM and gave it to him (I think he had tree weave, or something).<br />
<br />
Anyway, just like our buffs...be generous with them, and generous to true newbs that aren't being PL'ed.  Maybe we can get this game back to a little of what it was in days gone by.  Probably not, but it's nice to help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Last night I went to the bazaar and a low level character sent me a tell asking me for 22pp.<br />
<br />
I sent him a tell back telling him to stop begging and go farm it. He didn't realize I was giving him a gift.<br />
<br />
I taught him to fish.<br />
<br />
w.t.f.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I regularly give away loot in the 1 - 5k range. It is a pain in the butt to try to sell it in the bazaar these days, and I have enough tribute favor at the moment. I never give to beggars, but I do wander through some of the lower level zones and if I see someone working hard, I give them something nice...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I had just finished messing around in PoV when another shaman hailed me..She and I chatted for about an hour, she was level 56 and I was level 63, she asked me a ton of questions about alchamy, and good places to hunt.  Finally after chatting I actually ran into her sitting near the bank..I asked her if I could inspect her and I was shocked..I asked her if this was her main or alt..She said main, and that she only played maybe once or twice a week tops...WEll, her shield was absolutely crappy..I mean, lowend newb crappy...I was shocked, I ran into the bank, fished out my Tae Ew shield and gave it to her...She absolutely refused to accept it, it took twenty minutes of  smooth talk to finally get her to take it...She was ecstatic..I was really really happy to be able to help her out..I still see her from time to time and she hit lvl 65 not long ago..Weve remained really good online friends....Im not saying that I run around giving everyone the shirt off my back, but sometimes, it just feels damn good to do something nice..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>iasmin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">When Stromm was first up and I was wicked new as opposed to just stupid new like I am now, there was a toon that bought most of my leather padding from me in the bazaar. I had worked terribly hard getting those pelts and spiderling silks as a new character who desperately didn't want to beg from anyone. He seemed the chatty type and asked me how I was enjoying the game and I confessed that playing was all fine and dandy but tradeskills really made it worthwhile for me. He ended up trying to give me (and eventually convincing me to take) a large sum of plat. It's what started my nest egg for my gear. I used it all on tradeskills and made the nest egg bigger. My magelo shows the result of that &quot;seed money,&quot; something for which I will be forever grateful. <br />
<br />
He and others have all made me promise with their gifts that I will repeat the favors and so I do. Each time I celebrate another season in Norrath, I specifically go to Everfrost to visit home and I spend time buffing new characters and handing out picnics or loot I've scavanged.  I ask them to repeat the kindnesses just as I was asked to.<br />
<br />
I have gift givers' names written down next to my computer. And I thank them again each time I see them.</div></div><hr />
