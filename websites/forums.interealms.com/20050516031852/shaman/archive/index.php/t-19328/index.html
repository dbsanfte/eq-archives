<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I came across this post on the monk board: http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessageRange?topicID=43782.topic&amp;start=1&amp;stop=20<br />
<br />
I really do agree with the monks, the idea of an expensive spell manawise with long recast that only lasts 6 minutes is both retarded and ridicilus. <br />
<br />
Just because we have dealt with it since kunark doesn't mean that it can't be changed to something sensible like 20-25 minutes now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I complained about this 2 or 3 times to Lawrence Poe back at the Minneapolis FF.  That's when Primal Avatar was added without the need for emerald.  Clearly they aren't changing the effect considering the number of avatar upgrades we've gotten.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This is a pretty important thread on the Monk board.  It addresses many of our problems as those problems impact other classes.  <br />
<br />
The points seem to be:<br />
1) Shaman and Beastlord ATK buffs are at a disadvantage compared to the Mind Buff lines.  10min extended vs. 3 hours extended.<br />
2) Many melees at upper level are at max stats without buffs so Shaman buffs have lost their value and there are fewer and fewer buffs a high level melee can get that will help their DPS.<br />
3) Extending the Haste line is of less use and less balancing since: a) haste items are easier to get than ATK items, b) an extended haste line would just give the Enchanter class that much more power with long mana spell and long haste spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Avatar is 140atk, and melee classes get I think a 1.35x multiplier on atk (feel free to correct me on this, I'm not sure).  If it is 1.35x, that brings FA to about 190atk.  I remember reading (on the ranger boards I think) that 10atk yields approximately a 1% increase in melee damage.  Thus, FA comes out to about a 19% increase in melee output (I'm pretty sure this guess is significantly more than what it really is).  Keep in mind that all classes do a significant chunk of their damage via spells and procs.  Even monks and rogues do damage via procs, which FA doesn't help (assume 305 dex without FA, which is easy to achieve).  Considering that, FA is a significant damage increaser, but it isn't monumental.<br />
<br />
Now, compare it to haste.  Lets assume a rogue with no haste item and no capped haste does 100 dps.  Add in a 41% haste item and they now do 141 dps.  Give them enchanter haste (not considering the 41 atk from VQ) and they do 205dps.  Haste, in this situation, gives a 45% increase in damage.  Haste is slightly less significant for hybrids because it doesn't increase the rate at which they can nuke/dot, but it does increase proc rate, since they are swinging more.<br />
<br />
What about ranger buffs?  Strength of tunare is 60atk, and Sprit of the Predator is 70k atk.  That's 130 base atk, only slightly less than FA.  It will yield about an 18% increase in melee damage.<br />
<br />
SCRM and EE4 aren't hard to obtain, so we'll assume that everyone has it.  Ferine Avatar lasts 6.5 minutes base, but with SCRM and EE4 is will last 11 minutes.  VQ lasts 42 minutes base, but is easily extended to 70 minutes - that is over an hour for the best melee damage increasing spell in the game.  SOTP is 80 minutes base and SOT is 60 minutes base, but rangers don't get SCRM so the longest they can extend it is 116 and 87 minutes<br />
<br />
Lets recap:<br />
<br />
Enchanters:  45% increase to raw melee AND proc damage for everyone in the group/raid, buff lasts 70 minutes.  The buff is MGB'd before the fight starts and no maintainence is required.<br />
<br />
Rangers:  18% increase to raw melee for everyone in the group/raid, buff lasts 87 minutes.  The buff is MGB'd before the fight starts and no maintainence is required.<br />
<br />
Shamans: 19% increase to raw melee, buff lasts 11 minutes.  Theoretically you could do 11 people per shaman, but realistically its only 3 or 4.  AND it is a huge PITA as well as a noticeable drain on our mana.<br />
<br />
edit: Beastlords get ferocity, a 150atk buff with the same duration as FA, but a 2 minute recast.  They don't get SCRM so It is about a 9 minute duration at most.  This is slightly more atk than FA, but a bigger PITA to sustain.  On top of that, most beastlords fero themselves which sort of wastes it since they get much less return from it than a rogue or monk would.<br />
<br />
This is one of the few things that out-right pisses me off about our class.  When I made and leveled Jinheim, I viewed shaman as a battle-priest.  Our role was to get in the thick of things and support the melees.  We keep them alive and enhance their damage.  Imho we do a decent job of keeping them alive, but we certainly aren't the best at it.  What about enhancing their damage?  We're #3, behind chanters, and rangers*.  It is my firm belief that we should be #1, or at least offer them something that no other class does.<br />
<br />
* - For this rant I pretend that bards don't exist.  For the record, though, they give their group 30% overhaste, 60% normal haste, and can generate god only knows how much atk.  Warsong of Zek gives 18 base atk, but I have no idea how to calculate their real bonus with all their instrument and AA modifiers.  I know it is a lot.  That's just for the melees.  Casters get 21 mana per tick and 15% improved damage (nukes AND dots) if they are in the bard's group.<br />
<br />
I see two fixes to this, one is reasonable and the other is just a pipe dream of mine (bonus points if you can guess which is which!).<br />
<br />
1) Switch haste lines with chanters.  Chanters are getting the best persistant (i.e. not bard song) caster buffs and the best persistant melee buffs.  We get no persistant melee damage buffs (except bih'li!), just FA which is inferior to ranger buffs and a much bigger pain than bard song.  We have nothing to offer casters.<br />
<br />
2) Improve Ferine Avatar.  Two easy ways to do this:<br />
<br />
a)  Make it a group spell with a duration on par with that of VQ.  This will be a significant increase to a raid/group's DPS, but I don't feel it would be overpowering.  Basically, it would be just a little more than ranger buffs, since not everyone gets SOT, but everyone gets FA (and its 10 more atk).<br />
<br />
and/or<br />
<br />
b) Remove strength, dex, and agility from avatar.  Replace with combat effects, accuracy, avoidance, and strikethrough.  I will admit that although I know what these effects are supposed to do, I have no idea how much of an effect they actually have, and I have no idea what sort of numbers would be appropriate.  All I know is that it would give us something to offer that no other class has, which would make me a happy shaman.  It would also make us a lot more desireable in groups because I can promise you most non-time geared melees will get a hard-on the first time they see &quot;You strike through your opponents defenses!&quot; and insist on having a shaman in all groups after that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hail,<br />
Haste is slightly less significant for hybrids because it doesn't increase the rate at which they can nuke/dot, but it does increase proc rate, since they are swinging more. <br />
My understanding is that proc rate is independent of swing rate.<br />
Proc rate the way I understood it is a set # of procs per unit of time, regardless of whether you are swinging while slowed or with 100%+ overhaste.  If you are hasted and swing 50 times in a minute, you may proc an average of 3 times in a minute.  If you are slowed and swing 15 times in a minute, you should still average 3 procs per minute.<br />
<br />
I thought the warriors who were using those Earthshakers to mass slay a Plane were using weapons while slowed to increase the likelihood that they would proc on any particular swing.<br />
<br />
If someone could clear this up a little, I'd appreciate it.  I read the Proc rate thread in the Medicine Cabinet, and parts of it are still rather confusing.<br />
<br />
All that aside, I definitely agree FA should have a longer duration.  Group cast would be awesome, but even if it stayed single target with a standard duration compared to the rest of our stat buffs I'd be happy.<br />
11 min recasts w/ 4 melees plus pets is such a pain in an adventure.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes, that is correct, the number of procs you get per hour doesn't increase or decrease with haste or slow. When warriors use rampage with earthshakers it is counted as a single round which is why they proc more per rampage if they are slowed.<br />
<br />
Also, the damage improvement of atk is rather small now when most melees have 1700+ atk since the gain from attack at higher levels is significantly lower than it is for lower levels of attack. I read some parses from the monk board where 100 raw attack gave a 5dps increase where the subject had 1800 attack iirc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah I agree.<br />
I don't want a group fa if it only lasts 6 mins(11 mins ee). Since so many classes would be annoyed to have to keep clicking it off.<br />
So I would love no recast on ferine Avatar combined with extended duration and also possibly to cast it on the group.<br />
Or like Jinheim says a revamp of FA to include additional abilities. Or maybe a stackable haste component onto it. Say like a +10% haste, which would then upp our talisman of alacrity to the right level. <br />
Only problem is Ferine Avatar is seen as a kind of  luxury buff, it would become a neccessity with certain changes which could be bad.<br />
In agreement with the thread starter, an extended Ferine Avatar would be very nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Also, the damage improvement of atk is rather small now when most melees have 1700+ atk since the gain from attack at higher levels is significantly lower than it is for lower levels of attack.

<br />
From what I have seen (parses etc.) it does not really matter how high your ATK already is but rather where it is compared to whatever you are fighting. If you already hit for max a lot more ATK will not help you. Even if ATK is not capped though the duration of avatar is ridiculous. If they dont want us to avatar an entire raid (thought I don't see the problem) just give us a nonMGBable group avatar that lasts 30 minutes. I do not even mind loosing a slot for avatar but timing FA for 3 melees is a huge pain and the gain is, at best, half of what an enchanter can give the melees for a 10th of the mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">At this stage I think a group form of Avatar would bloody own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My understanding is that the bonus gained from atk scales differently depending on your weapon setup.  I think if you are using 1handers, you start getting decreasing returns around 1800atk.  With a twohander, though, atk keeps giving you significant gains as high as you can raise it (I think 24XXatk is as high as people have gotten).  That's why you see high-end rangers using twohanders instead of dual-wielding.  Many classes also get the Punishing Blade AA, which allows for triple-attack when using twohanders, making it even more appealing.<br />
<br />
If someone has a link to a good discussion on how all this works, it would be greatly appreciated.  I'm a shaman, obviously, so I am just working off of what I have heard other people say and what I've read.  I haven't researched it extensively or done any testing on my own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Nope, the reason high end rangers use 2h instead of 1h is because the fix of 2h damage way back when coupled with the 2h weapons of today mean a nice 2h will outdamage just about any dual wield setup they could do, especially with the pb aa you mentioned. Dual wield really needs a serious tune up atm in comparison to 2h.<br />
<br />
Attack works the same for both though, if you are at  2k attack fighting a mob with 1200ac(yep, you're slumming) you would get the same benefit or lack thereof for additional attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My preference would be: (1) either a group version with like a 3 min recast, or (2) a single cast version with a standard 2.25 sec recast.<br />
<br />
I understand the desire to consume a spell slot in terms of balancing, and the desire to preclude people from selling FA in the PoK, as is the case with KEI, etc.<br />
<br />
However, keeping FA on even 3 entities is just a monumental hassle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">What SOE could do is:<br />
<br />
Remove the str/dex from the Focus line, and add something else to it like more hp, bonuses to skills, or something.<br />
<br />
Make the avatar line, a group spell, and last 60-90 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Give the melees innate FA and erase it from my book, pls.  EQ would be about 200% more fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Id REALLY like too see Group FA . Especialy if its MGB'able ... I Think that would be a really SWEET Idea . I also like the idea of special abilitys and or Skill % bonuses . Stat buffs are pretty much garbage .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">No matter what happens, FA needs it's duration extended significantly.  <br />
<br />
To make it comparable to what casters get with kei, FA needs Time effects, needs a duration similar to kei, needs to be a group buff, and should be mgb'able.<br />
<br />
Balancing practicality with enjoyment, I'd make it a group spell with a 30 minute duration, keep it's present atk amount static, add time effects and resists, drop the str/dex portions, and make it mgb'able.  <br />
<br />
This way, Sony can make sure every melee won't be running around with it like KEI (since I highly doubt that was their intent with kei), melee's will still drool over it, we can use it on raids, and we'll actually enjoy casting it since it will do something useful without being a constant pain in the ass to cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I also question why shaman are not given a haste spell on par or better than enchanters.  I can live with them being the buff king for casters, but we have always had dominance in all things melee.  We should be able to bring a melee up to the haste cap by lvl 65 (assuming they're using a 41% haste item), we should be able to cast that spell as a group buff, and that spell should last for a significant amount of time.  There is absolutely no reason why that should not be done at a bare minimum.<br />
<br />
If we are given this, then I'd like for the devs to consider adding a portion onto FA that raises melees slightly over the haste cap (maybe by 5% or some such) in addition to the other changes that need to be made on FA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">For the love of god, DO NOT extend FA any more than 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
I would love a group FA.  I would really love a FA with no stats but rather bonuses to melee abilities like strikethrough.  I would Die for a shorter cast time on FA.  But what I DO NOT want is FA's time extended beyond 30 minutes (though an extension TO 30 minutes would be great).<br />
<br />
The last thing I need them to do is turn my only useful lvl 65 group buff into something that can be bought off some bot chilling in PoK.  Fo7 is already becomming highly available in pok and we are rarely needed for the extra hps.  Extending FA too long means that we aren't really needed for buffs in groups at all.<br />
<br />
Chanters had it done right...  longest cast time was not on thier best version of the buff.  So having a chanter in group still means more regen then just taking a trip to pok (of course having a chanter in group means a whole heck of alot of other useful things too, but i'm focusing on buffage here).  But we only get our high end buff at our last level...  please don't turn it into a BOT buff and trivialize my usefulness even further.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If there is really a softcap to attack that is easily attainable without Ferine Avatar we can just toss another one of our spell lines onto page 50.  <br />
<br />
This either needs to be fixed or explained.<br />
<br />
As the nerfs keep piling up ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>krindaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yeah I agree.<br />
I don't want a group fa if it only lasts 6 mins(11 mins ee). Since so many classes would be annoyed to have to keep clicking it off.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not me. Group Avatar would make my day. I HATE casting FA. It's EVIL!<br />
<br />
I would do a group avatar even with only 2 melee in group. Who cares if the casters have to click it off. I have to click off the frikking annoying SoP and any other buff that wastes more space than helps me. Every class is used to it. Group Avatar would mean:<br />
<br />
1:  it's on me, so I dont have to bring my timer when it fades.<br />
<br />
2:  I get all the melee at once and don't have to hear any whining about &quot;FA pls&quot;.<br />
<br />
3: Less time wasted.<br />
<br />
4: Less hassle when you've been rather busy and missed an FA or two and forget where you are in your cycle.<br />
<br />
Group Avatar = Happy Shaman<br />
<br />
I would live with my 11min duration FA and never complain about it, if it were group.</div></div><hr />
