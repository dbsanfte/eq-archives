<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mixelplux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This isn't a shaman issue at all, but it's something that my guild has decided to try and make public about a problem and how we, over 70 people, have been treated in regards to this, and that might just kill a guild that has been around since the first month of release.<br />
<br />
I am sure that many who are in Time enabled guilds are aware of the recent rash of bugs that have crept up since the GoD beta went live. Now, if there is a correlation or not, who knows, as the dev team at this point isn't giving any information besides that they are working it.<br />
<br />
Over 3 weeks ago, our guild received a bugged Time instance, meaning that after clearing phase 1 and expecting every subsequent phase to be available, we were greeted with an empty zone and got ported out 5 minutes later.<br />
<br />
We petitioned but received no help at all that night, and decided to petition the next day and let our Instance ID expire as has been suggested on numerous websites now. However, a guide told us on our following rotation day that PoTime was reset and that we should be good to go. This was 3 days after our initial problem.<br />
However, the same problem occured after clearing phase 1, an completely empty PoTime.<br />
<br />
We escalated this problem to an GM-admin and he tried to get some information from the devs, but came back with only that we should wait 5 days to let our instance ID expire.<br />
<br />
Now, here is where it gets interesting. We have 3 guilds on our server on a rotation for PoTime, and as of now only our guild has been affected. We decided to wait a week before trying again. The night before the 7th day, the first guild that made it into PoTime on the server was struck by the same problem. Now, it seems that some of their members know some Devs and were told a patch was coming down that night and they should be able to raid the following day.. the day our ID should have been gone and our planned day. Now, due to an agreement with the other guilds that I wont elaborate on, that Sunday was given to the other guild, their bug was gone, and they cleared the zone and went home happy. So we were left with going on our next rotation day the following wednesday. But guess what, even with every member being out of the zone for a minimum of 9 days now, we were still bugged. A dev checked some members and it showed them with Instance ID's of the other guilds even though they hadn't zoned in at all for over a week.<br />
<br />
So, now we've been trying to get some information why a) the other guild got a fix that worked and we wont, b) why the devs aren't even letting us know what is going on or what to expect and c) wont even give us the common curtesy of getting back to us on this issue without us mass petitioning.<br />
<br />
This is a log, edited to remove anything but the conversation between the gm and our GL.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, this is after the escalation to the GM, which was a few hours of Guide talks, that i will post later/tomorrow: <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 22:59:52 2004] Vaylin tells you, 'Greetings, I am GM Vaylin. I understand you are having trouble with the plane of time and instance issues. Unfortunately we are aware of this issue as you are also not the only guild having this problem. We can not help you with this issue as there is no ability GMs have to fix this. I ask that all those effected leave the zone for 5 days and do not come back as doing so will further this problem for you. I also ask that you /bug this matter with full details.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:00:15 2004] Vaylin tells you, 'There is nothing we can do for you on this. I do apologize to you.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:00:48 2004] You told Vaylin, 'Thank you for responding, but can I ask how 'staying out of the zone for 5 days', when we have done that for 3 weeks going on 4 now, and in fact, stayed out for 9 days last week is going to be different this time ?' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:01:43 2004] Vaylin tells you, 'It may not do anything however if it doesnt work then sadly nothings changed however if it does work then at least you can use the zone.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:01:49 2004] Greang tells you, 'You are the leader of the guild correct?' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:01:50 2004] You told Vaylin, 'Can i also ask why the zone has been reset for other guilds on this and other servers who were not blocked from the zone for 22 days as we have been ?' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:02:17 2004] Vaylin tells you, 'No ones reset that zone. I'm sorry who ever gave you that information is misinformed.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:03:00 2004] You told Vaylin, 'and because I dont want to push that issue.. its not about 'fairness'... its about not cancelling our accounts, can I ask that I have the email or name of someone who is your supervisor so I can explain the dire nature of the situation and possibly give you more power to correct it ?' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:03:30 2004] Vaylin tells you, 'The only resets that have been done on that zone have been due to them taking it down to attempt to fix this issue. We do not offer any customer service except the basic assistance in plane of time as developement has has asked us not to.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:03:32 2004] You told Vaylin, 'please Vaylin... we have been locked out of Time for 22 days.. do you think we don't know when an instance is reset by this point on our server, or that we are unaware of Drinal server time reset last night ?' <br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:03:55 2004] Vaylin tells you, 'I'm sorry but theres nothing we can do to help you with it' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:04:47 2004] You told Vaylin, 'Ok, I can accept that answer.... I am sorry for implying anything shady.. but I would like to have a contact of your superior so that I can enforce how big an issue this is for our guild. We are on the virge of loising 80+ accounts and a guild i have been in since day 1 of EQ' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:05:11 2004] Vaylin tells you, 'You can email eqcs@soe.sony.com however please be aware they will not reset the zone for you.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:05:37 2004] You told Vaylin, 'I dont even want a reset anymore, I want someone to know why a guild and 80+ accounts cancel their subscriptions' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:06:22 2004] Vaylin tells you, 'Then contacting my supervisor or any GM supervisor is not the correct course of action. As this is a developement side bug you need to voice your concerns about this zone not working to development.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:06:23 2004] You told Vaylin, 'i want a guarantee that something is done on Sunday after 4 weeks of being told to 'wait 5 days'.. I dont think that is unreasonable, and I dont think it is impossible or unprecedented that the 'bug fixes' be attempted for the guild who has endured it the longest' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:08:46 2004] You told Vaylin, 'I just don't know what to do anymore... I want answers more then anything, I dont want special treatment, I've never asked for it before. We've been so good with this.. we've stayed out of the zone.. we've allowed the server time rotation to continue even though we have been blocked. It is monumentally important and I guess we need more communication on the issue then 'go ahead and try in 5 days and be disappointed again'.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:09:39 2004] Vaylin tells you, 'I'm sorry you dont like the answer I've given however its the only answer we can give you. As I said you want the correct people to know how you feel about the problem in time let developement know. You can reach them by going to everquestlive.com and posting on the fourms there, doing /feedback in game, or emailing eqfeedback@soe.sony.com. All I can do is tell you I understand your situation your not the only one going through it. We sadly can not help you.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:10:42 2004] You told Vaylin, 'And, sadly, as much as I'd like to really be irate with you, I believe you... However, I am deeply saddened at what is about to happen with my guild, and I just can't express the anger of this guild disbanding and cancelling in words, really.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:11:22 2004] You told Vaylin, 'I fear what will happen, and I fear the crap you may have to put up with with 80+ people at their wit's end, because it is likely to come through the petition queue and be a pain that maybe you don't deserve.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:12:54 2004] Vaylin tells you, 'I totaly understand you and know how annoying this is. I've spoken to many people about this I do know their working on the matter and this week alone have attempted to fix the matter at least three different nights. Let developement know thats the best I can say.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:13:51 2004] You told Vaylin, 'I would love it if a simple status could be relayed to me or one of my officers, either via email or via game as they work.. it would help me to keep my people in order and to help me in keeping them from cancelling.. is that even a possibility ?' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:14:33 2004] You told Vaylin, 'Something I could use to keep them from going crazy, official word, something.. if i say 'wait 5 days and we will retry' one more time, they are going to lynch me' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:14:59 2004] Vaylin tells you, 'I'm sorry that wont be able to happen. I can tell you game masters are very busy as most of us are currently covering two to three servers.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:16:19 2004] You told Vaylin, 'You have to forgive me then if I say that is completely and totally unacceptable that noone can even communicate to a guild who has been bugged and blocked from enjoying a game they pay for for almost an entire billing cycle of 1 month.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:17:25 2004] You told Vaylin, 'I can understand if you tell me you can't reset the zone.. but I absolutely demand communication on what is being done... absolutely demand it.. and whether or not that matters to you, I absolutely know something as simple as a status report is not unreasonable and something that, frankly, I cannot accept.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:17:45 2004] Vaylin tells you, 'I understand your feeling here best I can say is check the offical website.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:18:06 2004] Vaylin tells you, 'there will also more than likely be a patch message as well when they fix the problem.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:20:33 2004] You told Vaylin, 'Nothing I say at this point really matters, but im deeply saddened that you would take the position that you won't communicate a status report to us and lose, conservatively, 30 accounts and possibly up to 80 and a PR storm as well... It seems ludicrous to me.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:24:06 2004] Vaylin tells you, 'I'm sorry that you feel that you are not happy with us contacting you personally on this matter. However we just do not have the man power to contact ever time enabled guild personaly about the status of this bug. As I personally have three servers that I do look over. The only thing we can do and that is up to developement again is post something on our web page and or patch message.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:25:29 2004] You told Vaylin, 'I think you do, at least, owe at least a status to the guild across all servers who has been bugged the longest.. .maybe working with people on Drinal is better for the dev team, and as a programmer, I wont say it isn't.. but you do owe the guild who has the longest time blocked from the zone at least something.. can let us handle the communication from there if ya like.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:28:10 2004] Vaylin tells you, 'Again I am sorry thta you are not happy with the whole situation. However as I said you'll need to contact the developement team on any dissatisfaction with how the fixing of this zone is going. As for communication the best we can do for you is to ask that you check the offical website and patch messages. I am again sorry and I do hope you have a better night.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:29:59 2004] Vaylin is not online at this time. <br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:30:12 2004] Players in EverQuest: <br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:30:12 2004] --------------------------- <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:30:12 2004] There are no players in EverQuest that match those who filters.<br />
<br />
We are at our wits end. We can't raid in PoTime and are forced to compete in elemental planes for mobs that are trivial and uninteresting against several other guilds. Another guild on same server gets problem fixed over night, while we are now after 3 weeks still waiting for an answer, and the best we get is sorry, send a feedback.<br />
<br />
I know to most of you this might be completely uninteresting, but it's the epitomy of how SoE handles serious issues that is seriously affecting gameplay. As an officer in this guild I am trying to talk people out of cancelling their accounts, but even some officers are thinking about just moving on. The treatment that we recieved so far has been abysmal at the best. I even had 1 guide suggest to me that our guild should go play alts.. all I could do is laugh.<br />
<br />
Short of abusive bahviour we have no more recourse left. We've talked to the GM's, even had a dev talk to us and check some members instance ID's to verify the problem. But nothing else. We know they can remove instance ID's from characters to at least remedy the problem temporarily, and while some guilds get this treatment, we with probably the longest running bug don't even get a feedback on what is going on.<br />
<br />
We've emailed dozens of times, we've had officers petition every day about these issues, and 3 weeks later we still get a &quot;sorry, it's being looked at but can't give you any more information&quot;.<br />
<br />
Sorry to make this abnormaly long post, but we thought it be nice to show how a serious problem affecting a good 70+ people is being handled by Sony. I hope that none of you will ever fall subject to such horrid and dissatisfying customer service while playing this game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't have a solution for you, but you do have my sympathies.  This must be absolutely infuriating, and I know that I for one would definately cancel my account if we were on the recieving end of this bug for weeks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dekurgen Heyokah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am an officer in a Time enabled guild. We have faced such problems now in Time on several occaisions but never to the severity of being blocked for a full billing cycle. I'm sorry you've had to put up with this crap, as I can easily see myself in the same boat at any arbitrary moment. The fact of the matter is Time instances have some major problems that have been lying under the surface of the high end gaming community since it's inception and it seems now, while SOE is feverishly busy preparing GoD for release, customer service has taken a back burner in regards to these issues. All that I can say is SOE probably needs to look more seriously into the issues of Time instance bugging before a good number of customers that they are preparing GoD for are gone due to complete frustration involved with the current content.<br />
GL to you and your guild and please keep us informed as this situation developes because even if you are not in Time, at some point you may very well be and the detrimental effects of massing your (already prepared to retire) raid force into an empty zone is sure to be the perverbial straw that breaks the camel's back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">All I can say is have every single person in yer guild petition every day. Maybe that will help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">this is either silent tempest of cats in hats.<br />
<br />
i have friends in both guilds and they are being held up by this, severly, that and the drinal server has crashed at LEAST 5 times i know about. this sever is the second highest population base, and its relatively new compared to other servers, lately drinal has been... how can i put this kindly, LAGTASTIC.<br />
i solo in a zone with NO ONE around for the next 3 zones and i still lag to the point of delayed hits, spell casting, and so on.<br />
The GM's do not care, customer service is only for those who can afford 40$ a month (ie. legends)<br />
this server needs to either split or be upgraded badly.<br />
we do a raid with 72 people, we get average pings of 3k, with choke and packet loss to the point of 2 in 6 grp members link dead a minute.<br />
SoE is bailing on EQ, once EQ hits rock bottom they will into EQ2.<br />
wich is total bs, so after eq, no more sony products, t.v.'s , vcr's nada.<br />
just to show how ignorant and unwilling the GM's and MG-admins are, one time my old guild Blood Honor raided Aow, he dropped 2 monk pants, the ring and BoC and a ST key.<br />
some kid who was tagging along just watching us kill AoW, decided to ninja a set of monk pants and the ring.<br />
we petitioned, took screenies of an inspect with the ring on him, and even a conversation with hi saying &quot;i got it off of AoW, from an open raid&quot;<br />
open raid my as*<br />
anyway, we send all this information in, it takes 1 week for the gm to say .. &quot;i can't do anything , im relaying it to someone who MIGHT be able too&quot;<br />
1-3 more weeks later, the gm admin reviews the evidence and says &quot;are you sure he just didn't get this fro ma pickup raid?&quot;<br />
/boggle<br />
after a few more days we finally get the items back. =/<br />
the offender .. got a slap on the wrist.<br />
a 1 week ban.<br />
btw, he wasn't a noob who didn't know anybetter, lvl 62 SK, who was in a reputable guild.<br />
<br />
a few people on drinal last night said they downloaded GoD files to thier emulators, saying the instanced dungeons were messing with POP time instances, i heard this all befor getting booted from the grp =/<br />
<br />
is it me or do the people at SoE subcontract people to do EQ expansions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">All I can say is have every single person in yer guild petition every day. Maybe that will help.<br />
<br />
<br />
it doesn't help believe me, it makes them put the issue on back burner, these are people too, some just play eq and have no internal understanding of how codes, scripting and trigger scripted events work.<br />
pressuring someone who knows little if not nothing about how this game came out of a bunch of harddrive space is not the way to go.<br />
pushing SoE dev's is definitly the way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There are over 10 servers in DIRE need of a server split. Dozens of bugged zones with hundreds of malfunctioning quests. Sony does nothing about it.<br />
<br />
I cancelled my account last weekend, because I realized it wasn't a problem about class balance, about zone bugs, about Plane of Time. It's that Sony just doesn't care. They don't care. They dont give a flying ****. They get your money, and they know that you don't want to cancel, and you want to keep playing their highly addictive game.<br />
<br />
Take a hold of this rush of anger and adrenaline, and cancel your accounts now. The problem is not one that can be fixed. You will never escape Sony's passive wrath of not-caringness. Cancel now, move on to a new game or better, to your real life.</div></div><hr />

However years of paying money to a company who do not value my custom has taught me the only way to make them realise my anger and frustration is to act with my feet.<br />
<br />
While i won't give up EQ and the good friends i have made playing it till i have a viable alternative to move to, i sure as hell won't be buying EQ2.</div></div><hr />

- No it's Pak'Cafan on Tarew Marr. We (Awakened) and the other time guild (Enlightened Dark) had some minor issues like not being able to zone in for a while into Time B or having to wait an extra day before instance spawns but nothing this major. This is ridiculous and there is probably a CS guy in India answering who has no clue what a MMOG is and the distress it causes for an entire guild when serious bugs like these creep up. SOE CS is non existant.<br />
<br />
Mix, post it on FoH boards and email this post to the Mobhunter editors. Maybe you can get more exposure and maybe SOE will put a few extra monkey coders to try to fix this garbage.</div></div><hr />

um no this poster is from drinal .. but i guess tarew marr can experience the same problems.<br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:25:29 2004] You told Vaylin, 'I think you do, at least, owe at least a status to the guild across all servers who has been bugged the longest.. .maybe working with people on Drinal is better for the dev team, and as a programmer, I wont say it isn't.. but you do owe the guild who has the longest time blocked from the zone at least something.. can let us handle the communication from there if ya like.'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">the start of our last Time rotation we were utterly and completely unable to zone in to P1.  We spent hours camping, reforming, having everyone zone out completely, reform and try again.  I guess I will consider us fortunate for only having lost a few hours that one night.  We did also suffer a reset with only Inny and Quarm left to kill a couple of rotations back, but I believe that was due to one of the global resets/patches as a result of working on Time problems.<br />
<br />
I care not to envision the guild wide wigginess that what you are experiencing would cause.  I sympathize and fear it happening.</div></div><hr />

Have you all been trying to zone in every day to see if you instance was reset?  Because if so, you should wait 5 or 6 days to let your instance completely reset.  Every time you zone in it just refreshes that timer.<br />

As for them not responding, well, I dunno.  That is pretty crappy of them.</div></div><hr />

We've let our instance ID expire, it doesn't work. We've had people who had not zoned into time in over 9 days with an Instance ID from another guild that was in there 2 days ago.<br />
<br />
Btw, we are on Tarew Marr, but we know about the Drinal server. The one conversation with a dev we had he mentioned that Drinal is being used to check the bug fixes or something like that.<br />
<br />
This isn't an isolated problem, but I don't think any other guild in the game has been stopped from progressing PoTime over 3 weeks now and still to get just a **** as /feedback or email response.<br />
<br />
Oh well, time will tell what this will to do us.<br />

<br />
&quot;all of the other servers are in a state of the art coalation center, while drinla is in the basement holding up some leaky pipes with its tower.&quot;<br />
<br />
another funny one is.<br />
<br />
&quot;drinals not a tandy 1800 ! its a 386 bro, state of the art !!!&quot;<br />
<br />
drinals dream<br />
<br />
&quot;dude, were getting a DELL !!!&quot;<br />
<br />
these are all funny things alot of people have said in a raid or shouted in PoK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">We have had a similar issue with getting bugged instances and have been /bug reporting it daily.  Our lockout time is definitely close to a month as well and we have even wandered into other guild's instances and leapfrogged phases.<br />
<br />
It is pretty frikkin sad that the &quot;Crown Jewel&quot; of PoP is little more than a buggy, crowded, and easily disruptable zone that only took countless hours to get into.  SOE could fix this problem in a heartbeat by putting true LDoN-style instancing in the zone and having the corpses GY to TimeA just like LDoN.  My guess to why they have not taken this easy course of action is simply because it would allow all the players to escape the usual competition, cockblocking, and drama that invades nearly every other raid zone in EQ.  I don't believe that the dev team, coders, or whatever are going to backtrack to TimeB after finishing GoD because it is easier to just let the status quo ride and shovel players off to GoD for more distractions....err content.<br />
<br />
Time as it stands is NOT designed for the 4+ guilds that have access to the zone on several servers and rewards those guilds with a timezone advantage much like VT.<br />
<br />
Dunno about the rest of you, but this is really the first time I have seriously entertained leaving EQ because of a complete flaw in design.  Most of the other goofs were tolerable, but after investing so much effort in gaining access to a single zone that is not useable, I'm pretty much done.</div></div><hr />

Why do we put up with this **** from sony?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I think I can shed a little light on this problem (maybe!).  There are, or at least were, 2 major problems on the instancing.<br />
<br />
One--the one that required Jaeydee's guild to have to reform, is that the guild coded as guild 0 on the guild list has been getting bugged.<br />
<br />
The other problem on the instancing is that, as far as I know, there are only 2 GM admins who can fix it.  Once you get a hold of them (and I am sorry, but I can't recall their names at the moment), they had to set a time for all of the guild to log on, and then manually summon them 1 at a time and set them to a particular instance.<br />
<br />
Dunno that my info will help any, but there are a couple of the really senior GM-admins that can fix it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">There are many guilds on different servers who had this problem sadly. I hope it gets fixed for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">that really sucks :(    i hope it dont happen when the other soon to be time enabled guilds on torv   <br />
<br />
<br />
keep feedbacking / buging / emailing daily the whole guild  make a template of stuff then go at it  attack sony get them to fix it thats the only way you will get heard is if you flood the **** outa them to fix it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Whatever you do, do not masspetition. We had a guild doing that back on a AoW thingie on AB and they got alot of warnings for doing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Yeah, I'm on Drinal, and I can verify its held together by some monkey poo and powered by gerbils in wheels. Our server is sucktastic. I feel bad for you, and not just because you are snagging our mobs :P I can say you handled the situation with much more poise and less teeth gnashing than MANY would do in this situation, so you have my utmost respect. Send this to mobhunter, and every news site you can. Nothing like bad press on how broken end game stuff is to demonstrate why something needs to be done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">It just boggles the mind how neglectful SOE is of their own end game.  Using this experience as a guide, GoD's end-zones at release will probably be unfinished and not worth achieving.<br />
<br />
Sounds like Furor actually had a tantrum for the right reasons months ago...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">this looks like lots of fun, currently 3 times guilds on terris, with 1 guild coirnav away, and another just needing rathe<br />
<br />
yay for a zone we aren't going to get to use</div></div><hr />
