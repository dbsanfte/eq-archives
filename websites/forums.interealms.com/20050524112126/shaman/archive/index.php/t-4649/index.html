<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ND and CS have been added to shaman abilities.  There is talk of adding limited Complete Heal to shaman abilities.  Does this change the order in which we should be getting skills or make certain skills less valuable?<br />
<br />
The main skill that seems affected by the Complete Heal addition would be Sell Buff Reinforcement.  I believe most people get this skill for longer torpor.  But it is 20 points to max it out that might be better spent on ND or CS.  Any thoughts about this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If the big heal goes in, this is my AA route:<br />
<br />
MC3, CannV, ND3, SCM3, QB2, CS3, then maybe rabid bear.<br />
<br />
MC3, CannV is obvious<br />
ND3 for the extra HPs for CannV and the big heal.<br />
SCM3 because i expect to be using the big heal a lot and 10% mana savings will make a big difference.<br />
QB2 for the faster torpor.<br />
CS3 for damage reduction.<br />
Rabid bear because i wanna be a bear. A rabid bear. A rabid bear with a big stick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gikk the Unholy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Depends on if the healing abilities will affect our new heal or not.  If they do, those will become a lot more popular.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Given that the healing AAs effect even the real Complete Heal, it is probable that the new heals will be effected as well.</div></div><hr />
