<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Saldaora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We just dinged 65 this weekend and are looking for duo spots to grind out AAs.<br />
<br />
Some info on us:<br />
<br />
Both characters have under 10 AA's, so no Canni 5 (it's the first priority though!).<br />
<br />
We're both bazaar equipped, and normal lvl 65 ldons still yields occasional upgrades.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any suggestions!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Tons of spots.  May I recommend:<br />
<br />
Droga - Learn where the named are and farm them for upgrades, tribute and bazaar loot.  Decent XP and great plat.<br />
<br />
Inner Acrylia - Same as Droga but a bit more out of the way and not many mobs to share.<br />
<br />
Veksar - You'll need Bane for this to be really efficient.  Better drops than Droga, but harder.<br />
<br />
The Deep - Close and easy.  Drops are bad, but XP is about the same as Tier 2 considering the quantity of mobs you can kill.  Mindless but very little chance of death.<br />
<br />
The Hole - Close and easy.  Bit harder to get to the good spots than the deep, but nice change of pace from the regular grind.  Don't expect much from the drops.<br />
<br />
Nadox - Do undead or Luggalds.  Nice XP and plat.<br />
<br />
Dulak's - Do deep in the caves.  Not many people go here so the drops still go for a decent amount.<br />
<br />
Torigan - Some nice stuff for duo can drop up near the Nadox ZI.  Research zone first to see if you need anything.  Skip to Nadox otherwise.<br />
<br />
Hate's Fury - Can probably do the entry mobs.  Tough place for CR though.<br />
<br />
PoHate - ZI mobs are easy and once you get comfortable you can move in and go for the Marsinger quest item droppers.  Will need a way for monk to gate out.<br />
<br />
POI - Can still get good xp here.  Fight your way around a bit or move into factory.  Loot = none (basically)<br />
<br />
PoJ - Basement apparently has great xp.  Loot = gems<br />
<br />
PoN - Hedge or gargs.  Loot = none<br />
<br />
PoS - Fish maybe.  Loot = none<br />
<br />
PoV - Trash mobs around GY or DoT-Rot golems in NE corner.  Loot = none<br />
<br />
LDoN - Use your duo as the base and get others to fill-in.  Best way to get good equipment that is a notch above bazaar items.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd say do Droga and IA until you get enough plat for the bazaar stuff you need.  Ornate legs for sure, and boots are nice.  Then LDoN once you have maxed what you can do with the bazaar items you can buy.  Other spots are nice to break the monotomy.  Once you get to around 50aa each you can start doing HoH.  At 100aa each BoT should be in your range.<br />
<br />
Peace,<br />
