<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mixinitup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey, I did look at other threads before I posted this, so please don't flame me =)  <br />
<br />
I'm looking for a place to box my 65 shm and 55 sk.  My main goal is XP for the SK, as I want to get him to 60 ASAP.  <br />
<br />
SHM has all lvl 65 spells except no LDON spells.  He's wearing some ornate and can buff himself to about 3k hps.  SK has ornate boots, and a War Marshall's Bladed Staff.  Buffed he hits 5k with virtue.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have seen Droga and Veksar sound like good options, I have spent some time in Veksar, but found that breaking the shopkeeper's room was difficult.  SK was only 49 then though hehe.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if there are any other places I can look, or if Droga/Veksar is my best option...    I was wondering about the frogs in PoS...  SK could snare, shm slow and dot them all to hell.  Would this be good xp for the SK?<br />
<br />
I appreciate any hints you can offer for my situation, thank you<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Prophet_Soulez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would do some tier 1 you could malo and snare + fear to take almost no damage... I think that would be the best get KEI first and then you could dog dog, skelie pet, SK pet(heh) and just DoT the living Shizz outta it... that would be my suggestion, try PoN but find a corner or something</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I leveled my SK to 60 in Nadox.  Start at the entrance from the temple in Gunthak (invis all the way in).  Start off in the Citadel.  Named will pop there and drops a decent ring and arms.<br />
<br />
Next, invis up and go to the Furious/Acolyte area.  2+ named there.  The Broken Skull Prophet drops decent chain sleeves, and a caster mask.  The Veteran also will spawn in the place of one of the furious.  He drops a so so dagger, and some decent plate legs.<br />
<br />
I like to set up camp in the hallway just past where the Furious path down to the hallway leading to the Citadel.  Safe area, and one roamer to worry about every hour or so.  Aggro is small in this zone.<br />
<br />
Now, you're getting comfortable with the zone.  Invis up and go down the tunnel to the undead area (where the SK can work his Envoke skills).  There's a little ledge before you get to the main undead room.  This is your camp spot.  There are two/three undead there, and the Captain can spawn in the spot of the second one.  He drops a nice plate cloak and decent caster shoulder item.  <br />
<br />
You then can take the other 4-6 in the room past the 2 entrance ones.  You have one roamer to deal with.  Sometimes he comes from below, sometimes from above.  Just med with one facing up and one below.  Keep an eye on your pets, because they'll see him coming.<br />
<br />
Captain can also spawn in place of one of the undead next to the pillar just inside the room.  You will also occasionally get the First Mate to spawn from one of the undead kills.  He drops decent monk/bl/druid legs, and a rare Bard sword that sells very well 10k+.  Stay on the ledge.  You will get an occasional train (sometimes unannounced) from either the Luggald area, or someone going to or coming back from Hates Fury.  It sucks, but SK can FD and if you can get running, you might make it back to the zone out.<br />
<br />
The thing about Nadox is you can get a number of named that spawn from a corpse.  The first time it happens, it will scare the **** outta you, because you're not ready for it.  Your SK if he is cultural and has a WMBS can handle these mobs easily, even though they are even, to red to him.  They all slow easily. <br />
<br />
You will get a pretty good supply of gems (rubies and sapphires) for your trouble.  A ****load of zombie skins for pottery.  The undead also drop a Coral Ring, which is decent AC/Wis/HP/Mana, and sells quick at 1-1500pp.<br />
<br />
The reason I liked this area was it's undead, which allow you to raise evocation on the SK, which is harder than hell to raise, since you only can do it on undead.<br />
<br />
Not the loot droga provides, but the undead are dk blue to you and one level below your sk.  Gems, and the drops make it reasonably profitable.  XP modifier is okay for the zone.  It's also a reasonably quiet zone, with not a lot of people.<br />
<br />
Don't go into the undead room and try to clear it.  You'll get adds.<br />
<br />
You could also try a dash to Hates Fury, and do the entrance mobs there.  You should do the pulling.  You will get an occasional double pull.  BD drops are fairly common.<br />
<br />
It's just another alternative.<br />
<br />
Your duo could handle droga pretty well on most of the spots, as well.  I just like Nadox, because it was a change of pace, not crowded (which I like) and reasonable loot/xp.  It doesn't get mentioned much, but it's not a bad place.  It's tough to find higher level undead, and this is one of the places that have them.  <br />
<br />
Luggald area is tougher, but better xp.  They have a ton of hp's and hit hardest in the zone.<br />
<br />
Nadox is another two box spot that works well, in my opinion.  You won't get rich there, but you can usually play worry free.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My main is a shaman with 200 odd aa's.<br />
<br />
I played a monk to 64 + 15aa, then cracked it and started a ogre SK and have him at 65 + 65 aa's now.<br />
<br />
It has taken me three months to get him to that level.<br />
<br />
All i can say is a sk &gt; monk duo partner for a dual bot by a long long long way.<br />
<br />
At 55 I tried several zones, mainly cause i was getting boored.<br />
However POI was by far and away the best spot pre BOT.<br />
<br />
I did 47 - 60 in poi, and at 5% per kill at 47 down to 3 kills fer 1% at 60 its still the best xp bar none you can find.<br />
<br />
The problem is that tanks are gear constrained. I have notices a huge difference in tanking between 1200 and 1450 ac buffed.<br />
<br />
1200 ac is a set of cultural.<br />
<br />
1450 ac is a set of ornate augmented with TAK bp and legs.<br />
<br />
At 1200 ac I had to canni between every 5 fights in bot on beeeeez.<br />
At 1450 ac, I have enough mana to keep 3 dots going on the giants.<br />
<br />
My xp rate has gone from an aa per night to an aa every 1 hour duo.<br />
<br />
However I would offer you this in terms of advice.<br />
<br />
Get him to 57 the go do ldons.<br />
<br />
Shams are in HIGH demand fer ldons. I considder it a bad night if i have to actually put lfg up.<br />
<br />
Tell peeps you are lookin fer a group with yer sk and the shaman can come if needed.<br />
<br />
Sheesh with easy ldons now, i pull, tank, slow and heal and the rest of the group is just there for dps.<br />
<br />
I have done easy ldons in full pet groups in under 40 minutes with me pulling tanking and slowing.<br />
<br />
So get him to 57 and start building them points for the tak armor, its the best **** you will see outside the EP's for your SK, and all it takes is time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Skenten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Spent a lot of time in Veksar with my 65 shaman and 62 warrior, it is a good place to duo.  The shopkeeper spawn is quite easy to break actually.  Kill M1 and M2 in shops area, both single pulls.  Rebuff / pet up etc, med to ful in room M2 was in.  Have shaman target M3 the far western mob in the Shop camp(the closest).  Have SK target M4 (the middle mob).  Creep up shaman up to point X, so he is in LoS of his mob and cast root.  Back up to the NW corner of middle room, where the SK should be waiting.  Root almost certain to stick, and only the M4 should come.  Have SK get aggro, slow mob, sick pet.  Once that mob is locked down by SK, go back to rooted mob and debuff.  Keep root parked until first mob dead, then move into room and kill.  Then you can pull the PH for rotting shopkeeper, and room is nicely broken.  Set up shop at bottom of stairs and pull shopkeeper and blacksmith rooms.<br />

Root pulling works on blacksmith camp as well as many other camps.  The aggro radius in Veksar is almost Droga small, so singles and worst case doubles are easy to get.  GL on drops if ya decide to try it out.  The xp at shops isn't the best, not even the best in Veksar, but if you need cash, 30K a belt is nice (Druzzil Ro).  Try out the other camps in Veksar, the chef and crusader are also easy, and have some sweet drops for melee and shaman alike.  Besides, it's nice to keep that annoying necro from having every camp in Veksar at once =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tehp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This post caught my attention because I am using a 65 SK and 55 Shaman.  In attempts to level my shaman I have taken him into Howling Stones.  Walked around from wing to wing with him collecting the Hand of Glory components.  SK has some EP gear and Shaman has some ornate.  Everything went well and got some nice EXP for the Shaman and the SK.  Howling Stones has always been good EXP from what I remember.  There's also a guildless 57 WAR and 65 SHM combo that plays in the zone in area to get his WAR levelled up.  He seems to like it a lot.  Also pretty peaceful zone since no one goes there for anything really anymore except to kill Drusella when she's up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tier 1 PoP is probably the best xp you will get, and you can let either toon tank the mobs once slowed.  The castle area with the bugs in PoD is pretty good and easy to tank.  PoP zones have better XP modifiers than any old world zones for levels 50+, 59% I believe - compared to 27% for the higher mod Kunark - Luclin zones.  The 50's are just slow no matter what you do.  There are some zones with super high xp mods like High Keep, but none for levelling past the early 50s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">yup west wing in charasis is greatexp for 55 to 59.<br />
South wing is more hassle, but probly ok for a skilled player, whos been there before.<br />
<br />
imo its better exp than pop as mobs have far less hps....kill rate is much higher.</div></div><hr />
