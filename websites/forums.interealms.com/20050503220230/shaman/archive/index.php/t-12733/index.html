<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a 53rd iksar shaman on the cazic thule server. I have no epic but have a lizzy mount. Was wondering where i could makes some decent money at? I've tried IGs in everfrost and i've also tried Misty guards, but its really not that great. I don't really mind if its pure money that drops but i prefer good loot items that sell nicely. If you just wanna tell me and not everyone that looks at this (doubt this ) email me at streett123@msn.com<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bohemith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Aye, I'm in the same boat you are. I just dinged to level 51 and I have 1kpp to my name. Its quite disheartening when in one level I have to shell out 2-3k on my server just for Regrowth, and I haven't even raised that money yet!<br />
<br />
I also need to try and save up for a horse... Oh boy Oh boy! I do however have a JB Bracer.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any suggestions for some $$?</div></div><hr />

kill guards in HHK, 1-4 pp per kill, and fine steel each kill, and it's probably way good exp for your level too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Urnti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">kill guards in HHK <br />
<br />
Sorry to mention this, but HHK guards would be green at 53, Nobles/bards probably still light blue/blue, but guards are way green at that lvl....still not a bad source of cash though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">this may not sound good bit it works for me <br />
<br />
his the iksar fortress in LILO go all the way in into the chancellors room<br />
<br />
Kill kill kill<br />
<br />
you will get jade chodaki prod that is used for HS key (sells ~ 1k)<br />
and every couple hours you will ger bracer of the hidden this will sell <br />
for 3.5K <br />
<br />
plus piles of gold and silver and the ocassional plat<br />
<br />
also if you are planning on doing the cudgel quests this is a good way to get that initial bump in faction to to bone chip quests<br />
<br />
this can easily be done at 51 - 53 (that is when I did it)<br />
<br />
note you will need to be able to set up a bazzar mule in order to sell these items they dont sell immediately usually</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>yadaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">its a time consuming thing but get ur factino up to amiable in paineel by killing kobolds in warrens.... then go to the gate guard hail him and get a key... once entered town, start killing the guards...abuot 3/4 pp per kill and drops shield and a wep for about 8pp i think.... dont go too close on necro guild.... w/ amiable no on will aggro you and kill on guards..o btw no faction hits</div></div><hr />
