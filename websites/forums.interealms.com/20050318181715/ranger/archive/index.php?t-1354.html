It's worth checking out if you have some time to waste.<br />

If you can't watch 'em, don't blame me. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, wait, it's the bank's darn firewall, my bad. ;)</div></div><hr />

I'll be busy tonight going through em all.  Some cool looking stuff there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drexel</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most of the top rated movies have some sweet light saber duels.  &quot;A Question of Faith&quot; has the best duels IMO (I watched the end credits and the Jedi are some guys from Medieval Times.)<br />
<br />
&quot;You've Got Mail&quot; and &quot;American Jedi&quot; are pretty funny.<br />
<br />
I could go on and on about which ones I liked and why.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Worth the trip.<br />
<br />
Especially look for the 'calling card' movie called &quot;Troops&quot;.  It is a Cops parody, following the men of the Imperial Police.  You will laugh your ass off.  All the more amazing when you realize that it was done on less than $2000.  The guy made it to try to break into film, kind of like Trey Parker and Matt Stone and the Christmas South Park.<br />
<br />
Trust me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GeraltRiv</div><div class="date">04-17-2002, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, The Force.net is an awesome site.  Here is a link to their fan film page: http://www.theforce.net/theater/<br />
<br />
If you only watch one movie there, let it be The Dark Redemption.  Amazing CGI, good story that fits in with the movies and the woman playing Mara Jade is smoking hot.<br />
<br />
Other recommendations are : <br />
Sacrifices - for a moving look at the aftermath of the Battle of Hoth<br />
Troops - Great stuff as mentioned above<br />
Rogue - I haven't seen it yet, but it's getting some great reviews.  I plan on downloading it asap.</div></div><hr />
