Congradulate him/her.  I quit.  Not gonna try for EC anymore unless they change the way the drop is handled.  Earthcaller is just not worth the work I put into it, expecially when a more powerful epic is obtained in 15 hours.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Domandred, do you know how long the first took him? A long LONG time&quot;<br />
<br />
Yea unfortunatly I do.  I've helped with a few Cleric epics before the changes.  They sucked bad.  My point was the fact that one of most (if not THE most) powerful Epic in the game is now officially doable in 15 hours.  Sure swiftwind is IF you get lucky on the drops (random for Reaver) and your mobs (VSR) are up.  Earthcaller is as well IF you get lucky on the drops.   But its still random.  That means that someone who is unlucky like me <br />
(Trust me on this one, there is a reason I don't gamble) will NOT see his epic in due time.  Someone else stated in another thread that unless you put in the time and effort you don't deserve it.  Well I guess that means that I don't deserve it then.  I have put in plenty of time and effort to get mine as well as other peoples, but still I only hold 1/2 of the whole epic. <br />
<br />
&quot;Since when did it become required to get your epic to enjoy the game?&quot;<br />
<br />
I enjoy this game greatly when I am NOT trying to get my epics and doing something else.  The 15 hour cleric epic is just the straw that is breaking my camels back.  That's why I'm giving up on my epic, so I can go out and do other things in the game.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope more people adopt this attitude so that it's easier for me to go and get an SEoC when my time comes. &quot;<br />
<br />
Hopefully your time will be short.  Personally I've lost patience, I wish you luck keeping yours.</div></div><hr />

So you gotta go to hate every xx days, so?  Did you expect the &lt;i&gt;epic&lt;/i&gt; quest to be easy?  I sure hope not.  Hundreds of rangers have Earthcaller, if they can/have done it, why can't you?<br />

Go play.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Domandred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">That's a LITTLE more constructive then &quot;whine much&quot; Lenas.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you expect the epic quest to be easy? &quot;<br />
<br />
I have never once said I want the Epic to be easy.  In fact make it harder for all I care.  My issue is the RANDOMNESS, not the DIFFICULTY.  Make Inny harder, but make it so he drops the stone every time.  That way at least if we try and fail we know it's us.  Now if we try and succeed we may still not get the stone.  Hell kick up the difficulty of the whole plane for all I care, just take out the random factor.  That's my issue is the randomness.  It needs to be changed.  Agree with me or not, but at least post something more constructive then...&quot;whine much&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lenas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's an issue that has been brought up plenty of times before.  What makes you think that starting yet another thread about it is even remotely constructive?<br />
<br />
It's called &quot;beating a dead horse.&quot; And it's getting old.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Elwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's attitudes like yours Lenas that are diminishing the quality of the Glade. You are more than welcome to disagree but saying things like &quot;Whine much?&quot; just sours the whole atmosphere here. Try to be a bit more tactful and constructive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tinlayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I believe that every ranger without EC shares in your frustration.  I know that I do.  I've been on countless Hate trips looking for that gem.  AND IT SUCKS. Yes you heard it.  IT SUCKS.<br />
<br />
There had to get that out of my system.  Seriously though, I do wish that SoE would re-tune the last part of our epic.  I think about a hate raid now and I want to puke.  Especially after porting up and checking track to find no minies up or Inny.<br />
<br />
Granted, it was changed once when the gem was distributed among the mini bosses instead of just Inny.  But I have yet to see the point in this bottleneck.  All the work has already been done.  I spent 10 months working to get swifty.  Then I read about &quot;how easy&quot; it is to get and think that I must be playing a different version of EQ.<br />
<br />
For those of us in small guilds/no guild,  the ranger epic is very challenging.  Not easy.  The bottleneck still exists.  I would like to see the number of rangers without EC compared to the number of clerics that were waiting on Ragefire before the change.  Just a guess but I think there would be more rangers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Loga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Stop attacking players.  The guys has a right to try to make his point in a discusion forum.<br />
<br />
Frankly 15 hours to complete an epic is sort of, well, out there.   Sort of trivializes the IDEA of EPIC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I believe that was his point Loga. Cleric Epic is a click rez, right? At least that's what I hear. I mean, my god, how much more do you want from the thing? I wish I had an unlimited click rez. That's insane. Then, to make it doable in 15 hours? Because now Ragefire can be triggered easy? That's rediculous. The Warrior Epic isn't anywhere NEAR that good, and is still hard. <br />
<br />
So, yeah, ok, Ragefire is a hard mob, yadda yadda, well, so is Inny, and so is the entire PoH. I mean, Christ, you almost need a Raid to go there. <br />
<br />
The point is, they should have lowered the time on Ragefire, but not made it so easy that the Cleric Epic is doable in 15 hours. I don't know about you all, but now it makes me see why we hate Clerics with the hammers. Would you give a crap about your epic if it was doable in 15 hours? No. If you did it then you'd be like, &quot;Wow, that wasn't so hard.&quot; <br />
<br />
I'd prefer to make the epic a bit harder to make someone appreciate it more in the long run. Everyone here talks about how people don't appreciate gear anymore, but then they make the Cleric Epic a piece of gear no Cleric is really going to have to wait long enough to appreciate it as much as the older ones. So, why don't we just buy Swiftwind and Earthcaller from a Vendor now. Might as well, if all the Epics are going to be that easy. It would mean as much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Hopwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">He got extremely lucky, I know clerics who have spent 26 hours camping Lord Bergurgle *ALONE* Not to mention Gimblox, or getting a raid into the Overking/Queen area of Charred Duck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But, IMHO, threads like &quot;It's not fair some other class gets something so great that is so easy to get&quot; also degrade the Glade.  Life is not Fair.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I don't care if click-sticks are in inventory when a new cleric is created.  How does this affect me as a Ranger?  It Doesn't.  How does it affect the challenges I face as a Ranger?  It Doesn't.<br />

I think that's more the point. How &quot;EPIC&quot; is something that only takes 15 hours. Heck, 15 hours is probably less than most people spend playing in a whole weekend. It takes longer than that to make Chili from scratch.<br />
<br />
Why did the guy need two of them in the first place? I didn't catch that. Was he doing it for a second Cleric alt, or what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dinfalas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Things are getting easier. Folks are getting more experienced and efficient. Though  I cannot prove it through my own experiences, my character creation was Dec 1999 and I still haven't obtained Swiftwind or 60.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Eolair Strongbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">He did it the 2nd time because he lost his first one when he paid to move to a new server.  When you move servers, you lose all your gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I have to say this now, more than ever. Cleric up there did his epic in 15 hours, and I just spent the same amount of time on the Ivy Etched Leggings because of the rarity of the Brownie Outcasts, the rate of drops on the arrows, and the spawn time of Wiltin as well as his rarity.<br />
<br />
Let's compare this. Ivy Etched Leggings, versus Cleric Epic. Both take 15 hours. You decide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Finishing the cleric epic in 15 hours is damn lucky. Period. <br />
<br />
I did it on my cleric and it took me several months to finish.  Part of the cleric epic is getting lucky on spawns. Both Bergurgle and Gimblox can take insane amounts of time to spawn, or they can spawn immediately. It just happens. I waited 3 spawn cycles for Bergurgle, I waited two weeks for Gimblox. It's luck. <br />
<br />
Hell, I remember when I screwed up my EK epic battle (yup, I got the druids killed...bad ranger) and had to re-do the first part of the epic....it sucked waiting for Faelin for six hours, and she had been up waiting for me the first time. It was luck, nothing more.<br />
<br />
Let's please not whine about whose epic is easier/harder/unfair etc. I agree the SEoC is pain in the ass, and so do almost all Rangers out there. We've been through this time and time again.<br />
<br />
Put it back on Inny and make it a guaranteed drop...and make a mini quest to trigger Inny ala Ragefire :) Having to clear to him would still be a timesink but at least it'd be a more fair chance....and this is coming from someone who has EC already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sullah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">My cleric epic took : <br />
<br />
1 hour Lord Begurgle<br />
6 hours Lord Gimblox<br />
30 minutes Prismatic Priest<br />
4 hours Chardok<br />
1 hour Ixiblat<br />
7 hours Human Ragefire <br />
3 hours shards in Skyfire<br />
30 minutes Ragefire<br />
1 hour of turn ins <br />
<br />
24 hours and I was extremely lucky but it took me 4 months to get people together to do the raids.   Before the change to Ragefire I didn't even consider starting my epic due to the outrageous Ragefire problems.  The cleric epic was completely screwed up before the change and it is now finally obtainable by people who have lives outside of EQ.  Remember the people camping Ragefire for 140 hours at a time and then getting KSed by a mobile and active guild?  Those days are over thankfully.<br />
<br />
Edit : You do realize that the new bottleneck is the Human Ragefire in SolB?  It's a 24 hour spawn and I have known people to stay there for 20+ hours waiting for him to appear.  I was lucky and knew the exact spawn time from a friend who turned in his stuff the day before.<br />
<br />
Shards can also take an enormous amount of time to acquire, especially when other clerics are looking for them as well.  I was lucky and got 2 guild groups to pull 5 things at a time and the shards came in relatively fast.  I have seen people camp shards in a single group for 8 hours and not get a single one.   The shards usually take about 10-20 hours to get all four of them.</div></div><hr />

Giving up is an option if yer stressing that badly....and I can understand it if thats what it takes for ya to have some fun again..but come on...you know ya want yer bug zappers.....I know I do..thats why I always come back to it.
