<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think I remember reading somewhere that with Spell Casting Fury, it not only increases the frequency of crits, but also increases the damage. Like with rank 1 your max crit might be 2k on a spell, but with rank 2 it might be 2.1k max?<br />
<br />
I was wondering if higher ranks of Critical Affliction also increases the damage.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking that neither add more damage with higher ranks, just higher likely hood of crits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm, dots remain constant 'double' damage, just crit rate that increases with more aa.<br />
<br />
Nukes, well when you first train fury (archetypes), I think it increases damage rank 1=33%/2=66%/3=100% . so with rank3 in first batch of nuke aa you start to get double damage. <br />
<br />
The further ranks of nuke aa just improve your chance to crit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How do the first ranks (archetype) of fury increase damage chance? Since we don't get crits without it, I mean...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Itzkul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The new OoW nuke crits take you higher than double on damage but I am not sure on the percentage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Spell Casting Fury (Archetype AA) does two things with each rank.  1) increases chance to crit on dd spells 2) increases the damage done when you crit dd spells.<br />
<br />
Spell Casting Fury Mastery (shamans don't get this one), Fury of Magic (PoP Ability), and Fury of Magic Mastery (GoD) all only increase the chance to crit.<br />
<br />
From what I remember, you have a total of 22% chance to crit a dd after all those are complete.  Mage Compendium had that number for me, when I looked months ago.<br />
<br />
Destructive Fury (OoW) only increases the damage done when you crit, does not increase chance to crit.<br />
<br />
Critical Affliction (GoD) and Advanced Critical Affliction (OoW) both only increase the chance of crit on dot spells.  The damage done by a crit is not variable.</div></div><hr />
