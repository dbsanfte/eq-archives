Sony Online Entertainment Inc. (SOE), a worldwide leader in massively multiplayer online gaming, announced today that it is adding incentives to EverQuest® II, the parallel online universe to the hugely successful gaming phenomenon EverQuest®, to reward current EverQuest players for the time they have invested enjoying the original title. The incentives will include exclusive crossover quest zones in each game that will be accessible only by subscribers of both games, allowing characters in EverQuest and EverQuest II to gain access to hidden treasures, an EverQuest II in-game reward for loyal fans, and additional features to be disclosed over the coming months for ongoing EverQuest and EverQuest II players. EverQuest II is expected to ship to U.S. and Canadian retail stores this winter. <br />
<br />
&quot;EverQuest II is a new and very dynamic online gaming experience that will change the landscape for massively multiplayer online games for years to come,&quot; said Michael Lustenberger, director of product marketing, Sony Online Entertainment. &quot;We realize all of the time and effort our loyal fan base has invested in building their characters within the EverQuest universe and we want to reward them for their efforts as they try the next generation of EverQuest.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Sometimes I feel as if I'm the only one looking forward to EQ2, lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zozexy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually, this has me actually considering playing EQ2.  I've spent 3 years screwing around with this game, if there wasn't going to be Char transfers, there was no way I was going to start from scratch.  <br />
<br />
Now there's hope...and it better be something worthwhile.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This is exactly what I expected.  VI has always said they won't kill EQ until no one plays it anymore, but that doesn't mean they don't want to get rid of EQ and replace it with EQ2.  Ideally programs like this (if they work, and this IS a Verant product) will allow people to effectively &quot;trade-in&quot; their old characters on EQ towards benefits in EQ2.  We'll have to wait until Verant releases more info on exactly how these programs will work, but if the benefit is good enough, and EQ2 really is better than EQ, then I for one will switch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If EQ2 is anything like SWG then everyone who buys this game will have to own a MAINFRAME computer with 8 processors and 1 terabyte of RAM.  Everyone will have to upgrade.  It's silly.<br />
<br />
Not to be negative or anything...it's not like this is Morrowind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ugh. So that means you have to play both EQ1 and EQ2 to get the reward? *** happens to someone who switches from EQ1 to EQ2? No reward? That sucks, but then again I sort of expected something like this.  :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Here's a nasty thought.  Just to get everyone thinking.  EQ2 is set in a different TIME.  PoP ultimate zone is the Plane of TIME.  Wouldn't it suck if thats the connection.  Beat Plane of TIME and you cand transfer to EQ2.  All of this is pure speculation of and idle mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Who really cares?<br />
<br />
Ask yourselves: do u REALLY want to play another game run by this s.h.i.t.t.y company?<br />
Yes in the end all companies want money. But some care about the players cause they want to keep them.<br />
Sony has proven time and time again that it simply does nto care.<br />
FOR HOW LONG have ppl complained on every class board about how their class could be improved on?<br />
Yes soem requests were obviously ridiculous but there were those requests that were right on. And there were ppl that offered to help code those requests.<br />
I don't care how good eq 2 will be. I won't play it. You may. It's your right. U got hooked on eq 1 and it may be too late for this but don't get hooked on eq 2 also just to get the shaft again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Don't get excited, all you get is one 'Heirloom' from your EQ char of choice and some manner of demonstrating that &quot;Barbacus&quot; (for example) is the ancestor of &quot;Noob_EQII_char&quot;<br />
<br />
Other than that yiou are starting from scratch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Give them a buttercup and they want a rose, give them a rose and they complain about the thornes.<br />
<br />
This company is not that &quot;****ty&quot;. You cant deny that they are making huge strides to balance and correct the game lately, the whole team is new from the team that ran this game into the ground. Give them a break and look around and enjoy what you got.<br />
<br />
Sorry, you can flame me till the cows come home for it too, but im so sick of hearing how horrible SoE is from people that log on and play hours and hours a night. <br />
<br />
This game is not THAT BAD, it provides so much fun for us all and if we can just let go of the tiny lil things that we find wrong and just enjoy it for the fun, this game is pretty damn good.<br />
<br />
Frankly there is only one thing that annoys me about this game and thats when i want a group i cant get one fast enough. If i have any larger complaints that drive me to the point of not wanting to deal with SoE no more cause ive had it, then i log off and go outside. You know, that thing thats like EQ but real. Has fresh air and birds and breezes and sunsets,pretty girls, jeeps ( for me ) to drive, beachs, bookstores/books, disneyland, frisbee, baseball , basketball, swimming  pools, hot tubs, picnics, mountains to hike, boats to ride and more. There is life beyond the computer....  I swears.  Litgruv is not trixy hobbitses, Litgruv is friend.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The strategic move here is obvious:  to get you to pay for two subscriptions at the same time.  If they were smart, the EQ2 zone would have quests that work through your middle and even high levels available, extending the time that people would need to keep their EQ1 account active.<br />
<br />
Porting chars from EQ1 to EQ2 wouldn't work.  In EQ2 you start with a class (exact oposite meaning as in EQ2), later you narrow your scope with an archetype and finally you choose your profession (these terms are descriptive and not necissarily exact).  In EQ1, you choose your profession from day 1 and progress in it, which is a much different focus.  Plus, who reslly wants to land in EQ2 (which will be a VERY different game) as a level 50 n00b?  You'd miss a lot of content and make some very embarrasing mistakes (&quot;FD?  what's a FD?&quot;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">LOL Crusty!<br />
<br />
I have to agree with Litgruv though. It is a game, if it really bothers you that bad you would be going to play solitare or some other non -online game (and probably complaining about the NPC noobs :)<br />
<br />
Do they have it right? NO!<br />
Will they ever get it right? NO!<br />
<br />
Who cares, play the game and enjoy what it does have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dimdim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hmm, I was looking forward to running around with no kit, killing bats, rats and eventually orcs for some cloth armour. I want to treat it as a new game, if they want to add some incentives for old eq players to move, I guess that's ok, just doesn't bother me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the reason why a lot of ppl play this game still is cause they got hooked on it or because of their friends online.<br />
That is what keeps making ppl come back. For soem it's the memories of what the game used to be.<br />
For me it is the friends and the fact that well RIGHT NOW eq is the best mmorpg and nothign else (in my opinion) comes close.<br />
It's like gettting hooked on heroin u hate that u are hooked yet it feels good but u are always trying to find a way out. Sooner or later u will :)<br />
How hard are the devs tryign anyway?<br />
I absolutely HATE seeing &quot;Fixed a couple of spelling errors here and there&quot;<br />
Or &quot;fixed some crappy akanon forge or door that nobody cares about since nobody uses cities nowadays since pop&quot;<br />
<br />
They are not tryign hard enough because they expect us to switch to eq2 so there has to be somethign very wrong with this game for u to leave they will leave major bugs in the game that have been annoying ppl so that one day u say forget this maybe eq2 is better and u pay for that too etc etc<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">tis isnt quite heroin, but i know what you mean. All im saying is what i know to be true for me, there was a time where i obsessed over slows being mitigated, over DoTs not working fast enough or or costing too much mana, over affliction focus items being fied, crappy heals compared to druids and such, i obsessed and complained about it all till i hated this game, till SoE was &quot;the devil&quot; then i quit, i simply let go of the lil things and accepted that if i wanna play EQ i cant explect it to be perfect cause its just humans making this game. They arent perfect and neither am I and to hold them to such a high order of perfection and to expect them to know what we all want would require me to hold the same expectations of myself, judge not lest ye be judged, or something i guess.<br />
<br />
Just saying , step back and minute and look at how this was all done only 1 year ago, how little care and understanding and listening there was. Now many encounters are looked at , class balancing is being &quot;attempted&quot;, we have many things we didnt before, its not that horrible. Just let go and when you get annoyed say fu*k it, just have fun. The game is so much more enjoyable from this perspective.<br />
<br />
Plus breaks help i want to add. When you get into the &quot; i hate SoE and EQ&quot; thing , turn it off and walk away for a week or 2, its amazing the difference it can make in the long run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Gee, you're totally right, Soulstorm.  They shouldn't fix ANY spelling errors in the game.  Put all those copy editors to work writing code.  Of course, you'll have to send them to school first since they probably aren't coders.  And if you get too many coders on the project they start stepping on each other's toes and creating more bugs.... hmm, maybe it's better to have them doing spell checking after all.<br />
<br />
It takes a lot of work by many people of differing talents to put out a game title.  Keeping a complex system up and running while making major changes is one of the hardest projects in ANY field of endeavor.  I have done both of these - game titles and complex systems - albeit not under as much public pressure as SOE does, and I think they are doing an OK job.<br />
<br />
I was project lead for the SAS/C Compiler for AmigaDOS way back in the day.  We caught a LOT of flak from the developer community for lack of certain features, or problems in subsystems or libraries, etc.  The people most affected by these shortcomings just couldn't understand why we didn't just FIX them - it would only take a few days.  Well, in fact, some of the fixes DID just take a few days - but they had to stand in line behind other fixes or improvements.  We were constantly doing triage on the product to find where we'd get the most bang for the buck on changes.  Some recognizably desireable projects got put on the back burner because a major rewrite was in the pipe that would remove any need for a minor fix; because it would affect only a small number of users; because we thought it would take too long (it's easy for YOU to say it'll only take 2 days, if I know the code and think it'll take 2 weeks, my estimate is the one we use.)<br />
<br />
Litgruv has it right - if you're that filled with bile over SOE's handling, take a break.  Or quit.  It's not healthy.  Me, I'm still having fun.</div></div><hr />
