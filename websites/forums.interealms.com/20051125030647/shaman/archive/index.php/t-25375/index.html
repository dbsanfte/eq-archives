<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I made a rogue on a pvp server.<br />
I'm not sure how I want to spent my talents.<br />
I'm thinking a fair amount into Subtlety for the ambush potentials,<br />
but not sure.<br />
Any comments?</div></div><hr />

<br />
as of my experience, at this point in time, I would go heavy combat. For one thing it makes leveling up far easier, but in pvp it is damned good too.<br />
<br />
For instance, ambush, sounds great doesn't it? It is a good attack, if you have all the talents to improve it, if you can find a high damage dagger, and if you are in stealth and behind target.<br />
<br />
I blow that away, with a cheap shot from any angle that gives two combo points, and two full rounds of SS before the target even comes out of the stun, I have dealt usually 1000 - 2000 + damage in that time, I have 4 combo points, I can kidney shot to stun again, ss again for a fat 5 point evis, and this is before using blade fury(20% increased attack speed and hits nearby enemies too for 15 seconds, 2 minute timer), and adrenaline rush(15 seconds fo 100% energy regen), or dodge.<br />
<br />
Stealth matters little, by the time you are high level, no one will see you untill it is too late. I can take warriors head to head with no dirty tricks, Paladins are a bitch, but I can win, just takes long ass time, any other class I can kill if I play it right.<br />
<br />
Pve it is easy, mow through critters left and right and don't have to use gouge/backstab. Ambush is a nice shot ability, but it does not outdo a CS and two SS, it is positional, requires low damage weapons.<br />
<br />
My build is mace specialty, I have a 6 % chance to stun with both maces, my main hand is a 124 damage mace, slow, but rogue attacks are instant(ss and evis, etc.) so speed matters not at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
I cannot stress enough how many times already blade fury and adrenaline rush have saved my ass. Three even critters on me used to scare me, now it is just easy experience. If I can find uber daggers, i might try another route, but right now it is no comparison.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Master of Deception 5, Impoved Gouge 3, Impoved Sinister Strike 2, Impoved Eviscerate 3, Malice 4 to get you Ruthlessnes 3, followed by Relentless Strike 1. That puts you at level 30. <br />
<br />
Those should keep you busy for quite awhile, and they don't commit you to a particular build (dagger vs sword). You'll find all of those useful for pvp and pve. <br />
<br />
I personally don't buy into the mace/sword &gt;&gt;&gt; dagger spec, but whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Cappi,<br />
<br />
it is not even a real comparison. I absolutely crush dagger rogues. I have a high stamina build, and remember that most of our strikes are instant, so delay is not a factor, maces have much higher damage potential than daggers.<br />
<br />
Also, untill you experience adrenaline rush + blade fury when you wade into a sea of enemies, you will not understand.<br />
<br />
Dagger spec kills well, but slowly, and takes more effort, and to be honest I don't want high effort, I am lazy. <br />
<br />
Only skill I lose is ambush, which a CS + 2 SS more than makes up for, in damage and combo points, and if you cant kill a caster right quick, you are not good. Against a melee character, the combat rogue shines. A warrior going toe to toe with me will lose everytime.<br />
<br />
My main hand weapon right now is 124 damage, with an effective delay as fast as our abilities refresh.(1.5 seconds?)<br />
<br />
I have 6% mace stun, 5/5 parry, 5/5 precision, 5/5 duel wield, blade fury, adrenaline rush, have the improved evis and sin strike plus aggression which helps them further, 3200 something hps at level 54. Dagger rogues, so far, get their butts kicked hard, but, if they ever come out with some high damage daggers, who knows, that may change.<br />
<br />
Just speaking from my experience. I cannot even try any daggers anyhow, seriously, there is almost never any daggers above level 40 in AH and never seen anything decent drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>crollub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well im only 28, called Dagga, so I was planning on using them, but when I saw a skeletal club at a 1g buyout in the AH at level 19, well I had to get it.<br />
<br />
http://www.thottbot.com/?i=8664<br />
<br />
Then the very same evening got me a stinging viper in a Wailing Caverns instance. <br />
<br />
http://www.thottbot.com/?i=5092<br />
<br />
And all of a sudden my daggers were absolutely pathetic. I even got improved ambush (will prob respec). Up to level 26 I waas opening with ambush, weapon switching and SS'ing away with the maces. I am now level 28 and find that now I have cheapshot I dont have to spend half the fight trying to get behnd the mob for my opener, while the other party members do the killing. And both the pally tank and the cleric healer really appreciate the 4 second stun at the begiinning of the fight.<br />
<br />
I do like the subtlety tree though, and almost all my points are in it. Camo is great for getting to where you need to be to do your opener. And improved sap is one of those abilities that I really liked when I first decided to go rogue, although so far I havn't really had a chance to use it much. I think if I had gone combat or assasination I would be getting more use out of my talent points, but preparation is something I'm also looking forward to playing with.<br />
<br />
I was thinking of respeccing to combat at some point, but didn't they nerf mace stuns recently so that you get diminishing returns the more stuns you do. This is the main put off for me. I don't want to CS for 4 secs, then proc a couple of stuns during those four seconds, so that all my subsequent stuns have no effect. Is this what happens? If you stun with mace a few times do kidney shots still work properly? (altho don't have KS yet, looking to the future)<br />
<br />
I am on PVE server, but am thinking PVP specs will be useful for the battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
Hey Mill whats your full talent spec?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't remember off hand, but tons into combat, rest into some of improved evis, gouge, etc. also the points into faster stealth.<br />
<br />
Rogues, all, beware of a warrior who pulls a retaliation out of his ass hehe, was dueling my brother beating his ass, but he has some ability on a timer like a big damage shield, everytime I hit him, he swings back for 15 seconds, I killed myself hehe.<br />
<br />
I am pretty sure, that the stun immune is on seperate timers, you can stun three times with mace stun in 15 seconds before can stun again, I am not sure though, but pretty sure CS not count towards that, I do not know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Damn, the secret is out /cry.<br />
<br />
Yeah, retaliation is like when a mob in EQ enrages and ripostes every attack for 15 seconds.  Brilliant against rogues.  The other trick up our sleeve is Overpower.  When a mob, or a pc, dodges, we have an instant extra attack that does weapon damage + some modifier that I can't remember.  Can spec talents to get 25% chance to crit on this as well.  Against rogues, this ability will be lit up constantly.  Refresh time on Retaliation is 30 minutes.  Overpower is only a rage cost of 5, so it can be used pretty readily.<br />
<br />
Mach</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Mach,<br />
<br />
yup, I am scared to hit evade now against warriors, and I have no clue as to what stance it is in, one hand and shield vs 2 hand, etc. Evasion either makes me immune to damage for 15 seconds, or hurts me good. Most warriors do not use alot of their abilities, for some reason.<br />
<br />
So much difference between smart warriors and dumb meat shields :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have a 54 Thief On Earthen ring. I have tried several different specs.<br />
<br />
I have gone 30 in Ass, I have gone 32 in combat I am thinking about trying 30 in Stealth just to see. <br />
<br />
Right now I like a 30 / ? / 10ish spec.  I am leading with a big ambush and have Stancesets mod so that a big damage sword gets slapped in main hand when I unstealth. Then I can use SS with the big sword Or gouge swap to dagger and Backstab. Both work quite well. And with seal fate and remorseless attacks The ambushes Hurt and give me a fast combo point cold blooded Evis. <br />
<br />
I grind as fast as a Combat Thief. But have more options in group combat due to backstabs and seal fate. <br />
<br />
Remorseless attacks is so sick with a Ambush spec big hit dagger. If I am quick I almost always get a pick and then crit Ambush for 2-3 combo points. Then a quick SS or two and Evis for a kill and slide into stealth for more carnage. <br />
<br />
Please note. I am on a PVE server. PvP doesnt intrest me much. But I can see the timed skills in high combat as a I win button against a PvP enemy. <br />
<br />
Good luck. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The overpower only works if you're in front of the warrior. If you keep strafing it pretty much screws their ability to use it. <br />
<br />
On a side note I bought riposte, and its become my new favorite ability, especially fighting rouges. Take away the main hand weapon and you can have your way with them for 10 seconds, which is pretty much the whole fight.</div></div><hr />
