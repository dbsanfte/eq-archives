<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bahdluk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey everyone I have been reading a while, or since I was a level 1 kitty shaman.  You all have convinced me not to become a shaman dressed like a druid but I am wondering how my gear is for a level 40 and what kinds of things I should change.<br />
<br />
I know I need 6 ac 65 hp rings before you even look.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Lose the legs, even totemic legs are better for AC and since you're clearly twinked, you could likely do the kromriff military legs quest.<br />
<br />
Lose one of those chipped bone bracers and get an RMB or one of those hammer bracers, OR if you really got friends and cash, think about a bracer of sense.<br />
<br />
Ditch the cloak and get a tailor to make you acryila cloak or an artic wyvern cloak.<br />
<br />
Look for a flayed turmoilskin belt for sale, or wait till you hit 46 and join a PoF raid.  Spider fur belt isn't bad.<br />
<br />
You're already familiar with the ring bit so I'll skip those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree, loose the legs, and the belt.  I disagree though with the previous poster.  I don't think the he is necessarily twinked, a good trader should have no problem getting these items at lev 40.  Here are my recomendations though:<br />
<br />
Legs :  Totemic or Ry'Gor<br />
<br />
Belt:     Flayed Turmoilskin (from Fear)<br />
<br />
Rings:  Ac 6  65<br />
<br />
Total cost for upgrade less then 2500p  and a HUGE improvement.<br />
