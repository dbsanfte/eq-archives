<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vivala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hello all,<br />
<br />
I've heard about a way to make some pretty fast aa points with the following duo:  60 shaman, 60 bard.  I read somewhere that the shaman slows, then brings the mob back to the bard, who is playing his ae damage song.  <br />
<br />
Question:  Can someone please elaborate on the exact tactic, which songs etc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shaman are the Kings of AE.  Problem is, the tactic is outdated.  It still works, and it can still be used, but pop exp is so fast anyways, there isn't much point in AE groups anymore.  <br />
<br />
Vivala you aren't exactly right on how it works.  But if you want to figure it out, try that first, and then think about what is the limiting factor thats keeping you from exping faster, and then figure out how to overcome that.<br />
<br />
Or, see if you can find crashem, he might talk to you about it if you ask nicely. Think he plays on tallon or vallon</div></div><hr />
