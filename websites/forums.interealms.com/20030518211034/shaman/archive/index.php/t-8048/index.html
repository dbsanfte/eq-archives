<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">At 222 pottery plus geerlok (puts me at roughly 233 skill), I succeded on my second try.<br />
<br />
Well worth the 700 plat I spent on components for the distilled mana!<br />
<br />
It drops you in the shaman guildhall, facing the shaman trainer. There's a vendor to your right and to your left and out in the hall there's six vendors. <br />
<br />
It's a 4 minute run to the PoK stone in Shadeweavers (including 1 minute for zoning).<br />
<br />
Now I can be on time to the raid gathering in the nexus, AND bind at my grind point! YAHOO!<br />
<br />
In other news, I etched all my 8th shawl armour and turned it into the dain last night... now I just need the war. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>rarra09</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Grats Harvyst ;)<br />
<br />
Gotta work on it myself, only 135 skill atm hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Soon as I saw it was in yesterday called wife and had her make me one :) Wouldn't mind having the port closer to the shadeweavers zone (or in the newbie zone as all the other shaman ports are) but hell I'm just happy they finally got around to us kitties.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thats cool harvyst. Glad they finally put that in for the cat shaman :). wonder if there is any hope for my cat warrior to get some &quot;cultural armor options&quot; ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I dunno about cat cultural, I would love cat cultural smithing. It's deadly hard to get from 188 to 225 in smithing as a cat.<br />
<br />
We still lack a cat alchemy gate potion, but hey, this is more useful to me :) Thank you, Verant :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Having a second bind point rocks. :)  First time I used my Spiritstone, I was helping a few friends finish their druid epics... head over to Tim Deep, bind, kill Faydedar, Spiritstone out, exp a while, gate back in the morning, kill Faydedar again. ;)<br />
<br />
Grats on the shawl progress too. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Harvyst, let me know if you need a redundant shaman for the war, it's always enjoyable :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Warscar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have to try and find someone on my server to make one for me. My highest trade skill is brewing at a 135.  I at least didn't have to much trouble making the zone essence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Grats, now i need to get my pottery up.<br />
<br />
Now all we need is something for the imbue gems spells to be useful for...not to mention cultural smithing...If they give us that free catnip for everyone!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Potions yet?!!!!<br />
<br />
/prays</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jheal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Grats !<br />
<br />
good news indeed  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My pottery is 199.  (GM brewer so can raise it much more)<br />
<br />
Currently 0 for 5 and 2kpp in the hole.<br />
<br />
No one selling them on zebux yet.<br />
<br />
/whimper</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Warscar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Cat, <br />
<br />
Vulcon is making them. I gave her 10 zone essences last night and she made 3. I bought one for 3k. Just join vulcon: vulcon channel and ask or see her bazaar mule Iwantyourplat.<br />
<br />
Oh btw, you can raise more then one skill above 200 now. If you check out your AA skills you will see they added one to the general section.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Akhilles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm lost... what are you talking bout? After being gone a year I come back and peeps are talking about pottery alot... why? Whats a spiritstone? Who am i and what am i doing here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">A spiritstone is a pottery made item that has a 30 second port to your home town. There is one (now) for each shaman race, and you have to get your specific race. It ports you to your race's home area.<br />
<br />
It has unlimited charges, and trivials &gt; 250 in pottery, and requires components which can be very expensive to gather such as distilled mana which takes 2 sapphires, and iron oxide which is hideously expensive if you do not farm it yourself.<br />
<br />
Last night Verant put in the Kitty spiritstone after months of saying they would never add one for the kitties :) So that's why we're all going crazy :)<br />
<br />
There is a companion stone called a faithstone for all races of cleric, as well. Nothing for Druids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Gratz for the Kitties, now i want the barb one to drop me at my guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Barb one drops you near the pok book though. it's a tradeoff. I'd almost prefer being near the pok book in shadeweavers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well Maybe it it actually dropped right on the book, Im not that unhappy about it actually its pretty close but little annoying they wouldn't revamp ours as well ogre and troll must suck a little getting dropped out in middle of swamp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Grats Harvyst!<br />
<br />
Is there any point trying to make this with 187 pottery skill + geerlok?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Probably not. It's &gt;250 trivial, and even if you forage the iron oxide, you still need 2 sapphires per each distillde mana per try... the costs will be pretty big to try for that 5% possible success.<br />
<br />
I've heard of people getting 50% success rate at 250 skill. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm glad I got mine :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">My wife is 250 pottery. She was 1 for 3 so triv is significantly above 250.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I got mine now.  Well worth the 4kpp I paid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Got mine last week sometime, too. It's well worth it. Now if they would just add vah'shir cultural armor :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">WooT! I got mine this past week, best 2K I have spent recently!!!  I love being able to bind at my camp spot and still be only a zone or so away from PoK book portals.<br />
<br />
Just wish they were soulbound.<br />

P.S.  I bought mine from Jessikka on Torv.  (she's an alt-not the main).  She had it on her in the bazaar for at least a week but I was a broke kitty.  Soooo glad there are so few +50 Vah Shir shaman on Torv. cause she still had it when I bothered to get some pp together :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Grats. <br />
<br />
But you coulda just used the knowledge port and saved yourself some trouble :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">You're missing the point.<br />
<br />
This allows you to bind in an area that is not close to a knowledge port, and still get to a knowledge port quickly.<br />
<br />
Aka, Bind in WL for some giant thumping, but gate to shar vahl and go anywhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">/em heartily agrees with Harvyst!!!<br />
<br />
Actually, I probably would NOT have bought a spiritstone before PoP came out, though Shadeweavers is sorta a short run from Nexus (Hmmm)<br />
<br />
Anyway, PoK book is exactly what makes spiritstones soooo helpful now!!!<br />
<br />
There still are a few zones (GASP!) that are not immediately next to a PoK book.  I love being able to bind in UP and use spiritstone to &quot;gate&quot; to anywhere in Norrath/Luclin via PoK book in Shadeweavers Thicket.   I can bind just ouside Chardok and gate out when hunting there, yet still be only a &quot;gate&quot; away from PoK books...... I can Bind in Trak when hunting in OS and still be only a &quot;gate&quot; away from a PoK book.....You getting the idea :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I hadn't been back to Shar Val much recently and now I'm passing through a lot which lets me do something I was missing, drive by buffing. Tossing up HoS on all the little kitties I pass on the way to the PoK book is always fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">grats kitties!  Could one of you link a pic of the new spiritstone?  I am curious since kitties have no religion if the item is flagged &quot;Agnostic&quot; or something to keep barbs like me from picking one up and using it just for the hell of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">No deity, just VAH/SHM<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure that they are all like that, I believe high elf one is just HIE/CLR without any certain diety.</div></div><hr />
