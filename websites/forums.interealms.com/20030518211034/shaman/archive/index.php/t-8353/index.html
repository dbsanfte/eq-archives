I got lucky. Real lucky. We were all gathered to do my 8th shawl event when the ranger did another check... this time from the corner, where he had gone LD on the last attempt.<br />
<br />
And what do you know, the bastard was up! :)<br />
<br />
So we rushed over there, got down there in what was our fastest DN attempt ever, and snagged him. :) And now I am the proud owner of one circlet of the faulkaen. :)<br />
<br />
The 8th Shawl event, by the way, was successful, except that the dwarf got stuck after the 4th battle and warped back to the start. One panic attack later, and one monk punch, we had him back to his spot and memblurred, and all was fine from that point onwards. But OH, the heart attack! &quot;What do you mean, he's gone?&quot;<br />
<br />
:)<br />
<br />
I am one very happy cat.<br />
<br />
And my guild is perhaps the sweetest and best guild ever... putting up with a real PITA like me :)<br />
<br />
Thank you guys for your advice. I would've gone crazy without it.</div></div><hr />

He had gone LD there the night before... before he had tried checking from the Shade's tomb but I am not sure if he could see Vile from there.</div></div><hr />
