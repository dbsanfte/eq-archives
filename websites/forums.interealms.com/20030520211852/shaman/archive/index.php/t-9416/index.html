As for how effective that hammer is, not sure, my race cant use them. I did find 2hb's with procs very helpful however soloing thoughout the low 50's.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I bought one and really like it.<br />
<br />
My 2hb sucks but the proc is wicked cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I cant use one but have thaught about it.<br />
<br />
I would rather go with a better ratio hammer like the Granit Face Grinder 29 36 or the war maul tha I have now but cant ever remember how to spell  33 36.  The proc on the barb hammer would be a lot of fun but it is cold based and should get resisted a lot by some mobs just like the JBB.  Overall I think you will get more damage and more consistant damage from a good ratio hammer.<br />
<br />
I have never priced the Barb Hammer so It is hard to say what the price / performace is going to be but the GFG is not that expensive and I just baught my War Maul for only 6k a few week ago.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It's great if you have a JBB.  Turn on autoattack and you'll get one swing off between blasts with it.  Always happy to see the following text:<br />

Soandso has been hit by non-melee for 263<br />
You have hit Soandso for 109<br />
Soandso has been hit by non-melee for 263<br />
<br />
Once you have your epic, sell it - we miss to often to bother hitting auto-attack.<br />
<br />
Radag:  Actual ratio just doesn't matter because we miss too often and we don't get a damage bonus.  I've had both a GFG and a BSH and there was no noticable difference other than I could steal agro when the proc went off after a nice hit like above :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Don't spend to much on one.  They aren't that rare to be honest, and they aren't that great anymore.  I won't sell mine, but I'd never use it either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have loved mine for a long time.  I'll frequently use it in place of my Tae Ew Maul (the 33/36 thingy Gerka/Radag has, too).  Damage is good, delay is so-so, but it procs.<br />
<br />
And it procs.<br />
<br />
And it procs.<br />
<br />
Frequently I'll do more damage from its procs than I do melee (well, considering our melee, that's not hard.)  One thing to think about, if we &quot;miss&quot; something, we still have a chance of proc'ing.  That &quot;miss&quot; may be a hit with the damage mitigated to 0.  I've proc'd a lot on misses.<br />
<br />
Have I mentioned it procs?<br />
<br />
A lot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Taladaen,<br />
<br />
Actualy it is because we get no primary hand bonus or 2hb bonus that damage ratio does matter.  We have no offseting factor that need to be taken into account like mele classes do.  The better the ratio the more damage you will get from the weapon.<br />
<br />
Also,  I hit all the time when soloing blue mobs.  My attack rating is well over 900 and with my self buffed str sitting about 250 I hit for 120s 130s about half the time.  This is not the same thing as trying to hit some higher ac group or rade target.<br />
<br />
Even now at 55 I spend no mana at all to damage mobs when grinding experience.  I just slow,  tank, and smack with the bit 2hb while the doggy rips him up.  My 2hb is doing a lot more damage to the mob then the mob is doing to me.<br />
<br />
Clearly if you choose a target that is very hard to hit,  and a weapon will proc even on a miss, then the evaluation of the relative marits of the different hammes will vary depending on the target.<br />
<br />
The only other differance is if you are clicking a JBB then you want the biggest damage number you can get regardless of delay.<br />
<br />
People often clain that the REIF is the best mele you can twink with and this is perhaps true untill after the damage caps are lifted.  After that I think it is very likeley that any of the good ratio 2hb or 1hb will significantly outperform a REIF.<br />
<br />
This subjust is not that complex but to say that ratio is of no importance is a simplification that I can't agree with based on close observation of the use of a number of different 2hb against a variety of targets.<br />
<br />
Beside,  I am an Ogre and I have not option but to bash things....  my mama would have no respect for me if I did nothing but sit on my arse and meditate.  *grins*<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Actually it is a nice hammer, especially when you count in you can grab it from under 1k from the bazaar if you are lucky!<br />
<br />
It seems to procc more often than the REIF as well (no logs on that though).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">no logs cause i've stoped meleeing recetnly for some reason but buff that dex up and you are a proccing fiend. i love mine and would suggest pick one up. its a great toy and i do good damage with it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Fumeden Ex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">sold mine for 1500pp. it had its uses, but after getting epic/jbb i loaned it out for over a year, got it back, and thought, &quot;now what am i gonna do with this?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I bought one for 600p in the bazaar and I'm enjoying it despite the fact that it doesn't proc yet.  I can't recall when it starts to proc.  I've already gotten my 2hb to 101, my piercing is 109 and my 1hb is 100.  That's not max for my level but its close.  I dinged 28 yesterday swinging it.  It seems to try to proc at lot and max hit I've done is 43 so far.    It does seem to hit a lot for 1-10 for me now but hit's for 40+ often enough that I do about the same damage as I would with a piercer.  I expect the difference in damage will change as I get higher skills in all weapons and higher levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Radag:<br />
<br />
Mob goes into flee mode and you chase it.   It will take far longer for you to beat it dead than it will to just click your JBB one more time to finish it off.   Trust me, I've done it many times.<br />
<br />
My stats are comparable to yours, with Rage I'm at 250-ish str and my combat skills are maxxed.  I would much rather swing a hammer and do _consistant_ damage but the JBB &gt;&gt; 2hb for consistant damage.  We're gimped in melee combat because some stupid clicky item from way back when :P<br />
<br />
BTW - pet peeve of mine:  If you hit a mob but the damage is mitigated down to 0 the client reports it as a &quot;miss&quot; but it still gives an opportunity for a weapon to proc.  Comes straight from the old MUDs' code.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">hammer is great for between jbbs btw, i reguarlly hit/proc between jbb blasts.</div></div><hr />

I love it, a little Rage and haste and you almost feel like a tank<br />
<br />
264 proc, I run into alot of resists on the HL mobs and i notice a dex buff helps with the proc.<br />
<br />
if you can get one at a good price i say go for it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>toradorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">&quot;hammer is great for between jbbs btw, i reguarlly hit/proc between jbb blasts.&quot;<br />
<br />
 Yeah but if you are in auto-attack you aren't medding while your JBB is casting. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
:)   I love my horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">900 attack and you hit half the time for 120/130?<br />
<br />
With a max of ~1300 atk (Slightly over, I think my best combo is 1315 or thereabouts) self buffed and swinging a primal brawlstick/hammer of spiritcalling, my max hit is 189 and against greenies I tend to hit for that a lot, but anything remotely close to giving xp my hit/miss ratio is about 50% each way, and about 30% of those hits are over 100 damage =P<br />
<br />
Procs are great, our melee damage is more than a lot of people give credit for, but is still just fluff (Witness how the cleric hammers make us look like an int caster in melee).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">i have no idea what server you play on, or what the economy is there.<br />
<br />
i play in the sewer known as Sullon Zek.  and our economy is a little off.  i was able to trade a totemic BP for it.<br />
<br />
proc is a little strange, starts at lvl 35 (i believe) and is not the same damage as winters UNTILL you get that lvl.  then the proc is capped at 263.<br />
<br />
in the lower lvls i carried a set of nothing but DEX gear to get it to proc more.  stuff like gorrilla hide legs from Kerra Ridge and such.  solo i would use the hammer, grouped i would use a spear and put on wis gear.  my 1blt is horrible.<br />
<br />
i was using the Barb hammer last night at lvl 52.57 hunting HG's in Rathe Mts.  with about 150 dex and attack just shy of 900, max hit i ever had was 80.  the number that i see the most common for some reason is 44.  <br />
<br />
some fights it would not proc, other times it was 3 in a fight.<br />
<br />
i don't have, and may never get a JBB.  on SZ they are just WAY to expensive.  so is the REIF.  and i will prob never see my epic either.<br />
<br />
if you have access to a hammer i would recommend it.  <br />
<br />
the one thing i would keep in mind is Kedge.  cold damage is almost totally resisted there.  i ended up getting a chieftain bogling spear, because my spine chill proc was no good there either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Taladaen,<br />
<br />
I don't trust anyone only reason LoL....<br />
<br />
I have also extensivly used JBB and that has little or know import in a discushion about the relative value of 2hb weapons and weapon ratios.<br />
<br />
Of corse if you have a JBB [ I don't at this time],  then weapon ratio is almost meaningless and you want to chose a weapon with the biggest damage number for the hits between JBB blasts.<br />
If you also have a horse and are outside you don't even want to turn attack on at all because of loosing the med benifit from the horse.<br />
<br />
Any shaman without a JBB should give serious consideration to using a big 2hb in experiance grinding situations.  With hast and a hast item,  I equip SCHW,  the damage from the big hammer is at least 50% of the damage from the JBB against selected mobs that have lower ac.<br />
<br />
I don't want anyone to &quot;trust me&quot;...  just give it a try and experiment and think creativly.  I have found this to be quite effective against the nobles in HHK and also in Kata killing guards at level 55.  It is not nearly as effective on higher ac mobs unless crip can bring them down to a level where they can be hit for bigger numbers.  If I still had Radag,  an Iksar deleted at 52,  he would always have a nice 2hb in the bag and the best hast item I could find.  With the Iksar ac boost and great health regen,  this should work very nice.<br />
<br />
After I get a new JBB things will change.  The last 2 JBBs I saw for sale where 40k and 70k so it is going to be some time.<br />
<br />
The ratio of a shaman weapon is of critical importance in how that weapon performs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Well, <br />
<br />
I bought one....got it for 3.5 K!!! Thats the cheapest I've seen them on our server though (quellious). <br />
<br />
I like it, I love the proc.<br />
<br />
I still want a jaundiced bone bracer though......I think maybe I'm gonna have to save up for one. <br />
<br />
thanks for your advice guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Found one for 2k after reading about it here, and it's been great.  Melee output is pretty low, but with an FBSS and Quickness I swing pretty often.  Of course it will go a fight without proccing, or proc as the mob is running, etc. but I've had several fights with three mobs on me where the proc decides to go off a few times and saves my butt.  When fighting shrooms at 35, three procs will kill most of them outright and even just one proc can make all the difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">last night i upgraded to the tarnished driveshaft for 1500plat.<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16999<br />
<br />
and while it does not have an effect, i cut the delay from 43/44 to 30.  that is a better ratio than our epic.  (granted the epic is a piercer and i would get a shield)<br />
<br />
but if i can cut 25% of the delay and keep the damage the same, gain some stats overall and get the melee DPS up; i think this will be a better weap.</div></div><hr />
