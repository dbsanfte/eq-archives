<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hoodlum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a recent convert to the shaman class, and I think I've made a few steps in the right direction concerning gear.  I just have a few questions regarding some weak spots I'm seeing.  I'm looking for long-term investments mostly (ie - most required/reccomended level restrictions don't matter too much to me as I'm aiming for the 50+ game).  I have about 12k to spend.  I'm open to any suggestions, but here's what I'm looking at mostly:<br />
<br />
- I don't think my primary weapon is too hot (Spine Chill Spear).  Is my melee going to be contributing enough to my overall damage to sink a few thousand pp into a new weapon?  Also, my Ivory Imbued Collar doesn't look up to par with the rest of my gear.<br />
- I have no focus effects on any of my armor.  I looked mostly for HP/AC/Wis/Mana gear (in that order).  Should I ditch some of my current gear in favor of foci II or III?  I've been looking into the PoK quests for a Mana Preservation II and Spell Haste II items (I believe those are the effects).  Are those worth doing?<br />
- I chose to wear Crystal Chitin Armplates because of the nice AC and stamina on them.  Was this a wise choice?  Are there other choices out there (around this price) that would suit me better?<br />
- The allure of the horse/lizard intrigues me.  I've heard that having a steed equates to a rediculous Flowing Thought effect, is this the case?  Also, would having a steed go well with my plans to solo &quot;in teh face?&quot;<br />
-  Getting a JBB is up on my list as well.  Something about mana-less nukes for a fair amount of damage makes me grin from ear to ear.<br />
<br />
I'm looking for long term investments.  I'd like to get all of my gear discrepencies out of the way so I can focus on levelling up as quickly as possible without neglecting any skills.  If anyone could give me a couple pointers, I'd be most appreciative.  Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Note:  I'll replace my Shissar Scale Helm once the I level up a bit and the stats on my Metal Linked Crown beef up a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">- Your epic is really the only weapon gear you need to worry about. If you are looking to spend some money on upgrades focus on other items instead of your weapon. We are a priest class, not melee.<br />
<br />
- See what the price on a tracking wolf coller is on your server. I am still wearing this at level 65.<br />
<br />
- Horses are a wonderful thing. <br />
<br />
- Mana free damage is also a wonderful thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I might recommend the chipped bone bracer for the wrist slot for the time being.  It's pretty cheap and the focus effect will last you at least till you can get decent stats out of the ones you're wearing now.<br />
<br />
The CC arms are good to the 50s, not many great arm items out there for less than 5kpp.  If money isn't a problem look at Hardened Grey Flesh Sleeves.<br />
<br />
The Fine Antique ring from PoK is very nice for the time/cost of the quest and you will be wearing it for quite some time as well.  <br />
<br />
You might consider getting the spell haste 2 item or a chrysoberyl talisman for the neck slot until your Channeling gets to the point where you don't get interrupted 75% of the time.<br />
<br />
Horse effectiveness is determined by your Meditation skill,  It would really be a luxury prior to around level 30-40.<br />
<br />
As far as weapons go, look for bargains and try to keep all your skills up.  I paid 200pp for a Blight, Hammer of the Scourge and have been quite happy with it but melee DPS is still not really that great.  At 45 I'm more efficient Horse tanking and letting DoTs and Scooby do the work and not turning on auto-attack so I regen mana at sitting rates during the fight.  If you see me swinging it's because I hate to neglect skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kongming</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Boots - Barbed dragon boots, 19ac 30hp 9 stam, about 3-4k, one of the best boots in the game that tradeable, great for the price.<br />
<br />
earring - you will want one of those solossite earring one day, but keep your BSEE for now.<br />
<br />
Back slot i would go with a iskar cape 75hp and mana, or a cloak of maestorm 55hp and 6 sta</div></div><hr />
