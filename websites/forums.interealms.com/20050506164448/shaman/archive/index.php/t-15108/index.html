<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is going to be my first time going on a Chardok raid, I have no clue what I'm to do. Of course I am one of the lowbies on the raid, but in my eyes its the best time to learn what to do and what not to.<br />
<br />
I know the simple things like keep pet taunt off (if dogdog is allowed) and so on.<br />
<br />
<br />
What are the other things that I should keep an eye out for incase it happens?<br />
<br />
We are to be doing the Royals, whatever that means....<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, you are low level for the raid. From experience my advice is this - cast late.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>sir0die</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i would sugest that you spot heal the other casters, and rebuff the folks that get rezzed once combat starts.<br />
<br />
i've been the low man on many raids, this is what i've done.<br />
<br />
most of the raids i've been on, the higher shamans do the pre-raid buffing, but once the sh_t hits the fan, folks start dying, and the clerics with clicky sticks start rezzing, if you see someone looting their corpse, slap a buff or 4 on them, haste, regen, sow(if in zone that allowed), don't worry abouot a str buff, rez effects wount let it stick. <br />
<br />
if for some reason your cheal group draws aggro, maybe be the sacrifical goat and draw the aggro with a slow or something and try to run the mob back to where all the warriors are.(done this once or twice)<br />
<br />
the most important thing is of course FOLLOW DIRECTIONS and don't draw aggro away from the MT or ST<br />
<br />
mostly, you'll be healing or buffing.<br />
<br />
the cheal group, if you don't know, is the group of cleric that are casting cheal on the MT (main tank). example, cl1 cast cheal, 3 seconds later cl2 cast cheal, 3 seconds later cl3 cast cheal and so on and so on. so essentialy there will be anywhere from 2-4 cheals being cast about to land on MT, all depends on how many cleric in rotation and MT's HP and how hard the mob hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The others have given good general advice, so I won't repeat any of that. What I'd like to add is that since this is Chardok, do NOT have a pet up unless told specifically to do so. So many Chardok raids wipe as there is a trap otw to the king and pets/players fall thru and aggro the King and his guards. Not good. You probably don't need the pet up at all anywhere in there, but if in a nice safe place, it probably wouldn't hurt. Just don't let the pet wander. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A Royals raid references heading deeper into Chardok to kill the Prince (for enchanter epic), the King (for cleric epic) and the Queen (for warrior epic).  A pretty classic challenging and well done raid event.  <br />
<br />
The pet should be fine if you use /pet guard here, and then summon companion as you move to a rest/camp/fight spot.  <br />
<br />
They aren't aggro, so obviously they can be parked whereever.  <br />
<br />
Royal raids are cool, while the Queen is no longer the challenge she once was, respect the fact when she dies that she's cleaned the clocks of many a raid.  <br />
<br />
Lord knows we've had a couple of necro summoning parties due to the Queen.  It's a different ballgame now of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>txMaddog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hi!<br />
<br />
Well...some Royals Summon so aggro is a bad thing.<br />
<br />
Don't sit if a mob is in camp, and keep your health above 40% to prevent bloodlust aggro (or whatever it's called).<br />
<br />
If the raid leader shouts CLERIC CAMP! do your best to keep the mobs off the clerics til they can camp out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, It all went well, we wiped once right after the bridge...some freak stuff happened and we got close to 8 mobs none of us where ready for that.<br />
<br />
A few CR's later we rebuffed and tried again we managed to do prince and king before I had to leave. It was a fun time, I got a shoulder item, some choikai something can't remember spelling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Most important thing about CD raids to the royals is to listen to the RL and not agro anything.  If you go to the wrong spot you can start some massive trains real easy. <br />
<br />
I dont know the lvls of the other shaman but if they are high enough all you may have to do is spot heal and do some DD.  Which is cool.</div></div><hr />
