<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rocki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Did I mess up?<br />
<br />
I have done everything in the epic quest step by step so far.  Today I got the three books from Lord Ghiosk in City of Mist.  As I was travelling in the emerald jungle to turn in the books, I forgot to turn off my invisibility before handing it in to the spirit in the lake.  The horn sounded, the spirit responded with the description of the next step, and my truespirit faction increased.  I did not get experience.  After I clicked off my invis, the spirit conned &quot;kindly&quot; to me.<br />
<br />
My question is, did I screw up?  Has anybody else done this and successfully completed the epic?  I really don't want to have to repeat steps.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
Invis always drops when you go to hand in quest items, whether or not your spell buff icons reflect this. The only way to hand in items while invisible is if someone else casts invis on you after you open the trade window.<br />
<br />
It is true you do not get exp for that step, and kindly faction there is normal.</div></div><hr />
