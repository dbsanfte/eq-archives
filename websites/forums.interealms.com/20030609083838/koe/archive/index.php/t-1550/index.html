<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jlove Fizzboom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all.  Need a few volunteers to raid the Phin-Man down under.  Lots of stuff drops down there, for lots of classes, so i'm hoping it won't be hard to find support for this.  I have heard it can be done with one group, but I have always seen at least two (overkill in each case).<br />
<br />
I will be home Saturday and sunday, and maybe friday of next week, but might not be able to check this thread for days at a time.  Hope to see you next weekend.  I am hoping for a raid start time around 1 or 2 pm EST, pls post when you are available and if at least one full group is ready at 1est, we will go:)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jlove Fizzboom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The Phin man was slain is masterful fashion by a large contigent of KoE tonight.  He was not brave enough to show his face at or anywhere near the raid time, but a VERY patient Fanadile put her alternate at the zone in and stayed there watching for 8 hours +.<br />
<br />
When the call went out the phinny had spawned at approximately midnight est, a swarm of KoE decended and killed that Phish dead.<br />
<br />
Gratz to Aiela on epic piece.<br />
Gratz to Zadu on staff of elemental mastery water.<br />
Gratz to Aneron on the final piece for his lvl 49 quest spell.<br />
<br />
There will be more Phinny slayings in the future, and I will be happy to attend them.</div></div><hr />
