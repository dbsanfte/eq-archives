<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, Scirocco made an interesting post over on the guild summit forums. He stated:<br />
<br />
&quot;The list below is not mine, but from another thread in another location by a player who plays a 65 shaman, 65 druid, and res-level cleric.  I could think of a couple tweaks to the list myself (and would add that I think the mage DS should go up to match the suggested druid DS increase), but as a concise, simple list of relatively easy changes to the current, pre-OoW game, it's not bad (in my opinion).   The main goal, as you can see, is to alleviate the healing problem while giving clerics some improvements in DPS and utility spells.  I throw it in the mix, FWIW:<br />
 <br />
 <br />
I said on another thread that I thought I could balance priests by making 30 changes to spdat. Here's my specific proposal, changing 10 spells for each priest class:&quot;<br />
<br />
***incuding just the shaman changes listed for our discussion***<br />
<br />
 1.  65 shm - Breath of Trushar    1:  increase HP v2 by 900/tick<br />
 2.  65 shm - Quiescence            1:  increase HP v2 by 600/tick<br />
 3.  65 shm - Daluda's Mending     1:  increase HP by 2000<br />
 4.  58 shm - Kragg's Mending       1:  increase HP by 5000<br />
 5.  63 shm - B.O. Replenishishment  1:  increase HP by 80 per tick<br />
 6.  64 shm - Bane                   resist adjustment:  -30; recast:  2.5<br />
 7.  64 shm - Velium Strike         casting time:  5.5<br />
 8.  61 shm - Spear of Torment   casting time:  3.0<br />
 9.  65 shm - Balance of the Nihil   resist adjustment:  -100<br />
10.  AA shm - Virulent Paralysis     resist adjustment:  -100; recast:  30<br />
<br />
What do you guys think?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So what he suggests basically is upgrade druid healing to cleric level, upgrade shaman healing to former druid level, and give cleric some utility.<br />
I don't know if this will work out (actually I hear the cries of clerics right now) but I would like to see that in a test environment.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i dont think the healing will ever go over. Remember, they just adjusted out healing and as far as rytan is concerned, its not bad.  Honestly, i think they are all good ideas, i just dont see SoE considering them.<br />
<br />
Also another thing to consider is, the higher out HoT's go, the less effective at mana conversion they become. Not that its a determining factor, but something to think about</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I just don't understand that HOT argument at all. Sure, I use Q + can 5 for mana regen, but I use Q all the time for healing myself, my pet and other players. Imposing some arbitrary low limit just to keep it &quot;efficient&quot; for mana regen seems incredibly short sighted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think clerics will need a bit more than what that list offers.  <br />
<br />
They need a bit more of a secondary role, so it's not so bad an idea to stack them or do something else in exp groups.  <br />
<br />
Too much efficiency become worthless in many situations.<br />
<br />
So, I think clerics would need more dps, whether through nukes or melee.  But something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">did SoE representatives see this list?  It seems like a very good way re balance (or keep in balance while improving) everyone all around.  Only thing I can think of to add to the list would be recast time on malos and turgur's (reduce it).  Other than that, great list, lets hope that someone who matters sees it and thinks its good too.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
Gart, I agree with the cle thing for DPS to an extent, but they have decent DPS as is (IMO) for NOT being a DPS class via; Hammer of Divinity (http://eq.crgaming.com/spells/spell.asp?Id=1936) , Hammer of Souls (http://eq.crgaming.com/spells/spell.asp?Id=1937) and Hammer of Damnnation (http://eq.crgaming.com/spells/spell.asp?Id=2121) ...correct me please if I am wrong, but these can either be wielded in combat or sent in kind of as a pet.  They proc A LOT and if weilded have a decent dmg:delay ratio.  I always see clerics using these things, so they must be useful.  Dont think IMO that they need any more real help for DPS in any real capacity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Cascet, it's posted to the forums that were created after the Guild Summit earlier this year. SOE developers read and post to the forums.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As it is Trushar is already highly inefficient for healing CanV (awesome in other aspects though).  If the HoT healing goes up so does the mana cost making CanV obsolete and useless (unless you can afford another gem slot).  And no...I don't want to change out every time I cast CanV <br />
<br />
A way around this could be to add an extenstion aa to CanV that is a HoT similar to the damage taken that casts as a part of CanV.  This would help the higher end shaman as well as those that may have a hard time getting their HoT spells.  :p</div></div><hr />

cool beans, hope they take it to heart then and do something about it :)</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
all this would be incredibly overpowering up to kod taz level at least.<br />
<br />
trushar + daluda in their current state make healing in elemental xp groups trivial already (no need for other healer) and almost fine in kod taz.<br />
<br />
9. 65 shm - Balance of the Nihil resist adjustment: -100<br />
10. AA shm - Virulent Paralysis resist adjustment: -100; recast: 30 <br />
<br />
why not neg350 on balance ? or alot more ? neg1000 ? <br />
Resist check is very fine as it is now and only small issue could be the short duration, 30 more seconds would be great.<br />
<br />
VP could get a resist check, but no need to be as high as 100, 100 is alot. -30 or -40 can be acceptable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If we are going to fix stuff, let's FIX stuff. Not sure how all of this would tie in - some of the modifiers in particular might be too powerful. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Balance of the Nihil. Resist mod -70, duration 5 min.<br />
<br />
2. Daluda's Mending. Increase HP by 2100<br />
<br />
3. Malos. Casting time: 3 sec., recast time = 2.25, add -55 DR effect<br />
<br />
4. Bane. Resist mod -50, casting time: 1.5 sec., hate = (hate of 2k nuke/2), recast time = 2.25, 550/tick, duration 4 ticks<br />
<br />
5. Blood of Saryrn. Resist mod -50, casting time: 1.5 sec, hate = (hate of 2k nuke/2), recast time = 2.25, 450/tick, duration 5 ticks<br />
<br />
6. Velium Strike. Casting time = 5 sec, damage = 1200<br />
<br />
7. Ferine Avatar. Target type = group, duration = 30 min, recast = 2.25 sec. +20 Avoidance, +20 mitigation, +20 strikethrough, +10% double attack, +10% dual wield, +10% all weapon skills, +180 ATK<br />
<br />
8. Ancient: Chaotic Pain. Vendor sold = YES<br />
<br />
9. Add Discipline: Protective Spirit/Stonestance.<br />
<br />
10. Virulent Paralysis . Resist adjustment:  -100; recast:  30<br />
<br />
<br />
I didn't add any truly new stuff, though I did steal a discipline from beastlords. If I were to throw in new stuff, I would also include:<br />
<br />
11. Our own special MGB HoT. Would probably be a heal + end regen + PR/DR cure.<br />
<br />
12. Single target Divine Arbitration for emergency heals (on same timer as cleric DivA)<br />
<br />
13. Fix the $@%#$% resist rate on rains.<br />
<br />
14. NO MORE SHORT DURATION BUFFS EVER.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Darn it, I forgot to add upping Talisman of Alacrity to 60% haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I just don't understand that HOT argument at all.

Imposing some arbitrary low limit just to keep it &quot;efficient&quot; for mana regen seems incredibly short sighted.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not saying it should, just making sure the trade off is brought to the front of the thought process for this line of spells. I use Q too and dont complain much, i just hit can4 a few times to semi-even it out, but what about BoT? How good is the ratio then? With these upgrades listed above, how will the mana costs scale up. Things to think about is all.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse, this could bring up also the idea of a a Can6  or CanV level 2 AA that would be more inline with this HoT series.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">1. Balance of the Nihil. Resist mod -70, duration 5 min.<br />
It would need a significantly higher mana cost to make up for the faster cast time and resist mod compared to Tugurs. It does not need a 5 min duration. This spell was designed for GoD/LDoN style content where mobs have low hps so the fights are over quickly. In longer fights, (e.g. Luclin or PoP content), you have time to Malos/Turgurs.<br />
<br />
6. Velium Strike. Casting time = 5 sec, damage = 1200<br />
Not sure about this one either. This will raise our nukes on par with Ench and Cleric nukes without giving them anything in return. Particularly with the changes to the DoTs you propose, shamans will effectively leap frog other classes in the DPS ladder. <br />
<br />
7. Ferine Avatar. Target type = group, duration = 30 min, recast = 2.25 sec. +20 Avoidance, +20 mitigation, +20 strikethrough, +10% double attack, +10% dual wield, +10% all weapon skills, +180 ATK<br />
SOE have said they don't want this to be a group spell since it will become MGBable. I wouldn't mind a single target version similar to what you state but the number and size of the bonuses you give here is just too powerful. This would increase melee DPS by 30% ish and decrease their damage taken by a similar amount. It is just too high. Content would have to be retuned.<br />
<br />
8. Ancient: Chaotic Pain. Vendor sold = YES<br />
This is the same as the proposed level 67 shaman spell Pained Memory. Let's wait and see how the OoW spell model works.<br />
<br />
9. Add Discipline: Protective Spirit/Stonestance.<br />
Casters and priests don't get disciplines. Sorry. It would be nice to have but really isn't necessary.<br />
<br />
10. Virulent Paralysis . Resist adjustment:  -100; recast:  30<br />
-100 is unnecessarily high. Even a -30 or -40 would be fine. Coupled with MD (or the new Malo), this would be fine. If you are going to make it -100 why not just make it unresistable?<br />
<br />
Edit: The lower recast time really isn't necessary, either. The benefit its current recast time is that VP expires just after the recast time at max AA. VP allows shamans to reclaim a spell gem under controlled circumstances. Reducing the recast time means you never have to worry about root, which was not the intention of the ability. <br />
<br />
11. Our own special MGB HoT. Would probably be a heal + end regen + PR/DR cure.<br />
No PR/DR cure. This would cure AOEs rather than heal them. Blood of Nadox is not MGBable for that reason.<br />
<br />
12. Single target Divine Arbitration for emergency heals (on same timer as cleric DivA)<br />
DA is a cleric/bard only thing. Shaman have VP for situations where things get hairy. I don't think this is necessary either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">all this would be incredibly overpowering up to kod taz level at least.<br />
I agree. A few weeks ago I (62 shaman at the time) was duoing luggalds in Nadox with a 58 War. Both were pre-EP geared, although I did have one piece of ornate. I found that, once I hit the war with replenishment (+40 hp per tick) and slowed the incoming mobs, I didn't need to worry about healing her again even when we were pulling multiples. I would use Stoicism to heal myself after cannying but niether of us were ever in danger of dying. Admittedly, luggalds are hardly GoD level content but I think that is indicative ot the existing level of healing ability that shamans have. I'm not saying that shamans don't necessarily need a leg up in healing here or there but we need to remember that suggestions we make must be reasonable, not a wish list.<br />
<br />
Looking at the list you provide, Gloriana, I feel that clerics are being shortchanged. Basically, druids and shamans are getting large boosts in healing in exchange for clerics getting a little bit of utility and a slight increase in DPS from shorter casting times. I understand that clerics want these changes desparately but not at the expense of positions in groups. Clerics need a decent secondary role in groups that is not bottable, not just invis, lev and EB added to their spell list. <br />
<br />
I realise that you want to focus on shaman issues not class comparisons but, as evidenced by some of the thinking already demonstrated on this thread, I honestly feel that the two are inseparable. We also need to look at the abilities of other classes to see how changes to shaman will affect them and whether they will need adjustments to compensate them or compliment us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I got it. Give us Paragon for out Can5. See we hit canV and then hit paragon for mana and healing back, but it can only work after Can5 has been used and is self only.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok its a pipe dream, but hey, you never know what you stumble across ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Hail,<br />
<br />
I personally like the shaman list.  Who wouldn't?  I'd be pretty happy with only half that list going live. :cool:  It would make regular shaman acceptable main healers (without needing tons of focus gear/AA's) in most content.<br />
<br />
It makes druids acceptable main healers in just about any content.  I'm fine with that personally, but it is a major paradigm shift back to the only slight differences between priest classes years ago at the lower end of the game.<br />
<br />
I honestly don't think this list does enough for clerics.  It gives them some conveniences (lev, invis, EB) that are nice to have but not earth shattering for them.  It removes some nuisances for them (knockback nukes) but doesn't give them any sort of real punch.  I view those changes akin to our asking for our pet to have innate dual wield, SoW, etc, and some of the other minor changes we'd really LIKE to have, but aren't worth screaming up and down about.<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly, except for upper GoD or very dangerous content, would you ever look for a cleric if the druid &amp; our changes went live?  Clerics need some serious utility improvements if the other two priest classes are going to become *real* healers again (like we were so many years ago) in any situation.  Give them some superwhamodyne undead nukes/DoT's so they can solo specific content.  Give ALL the priest classes the ability to BASH and let clerics get some &quot;Holy Slap&quot; bash that crits or has a nifty effect on it.  They'll need someting besides these to make them happy.<br />
<br />
I'd love to see these changes, but I don't see it happening as it really rips a huge hole in the cleric niche.  While I think that would be a GOOD thing to do overall, there also need to be some major concessions to clerics (but not in terms of healing ability) so that they remain a viable class that you wouldn't mind taking in any group situation.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Sometimes I don't understand people.<br />
<br />
Why would someone want to eke out another 1.2 dps at the expense of a friend or fellow player. <br />
<br />
Every class in the game gets the crickets some time... you know the.. Hey gang what yall doing....Yall need me....<br />
<br />
(Chirp... Chirp)<br />
<br />
As a shaman I can run entire groups based off me alone. I can solo and group with the best of them. But you know what. Playing with the top game all the time would simply burn a shaman out. Just like clerics get burnt out from being responsable for 5 other people fun night. Every night. <br />
<br />
When the heal is a second late who do you blame. The healer. Be it a cleric druid or shaman. It is alot of responsibility for a single class to alway bear the burden of that. And when folks are dead. Who has the absaloute requirement to get back and fix things. Once again in most groups the cleric. And they have the absolute worst chance of getting back to a body on thier own merit. Due to a horrible lack of utility.<br />
<br />
Shaman and druids need to be able to play in the place of a cleric. And clerics need to be able to play in the place of a shaman or druid and That shoe only fits when content is trivial.<br />
<br />
when stuff is challenging you want the specialists because That is the best possible chance for survivial. And The generalists are simply not suited for the absolute bleeding edge. And we all know who the specilists are. Warriors. Enchanters. Wizards, Clerics, Thieves. Only two of those classes specialties overlap. Wizards and Thieves. Because DPS always will stack once you have the holy trinity. Both Of them make fights abruptly shorter. So that helps the holy trinity keep themselves in the A game as well. <br />
<br />
The other specialists are a bit more hazy of course. Shaman are Specialists at slow or in a way group support. Druids are specialists at doing Everything (Or you could say a specilist at being a generalist.) Bards are the WD 40 of EQ. They make everything slide better but you always feel a little greasy afterwords.<br />
<br />
That leaves the other classes. The niche classes. Or the so called hybrids. (Yeah yeah necros and Mages will scream at being lumped in there but they are simply a hybrid of the wizard archtype. Damage dealers with a hook.) Rangers and beastlords are the DPS hybrids. And Paladins are the Defensive one. Shadowknights have no real role other than the semi- tanking hybrid with a good effects budget and lousy PR. <br />
<br />
If anyone can figure out bezerkers please let them know what they are supposed to do. <br />
<br />
As the game gets more and more known and explored the trivial content becoems the venue for the generalists and the specialists are left sucking hind tit till the next bleeding edge is found. <br />
<br />
Well unless they are friends. Of course. Or for a few people that care less about the optimum DPS contributions to achive maximum gain out ot the littlest risk possible. The Accountants of EQ. The damn min maxers. Are what really hurt the game the most. Because they have the developers beliveing that they are what drives all of the game. <br />
<br />
The developers won't realise till it is too late that the bleeding edge folks are going to go to the next bleeding edge thing. Even another game. So don't bet everything on red my friends. Else you will lose in the long run. <br />
<br />
Bah I am rambling now. Sorry for the long post. But it just drives me nuts sometimes because the players are part of the problem. And because we are all right in our own minds nothing will ever truly get fixed with EQ because something ran by a committy (yeah spelled it wrong) will only succeed in making everyone unhappy in the long run except the very very comitted few.<br />

<br />
No offense intended, but you and I are playing a very different EQ. I'm level 65 with more than 300 AA, Time and Kod'Taz access. You're 64 and not yet fully elemental. Now I'm sure you're going to tell me all about your 600 AA Time+Qvic Class_X, but that still doesn't mean you have a good insight into what might help shaman be more effective in the high-end game. You don't even HAVE many of the spells you are criticizing.<br />
<br />
(Edit: The above came off a bit harsher than I intended. I don't think my progress in EQ gives me any kind of moral superiority, and everyone is entitled to their opinion. I have experienced a lot more of the game as a shaman, though. A level 64 shaman just has a great deal more of EQ to see, and may well come to a different conclusion after gaining level 65 and progressing a bit, thus running up against the new hyperspeed vision of encounter design.)<br />
<br />
In general, shaman are fine in PoP and normal LDoN, though the edges start to fray a bit once you get elemental access. Hard LDoN and GoD really suck for us, in my opinion (and in the opinion of lots of other shaman in the same spot). Where we need a boost is in non-trivial content.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It would need a significantly higher mana cost to make up for the faster cast time and resist mod compared to Tugurs. It does not need a 5 min duration. This spell was designed for GoD/LDoN style content where mobs have low hps so the fights are over quickly. In longer fights, (e.g. Luclin or PoP content), you have time to Malos/Turgurs. <br />
<br />
Why should I be digging up a Kunark spell to slow stuff at all? Would it break the game for Nihil to be a full on replacement for Turgurs? It's more of a convenience factor than anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not sure about this one either. This will raise our nukes on par with Ench and Cleric nukes without giving them anything in return. Particularly with the changes to the DoTs you propose, shamans will effectively leap frog other classes in the DPS ladder. <br />
<br />
You're afraid of leapfrogging enchanter and cleric nukes? OH MY GOD, STOP THE SERVERS, A SHAMAN JUST OUTNUKED A CLERIC AND A CHANTER! The DoT damage we can do will always be limited by encounter speed. Right now, the hyperspeed pacing of most fights would mean that even if you used both DoTs as I described, you'd still end up missing some ticks. And both of those DoTs combined would do 1000/tick, which is about 167 DPS. Of course, after slowing and laying on the first DoT, you'd be a decent way into the fight in any case. They might need a bit of tuning to drop the DPS down a tad, but it's hardly over the top.<br />
<br />
For some reason, it's okay for a chanter to charm a pet, haste it, hand it 2 weapons, and have it do 2000 DPS - but it's not okay for shaman to outnuke chanters.<br />
<br />
<br />
SOE have said they don't want this to be a group spell since it will become MGBable. I wouldn't mind a single target version similar to what you state but the number and size of the bonuses you give here is just too powerful. This would increase melee DPS by 30% ish and decrease their damage taken by a similar amount. It is just too high. Content would have to be retuned.<br />
<br />
SOE says lots of stuff, and most of it is borderline retarded. Rytan thinks stats matter, for God's sake. Look, with the philosophy you espouse, we can NEVER get any more powerful because &quot;content would have to be retuned&quot;. We are all going to be level 70 in few months, which will shatter all of the previous content anyway. Remember how many guilds broke into VT after you could level to 65? Same thing will happen to PoP.<br />
<br />
For some reason, it's okay to have bards to tack on 30% overhaste, but it's NOT okay for shaman to have independent spells (other than haste) that would increase melee DPS. It's okay for rangers to have long-lasting buffs that add 100+ ATK, but for shaman, it would be unbalancing. Why have you subscribed to this line of thinking?<br />
<br />
TO HELL WITH THAT ATTITUDE. OoW isn't out yet. Let them retune that for our new highly potent buffs which will be desired by every melee. And to hell with the tedium of FA rotations, too.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is the same as the proposed level 67 shaman spell Pained Memory. Let's wait and see how the OoW spell model works.<br />
<br />
Point taken, but the Canni spell line hasn't been upgraded since Velious. This spell should be available to EVERY level 65 shaman. It's a disgrace that it was made into an ancient.<br />
<br />
<br />
Casters and priests don't get disciplines. Sorry. It would be nice to have but really isn't necessary.<br />
<br />
You know this based on your experience playing a shaman in high-end GoD content? In my opinion shaman DO need some kind of survivability increase for when they draw aggro. Right now, an enchanter has more survivability than we do, due to their instacast runes, self-runes, hate-reducing spells, and stuns. This is a ridiculous state of affairs, and needs to be corrected.<br />
<br />
<br />
-100 is unnecessarily high. Even a -30 or -40 would be fine. Coupled with MD (or the new Malo), this would be fine. If you are going to make it -100 why not just make it unresistable? <br />
<br />
I agree that -100 may be a bit high, I copied it directly from the list above. -50 might be more appropriate. Why shouldn't shaman get an on-demand root AA? Druids and rangers get an on-demand snare AA. Making VP land reliably without having to cast MD first would be a nice improvement to our root-parking abilities.<br />
<br />
<br />
No PR/DR cure. This would cure AOEs rather than heal them. Blood of Nadox is not MGBable for that reason.<br />
<br />
Again - content grows, we go with it. It's absurd that SOE has denied us an MGBable group heal, when both of the other priests, as well as our hybrid, have one. &quot;We didn't intend them to be used this way&quot; they say. So what? If they are so unbalancing, take them out of the game. Otherwise, bring us up to par. There are plenty of detrimental AEs that this would not affect, including curses, spells without counters, etc. It's just an idea. Some kind of MGBable heal is a must, though.<br />
<br />
<br />
DA is a cleric/bard only thing. Shaman have VP for situations where things get hairy. I don't think this is necessary either.<br />
<br />
I assume you are mixing up Divine Arbitration and Divine Aura (since bards get nothing like Divine Arbitration). FYI, SKs, paladins, and necormancers get invulnerability spells too. <br />
<br />
This would be a fast-casting single target HP transfer AA for emergencies. VP isn't going to save anyone when he gets aggro in a KT group or in one of the GoD raids. A superfast heal might get the job done, though.</div></div><hr />

But honestly If you are too worried about hate Keep up the fast casting root. You get aggro root it and take a step back. Closest target = not you. and you don't have hate till root breaks. And that should be long enough for Tank to regain aggro unless of course you are using a poisen dot. If root doesnt land use Blind. Same thing. Attacks closest target that now is not you. <br />

&quot;Deserve&quot; is such a strange word in a game like this. &quot;Why do you deserve something more than me?&quot;. This question will invariably lead to a discussion of who puts the most effort into the game and some lunatics will even go as far as calling it work. This always ends up in a flamewar.<br />

Sure, you might benefit more from having it on your massive raids but that doesnt mean I couldnt use it.

Faern, I really don't know where this is coming from. Ideas get posted on message boards for input. I think you have taken this uber-vs.-casual persecution mania to a whole new level. I am not even that &quot;uber&quot; in the grand scheme of EQ progression (the real uber shaman are in Qvic+ atm). However, I am in a lot different spot than a level 64 shaman with 14 AA. Sorry, but the game does change a lot as you progress.<br />
<br />
My point wasn't that &quot;omgz I have Time access so I'm better than you&quot;. Rather, it was that it's kind of silly for a shaman who is at one of the sweet spots in our progression cycle to tell people who are further along what they do and don't need. I don't know how you can interpret my post as giving SOE an excuse to never fix anything. It's not like they need an excuse, since we've been pretty static for a long time.<br />
<br />
Every one of the ideas I suggested would be available to all shaman, regardless of flag status. The hardest things to get on that list are Daluda's Mending and Balance of the Nihil, and the runes for both of those drop in Vxed, a trial you can access without a single flag to your name.<br />

All that cumbayaa still doesn't change the fact that 90% of our spells are useless, upgrades what we get to other spells (i.e. &quot;mods&quot; to stat buffs) are also given out to other classes with similar spells, other classes will still have more utility, our slow is still just barely better then other slows and still is screwed up by mitigation and immunity to it, we still lack any utility, Can5 will still suck, our nukes are only good enough to kill gnolls in Blackburrow and our silly pet still doesn't have built-in SoW and innate dual wield skill.

Bleh to these changes, they don't change much anything, because other classes with whom we're comparing us here - clr, dru, bst, enc for example - get ALSO similar, same, if not better, upgrades and possibly new abilities, and we still remain where we are, with crappy buffs, AA's and abilities.

Just about the only *real* upgrade to the Shaman I play would be longer duration and / or shorter recast of ferine avatar (and that's a real stretch for an &quot;upgrade&quot;).<br />
<br />
Is the game I play different than a Shaman with Time and high end GoD access?  Hell yes it is!  I am *KING* in my content, seriously.  If you really don't think a Shaman is king of lower tier PoP (and every other expansion before it) you either a) haven't played that content with that level Shaman, b) don't know how to play a Shaman effectively, or c) wasn't geared/aa'd/levelled/experienced enough to play effectively.  I will start to lose the edge entering LDoN hard and Elementals.<br />
<br />
Considering my power playing my game, I would hate for that to be held against high end Shaman.  I would also hate to see some seriously marginal improvement to my game be made instead of a much needed improvement to a high end Shaman's game.<br />
<br />
Shaman didn't really acquire new skills through the expansions, just upgrades to what they already had, because we retained a high relative power among the classes from expansion to expansion.  That lack of growth manifested itself in the ugly monster that is high end PoP and GoD.  Now, it's difficult to improve Shaman because the encounters have changed dramatically and Shaman have not been given the proper improvements to scale with the content.  We had linear improvements where this new content demands significant changes.<br />
<br />
Do the high end Shaman's woes affect my game?  Nope.  Should my power affect a high end Shaman's game?  I hope not.  Do I feel sympathy and a desire to help aid their plight?  You bet I do!<br />
<br />
Do I play the same game?  Hell no.  Am I going to try and get a piece of their pie when I've already had my own?  Hell no.<br />
<br />
Until then, last time I checked, we both pay the same in monthly fees for our account. So fek off with your &quot;I play a different game and no bones need to be thrown to you lessers, but would you like to buy my cast-offs in the bazaar?&quot; selves.<br />
<br />
Ah, the monthly fee card!  OH NO!  There's obviously no way to refute that since the entire game is balanced on the monthly fee you pay...ya.  It's not as though some people play 200hours a month and others play 20 or anything.  Oh, but they should all have access to the same game content right?  If so, I would like my level 3 Magician to have res, a 2700 point nuke, SoW, and root since, after all, I pay my monthly fee just as those other people with big nukes, SoW, root, and res do.<br />
<br />
Oh wait, I forgot the game is progression based so wouldn't it be neat to have every character start in a zone that then connected to every single other zone in the entire game.  There would also be no access restrictions to these zones so any level 1 player can go in (gotta all have access to the same content remember).<br />
<br />
Then the level 1 player dies, dang!  Those mobs hit hard!  I guess I need to level, but wait, I can't do that without putting time into the game.  However, I pay my monthly fee, time shouldn't be a factor right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Lumor2000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">The original changes look pretty light on the cleric side compared to what we would get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Specter Aldonova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Gonna hit a few different points here and there...<br />
<br />
1.  Root CC does not work in higher end zones on a raid.  There's not enough room.  If you root it where you WERE and move, it's hitting the Clerics or other casters.  Big no no, cause those casters are now dead.<br />
<br />
2.  BoT as a heal works great AND efficiently.  I can use Cann5 while fighting an AE mob and still get back the hps I lost.  And, I wouldn't mind having more hps per tick, either.<br />
<br />
3.  I don't WANT to exp in BoT, SolRo Tower, PoEarth, PoWater, PoAir, PoFire.  You guys can HAVE that.  I want to exp in KodTaz and Yxxta and Tipt and Vxed and Ikkiniz trials and Qvic.....  Better exp AND loot there anyway.  40, 50, 60 hp augs, armor, spell runes, etc.  You guys who like BoT can keep all that ornate armor.<br />
<br />
4.  I can heal for a normal or hard LDoN just fine.  A few dps guildies and myself as healer and we are gtg.<br />
<br />
5.  All the changes listed I would take.  I agree that I think the Clerics get a bit short-changed in that list.  However, they have one spell we will never be able to compete with.  The ability to raise the dead.  That one ability will always give those classes who can do it top spot in a group.  Clerics, Paladins and Necromancers.  And, Clerics are the default choice for this.  However, if the Clerics want some sort of Holy Vengeance dot or something, fine.  Let em have it.  With a front end loaded DD.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:  One thing to add.  I would like the dot aggro to be fixed and the dots themselves to be scaled more in line with Wizard/Magician nukes.  The above changes would fix (or at least satisfy me) healing, but a DPS fix is also important.</div></div><hr />
