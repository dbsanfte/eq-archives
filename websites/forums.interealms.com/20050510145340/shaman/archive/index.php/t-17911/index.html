<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>AgrajagGarrgravarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, I've been trying GWs for a while, in order to get some of my lvl60 spells.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, THE DAMN THINGS WON'T SPAWN.  I've been there about 5 hours now with a group, killing the elder wyverns in the VP entrance, and I've yet to get a GW to spawn.<br />
<br />
Has something happened to the spawn rate, or am I just incredibly unlucky?  I feel bad pulling some of my friends to Skyfire for crappy XP when we've never seen a spawn.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nothing has happened to the spawn rate that I've heard.  They've always been extremely streaky.  Sometimes you can get 2-3 an hour and sometimes you won't see any for 5.  I would say you probably just had some bad luck.  At 61 you should really only need a 60+ melee partner to kill them so if some of the group get tired and leave don't give up if you still have a melee around.<br />
<br />
On the other hand I think you may be better off farming some plat, leveling to 65 and forgetting your 60 spells if that is an option for you.  The 65 spells are cheaper on my server anyway and your 60 spells won't really ever be used again once you get 65.  Also, with the spawn rate and rarity of the 60 spells dropping from a GW you'd be lucky to get malo or torpor after 30-40 GW kills which would take quite a long while.  Of course you could get extremely lucky and I certainly hope you do but don't count on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">GW suck as a source of spells.<br />
<br />
Too rare as spawn, and then reasonable spell drops off them are even more rare.  <br />
<br />
Once in a while some guy gets lucky, and then posts like it's not so bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Back in the day it was 183 GW's dead when I just stopped counting.<br />
<br />
But like 2 weeks ago We were clearing to a dragon in Vp and A GW in there did drop Torpor. <br />
<br />
So it can happen. Good luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Icklymuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">GW spawn on zone reset or 8 hours after death.<br />
Camping for GW is pointless, have your tracker zone in and check, if their up, great if not just come back... No point in sticking around really...<br />
Skyfire sucks for exp...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Complete your VP key.<br />
Hunt inside VP for your spells.<br />
You'll be done in about 1/100th the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd level in PoP until 65 and get those spells instead.  Or at least hunt in Sebilis for your spells, its much more fun.</div></div><hr />

If i remember right there is a spot in Skyfire where you can get them to spawn and keep spawning. I think they split or something and you need atleast a group or maybe 2 to keep up with them.I cant remember where it was, but im sure it was skyfire.  <br />
<br />
On a side note, i just took a week and farmed up plat in Seb and PoG and places like that and bought torpor.<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
<br />
<br />
I dunno if chardok B is stilla round, but that place is great XP and in the castle level 60 spells drops. Infact in that castle was the 1 and only time i ever saw Torpor drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I went on a soloing binge a while back, my goal was to solo a GW.  When I logged in I'd go check on the spawn.  If a GW was up, I'd pull it, if not I'd go about my regular business.  Sometimes I'd clear at the start of the night, gate and head back at the end of the night.  If you bind at a relatively safe spot in SF and use your spiritstone, this becomes a relatively easy chore.<br />
<br />
Thats said, if you're doing it just for the spells, farm the plat, odds are you'll get it before hell freezes over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Katiasky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I used to farm the GWs all the time (I've since given up, not even on my really boring days do I set foot there.)  I always took at least one person with me, just to not go crazy with boredom, and cause I always got my tail kicked without someone, (any class will do.)  Park over on the hill next to the VP entrance, and commence killing the three wyverns there, I used to get at least one GW an hour, sometimes none in three, sometimes all three spots would spawn GW.  But, no shaman spells ever dropped.  Got some wiz, beasty, druid and chanter ones, like every other wurm dropped a spell, just never any that I needed.  So I skipped Torpor and just leveled right up to Q, easy, better, faster that way, and you don't have the gruesome memories that are Skyfire :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mift atchou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Best bet is to get your VP key, every mob up there is a spell dropper and you can even gate out of the now. Spells seem to drop more frequently up in VP as well than down in skyfire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm not sure if you were doing this, but if you have a tracker be sure to track down all the wandering Elder Wyverns too.  All Elder Wyverns are ph's.  The wandering ones spawn around the VP entrance then take off.<br />
<br />
Another good source of 60 Kunark spells is Harla Dar in WW.  Not a difficult target for a couple groups depending on levels, and she drops a nice tally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Swiftfisted</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Are we talking about the same VP key that will take about 40-50 hours of camping, plus a trak tooth off trak?  Ummm no thanks.  I would level to 65 and get those spells. <br />
<br />
Really, waiting around for level 60 spells is not worth it anymore.<br />
<br />
On E'Ci Quiescence and Malos are actually half the price of Torpor and Malo.<br />
<br />
I'll say it again, lvl 60 spells are a waste of time.</div></div><hr />
