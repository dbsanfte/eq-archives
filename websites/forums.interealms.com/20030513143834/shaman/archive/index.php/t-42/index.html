<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Malkaven Maddness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">can anyone tell me where they got there dusty skulls?  I spent like 13 hours in the south wing non stop killing mobs.....i have about 30 glowing skulls and no dusty..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krodah Dirtnappah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">we were in East wing last night and we got a ton of Dusty skulls (lore)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Malkaven Maddness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">THX will try east again tonight</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sraxxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did get my Dusty Skull from the south wing. It seems to drop off the higher level critters - i.e. Undertaker skeletons, etc. It would likely be more common in the east wing, but is obtainable in the South.<br />
<br />
I tend to see about 1 every 90 minutes there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Daedric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I finished cudgel 6 and now I'm ready to start this.  Would it be possible for one group to have the skulls drop in an evening group?  It looks like it's gonna take some convincing to get a guild group to HS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Szlia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When I went to collect the skulls in South wing we had 4 glowing in like no time and we got the Dusty only when we were killing in the secret passage from South to East (from a guardian skel if I remember well).<br />
<br />
The next day, the first skell killed in south wing droped a dusty skull :P<br />
<br />
My guess: random weighted by mob level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Dusty are pretty rare in comparison, seemed to be about 1 dusty per 30-40 glowing ones.  Had to do the damn thing twice &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
South wing is decent spot for them, and great exp as well.  You'll need a 58+ puller, and a rogue for the doors, but otherwise a mid 50's group can probably hold that area decently well.</div></div><hr />
