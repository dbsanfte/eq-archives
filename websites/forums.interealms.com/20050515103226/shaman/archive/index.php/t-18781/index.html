<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ghobster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking through Everquest's official website last night about character name change, merging characters from different accounts into the same one, and moving characters from one server to another.<br />
<br />
It states that they will move your character from one server to a different one but all items and coins will be removed. Keep in mind, you are paying for this.<br />
<br />
Now, is it just me or does this just sound plain retarded? Why the hell would I PAY to move servers if my equipment were to be erased?<br />
<br />
I don't see the point in that other than a character that doesn't really have much equipment or coins and just want to move it just for its sheer levels gained and AA.<br />
<br />
Who the hell comes up with these ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Actully for $75 you can move to &quot;most&quot; servers with your gear now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ARghhh! $75!?  Well I guess I kind of dislike my server THAT much. Can you link me to where it says that because I don't see it anywhere :(.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ggrugnuuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">SOE wants to make more of a profit. I would get into it, but I'm sure if you thought about it long enough you could figure it out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I read in an article on a business website that SOE claimed to have made over one millions dollars on naked character moves and they had a 40% profit margin overall.<br />
<br />
It was on Business 2.0.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well they make a load of money on all accounts to start with. So many dollars for each active account each month. It's close to 500.000 active accounts as i have understood it. Perhaps the number has decreased but still... Thats millions every month!!!<br />
<br />
I dont know the server maintenance cost and the amount of all salaries the staff get, but you could wish for them to atleast sell us finished expansions and a little better customer support. And where did the GM events go?<br />
<br />
Edit: And regarding character transfers... 75 dollars for a few mouseclicks? Talk about business opportunity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">you cant blame them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There's a lot of gripe about this on my server (FV). Since we have a small population, and it's a &quot;newer&quot; server, a lot of people want to transfer here. We only have one guild in Time, and they just got there maybe 3 months ago, and one guild in the EP's. So, guilds on the crowded &quot;older&quot; servers see the potential to rake in the loot. They used to allow naked transfers, but that really wasn't a big deal to the uber guilds, because you keep your flags/keys, and with no competition in the EP's or even VT really, wouldn't take that long to gear back up. Now, however, they say they don't allow any transfers to FV, although this is a crock of ****. Honestly, it all depends on who you ask from SOE, because I know of a person who either has his character on FV as of today, or in the next day or so. Took him a few months of asking, but it happened. To be honest, I could care less if they allow them or not, but I would like a stable policy, not one based on &quot;if the CSR is in a good mood today&quot;</div></div><hr />
