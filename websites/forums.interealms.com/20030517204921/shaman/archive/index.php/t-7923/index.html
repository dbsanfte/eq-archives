<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Making this thread to gather information on methods and tactics for the Shaman going into the trial.<br />
<br />
That being said, I have seen a few theories on this a tried a few. It seems that group composition has the most effect on the results. So list some winning groups too.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have tried:<br />
<br />
War, Rog, Shaman, Wiz, Wiz, Cleric<br />
Made it to 4th wave mob 3<br />
<br />
Used tigirs to slow right next to the tanks and AE rained then. This is more efficient even on a single mob than our single blast especially since in knocks down the  HP of the others in the effect range. Be warned, use this only 2 time a wave or you won't have the mana to last at the end. When I was not doing damage, I was canabilizing and using torpor on myself.<br />
<br />
<br />
Got to go right now, but I will post my  other 2 failure later.<br />
<br />
Laters</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Fighting from the back right corner of the room helped my attempts because it kept people from running around wasting time getting to mobs and kept the mobs nice and condensed for switching.  Anything that puts seconds back on the clock is great.<br />
<br />
I slowed very little and used PR nukes to finish mobs.  Kraggs was great for the last fight too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think Ice Strike is better to use here than Blast of Venom. BoV is 680 dmg for 340 mana, while IS is 675 dmg for 250 mana. I've very rarely had an Ice Strike get resisted there. If you can, get some mage focus items before the trial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1. AE Slow ONE time after all the mobs are bunched. This gets aggro on you and reduces the number that jump the cleric when they heal. Don't waste the mana for another cast.<br />
<br />
2. Cast ONE Torrent of Poison or Tears of Saryn, whichever you have.<br />
<br />
3. Assist the melee assigned as MT and hit each mob with ONE or at most 2 faster cast DD. Blast of Venom works nicely.<br />
<br />
4. On the 4th mob of each wave, cast Blast of Venom once and then start regaining mana.<br />
<br />
On the final wave(4th) try to be as stingy as you can with mana, you will need it to help heal. Only nuke when it looks like one of the mobs might not die fast enough. Be ready for the Boss.<br />
<br />
The group I had when we did this:<br />
<br />
Monk<br />
Monk<br />
Rogue<br />
Ranger<br />
Shaman<br />
Cleric<br />
<br />
All were level 60-63, and at the time I had none of the really helpful Shaman spells. Took us a bit to figure out the best way to win (There were zero groups in line, and no one in the room, so I believe we were one of the early groups to complete this trial), but when we finished it, we were far from hurting. Picked up a few parchments and a few items also.</div></div><hr />
