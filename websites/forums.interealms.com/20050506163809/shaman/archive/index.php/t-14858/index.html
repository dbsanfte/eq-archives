We have killed quite a few EP mobs and silk seems to drop like candy. We got a few plate and zero chain or leather.<br />
<br />
Are some planes more common for chain?</div></div><hr />

I'm guessing it's just luck.   Plate is most common, followed by silk/chain/leather.   Leather/silk usually starts to rot first from what I'm told.  The problem with plate is it's usually 50+% of a guild and gets less than 1/3 the drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not sure what server you are from but plate is hardly the most common.   Silk and Leather are most common by far, then plate, and then chain on Brell and most other servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Plate is the rarest for us, which is stupid because there's 5 plate classes, including the 2 most important, warrior/cleric. Leather is our most common, followed closely by chain.<br />
<br />
Same thing with earth ring event bracers, the chain/leather ones drop a lot, the plate ones are really rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">still having problems getting chain drops for us....right after the patch before last our chain drop went up considerably that day..but haven't seen barely anything ever since.  Right now, all of the leather recruits are in at least 3 elemental pieces and another recruit just got the leather pants...which is saying that me as a recruit does not have any chain pieces yet..which means that the reg members are still even fighting over the bracers.  Far far too rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">drop rate is ok for us.<br />
Sure some class are missing some part more than other (plate boots, leather helm, chain bracer for example for us) but with over 1000 drop (elemental armor + toys) the % of chain / plate / silk / leather is ok (maybe a bit too much leather tho)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Chain drops of raiding last 14 days in EPs: 3!<br />
But about 80% of the mobs droped 1 or 2 leather pattern. We even had 1 or 2 days where EVERY mob droped at least 1 leather pattern. Next common drop after leather were silk followed by plate.<br />
<br />
I wish there would be a chance to convert the pattern like give leather pattern and 1 or 2k to a NPC and you get chain / silk / plate (depending on person who does it) back.</div></div><hr />
