<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone else tried this new instanced zone in nedaria?<br />
<br />
ZI is in the bearcaves by the Taelosian npc. Click the stone to zone in.<br />
<br />
You get the dz by talking to an npc by the docks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Exp is pretty bad but you get 16-18pp per kill, and they're pretty weak for lvl64-65 mobs. It's mostly a zone for showing off the new bat and rat models though.</div></div><hr />

and I hadnt heard anything about this area yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, you probably need a group. All the rats, bats and golems assist each other so it's pretty hard to get singles.<br />
<br />
There's a high-elf npc standing at the docks that hands out the instance. Go talk to the Taelosian in the bearcaves first though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The zone was also really really laggy for me. I was getting 6-10 fps when I went in by myself to look around and I don't usually go below 30 on full raids.<br />

<br />
Don't need a group, unless you have a video card with DX9 features, the zone looks like muddy and washed out, and is laggy as all get out. (Link goes to screenshot proof from yours truly)<br />
<br />
Additionally, they seem to be using a different file extension on new zone files... using .eqg instead of .s3d</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I had alook at the new zone a few days ago. It did have a sort of bleached quality about. The lag was horrendous, so I gated out shortly after arriving (took a while before the cursor could get to the gate gem  :( ). If this is the graphics system they are going to use for OoW I can see that there are going to be a lot of very unhappy campers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Judging by most of the comments on here and on forums link goes to it looks like SoE may have been trying to show off to people how wonderful their new gfx system is but after all the comments about lag etc looks like they may have shot themselves in the foot again :).<br />

Since theyre busy hammering out bugs from expansions years old and still have lots to be done im beginning to think that maybe all servers are test servers. Sucks we have to pay to beta test supposedly finished products.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Why restrict it to Test server though? Does having this zone available affect our game play? If ya don't want to go, don't. This zone's been live since the last patch and I didn't even know it existed till today. <br />
<br />
Put it live on all servers = more feedback. That's always a good thing. ;)<br />
<br />
Test Server is there for testing new stuff that will affect game play. New abilities, spells, new graphics for the entire game (EG. Spell effects) etc...</div></div><hr />

you just answered yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">For those experiencing a lot of lag when visiting this zone, there appears to be a bug in the code (surprise surprise) which requires you to force a graphics mode update. This can be done by ALT+ENTER to drop to windowed mode, and then back again to full screen, or else go into your options screen and switch to another resolution and then back again. Of course, after leaving the instance, I had to camp and come back in as no NPC would respond to my hails etc. (was on bard, so couldn't just gate out to see if simply zoning would fix it)<br />
<br />
Personally, on a fairly average system (1.6P4, 1Gig RAM, 128MB Ti4200) I found it quite smooth moving through the zone after doing the above.  I didn't think there was anything to really &quot;oooh&quot; and &quot;aaah&quot; over, (maybe my card doesn't show all the nifty new stuff?) but it didn't seem any worse performance-wise than the current system; *maybe* slightly better. <br />
<br />
I am withholding judgement until I see how it can perform in a large open zone such as Barindu, which is about the only zone I really find troublesome to move around in these days, although Kod'Taz is a little jerky in places. (I run all old models only).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Sucks we have to pay to beta test supposedly finished products.  :(<br />
<br />
Grwing tired of hearing this. No offense to you Vig, but your the one i guess i have to address it on.<br />
<br />
EQ is not a finished product. The point of EQ is that its not supposed to be a finished product, hence the name &quot; EverQuest &quot;. Everyone wants new content, new things and when SoE pumps it out for you in such the rush its demanded, we bitch cause its not a polished peace of perfection.<br />
<br />
I challange anyone that thinks making these games is easy, to do something simple like maping levels for quake3 or coding anything for openGL ( a full game ). These things are massivly complex and there is so many lines of code its insane and it only takes 1 mistype to fubar something up and you might not see the typo till it affects something on someone obscure system. These games have to run on mutiple configurations, from tnt2's to ATI 9800 whatevers, from p2 400's to 3.3 ghz systems of different chipsets, cross many driver bases and well. Its such a massivly complex thing that getting upset about something not working isnt the right response.<br />
<br />
<br />
However them not fixing anything once they find out the problem is.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, just had to finaly get that off my chest, nothing against you Vig, it was more directed at the 100+ posts ive read in the past from people that just didnt understand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Litgruv<br />
<br />
I have been playing FFXI for a while now. They have fewer patches and next to no issues. Im not asking for EQ to be a perfect game, but some of the things we have put up with during 4 years is depressing in comparision.<br />
<br />
Square has a long tradition of quality that Verant lacks. In the end i think verant would be better off if they took a margin of their earnings and hired a few more skilled coders and modellers to fix all the issues.<br />
<br />
Everquest is however still a great game. It just makes me sad that the amount of annoyances take away some of the enjoyment.<br />
<br />
(edit: My 2 hand blunt animation is a great example)<br />
<br />
Peace :)</div></div><hr />

Peace :)<br />

You also forget that EQ is based off a 5 year old graphics engine that hasnt been built from scratch but is being patched together and rebuilt on the fly. Not to mention EQ is a lil more diverse and just larger in general then FFXI.<br />
<br />
Like i said, i feel you pain, and like i also said, its not really directed at you so dont take offense, but some people  ( not saying you ), just dont grasp how hard it is to do what SoE does. Some people think that just cause they go &quot; hey SoE there is a problem in zone &quot; That all things just magicaly get fixed. No, they dont. They have to be searched out and troubleshot and be done on top of all the changes they are doing right now to try to keep us all from leaving.,<br />
<br />
No EQ isnt perfect, yea other games might be smoother cause they are newer and yea the guy that neg rep me cause of my comment above is a retard that doesnt get it. All those are true, but my only point is that some people might be missing how hard it really is. <br />
<br />

First off, im not feeling offended so dont worry. :)<br />
<br />
Secondly:<br />
<br />

<br />
This might be one of the reasons they have problems. They still have to make old world eq useable by those (i doubt any though) who bought it and is running with no expansions.<br />
<br />
I couldnt really say if EQ is more diverse or not. It's definetly more complex, atleast now after 5 years. But since they have a larger player base that would mean that they can safely invest percentually MORE money into bug fixing than a game with a lesser player base.<br />
<br />
Like i said, i feel you pain, and like i also said, its not really directed at you so dont take offense, but some people ( not saying you ), just dont grasp how hard it is to do what SoE does. <br />
<br />
Yes its hard, but they are and want to remain actors on the ever toughening MMORPG market. If i ran a MMORPG company i would fix old content before releasing new. Even if we all buy the expansions like sheep, quality should be a priority if they want to remain at the top. But it's their product. I only play if i want their product.<br />
<br />
Some people think that just cause they go &quot; hey SoE there is a problem in zone &quot; That all things just magicaly get fixed. No, they dont. They have to be searched out and troubleshot and be done on top of all the changes they are doing right now to try to keep us all from leaving.<br />
<br />
We pay a monthly regular fee to finance the game being improved. Expanding isnt always improving as many who think Velious was the top tend to say.<br />
<br />
We should however give them a pat on the back for wanting to repair every broken thing that bother us. But i will not throw flowers under their feet because they are only doing so now because the competition makes it nessecary to try and keep every customer. There are bugs years old.<br />
<br />
I have no idea how they will go about it when they launch the next expansion. All the expansions up until now have meant countless repatching, remaking and lots and lots of irritation. My favourite examples are: Tribute system. They should have been able to forsee that. Also the Rathe Council encounter. How many times did they retune it? Did they even let a beta-guild test it?<br />
<br />
All my respect to Verant and EQ for making a game that has kept me absorbed for 4 years. During my peak years EQ would be on my mind when i went to bed and during all my work days. We used to talk EQ at work me and my Paladin workmate.<br />
<br />
Still. Selling us unfinished products (expansions) is bad business. Car dealers dont sell us broken down cars they say they might or might not fix within the next 6 months.<br />
<br />
If they put quality into what they do they might keep a few of us around for a long time yet. But not if they ONLY want to milk us for money. They have to have a product that stands up to the competition or they need to cut on the monthly fee.<br />
<br />
Interesting discussion btw Lit :)<br />
<br />
(edit: Ofcourse its hard. But nobody is forcing them to strive and keep their top position. If i didnt care for EQs future i wouldnt bitch about it. EQ concerns me.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a software developer myself, I'm going to disagree with this.  It isn't that hard, and I can virtually guarantee you that the developers already know about 75% of the bugs we see day to day, but can't spend time fixing them, because management has already filled their plate with unreasonable deadlines for new content.<br />
<br />
Every software job I've ever had, management seems to be fundamentally ignorant of the &quot;holy trinity&quot; of software development--features, quality, and cost.  You can't increase any one part of the equation without sacrificing something else.  You want more features without sacrificing quality?  Well, it's going to cost you more.  You want more features without increasing cost (the most typical demand)--well, that's going to mean a lot of bugs.  Seems pretty simple, doesn't it?<br />
<br />
However, the overwhelming trend in software these days, whether you're in gaming development, or operating systems, is to push more features out the door as quickly as possible because in the minds of management, &quot;features&quot; == &quot;sales&quot;.<br />
<br />
We're finally getting to the point in EQ where the customers aren't buying it anymore.  Literally.<br />

<br />
I think you hit the nail on the head here.<br />
<br />
Im pretty sure all the game designers and coders are more than capable of hammering out any bugs, but the company management wont let them aslong as there is a big bag of cash waiting around the next corner... after all, running a company is about making money...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Shiuna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Well, I visited the Forgotten Halls last night. I have 2Ghz pentium 4, 1G memory, ati 9800 pro w/128MB, DSL. According to EQPlayNice I was getting about 20 fps. At the time I was also running another instance of EQ in the background using EQWindows.<br />
<br />
The color scheme was southwestern, lots of sandstone, turquoise, and orange. I did find one room with a shiny floor, and the reflections were a very nice effect. Couldn't see myself, though. Animations seemed pretty smooth, the rats were rattier, and the bats were battier. Apparently the rats have fleas, because they kept scratching behind their ears, like dogs. There were lots of wandering guardians and tunjas, and noone seemed to be concerned with my exploring.<br />
<br />
I've been experimenting with single-pulling with our lowest-level pet, so I tried it on the rat room. The rats hit for a max of 624. Pet went down before I could even click the backoff key, and the whole room came after me...which leads to my next bit of information...your corpse is dumped next to the Taelosian in the bear cave :eek:<br />
<br />
I seem to remember a large room with guardians spaced around the wall, which might be a better place to try fighting. I'm down to 1 blue bubble death buffer into 65, so its time to beef that up before I try again (unless I can find a rez in Nedaria....try to explain how you got killed there at level 65  :p ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I went there again last night to try out the changing display thing. First zoneing in I could barely move because of the lag, but it improved after I did ctrl Enter twice. It was still kind of laggy though, similar to the sort of lag I usually see in zones with lots of trees.<br />
<br />
I don't know if anyone else has this problem, but it seems that mouse control becomes very &quot;soft&quot; in zones with lots of trees, particularly in kunark. It seems strange because the display appears to update relatively smoothly, its not the sort of choppy display you see with video lag. Places like WW and FV for example. I see the same sort of thing in Nedaria. This is with a new 3.2Mhz system, 1GB ram and an nVidia 5200 card. I remember that on my old system (1.8 MHz, 500 MB ram, Geforce 3 Ti500) was a lot smoother in those zones prior to DX9.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>junaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The problem with management is most work of the 80-20 rule.  If 80 percent seems to be working, release it and worry about the other 20 percent later.  At least that is what they keep telling me in all the management courses I've been on.  I'm not saying that it is wise or even correct, but that is the stance that most managers take now-a-days.  I think the problem we have with SoE is that once 80 percent is working they forget that they have 20 percent more to fix.  If its a big issue (affects game play.. or exploit of some kind) they fixed it right then and there.  But if it's small it gets over looked for the next expansion that will be coming out in 6 months.<br />
<br />
In the Case of GoD they are just returning the content now to make it more playable.  To the best of my knowledge no one had made it all the way through the GoD content yet (and by that I mean killing the end bosses in the last zone of the expansion).  Then after that are the extra quests that can be done/found.  But we still have a new expansion coming in the next 2 months.  Is it really necessary to get that expansion before the previous content is complete?  Maybe.. but then that leaves the possibility for content to go unused.  <br />
<br />
I would rather seem them resolve the geometry problem that seems to have occurred since DX9 before I see a new expansion.  I really hate getting stuck on rocks or seeing mobs that are half in the floor.  That in my books should be top priority over a new expansion that will introduce more bugs and patches to resolve more issues.</div></div><hr />
