The night I got my epic I also dinged out of the ever so hellish 54 into 55.<br />
The cool part was that it happened at the exac same time :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hehe -- I always wanted to ding 60 by doing the bonechip quest (in Field of Bone) or the Wine Quest (in Neriak).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hahahaha Soupy, you just gave me the idea of how I'm gonna ding Venerable.  Time to collect some bone chips.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Had put a , after chips instead of a .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dang, that's the way I should have done it.<br />
<br />
NICE xp at 54 for getting the SoF... I got like two blues out of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The best Dinging Story I've heard to date was a Cleric off my server...  when he was a few pixels from 60 he was in an XP camp and purposely died.. then sat there beside his unrezzed corpse for about 2 hours XPing like crazy.   Then, he rezzed himself so that he would ding 60 &quot;While doing what his class does&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I fell 1.5 blues from dinging to 55 when I completed my epic.  The next night some guildies deprived themselves of sleep making sure I finished it off and dinged.  Epic is great exp ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Congrats - I dinged 57 on hand in for my spear :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Couldn't see anything it was to dark, COUGH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i thought it would be cool to ding 60 by turning in my noobie note, but i had already turned it in =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I did the exact same thing, dinged 55 when I turned in the scale and got my spear.  I didn't save the screen shot tho.<br />
