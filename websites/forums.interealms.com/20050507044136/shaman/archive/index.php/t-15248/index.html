<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jayzan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just realized the other day that my pet could use weapons.  I knew that mage pets could and I think I gave the lvl 29 pet a weapon once but he just ate it and didn't use it. So I just assumed they couldn't use pets.  But I gave a Cane of the Tranquil to my dog (55 SoH) and he started 1hb'ing stuff to death.  I could definately tell the difference. <br />
<br />
Is there a limit to what the Lvl 55 (Spirit of Howler) can do with weapons?  Can he DW? <br />
<br />
Last I heard they were not effected by the Delays of the weapons, is that true?<br />
<br />
Also,  I read on here that they could use weapons with procs.  I've seen beastlords dogs procing away, but I thought it was their spell buffs that made them do that (in bstlords case).<br />
<br />
If you put a Club of the Ice Ocean in it's hand will it proc for 300DD ?<br />
<br />
Any Tips?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pets cannot equip nodrop weapons or 2hs weapons. They will DW if you give them two 1 handed droppable weapons.<br />
<br />

<br />
That's true, I'm 99% sure damage does not effect it either with the exception of blam sticks from pom<br />

<br />
That's their pet buff.<br />

 <br />
If it's high enough level to proc it, it will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well bit more info about your pet and the weapons we feed them....<br />
<br />
Any 1 handed weapon that is droppable = Pet will use<br />
Any 2 handed weapon = Pet will NOT use <br />
Any No Drop weapon = Pet will NOT use<br />
Armor* = Pet will use ( Head, Face, Hands, Feet, Chest, Back, Wrists, Shoulder )<br />
<br />
Equipment slot restrictions do matter ( example: Sarnak Parrying Blade (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6840) in Secondary slot only)<br />
Any Class or Race restrictions on weapons/armour do not matter.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dly - Does not effect<br />
Dmg - Does effect (Only if greater then natural damage modifier)<br />
Effect - Does effect (Only if pet level is higher then weapon Proc level)<br />
Str** - Does effect (Increases Pets Average damage per hit)<br />
Dex** - Does effect (Increases Pets Proc rate)<br />
Agi** - Does effect (Marginal depending on the amount increased to effect the AC ussually not really worth it but can be at times)<br />
Sta** - Does not effect (By most popular Opinion it has ZERO effect)<br />
Int** - Does not effect (By most popular Opinion it has ZERO effect)<br />
Wis** - Does not effect (By most popular Opinion it has ZERO effect)<br />
Chr** - Does not effect (By most popular Opinion it has ZERO effect)<br />
AC** - Does effect (Marginal depending if it pushes pets AC over a AC threshold)<br />
HP** - Does effect<br />
Mana** - Does effect (Our pet really does not use any mana so no real use for our pet)<br />
<br />
*NOTE: I know for a fact pets equip Mage summoned armor. (Huge tanking ablity increase) With that information I would hazard to guess they would follow the same rules for equiping armour as they do for Weapons. (Example: Will not equip no drop armor)<br />
<br />
**NOTE: It really does not matter what causes the change in stats be it weapon, spell, or Armor they affect the pet the Same<br />
<br />
The biggest thing to keep in mind is our pets unlike all other classes pets will not duel weld unless forced to by making them equip a weapon in thier secondary slot.  The easist way to do this is by giving them two cheep weapons Rusty Weapons work very well for this.  Though if you gave them a secondary only weapon they would equip that weapon and would duel weld from there out.  Just be careful about giving them Primary only weapons as they will not equip them unless that is the first weapon you gave them.  From the best of my knowledge will not unequip a weapon to equip a primary only weapon.<br />

<br />
Personal Note:  I wounder if pets can use focus items to increase proc amounts and other things.  Some one should give that a try out and post the results.</div></div><hr />
