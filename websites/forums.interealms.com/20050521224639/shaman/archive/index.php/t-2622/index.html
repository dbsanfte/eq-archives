<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mooshfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">H'los. I've been looking for this particular beatstick, Dathor Great Hammer, for sometime now. <br />

Dathor Great Hammer   <br />
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM  <br />
Damage: 74<br />
Delay: 95 <br />
Ratio: 1.283 Amazing <br />
AC: +2 Str: +15 Sta: +15 HP: +100  <br />

Weapon Skill: Two Hand Blunt <br />
Classes: Beastlord Ranger Shaman Druid Cleric Paladin Shadowknight Monk Warrior  <br />
Races: All Races  <br />
<br />
As yoo can see, it makes an excellent pvp weapon for jousting and also a nice in-between-jbb-casts thing. It drops off a Shak Dathor Warlord, I've killed him once and have wondered how rare the hammer is? If anyone has camped him? And if he wields the Hammer if he has it. It seems quite rare because:<br />
<br />
A. Hardly anyone hunts in Umbral Planes.<br />
B. Because I think its rare =D (Only 1 known hammer on my server)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Now why would they make a 16stone weapon, and have it monk useable?<br />
<br />
and what monk would ever use it =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, monks do get additional leeway with their weight as they gain levels.  I think they get an additional ten pounds by level 60 (could be wrong!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its good in duels and using riposte disc, for monks. Friend the monky had to run through DN and spawned a beetle trap, he just riposte disced it and killed all but one.  Its also good in duels cause you hit anywhere from 300-500 and wont kill yourself from an oppents disc, but yeah otherwise its just a toy, but a fun toy :)</div></div><hr />

Because VI likes to torture the monk population.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've killed 3 warlords and gotten 3 of the int rings. I havent 'camped' him, just killed him when he was up after patches, so I dont know how tough he is to force to spawn.<br />
Hammer seems rather rare but that could just be randomness not in my favor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
exactly why every time i look at an item on allakazams, theres always a post saying &quot;MONK ITEM&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
And i didnt know Monks gained the addiotional leeway? thats pretty handy.  In anycase it would kill their sta or whatever, not really worth it other then the disc's that were mentioned</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ms. Skyshrine Hottie is right ;)<br />
<br />
A lvl 60 monk starts losing AC as he hits the 25.0 weight mark.<br />
<br />
<br />
on the STA issue: it has been parsed numerous times that, if your STA is above 100, having an empty fatigue bar will have no effect besides one: you can't jump any more (whoop-de-do).<br />
<br />
I still don't think I'd want this... &quot;thing&quot; ... except for dueling, and to show off high crits ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mooshfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As I stated above, its a PVP weapon :P Prolly means more to me than you because I like to be prepared for...situations..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Halor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">But would this be a good weapon to use with the Rabid Bear AA skill?  If not, what would you prefer?<br />
<br />
<br />
Halor Frostvalor<br />
60 Shaman (Eternal Rage)<br />
Torvonnilous</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mooshfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Because Rabid Bear lasts a short bit of time I wouldn't really use this weapon because it's clearly a delay kiting/jousting tool, as well as a jbb weapon. For Rabid Bear, I think I would use the best 2hand Ratio weapon which is the Bone of Bertoxxulous I believe? Or if you have an unbelievable proc on your weapon its also a choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I also can see the worth of this weapon.<br />
<br />
How tuff is the warlord?  What's required to kill him?  where does he live?  Details would be nice, as UP is a large place and not very safe to explore.  Is he a one group mob?  And is a cleric mandatory?<br />
<br />
As for the delay issue.  Hmm.  Self buffed to 50% haste . . plus a haste belt with 17% haste.  That's all the haste I can manage.  Rabid Bear gives 100% haste, which is the cap unless you got vah shir bard song.  Still, with 100% haste it would only be a delay 46 weapon.  In friggen credible hits prolly would make it worth using with Rabid Bear.  Imagine a Double attack for 500's.  It could happen.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Warlord I 'think' can pop in place of any shak dathor. All 3 times I pulled him to the area just past Vex Thal entrance; nothing seems to patrol there. I think he was lvl 58 or 59. I killed him with me (60shm) and my 2box 59warrior all 3 times I fought him. Might be able to solo him but I havent tried since I have my big 'pet' available.<br />
<br />
I pulled with malo, and slow went on easy after that. Have to coax mobs into that area slowly or they will run off and bring adds. The pathing is fugly/nonexistent but the area is fairly safe once you get pulls there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Fixing some math errors that got posted above.  Base: 74/95.  67% haste: 74/57.  100% haste: 74/48.  I'm rounding up, and I doubt that it's possible to tell whether the .5 delay (.05 s) is actually counted or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Mooshfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I pulled with malo, and slow went on easy after that.  <br />
<br />
I've killed him once, attempted twice (needed to evac once). Was just me and a druid, the problem was, it took 9, NINE slow attempts to finally land AFTER Malo was applied, the second time was mroe pleasant, took only 2 attempts. I bought a tash stick for this purpose hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Durnitol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I thought that hammer dropped off RC?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Little off topic on the monk stuff.<br />
<br />
level 1 - 14wt<br />
level 15 - 15wt<br />
level 30 - 16wt<br />
level 45 - 17wt<br />
level 51 - 18wt<br />
level 55 - 20wt<br />
level 60 - 24wt<br />
<br />
Staying under the cap is relatively easy with the really nice monk stuffs being naturally light. Monks whine about it too much because they don't want to give up that 10wt TStaff. Can't really blame them. I wouldn't want to give it up either.<br />
<br />
LOOOTS of better monk ratio weapons out there anyway. Pretty much strictly PvP or disc oriented.<br />
<br />
Even if you had one... you'd only &quot;whiff&quot; once every 10 seconds instead of every 3-4, and you'd be putting your &quot;Saved from the Glue Factory&quot; horse out of business.</div></div><hr />
