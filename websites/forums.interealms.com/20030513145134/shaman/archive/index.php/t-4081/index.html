<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nidalap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,  last week I was able to kill Lord Ghiosk and got the 3 books from him (woot).  I did the turn-in and got the usual &quot;next step of quest&quot; message from the Spirit and got the FACTION ADJUSTMENT.  I noticed I didn't receive any EXP (probly because I'm 60 :D ). After much relief (getting exicted), I noticed I was invised (dohhh).  <br />
<br />
My guild will be doing my Hole part very soon.  Question is did I get the RIGHT faction adjustment when I did the turn-in while invised? Has anyone had this kind of problem before?  Any answer is very much appreciated.   Thanks :) <br />
<br />
FYI : I didn't skip or redo any step so far.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lumppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This has got to be the easiest part of the quest to do because the books rot so often. What I would do is just get another set of the books and redo it to make sure I got the faction hit. It is easy to camp an alt in CoM and log on every so often to see if any one is in there killing and ask if the books are going to rot.</div></div><hr />
