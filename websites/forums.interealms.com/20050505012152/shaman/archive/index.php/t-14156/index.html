<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caelum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just reached 29th, and I looked at my base HPs.<br />
<br />
Unbuffed and unequipped, I come a bit shy of 600 HPs.<br />
<br />
Level 29 Barbarian Shaman with 105 STA.<br />
<br />
Is this normal?  It seems a bit low to me.  But then, maybe I'm just paranoid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Braxton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You are doomed, you have gimped your character, reroll it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That is exactly where you, and anyone else that is a shaman with 105 STA would be at without gear on, you can't change that.   What you can change is the gear that you have at that level, and since you didn't list your gear or Magelo there isn't much I can comment on about that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If it makes you feel any better, at 65 and nekkid, I have 1300 hp. I believe my bast sta is 100, so your hp sound &quot;normal&quot; for your level. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">as a barbarian, at 65 and naked, I have 1400 hps naked.<br />
But then again, I have Natural Durability 3 AA skill tho, which accounts for the difference between me and Donar.  Racial differences mean close to nothing at 65, cept faction reasons, and personal preference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have always wanted to reroll and be an Ogre.  Why?  Because of the STA!!! Well guess what? I rolled my current character with 75 sta.  Ogre shamans with max sta at time of rolling have 150.  I have 75 less natural stamina than an ogre that I wanted to roll.<br />
<br />
With my current gear, and with boar, I have 277 sta.  Talk about races not mattering.  Now that PoP is out, it just doesn't matter anymore.  My guilds main tank on 90% of our raids is a gnome warrior.  It just doesn't matter anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Asyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">AHhahaah<br />

Love your sig Gooch !</div></div><hr />
