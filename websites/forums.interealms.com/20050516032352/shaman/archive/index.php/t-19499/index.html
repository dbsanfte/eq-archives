<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>umpaa_the_prophet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know what the minimum level you can have in a group 65's to still get the full points for a LDoN adventure? I know I grouped with a 64 once and got full points but I'm not sure what the level minimum is to get the 51 (normal) points.<br />
<br />
UMP!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">To get &quot;full points&quot; (meaning level 65 adventure points):<br />
<br />
The group as a whole must average 63.0 or higher<br />
<br />
<br />
So - if you have 5 level 65's in the group and then add the lowest level that can accept an adventure with them (57 or 58 or 59, forget which) you will average more than 63.0, and you will get the &quot;full points.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The flip side is that, if you want to get the next easier level of adventure, you need a group that averages less than 63.0.  For example, if you have a couple of level 59's ya want to take through an adventure, and decide to play it safe by getting the level 60 adventure, then don't add too many level 65's to fill out the group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
65+65+65+58+58+58 = 369 / 6 = 61.5 avg level (will be level 60 dungeon)<br />
<br />
65+65+65+65+58+58 = 376 / 6 = 62.67 avg level (will be level 60 dungeon)<br />
<br />
63+63+63+63+63+62 = 377 / 6 = 62.83 avg level (will be level 60 dungeon)<br />
<br />
63+63+63+63+63+63 = 378 / 6 = 63.0 avg level (will be level 65 dungeon)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Or for the mathematically challenged (i use that method ...), just go start calculating from a full level 65 group with 6 members.<br />
<br />
Now you can 'afford' 12 level decreases (counting all group members together) and still be in a 65 dungeon. Hit number 13 and you will go in the lower level version.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So if a party with an average level of 63 will get a level 65 dungeon, what does a party of level 53s get?  At what levels do the dungeons scale up in difficulty?  Is it when the party level averages 48, 53, 58, 63?  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lunira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm curious as to how the number of players in your group can effect the dungeon?  Say going in with 4 people instead of 6?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Number of people seems to have 0 effect. Also the 12 levels thing only works with full groups of 6. With less people it's lower. Also if your group does have a lower average you can select hard to bump it up one level of difficulty. So if you have an average of say 61 but still think you can handle the normal 65 dungeon select hard and you'll get it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Have some experience with this as most of my current shaman's leveling time has been in LDON.<br />
<br />
The only thing that seems to affect the dungeon difficulty is the group's average level and whether the dungeon is normal or hard. 4 person groups get the same number of mobs etc. as 6 person groups. I don't notice fewer mobs with less people or more mobs with a full group.<br />
<br />
As for what average level do you get the 'next hardest' dungeon at, its either x2.5/x7.5 or x3/x8, not positive on which. So doing a hard dungeon at 53(get the level 60 dungeon)/58(get the level 65 dungeon)/63 (get the 65 hard(70) dungeon) is really a pain, doing them at 52/57/62 is much easier. At 51 in a hard most mobs con blue/even with the nameds conning even/yellow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I often 4box an LDoN with a 65 Pal, 65 Shm, 65 Mage, and 63 Chanter.  I have always gotten full points on a win (51) and full points on a &quot;missed&quot; completion (12).<br />
<br />
The only thing I have noticed with 4 people is that it's a lot harder to complete the quest on time and I seem to get 5 rescues, to 1 of each of the other kinds when I try for an adventure.  I never take anything but mass kill and collect though, as non of my chars have track.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have three level 53 characters.  If I 3-box an adventure, what would the dungeon difficulty be?  That's what I don't quite understand - at what level does the dungeon difficulty ramp up?  Level 50?  51?  52?  53?  etc.<br />

53+53+53/3 = 53, so you would get a level 55 adventure. 23/28/33/38/43/48/53/58/63 are the average group levels at which the dungeon jumps up to the next difficulty level.</div></div><hr />

Mage eye &gt;&gt;&gt; track anyways. I can't count how many times a tracker has tried to bring us in the wrong direction by not paying attention to maps and such while my wife already knows exactly where to find the target.</div></div><hr />
