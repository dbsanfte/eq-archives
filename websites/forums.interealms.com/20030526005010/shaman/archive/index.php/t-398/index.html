<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">UPDATE: You can find the new thread and details here (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=12590) <br />
<br />
<br />
A guide to mobs that can be slowed, with thanks to Nixx for the inspiration and kicking off part 1 (parts 1 and 2 no longer exist).<br />
<br />
http://www.dith.demon.co.uk/slows/<br />
<br />
Please post any additions and corrections and I will update accordingly.<br />
<br />
It is assumed that magic, disease debuffs are cast - Malo(sini) / Tash, Insidious Decay etc.<br />
<br />
Please state where relevant:<br />
<br />
-The name of the mob<br />
-The zone<br />
-If you managed to slow the mob with Turgurs<br />
-If you managed to slow the mob with Plague of Insects (Turgurs bounces)<br />
-If the mob gives the immune to changes in attack speed message (client message)<br />
- Mob does not give immune message but to all intents and purposes appears to be unslowable.<br />
<br />
Please do not post 'my mate slowed soandso' unless you have it on very good authority, first hand experience is the most useful! Screenshots of contested (in terms of being slowable, not popular) mobs yawning are appreciated!</div></div><hr />

General V'Ghera, general consensus in other threads has been that he is unslowable, have had one or two who've said he is slowable hence being listed as under contention. I want a screenshot of him yawning ideally.<br />
<br />
Sev - similar to other Kunark dragons, not immune, still contention over slowable or not. Might be time to discuss the Kunark dragons again. Anyone slowed one recently? Personally I've never stuck slow on on any of them but I havent tried particularly hard, they're normally dead rather quickly.</div></div><hr />

I'd mark him and Gorenaire dreadlands (also not listed) as unslowable. **<br />
Technically they aren't immune, but they are essentially 100% magic resistable and you won't be getting it on them. <br />
Same for disease slow.<br />
Especially since they can die in 15secs with crazy manaburning wizards.<br />

Some are slowable, some are not.  Apparently it depends on what level they spawn as.  But they are indeed slowable, if it spawns as the right level.<br />
<br />
I'll try and get a screenshot next time we get down there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, Dark Sendings in Griegs End vary. Some are slowable, some are not.  I know for a fact that sometimes they will spawn as immune, and sometimes, usually, you can slow them.</div></div><hr />

You're thinking of the 2 spawns in the sequence right before the Burrower Parasite.  Yes those 2 can spawn at lvl60 (slowable version) or lvl 61 (immune to slow version)<br />
<br />
The final worm is always immune to slow, and hits for Avatar of War like power.<br />

Hehe, I think we had a miscommunication.  I was originally only talking about the Burrower itself so I thought you were saying sometimes he could or could not be slowed, sorry.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Shalara De'Tan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Bustyn - Been a bit since your question but to answer it, there is no &quot;standard&quot; level or debuff layers on whether a mob is slowable or not for this list.  The shaman reporting could be a level 60 shaman with Malo -&gt; Malosini, Chanter Tash, Bard stacked Tash, and OOS, or a level 1 shaman with no debuffs, or anywhere in between.<br />
<br />
I would venture a guess that most of the mobs reported slowable that are 60+ take Malo, then Malosini, plus tash and probably OOS to slow reliably, and even then may take mutiple tries for a level 60 shaman though.<br />
<br />
That doesn't mean you can't slow the same mobs, but without the levels and debuffs you may well die before you can get it to stick ;)</div></div><hr />

Credit remains with the original contibutor if you mentioned a mob already listed. <br />
<br />
If something is slowable with Turgurs then its assumed Insects will stick, not going to put a mob in both columns.<br />
<br />
Please remember to post the full mob names and the zone, describing where they live or when they spawn isnt information I can transcribe, I may not have been there!<br />
<br />
A reminder on mobs that I am going to demand screenshots on:<br />
<br />
Any Kunark dragon - yawn, insects<br />
Naggy and Vox - yawn, insects (I'm probably going to remove the ** on these soon)<br />
Sontalak - yawn<br />
General V'Ghera- yawn<br />
Velketor the Sorceror - yawn, insects<br />
<br />
Confirmation on the following appreciated:<br />

<br />
So basically, only mob I'm unsure about in PoM at this stage is Ferjeneror.  Red con, but haven't been crazy/drunk enough to test it out on him yet :)  I'll get around to it though, just remembered right behind him is a portal I can click to ditch aggro.  <br />
<br />
All in all, only 2 mobs I can think of in PoM that resist turgurs: white stallion and Lith (both forms I think).  White stallion can be slowed by Plague of Insects, but havent been successful on Lith.  However, the patch might have changed his vulnerability to disease, but both still remain extremly MR so don't count on turgurs.</div></div><hr />

The deal with the parasite larvas, if you fight them often keep /coning them.  Sometimes they spawn and con yellow (post 60), sometimes an even level 60.<br />
<br />
If they are the level 60's, they are slowable with turgurs.  If they are the yellow con (post 60) they are immune to slow.</div></div><hr />

I don't have a screenshot (he wiped us out except for one cleric who camped in time), but you can use THIS LINK (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=9294) as separate verification, if that's good enough for you.

Minor correction on your list.  In the deep, you have: Parasite Larva (level 59) as slowable and Parasite Larva (level 60)  as immune.<br />
<br />
The level 60s are the slowable version, and the lvl 61's are the immune, they dont spawn as lvl 59.<br />
<br />
I know... Im just nitpicking  =)<br />

Addition to the list is the spined rock burrower (another type of small wurm that spawns during the RoF in the deep), immune to slow.</div></div><hr />

Updated the site. I've moved Planes onto a seperate page - this includes Planes of Power zones.<br />
<br />
Vox needs a screenshot, no exceptions please. <br />
Have left the confirmation with the first contributor in the case of multiple posts about a mob.<br />
<br />
I'm only going to inclue mini bosses, bosses and immune yard trash in PoP zones rather than listing every mob.<br />
<br />
I've made the spreadsheet available for those who would prefer that format or want to play with the layout.<br />

<br />
Was not able to land slow on Vox when I wiped to her both times.<br />
<br />
However, I am almost 100% sure that I stuck Turgors on Naggy at lvl 51.  Got the resist message the first three times, but I'm positive that the fourth cast slowed her.  I know that at the end, only me and about three others survived, and from what the two tanks said when they were standing next to her was that she must have been slowed cause she wasn't hitting them as fast when she went down.<br />
<br />
However, that was back in the day when I didn't take many pictures, other than me over naggy's corpse of course.  On top of that, I didn't know how to use the client log, and I had not even turned off others hits yet, so the screen was scrolling so fast that it was hard to see<br />
<br />
So, sorry, wish that I took the screenshot</div></div><hr />

I recently took down the Kromzek Captain with 3 friends in Western Wastes.  We had a 62 Pally, 50ish Rogue(bracer recipient), 60 Druid, and a 60 shaman (myself).  We just beat out a larger force in a race for the scout. :)  Times like that you realize knowing just where the SG entrance DOES make a difference.<br />
<br />
I have an older copy of this list taped to my wall, so forgive me if this information has already been provided, but I didn't see him listed. <br />
Burned about 3/4 of a mana bar trying to slow him with Turgur's with NO JOY after Malo/Malosini were in.<br />
<br />
Slowed easily with Plague of Insects after ID was in.<br />
<br />
Corroborating information about disease based-slow landing and magic-based slow resisting can be found here if you sift through the shaman-ignorant posts: http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1255<br />
<br />
Wish I had read that before trying him. ;)<br />
Hope this post helps someone else conserve mana someday. :)<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Just checked the list again (after posting -DOH!) and saw this is already listed in Wakening Lands, though not in Western Wastes.  /sigh  Time to reprint the list again!</div></div><hr />
