<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have a question regarding how DoN works for guild progression.<br />
<br />
Can the raid tasks be repeated - basically making them raid targets for any given night.   <br />
<br />
So if I had finished the Calling Emoush raid quest, could I still trigger it again so the guild could do it over and over?     The stones that drop for the spell/AAs , are those applicable to anyone on the raid, or only people of the same faction, who are at the same stage of the quest?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

last time we did grimlax we had to kill 2 see invis.<br />
took us 12 min to complete the task.</div></div><hr />

Samanna I am up to the spider raid and I can get any mission I have previously done. Can not get single tasks tho, once you do those you cannot get them anymore.</div></div><hr />

Bard runs ahead of the group who are all invis. If a see invis attacks bard mezzes until group has run ahead, fades, move on. Average around 3 see invis up to the last room then bard does the same but agro's the bunch out of the way and in for the kill.<br />

Yes and no.  All raids can be gotten by any one person up to that point in the raid at any time that they wish, unless that person or anyone in the group/raid is locked out, meaning that once the raid is beaten, you are given an invisible timer upon which you cannot redo the quest until it's back up again.  I'm not exactly sure how long this is, but it's long enough that you can't do it back to back days.  This messed us up when we were locked out on the emourash raid and then were not able to progress the next day doing the next 24 person raid because of it.  <br />
<br />
Think of it as any old regular expedition.  Once completed you get a lockout timer for a certain amount of time, that no matter what you do, that mob will not be up in the instance.  This is the way that the raids work, except you can't physically see the timer, you just know that you have one when you try to get the task again, it will tell you that you can't yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The lockout timer on the raid events (emoush,volkara, etc) is three days. But, it's only on that particular event, and you are still open to do others. For instance, did emoush one night, the next night did volkara ( with just about the same batch of people), tonight we just did the dojo one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Some great replies, thank you.<br />
<br />
Let me ask a more specific question... in your opinions of what you've seen and know so far.... is DoN a nice place for a guild of around 30 people (some elemental, some not)... to progress?<br />
<br />
How is the loot in general?     How is the fun factor?     Since the lockout timers only affect the individual event... could a guild (who had at least 1 person high enough to trigger) stagger the events, and hit a different target each night while the lockout timers expire?<br />
<br />
If someone loots the stone rewards from the boss, and they aren't at that stage of quests/tasks yet... will they still be able to turn in for a reward, or must they first get to that stage, then turn in their stone they got from a previous raid (specifically, thinking of the task group 2 raid mentioned above, where 6 stones drop that are for your 69 spell + AAs + new AA ability).<br />
<br />
Basically I want to try and get a feel, if DoN is worth focusing on , for a small guild (~25-35) that is pretty well geared (for elem/pre-elem) and it's a great team... with good class balance among the members.<br />
<br />
Can DoN raids sustain that... and grow from that... or is it not really designed for that.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">from what I've seen.<br />
<br />
standard loot from DoN sucks.<br />
<br />
random Mission loot (100-125 HP with focus V effect) from DoN is about average from OoW.<br />
<br />
low end raid (Emoush event type) loot is about the same as mission loot.<br />
<br />
mid-high end raid loot is unbelievable.<br />
<br />
DoN/OoW will help you gear up your players to continue progression. there is no doubt about that. get your non-elemental people into this gear, it will provide some upgrades so you can push them into elemental.<br />
<br />
after this, farm elemental armor. elemental armor is STILL better than average OoW/DoN gear.<br />
<br />
once you get to the elementals. push towards time, and if you haven't, push KT flagging. when you complete time and start farming, it will be about time to start Ikkinz+ raiding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Start Ikkinz mini's for Bloodlink/Aegis/Mantle/Darkglint whenever you can, even if you can't beat em~</div></div><hr />

I'd say no. Loot isn't that bad if you're in a elemental guild, but the three day lockout just makes it not worth it. You get one maybe two loots per raid - yes there relatively fast, but you're not going to gear up a guild doing them solely. I've seen an all/all ring drop with 9 ac 120hp/mana 41% haste, chain BP 69 ac 150 hp ft3 25 atk, and chain legs 40 ac 140 hp (and maybe some ft). So not too bad I guess, but I'd still work towards time/ GoD targets IMO.<br />

<br />
Yes, that is possible with all the raid drops to my knowledge....just hand them in when you get to that point. Also, it doesn't matter whether you do good or evil raid, the drops are the same, and can be turned in to either side. And no, you can't do the good raid and then go do the same raid under the evil side, we tried that to no avail :P</div></div><hr />
