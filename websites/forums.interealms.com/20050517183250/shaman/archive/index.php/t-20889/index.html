<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Let me ask you two questions, give me your truthful answers.  These questions apply to ALMOST any class:<br />
<br />
1.  For the last few expansions, what have your thoughts been when you've seen the new spells and abilities your class recieved?<br />
<br />
Most of you will answer with a yawn or with a frustrated roll of your eyes.<br />
<br />
2.  For the last few expansions, what were your thoughts when you started seeing the equipment available in the high level dungeons?<br />
<br />
Most of you will answer like I did, with your eyes popping out in disbelief and with unending drools of envy.<br />
<br />
Now you're ready to answer my final question:<br />
<br />
From the point of few of the content that developers put into the game, what is EQ really all about?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">what is EQ really all about?Something to do when inebriated to keep you from hurting yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">naw, it depends on how you play.<br />
<br />
LoY did not bring a shaman piercer, and the best shaman weap is the Soulstripper.<br />
<br />
LDoN did not bring a shaman piercer and the best weapon is the constantly nerfed Orb of Delightful Magic.<br />
<br />
so far i have not seen a GoD piercer, but i did not look hard as i did not/will not buy GoD.<br />
<br />
the other gear?  big deal.  Sony wants to turn me into a gimp dress wearer then they might as well change the character models to reflect it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What is Eq all about?  Making money for SOE; I thought everyone already knew this.  <br />
<br />
The game has always been about dangling a carrot (gear upgrades, new AAs) in front of the player and hoping they continue to spend more hours sitting there trying to attain these new goals.  I think they have missed the mark with their recent carrots though, as they just don't seem quite as tempting anymore.  The latest expansion seems to be one of the worst in terms of extending the stick dangling the carrot, and a lot of players seem to be reaching the carrot, taking a bite, and finding out it wasn't really as tasty as it looked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That's a bit wordy Ruat.<br />
<br />
$$EQ is about the bottom line$$</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Let me ask you two questions, give me your truthful answers.  These questions apply to ALMOST any class:<br />
<br />
1.  For the last few expansions, what have your thoughts been when you've seen the new spells and abilities your class recieved? <br />
<br />
PoP = &quot;They'll figure it out eventually.&quot;<br />
LoY = &quot;They'll figure it out eventually.&quot;<br />
LdoN = &quot;They'll figure it out eventually.&quot;<br />
GoD = &quot;Ok, what the ****.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
2.  For the last few expansions, what were your thoughts when you started seeing the equipment available in the high level dungeons?<br />
<br />
<br />
PoP = &quot;Oh well, I thought Luclin gear was uber at one point too.&quot;<br />
LoY = &quot;Omg, an expansion without uberloots?&quot;<br />
LdoN = &quot;That ****'s droppable?&quot;<br />
GoD = &quot;Check please.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
From the point of few of the content that developers put into the game, what is EQ really all about?<br />
Now?  Making money, as has been said.  EQ was bought like a Taco Bell franchise, with approximately the same level of emotional investment and commitment to excellence on the part of the people who own those places.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Nothing against Taco Bell, but slapping together soft tacos isn't quite the same as creating and maintaining a world that people inhabit.  Not that I'm bitter or anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In my case I've realized  not only is the carrot no longer in my reach but it never will be. I've cancelled my account. It should end around May 11. I was happy being a lowbie player in the scheme of EQ, but when I saw this new content designed for only elemental plus people, I realized their was nothing left for me in EQ. I won't do the join an uber guild thing to extend my EQ life. I'm done. City of Heroes, or another game will fill my  time untill I find something that isn't reliant on the &quot;uberguild plan&quot;. WoW isn't likely in my plans, its being designed with someone like Furor's input, I don't need another EQ raid level clone.<br />
<br />
Uber raid or die, the creedo of EQ, fek it, I've had enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The game is about forcing people to work together and strive over a long period of time to get gear which they can't get by themselves. This sounds great but is so time consuming that it keeps people roped into the game for years, racking up big $ for Sony.  The social/guild structures in this game are the money makers for Sony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Quiggle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">After LoY, I wanted a ****ing refund. Only thing good was the Blood of Nadox spell and Stoicism for the younger shamans. <br />
<br />
LDoN was alright, but it was really nothing special. Nothing new or exciting, but made a lot of nice upgrades available without having to spend dkp. <br />
<br />
GoD so far is awesome. Only Kod'Taz flagged now, but I like the challenge. <br />
<br />
EQ for me is all about playing with my friends, not caring about who beats who to the end game, and enjoying all the new experiences along the way. <br />
