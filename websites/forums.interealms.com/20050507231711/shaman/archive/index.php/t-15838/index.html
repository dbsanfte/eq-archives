<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cerath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anybody ever registered a new account with an expansion key?  And if so, did it get the first month free too?<br />
<br />
I assumed Evolution would have a price tag of around $90, and when I saw the real one I immediately decided it's time to start running a mage with me.  But it's not out until the 25th, and I still have a spare Luclin code laying around because I had to rebuy the CDs after I lost them like a moron and my hard drive threw up.  Then it occured to me the only boxes it says the free month crap on is ones that specifically contain classic EQ.  But logically I can't see them charging new accounts with an expansion key when they didn't charge the monthly fee with codes they GAVE away... plus amazon.com says they don't.  So it'd be nice to be able to not have to wait 8 more days, but it'd be even nicer to pay $12.95 less by waiting. :)</div></div><hr />

Errr, that's not what I meant.  When you register an expansion it tells you you can start a new account with the code, OR upgrade an old one but not both.  So naturally, I assumed you can start a new account with an expansion code.  Tried, and can't.  I guess they only meant that for Trilogy/Gold/Evolution even though it says it for all codes.<br />
<br />
I asked around a bit though, and you can still get free trial codes for a European account.  Address is http://cmt.ubisoft.fr/eq_keys/uk/ if anybody else wants one... I know a lot of people were looking for the trial thing after it vanished off Sony's website.  It initially thinks you're European but you can register it as American during billing... just have to enter the blling info on the station website rather than in-game.</div></div><hr />
