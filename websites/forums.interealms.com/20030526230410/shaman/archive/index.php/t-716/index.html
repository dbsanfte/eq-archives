<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zephreus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can anyone give me a general idea of what this spell goes for now?  Acquiring it myself doesn't look all that viable right now, and I was wondering what a &quot;decent&quot; price for it would be now.. given that they increased the drop rate a while back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I paid 3K for it last night. I'm in the same boat as you not able to aquire it myself, and saw it for sale so I grabbed it. All I need to do now is level up so I can use it ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Got mine 3 weeks ago for 500p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sthaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Someone was selling for 5k (or 7k, can't recall) on BB the other night, but when my friend got there to buy it for me, they wanted 20k.  I passed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">IVe seen anywhere from 250pp to 5k.  Not sure people really know what its worth now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well it definitely will drop on almost any jugg raid now...multi copies even sometimes...price will drop once word is out...right now tho copies are surfacing and trying to pull same price as before (10-15k range)...i think this is the fact that lots are dropping and people just assume its same old price...but i would not pay more than 3-5k for it..and i didnt when i got mine...this is on Tholuxe...wait a few weeks if u not 56 yet..price will drop and they will be out there...if not..and u can use now..might have to just pay whatever is asked just to get it now and use it...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did you knock him down to that price or was that his asking price?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It was a druid auctioning pox of tox. So I sent her a tell, &quot;How much for pox of tox.&quot; She says, &quot;50pp.&quot; I flip and say, &quot;Deal. Where you at?&quot;<br />
<br />
Turns out she thought I wanted a PORT to Tox! I was crushed. <br />
<br />
In the end, she actually DID have the spell. She asked for 1k but I knocked her down to 900.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Soupy, I could have gotten you pox. I need a hug now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Paid 200p for BoN on Veeshan about a month and a half ago. Gave it to a Shammy friend who was already 56 and could use it immediately. She replaced it for me less than 2 weeks later and I still haven't gotten off my arse to get 56 yet. :)<br />

Looking more and more like my Shammy and Druid have been demoted to buff monkey plevel ho's for my Warrior and my wifes Rogue. :)</div></div><hr />
