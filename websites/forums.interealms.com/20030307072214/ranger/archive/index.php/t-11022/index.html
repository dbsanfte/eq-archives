<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mizar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild is gonna try Kedge Keep soon. I know it's an hard zone due to the unmezzable mobs and the horrible pathing.<br />
I'd like to have some advice... we shoud have 2 groups in the 48-56 (i think 1 pally 1 sk 2 rangers 1 bard 2clerics 1 wizzy 2 mages 1 chanter a couple of druids perhaps, yes we miss tanks) We should try to get the items for wizzy epic but not on the first try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harijan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">KK is one of the most challenging and in my opinion funnest zones in the game.<br />
<br />
My background with Kedge I leveled my shaman and ranger as a 2 box from level 28-32 or some such.  The crowning achievement  being that I finished level 28 in 12 kills.  XP bonus plus ten level differential.  If anyone wants to know how I can post that somewhere.  <br />
<br />
It was not easy.<br />
<br />
So anyway.  Updates on kedge.  We back a few weeks ago after dinging 46 (need to update sig) and had a blast.  XP is still great.  A few pointers.<br />
<br />
Research the safe pull spots before you go in and get to those safe spots as fast as you can.  Invis if possible.  Even the green adds are dangerous here.<br />
<br />
Pets are now very effective in Kedge.  Sinse pets no longer draw aggro when idle, and the mobs do not run the pets add a huge benefit to the group.  <br />
<br />
Whatever group you go with cannot panic, running from mobs in kedge is the best way to die.  <br />
<br />
Enduring breath potions for everyone who does not have a permanent EB item.<br />
<br />
Expect to wipe out once or twice before you get the hang of the zone.<br />
<br />
The enchanter is going to be bored if none of the mobs are mezzable.  (I never had mez so I never knew this)<br />
<br />
Ghetto mez (root) is the best way to crowd control.  MR is low on most mobs.<br />
<br />
Have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Habermas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Our guild raided Kedge a couple of months ago. I was one of those who pushed for it, and it became my nightmare. The biggest problem to consider is just breathing. <br />
<br />
If you don't have EB items for everyone, designate someone to cast EB. And here's the tricky part: make sure they have a timer to recast BEFORE it wears off. By the time they note that it is wearing off and cast, it is often too late. I was responsible for casting. First time in, no problem. Next time, for whatever reason, I could not stay on top of the job. Nothing like getting a group on your case because someone died (even yourself) simply because you didn't cast EB in time to save them. So be smart and have them keep a timer, and make that their SOLE responsibility. Make sure they have plenty of fish scales as well.<br />
<br />
Good luck and happy hunting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Klegore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aye I use a VWR lab timer to do the same thing - just set it for 25 minutes and refresh everyone after you do yourself so you know when to get them next.  And yes it lasts for 26 minutes and 45 seconds according to my timer (avg value hehe).</div></div><hr />
