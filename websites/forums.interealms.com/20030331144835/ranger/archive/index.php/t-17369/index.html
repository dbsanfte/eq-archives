<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rezz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With the size and number of the known zones these days and the ability of rangers to track, I would like to see us play the role of Scout.<br />
<br />
Yes rogues get s/s to go poke around dungeons and zones with little chance of being seen, and with the PoK stones they are MAX 15 minutes away from any zone. I'd like to see rangers compete in this area.<br />
<br />
- Self ports gets us within any zone within 5 minutes.<br />
- Our tracking ability (combined with camo and sneak) can get us deep within most zones without being spotted.<br />
- Our weaponshield disc and porting ability should get us out of most situations while we are scouting.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see us play a more important role in a guild rather than a couple of ATK buffs and DPS.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes I know it's a dead horse. Just thought I would bring it up with having us be &quot;scouts&quot; at this level of the EQ evolvement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rounlin Starwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">can we say dead horse?<br />
<br />
PoP, Luclin ports gave the ability to port to nearly every zone or at least in 5 minute running distance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kishin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i'm a little surprised a person in N.O. would bring this up at all x.x<br />
and what's the matter with being dps?  it's a critical part of a raid, and post am3/eq we get some fine fine dps lovin'.<br />
i don't believe that any other melee gets a tolan's bp equivalent (unlimited charge port item), and a thurg gate potion can be used within weaponshield's duration (just in case you get into a real tough spot).<br />
<br />
although i wouldn't mind some tracking AA, or some increased raid/group pulling ability (so that we are better than monks at pulling in certain situations, worse in others).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rezz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't mind being DPS. I want to add more functionality to the guild.<br />
<br />
The self port issue was a dead horse at Kunark. But with the expansion of the game AND the new ports in PoP, why the hell NOT give us SELF ports so we can go scout for targets? Why do we have to wait upon druids to go look around with their limited track, or have them bring along a rogue who has to s/s to get to a mob to see if he is up. Why not send out the rangers to scout the world for a target?<br />
<br />
And why would you be suprised that someone from NO would bring this up? I think it's a valid point, I know it's been beaten to death but there have been 2 expansions since I have seen this brought up which added a lot of &quot;content&quot; to the game and a lot more places that need to be scouted.<br />
<br />
I see part of a ranger's bag o' tricks is being a talented scout for a guild. I think self ports aren't asking too much and I think the role of a scout should be done by a ranger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Negil Elvandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Maybe I missed this idea somewhere but I was thinking it would be good if we got a self only port to sfg and gfay. Like the druid port, circle of sfg (or whatever it is).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Spritle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just add a couple more click port items to the game.  And make the damn things questable instead of being a rare drop from a boring dragon thats a pain in the butt and requires several people to kill.  I simply can't believe that the addition of one or two more 30 second cast time/self port to Fay or SFG items will harm the balance of the game in any way.  They could even be no drop if the economy of TBPs is an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Elwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you want more utility to compete with rogues in the high-end raiding game, ask for a zone-wide tracking AA. That's a lot more realistic than self ports.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Poster-01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Who can see a RPing ranger porting about - Anyway who needs to with Nexus and PoK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Spritle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&quot;Who can see a RPing ranger porting about - Anyway who needs to with Nexus and PoK.&quot;<br />
<br />
I can see an RPing Ranger porting about and you can too when you watch me or many others use a Tolan's BP, Thurgadin gate potion, Vial of Swirling Smoke, or hitching a ride with a druid or wizard.<br />
<br />
Nexus and PoK won't help you if you need to get out of Hate, ToV, or the remote depths of any other dungeon.  A self port to LFay zone will drop you off right next to a convenient PoK portal and give you fast access and mobility to reach zones quicker and cut down on more useless down time.<br />
<br />
I'm not advocating that Rangers be given any special considerations regarding ports.  However, self port items already exist as an earned luxury and don't seem to have caused any balance issues so far.  The 30 second cast time on the TBP ensures that it cannot be abused for solo exploitation and I see no reason why a few more such items couldn't be introduced, even for other classes.<br />
<br />
VI/SoE has a history of being overly cautious about rewarding players and adding game features that could increase enjoyment in the game.  I say enough of the stingy paranoia about game balance and fess up the goods.  Take some of the tedium and frustration out of the game so we can concentrate on having fun.</div></div><hr />
