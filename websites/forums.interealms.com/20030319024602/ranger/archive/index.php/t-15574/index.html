<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Naedarie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">here I am, reading what i can, and it seems that most people tend to group thru the 40's.  I mainly solo, due to time constraints, etc.  I may be duplicating another thread in here somewhere, and if so, feel free to point me in the right direction.  I've tried DL, CC, LOIO (bloodgills), OT, Stonebrunt, EW, etc, in my search for a decent soloing spot.  CC had decent xp and cash, when I was able to get the geo camp (even offered to duo/group, to no avail)  and the terrors weren't quite as good.  does anyone have any suggestions as to a place that I could solo, that is usually uncamped, or not very busy?  Loot would be nice, but not nessesary.  I would prefer tanking, as i haven't quite gotten a handle on fearkiting, or a fearkiting area with some major hints on what i need to do to carry it out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vegah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did the mid thru upper 40's at Icefang in EW.  Very safe area; don't think I ever had an add.  Icefang is pretty good exp; plenty of walruses and mammoths when Korrigain's up.  Also did the occasional giant and man-o-war (not too hard with KEI; root, dot, nuke, arrow till melee).  Exp was really good; loot kinda sucked.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Benemyjosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did Icefang too from 49 to 50 or so, and you can still  pull Icefang even if Korrigain is up, just run in the hut, target Icefang then run to the back of the hut outside, oppisite of Korrigain and cast snare or ensare and Icefang will come through the wall of the hut toward you.   Then when he get's close just fear him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Icefang is good enough XP to only kill 1 spawn? or are there other things to kill as well there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valorindel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There are walruses that spawn right beside Icefang that can be fear kited as well. Just stay away from the Ulthorks while you do that, they get a little testy when you kill their kin like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sarlyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You are also a good level to do the Ice Forged shackles quest. Fear kite tigeraptors in Wakening Lands (pull to Skyshrine zone) and save the strong guts. You only need 1 guts. Then get a group to kill holgreshes in the same zone for the pole part.</div></div><hr />
