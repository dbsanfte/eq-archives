<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vusum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">K a quick question im a 55 shammy on luclin.  Most of the time i end up getting a group in one of the tier one zones in pop.  But sometimes i dont have the time or energy to find a group hehe.  I was tooling around in maidens eye the other day and had to leave so i decided to hit the bank in ss on the way before i logged.  Now my question is are these mobs tough ie can they be root rotted?  Dont much care about faction.  Had a lot of blue cons at the dsp side ent sicked the dog dog on em and he did quite well but had to zone when i got a wandering add seemed to be quite resistant.  Now since this zone is dead on luclin i am trying to get some guildies to try it with me one day but wanted to pick ya'lls brain first.  I would most likely end up grabbing a 57 mage a 56 wizzie poss a 55 56 melee depends on who was on at the time.   With this force could we do well here?  Let me know what you have experienced in here as far as mob resists and hp, casting mobs etc.  Thanks much gang laterz.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>TixaUoff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ok lets see, i belive at 56 maybe 55 i soloed the guards here, the two at the DSP zone and the two at the MS zone, they are semi resistant, malosi will fix this, easily rootable/dottable, dont even bother with a pet. you will waist to much mana on heals for the pet, so just rot it to death. make sure to get a c3 before heading to here, makes things go much smoother. they go down pretty quickly with VotS/Ebolt and Scourge/Plauge. about 1  cast of the disease dots and 2 casts of each Poison dot should take them down, thats if i remeber correctly. the only hard part is the first split of the guards cause you gotta keep both rooted and kill one off fast and then leave enough space between the second guard for ease of spawns. start of by either slowing or malosi'n and then root and do your thing. they drop about 16pp every time and can drop ringmail and random 1pp+ vendor loots.<br />
<br />
now as for group, the group you mentioned is fine, head into the zone and immediatley turn left or right and click the portal and start clearing the upper deck with your group. youll get an add here and there but keep them slowed and youll be fine.<br />

[Edit]as far as i remeber i didnt see any casting guards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chelesa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I tried out Sanctus the other day solo at 56.  Had KEI and buffed and equipped the doggie.  Parked him at a back wall where there were 2 or 3 wandering guards.  They hit pretty tough and fast but they seem to have relatively low hit points.  They will try to run off at low hp's so keep them rooted.  But I made the mistake of attacking another one, umm the name escapes me right now, protector of ? maybe.  They seemed very magic resistant and they cast a DD spell that killed me off pretty quickly.  Sanctus Seru doesn't seem to have many people there at any time, at least on my server, so it's usually quiet and 16-20pp per kill adds up quickly.</div></div><hr />

I've never hunted here, but I can offer some advice from the times I've done research for the Earring of Veracity quest.<br />
<br />
Pay attention to how the guards look and observe them for a bit.  The casters will actually cast spells on a fairly regular basis.  As long as you stick to the guards at the zone-ins, however, that shouldn't be a problem.  If you decide to go further in, like to the four major buildings around the Seru building, you'll *want* to be prepared for casters.  There are enchanters and pallys at the very least inside those buildings, and I've heard of groups getting sputched by g-fluxing 'chanters.  On some of the upper floors there are &quot;boss mobs&quot; to watch out for, with a bad tendency to port groupmates to a jail area in the city, well away from the fight.<br />
<br />
The zone in from Marus Seru should actually be a better place to pull and hunt, as the long hallway there prevents major adds.  Just be aware of your faction; the guards in MS at Neth Lair are on the Seru faction.  Kill thought leeches and recuso bandits to maintain faction if you really feel the need.<br />
<br />
Just my $0.02.  :) <br />
