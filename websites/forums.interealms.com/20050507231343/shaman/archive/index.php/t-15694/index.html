<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">* Attendance feature - many guilds use a points system; it would<br />
sure make life easier to hit a button to generate a log of every player in<br />
the raid. <br />
<br />
* Raidwide shrink - If you're in the same raid with someone, I don't<br />
think &quot;griefing&quot; is applicable, just as our group shrink isn't a problem.<br />
<br />
* Raidwide &quot;see invis&quot;/&quot;invis&quot; combined buff. Again, just to make life<br />
easier. <br />
<br />
Your thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vahnisia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">* Attendance feature - many guilds use a points system; it would<br />

<br />
Can't you just take a screenshot of the raid window and look at it when you log out? It has the names, classes, and levels of those that attend. The only thing that a log file could have extra would be the guild name. Since most raids use a main looter, a record of what was looted would not be much help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can't import a SS into a datebase. An export in text format like the one from guild roster would be better.<br />
<br />
I think to that a raid should be handled like a huge group. Every buff you can cast on a group mate you should be able to cast on any raid member too. Would really help to get peeps shrunken / invis.<br />
<br />
Allowing to /follow any raid member would be nice to but not such a big problem (to run bots on reflag missions).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dan_N</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have the same problem, getting attendence is a real pain in the butt.  Wish they would make a /list function like in channels or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Use the guildtool.   mark in the private note on people when they arrive at the raid, then filter to NOT show offline, and hit the &quot;guild dump&quot; button.   This will form a text file of everyone online, what zone they are in, and include the note you made of time of arrival (and you can look at the time the file is made to see when you did the dump)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Michael J. Kaspar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Been a while since I had to take attendance on a raid, but I recall doing something like this:<br />
<br />
1.  Turn log on by typing /log on, or /log.  Do this right before engagement of big mob.<br />
2.  Do a who command that gets you what you want.  /who guild, /who (if you folks are the only one in the zone), or as a last resort do a /list 1 command to list out folks in the designated raid channel.<br />
3.  Type something like /say above is the attendance for &lt;mobname&gt; on &lt;date&gt; at &lt;time&gt;.<br />
4.  Turn log off.<br />
<br />
You can do this multiple times if you kill multiple mobs.<br />
<br />
When your finished, you can open the log file in notepad.  Copy and paste the sections into Excel, then use Excel to get rid of what you don't want.  Only reason I would open it in notepad first was so I could block select exactly what I wanted to manipulate.  In the end I could do the whole process in about 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
Hope this help :).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sometimes our raids have people in other guilds,<br />
or prospective recruits. What's in the raid window<br />
is best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ya i think raids should be treated as a giant grp since thats pretty much what it is with the new /raid function would solve alot of problems and make life easier<br />
<br />
and for raid see invis MGB Acumen thats tons of fun</div></div><hr />
