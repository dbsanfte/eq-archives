<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Samius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hola fellos shammies<br />
<br />
I just did me final battle for the 8th cudgel and it is mine 8) WOO WOO<br />
 I know some people where lookin for info on final battle<br />
<br />
Go to HS south in secret tunnel. <br />
i pulled so as not to have anyone aggro Iksar apparition ( he will aggro any non iksar or someone who doesn't have good cabilis scaled mystic faction<br />
<br />
Clear room of all npc's cept Iksar apparition<br />
<br />
Hand in Iksar relics to him. VS ghost will spawn along with the 4 arisen mobs<br />
<br />
Spirit of Rile will spawn too. Spirit of rile and Vs will have a battle. let it finish. Took about a minute or so for the scripted stuff to finish and VS becomes targetable<br />
<br />
once VS becomes targettable cast a malo on him and slow his silly but. he came to group in the tunnel with 2 of the arisen mobs<br />
Mez the arisens and keel VS (note i died from the HT's he judiciously slammed on me arse, better i eat it than the main tank)<br />
 He died very easily to our group ( 2 balanced groups of all 60s, was a huge overkill)<br />
<br />
Once he is dead loot the skull of rile. have mezzers mez any remaining Arisen mobs.<br />
<br />
Turn in Skull of rile and your 7th cudgel, and Gratz to u on your Skyiron Cudgel of the Ancients<br />
<br />
Side note, the Carnage effect is not workin properly, Focus prevents it from being cast and will overwrite it if it is cast afterwards. I Spoke with our server lead GM. and he says it is not working as intended. it should be a group mini avatar and not have stacking issues with focus. He says to expect a patch soon<br />
<br />
and i am the proud owner of what the GM believes to be MIthaniel Marrs first Skyiron Cudgel of the Ancients<br />
<br />
Hope this helps fellas 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ah finally some good info on that damn effect.  I've been trying to talk to our server gm about it, but he hasn't answered me any time I've tried to talk to him.<br />
<br />
Group mini-focus would be pretty sweet, maybe worth the emerald then if I can do a whole group with it.<br />
<br />
Congrats on finishing your cudgel, it feels good to finally have it done.<br />
<br />
BTW got news tonight that the server GM from the nameless is moving to mith marr, so apparently you're getting a new one soon =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hehe O god I hope not. GM Therdar (Mith Mars head gm) is awesome. Very helpful and is proactive about gettin problems solved. <br />
<br />
Timeline from me gettin 8th cudgel<br />
<br />
1945 - completed cudgel quest, GU is spammed with gratz sam and woo woo good job bubba.<br />
1947 Casts first virgin casting of carnage on group one<br />
1948 something wrong, casts carnage again<br />
1949 slew of curses spew forth from me mouth<br />
1952 petitions GM<br />
2020 Guide contacts me and asks for info, Guide says info being kicked up to server gm<br />
2030 Lead GM therdar contacts me and gets info, GM tests effects with a guide<br />
2035 Lead GM Therdar says the effect is not acting as intended. all the data is being uploaded to the development team , Expect a patch soon.<br />
<br />
hehe see why i no wanna lose this guy? This is not an isolated incident, Therdar rocks. gets problems taken care.<br />
<br />
BTW i think u either misread me post or mistyped. its not a mini group focus its a mini group avatar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I thought it was a single target mini-avatar, not a group spell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">er yeah meant to type mini-avatar ... sorry 'bout that.</div></div><hr />
