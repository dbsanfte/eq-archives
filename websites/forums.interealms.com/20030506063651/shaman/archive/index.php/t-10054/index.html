<br />
I have been reading up on shamans and love every aspect of them.  I am going to start a new one soon and would like some suggestions for equipment.  I have about 12k to work with atm and could use all the help i can get.  Thanks a lot for your responses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was twinked by some friends but then sold some stuff and bought some stuff etc. Anyhoo for my level i think i'm doing ok and my gear might give you some idea's, you can check the magelo link in my signature.<br />
<br />
With the edition of my REIF i think my equip tops 12k on AB<br />
<br />
And good choice, SHM is a really nice class</div></div><hr />

Here's what I did for mid-game twinkage:<br />

<br />
I'm twinked for about 15k, get the REIF if you solo and a Ikky BP, period.  <br />
<br />
I just got a REIF for 7k (average price) and its great.  Amazing damage when quicked.  It rules all other damage dealers avail under 50;I have Blight Hammer and Barb Spirt Hammer, selling both.<br />
<br />
Ikky BP= Regen &gt;HP&gt;AC&gt;Wis.  It will alow you to solo easliy at low levels and actually cast some at 24 when you get Regen and Can I.  People use Ikkys into the 50's.  Ikky BP= 5-6k.<br />
<br />
I've tried several combinations of gear in my 30s (when I got twinked by friends, played 1-30 straight up) and this really works great for me.<br />
