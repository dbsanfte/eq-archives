<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">WOOHOO!! As the subject header states, I got my epic tonight! I'm so excited. I'd like to thank everyone here at the crucible. If it hadn't been for the many wonderful tips and hints posted here, it would've been much more difficult. I am in your debt. :) As an FYI for those interested, my guild killed Rak tonight with one mage pet and one cleric casting celestial elixir on the pet during the battle. There was another cleric present but the primary healer had no problem keeping the pet alive. The fight didn't really take that long either. I did die from the AE, but since my resists are terrible and I didn't want to take a chance on making Rak move, I just stood my ground and took the death. It was worth it, after all, to receive the epic. Also, as far as faction goes, when I conned the sentinel spirit at the turn-in, I was just 'ally', not max ally. I did each part of the epic as written in Belgar's guide just once except for the very beginning. I botched my first attempt at the test of patience and had to start over. Other than that, I repeated no parts of the epic. Once again, thanks crucible posters for all the wonderful information you've given me. :D</div></div><hr />
