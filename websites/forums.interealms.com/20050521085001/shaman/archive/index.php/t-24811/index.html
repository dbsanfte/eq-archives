<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's just another guild recruitment message full of propoganda for their guild.  <br />
<br />
Qualifyed applicants have been getting more scarse on the nameless in general recently.<br />
<br />
edit:  Though in general i find the propoganda for recuiting guilds a bit annoying myself /shrug.  (gotta love random thoughts while trying to get work done on sundays.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They are actually a pretty good guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zuniah Stormhand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">First of all, thank you m970456.<br />
<br />
I dont want to start a pissing contest. Just want to point out that its funny Xilinx &quot;finds the propaganda for recuiting guilds annoying&quot;.  And yet his fellow member Gerogride also posted in the Cleric Forum re: recruitment. Nice Sunday random thoughts too eh? Classic case of pot calling the kettle black? =P<br />
<br />
Pardon to the others i dont want to offend. I'm done replying.<br />
<br />
P.S. To those interested, feel free to visit the website please. We need all classes that's the reason I posted here.  <br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So instead of becoming part of the community here, you're firing off a recruitment ad and hoping?<br />
*shrugs*<br />
Hope you can find a good shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vittra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">=) I am a shaman in War Dragon myself. heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zuniah Stormhand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Isn't being part of any community irl or otherwise announcing any ads for jobs for those ppl who need &quot;jobs&quot; or affiliation?  I don't know what part of the world you are in, maybe newspapers or ads dont work in your place, but I know having a recruitment ad works in most countries I know.<br />
<br />
This is so funny.  Since when is recruiting ppl to join a guild a crime?  We are not forcing ppl to join us.  We are just making them aware that there is a guild available for them in case they want to.  Besides its a guild  :D  it's not a terrorist affiliation lol.<br />
<br />
We need shamans too. Hence the post.  I don't see why we need to get &quot;flamed&quot; for it, but if it you like it, go ahead, flame on.  Hope your happy.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">/moderator hat on<br />
<br />
I don't mind the occasional cross server recruit thread. If they ever get too numerous and annoying, I'll ask Sunmoon to start a thread for that purpose.<br />
<br />
/moderator hat off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zuniah Stormhand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thank you Gloriana.  We in no means want to annoy hence a quick post, and no hope to keep this thread like 20 pages long.  It was meant to be an ad and not a flame thread.  I apologize again for making this much longer than I'd ever dream of.<br />
<br />
Thank you again for your patience.  This will be my last reply here.<br />
<br />
Have a good day!</div></div><hr />

<br />
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.namelesstavern.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=37&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is a list of most of the guilds on the Nameless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">No offense, but not sure that info from &quot;several years ago&quot; has any relevence at this time.  I don't have any first hand knowledge of the guild itself, however, I've played with several members from time to time in pick up groups.  They have always been very capable.<br />
<br />
I for one would like to see more guilds post on our site.  As I've posted before, it would add another facet of valuable information for all of us, even if it's just notices on when guilds are recruiting or what content they are working on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>frynque</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">No offense, but not sure that info from &quot;several years ago&quot; has any relevence at this time.  <br />
<br />
/agree.  i merely posed the question, because they werent your run of the mill, no real reputation, guild.  they had a very distinct reputation, and i give them kudos if they have reversed that and done good.  that is all i'm saying.<br />

<br />
^^ BINGO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gaknab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">has war dragon evolved from the their old zerg roots?  i remember war dragon from several years ago when i played on Nameless.  it was a common joke, when hearing about a new kill for them, to ask, &quot;how many did they stuff into zone this time before it crashed?&quot;  they were notorious for alot if &quot;questionable&quot; things, like training other guilds raids, epic mob KSing, and other things.  now this was several years ago, so, for all i know, they might have cleaned up their act and gotten back onto a better foot.  admittedly, though, i'd recommend, for anyone server defecting to Nameless, to look at &quot;Legacy of Steel&quot; and &quot;Valorguard&quot;, if they're still around.  last i heard, &quot;Shock of Swords&quot; finally faded out, is that true?<br />

<br />
Shock of Swords died in oh May of 2002 or so. Shock was by far the best guild I was ever a part of. I have yet to see anything like it anywhere. /mourn<br />
<br />
Anyways when Shock died I quit playing EQ. Came back about 18 months later shortly before GoD was released and starting playing alot again. The guild structure on the nameless changed a Ton in the time I was gone.<br />
<br />
The Top guild on the Server is still Legacy of Steel, followed closely by Paradise of Nameless who raid on Asian times. Other good guilds on the server include Valorgaurd, Fist of Fate and Decade who are all into EP and Time and working into GoD content.<br />
<br />
Anyways as was mentioned earlier War Dragon had a hugely bad rep back before I quit, but to be honest I haven't heard much about them since I returned to playing EQ and the few War Dragon members I have grouped with seemed like decent folks so I'm assuming the guild has cleaned up thier act.<br />
<br />
Anyone who has any questions can feel free to shoot me a tell.</div></div><hr />
