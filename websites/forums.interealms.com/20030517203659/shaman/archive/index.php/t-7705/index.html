<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kilokeo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For the greenmist, some sk can't complete it because of their diety.  Is the same for the cudgel quests or can any diety complete it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Iranicus Spellbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Only bad races can do the cudgel quest is what i am hearing because barbs and kitties cant raise a faction required of bad races only. Just a rumor, but in terms of diety any leezard, ogre, troll can wield it but only if they have the faction of course</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know anyone on CT alignment can complete it and have heard Inno trolls claim to be able to complete it as well.  Barbs can't go past the 1st by normal means and I think Cats bottom out on the 5th or so.  Not sure on RZ ogres either.<br />
<br />
There may be some shifty ways to actually complete this series of quests using illusions and faction modifying items, but it would prolly end up being more trouble than it is worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">troll innoruuk shaman, i have 8th cudgel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Question for you Arisai: What did your Scaled Mystics faction max at?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">anyone can do this quest regardless of diety, all you need is the proper faction to do the hand ins.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some race/diety combos aren't able to attain the faction required to complete all the quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">How so?  You should be able to get the required faction by completing several minor quests for the necro and scaled mystic faction.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Faction has a maximum limit (2000 points above your personal starting level). Once you hit max, you can't go higher. But what Gormadoc is saying, for some race/diety combos this still isn't enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">supposedly the way around that is to MQ the 8th cudgel.  Only the &quot;initiator&quot; of the quest has to have the proper faction, the person recieving the item (by turning in the last piece) does not. Now to find someone who's willing to risk his 7th on that basis ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Possible for a Rallos Zek Ogre to do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Iranicus Spellbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">From everyone i have talked to that has tried to get the skyiron cudgel of the ancients, the only shaman races that i know havent been able to complete this quest are barbarians and Vah Shir. I know Ogres and trolls can easily do it. Especially if your Cazic Thule Diety (my shaman is a leezard and is cazic thule). As for the MQ, i think it would be to much of a hassle to start another shaman that can go to 7th cudgel (although) nearly all ofit can be mqed seeing how the skulls aint no drop and when they are u aint combining them, but all the time your spending re doing this quest could be put into getting a sweet spear from Umbral Plains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">How did you guys get faction to do the quest? I'm KoS to the Temple of Terror as a Rallos Zek Ogre Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>gummox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you don't mind bottoming out a couple old world factions that you're probably already KoS to anyway, the explorer knives quest (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1663) is much quicker than the bone chip quest (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=260) that most ppl use.  By my best estimate, the knives give about as much faction per stack as the chips do per backpack full of stacks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jowjo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Rallos Zek Ogre here, maxxed faction with the bone chip quest (cannot get any better) Maxxed at indifferent to the shaman guild.<br />
<br />
I could not get the quest text for cudgel 1  =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Arghhhh......<br />
<br />
Not an option for Rallos Zek Shaman huh? That blows...was really hoping to be able to do this quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">i know of a rallos zek troll shammy who has the final cudgel..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">? <br />
<br />
Can you be a RZ troll shaman? <br />
<br />
I thought it was CT or Inny. I'll have to go make one and check.</div></div><hr />

i know of a rallos zek troll shammy who has the final cudgel.. <br />
Who Gorm? How did he do the quest and get past the faction issues?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I'm capped at Warmly. Troll Inno Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Name is Skab on my server.. not sure what quests he did.. I do know he did the bone chip quest A LOTTT  I think he turned in close to 4k bone chips..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jowjo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Gorm .. any idea how he got past the indifferendt faction? I did the bone chip quest and maxxed faction. I still could not get the quest.<br />
<br />
I have all the skulls from the tower from just collecting chips. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Don't have a clue.. will have to inquire =P or get him to post here.. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>deviator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">im a barbarian and have the 6th cudgel, i used the ornate velium pendant after turning in 7k bone chips. i maxed out at indiff but the pendant takes me to amiable. only problem is that it only has 4 charges, i have used 3 or 4 pendants so far and need about 3 more i think. i tried killing juliah lockheart in icewell twice so far but she hasnt dropped another one, i bought the previous ones, so im concerned she may not be dropping them anymore. if anyone knows for sure that she still drops them, please let us know so we can finish this quest. thank you.</div></div><hr />
