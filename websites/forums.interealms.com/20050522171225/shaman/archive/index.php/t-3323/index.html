<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jiggah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,<br />
<br />
My main is a ranger, but I recently started 2 boxing.  I started a cleric and got him up to about 30.  Now I'd like to do the same with a shammy to see who I like best as a partner.  I want to do an iksar shammy basically because i think they look cool.  that's really pretty much it.  considering the shammy is pretty much going to be a bot, am i really shooting myself in the arse by picking iksar?  is there a race for shammies that is really considered the best?  and regarding starting points, i put 20 into sta (for later cannibalization) and 10 into wis.  should i go back and do the standard 25 wis, 5 sta as most boards seem to say?  thanks.</div></div><hr />

Not really, not really, not if you're happy with that choice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did 25wis 5sta /shrug it's ok for me, I like ac then hp's because I solo or duo a lot andI usually tank :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Speaking as an Iksar Shaman I like the call on +Sta, and if I could go back and do that myself I would.  Wisdom is far easier to raise as a Shaman than Sta (from gear at least) and Iksar Sta is terribly lacking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jiggah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">thanks to seredith and nuttasaurus.  i think i'll keep the iksar shammy i already created with the 20sta and the 10wis.  thanks again.</div></div><hr />

At this point there is one other active lizzy oracle on xev that i know of. There were a few others but I never ever see em on anymore. <br />
<br />
/who all 60 shaman barb is 20+<br />
<br />
/who all 60 shaman troll is 10-15<br />
<br />
/who all 60 shaman ogre is 0 or grubnubbnubb lol<br />
<br />
/who all 60 shaman iksar is me and some fellah named Zenok<br />
<br />
/who all 60 shaman kitty - ZERO!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ogre starting STA is 127, 47 more points then the Vah'Shir.<br />
<br />
Ogre starting WIS is 77, 3 points less then the Vah'Shir.<br />
<br />
Solution: Start an Ogre, and do 25 WIS / 5 STA! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As for Iksar...<br />
<br />
Ogres have 52 points of STA over them. If you're into Stamina, I'd definently go for the Ogre. Just put 25 into WIS, and the remaining 5 into STA, or wherever else you'd like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Alliza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I just made my iksar shammy last week and so far haven't regretted it one bit.  <br />

3 more levels and I'll have my first pet, I hear thats when the power truely starts.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tragik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">While having high stamina and hitpoint gear is great, the most important HP stat you will ever have is the ability to regenerate it quickly.  At least until 60 with torpor/cann5.<br />
<br />
Same goes for mana, hence the popularity of buffs such as KEI.<br />
<br />
On that note, I would recommend Troll or Iksar shaman simply for the superior health regeneration.  I chose iksar myself just because they looked like they belonged out in the jungles of Kunark when it was first released.  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Venomblood Draconis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As an Iksar shaman, and an Oracle, I can tell you some things. If the shaman is only to be a 'bot, then you'd be okay with whatever you chose, just choose what you enjoy. <br />
<br />
Iksar have some pros and cons. I haven't regretted making Venom once. You can't go most places, but once you get to the high end game, it really doesn't matter. With the Nexus and Shadowhaven, it matters even less. You can also fix faction, if you are into mind-numbing questing or killing, if you want, in most cities.  <br />
<br />
And the above poster who was talking about the rareness of Iksar Oracles is right. I know of 2 on my server (Veeshan) besides myself.  A rare breed, indeed. Not a problem, as far as I'm concerned, fewer folks to share the Oracle chair in Cabilis. The one in Halas, you probably have to take a number.<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Shaman race doesn't matter terribly much.  I really wish I'd put my starting points into stamina instead of 25 wis/5 sta.<br />
<br />
Getting my Stamina up as an Iksar is rather difficult.<br />
<br />
I have alot of HP though, so it's not really that big of a deal.  Lizards can get massive HP just like everyone else, it's just a little bit more difficult.  <br />
<br />
When I made my shaman everyone was drooling over the Iksar AC bonus.  It's not that great though :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Farbzilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">race honestly dosen't make a lick of difference.  I chose Iksar because i just love the race and the continent of Kunark.  Seemed like a fun character to play.  They do get a few plusses and a few minuses, but it's all about who you want to be and how you want to look.<br />
<br />
Sta is the way to go IMO, you can get more +wis items than +sta items easier, but again it's personal prefrence, and even if you put the points soley into cha  you can become as good as you want to be.<br />
<br />
Enjoy your shammy, just be careful that he dosen't become you favorite like mind did!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">&quot;Shaman race doesn't matter terribly much&quot;<br />
<br />
true, but it is definitely the class it matters most for, and for which the different classes (cept vah shir) are most different. so you might as well think twice before you create your shaman.<br />
<br />
if you're gonna make a bot that's gonna sit in the low 50's, i don't think iksar would be a bad choice at all. good mana pool and regen is indiferent passive mana regen. i'd do 25 wis / 5 sta though, very very few oracles have 255 wis and it doesn't excactly hurt to have a decent mana pool. you should focus your gear on ac/hp and won't have much added wis from it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think that most oracles have 255 wis after KEI.  Most of the ones I know do atleast.</div></div><hr />
