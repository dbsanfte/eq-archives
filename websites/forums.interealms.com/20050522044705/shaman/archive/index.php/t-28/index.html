<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It's like the 70's in here.  Yow.  The sad part is I almost like it.  <br />
<br />
Just so everyone knows, I backed up about 65 megs worth of posts before the board dump, including the slow list, spell locations, hunting areas, and a whole bunch of other good stuff.  Oh, and anyone who ever complained about Sun dumping Sigs, thank God for it now, lol, the backups were bad enough with the small sigs!  I had to leave graphics on because I wanted any maps and what not that may have been inside them :)  I think in case this ever happens again I am going to tag all the really good posts with a FLAGGED in the title so I can search them out in a hurry.  <br />
<br />
Hey Sun, depending on size and what kind of connection you are on, I can either download from or have you mail me the corrupt database from the old SC, I've got plenty of webspace unused atm that I could repost it for a short while.  The forum sitting there is unused, I could just link it from the empty DB it is on now to the old SC one.  Not a huge deal though, I am just shuddering at the thought of digging through all the posts I just saved, ha!  Would make one heck of a knowledge base though.  Just out of curiousity, how corrupt is corrupt?<br />
<br />
Ok, next question, do you guys like the old colors or the new colors better?  Or neither?  I'll look into all the old posts and find out what all the names are (really should have written those down, sigh hindsight) for post counts.  Luckily the saved posts have the old colors too.  I miss my Yin Yang.  Hmm, that sounds bad.<br />
<br />
PEACE!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Old Colors</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Kinda like the new colors - very fresh and v easy to read.<br />
<br />
Think even if you change them it would be nice to have a little bit of a change from the old ones - bit of spring cleaning in the Crucible and all that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heya Thantu.. well, I can restore the shaman to a full DB for you and you can point your vBulletin boards to it if you wish.<br />
<br />
The shaman DB took up about 97 megs. Also, you'd need a working copy of vBulletin installed (I can *cough* provide that for a short loan) PHP and MySQL. If you have all that, I will try to hook you up with my sysadmin who can get it working for you in about 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
Then, people can use that site to do searches and pull data to export to the new one if you wish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Also, one of the new things I will be giving you all is the option to change your templates. Then, you can choose all types of colors depending on if you are at work, home, etc.. or want to be festive with holiday templates ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oh - forgot to mention - I really like the way the quotes come up now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Quotes are actually readable now.<br />
<br />
/cheer<br />
<br />
I'm indifferent to the colors:<br />
<br />
a_new_colors_00 regards you indifferently - it appears to be quite formidable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Is it compatible &quot;only&quot; with vbulletin, or could I use another forum software package (I'm sure it would look whackey, but as long as it was readable)?  Yeah, it already has working currect MySQL and PHP, in fact there is a unused working forum there now linked to an empty database.  Lol, I wonder how many people are going to opt for the monochrome, &quot;I'm at work&quot; template?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hrm, I'd suspect it would only work with vBulletin since it's a specific format. Like I said, I can get you a copy for quick use.<br />
<br />
Thantu.. another feature you'll love, I added a hack that allows a signature to only be loaded once per page. No more sig spam for j00 ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">These colors scare me =)  Kinda good though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">new colors</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">new colors are so fresh and so clean clean</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I don't mind a color change from the old, but the current color scheme is a bit rough on the eyes. The stark white background is harsh =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I like the way quotes look now.  I don't mind the lighter colors.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">So bright! So, so bright! :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ezeekial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">i like the new colors. crisp and fresh, or something like that. :|</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Too bright! Old colors were good...but changing to some new ones would be nice, just make em darker PLEASE! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kylemall Inthensom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">These colors are absolutely horrid..<br />
<br />
I'll turn my comp to 25% brightness...<br />
<br />
PLEASE switch us back...I'd rather stick glass shards in my fingernails.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">New colours<br />
<br />
the new quotes thingy is much better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The new colors make it look more professional (IE, my boss won't be so suspicious when he walks by and sees me reading them :)).<br />
<br />
Truth be told, I'd be happy of the TSC graphic was removed from the upper left hand corner as well (don't really need it on the forums, do we?). That way he'd really be clueless unless he stopped, hovered over my shoulder, and read some of the posts.<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">My personal opinion is that dark text on a light backgound is easier to read.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I like the new way quotes look, but can you tone down the background colors a bit? They are kinda hard on the eyes. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">#FAFBC4 = off white / bone'ish color :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>T'harkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">new colors, much much easier to actually sit down and read posts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Ezeekial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">i think some of you guys have your brightness turned up from playing your blind barbies. j/king<br />
<br />
but seriously it isnt bright at all. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Tomorrow I will start experimenting with a few &quot;softer&quot; colors after I wake up (workin late tonight and I've got a HP to repair yet this afternoon).  Since I'll be off I'll start sorting through the backed up posts as well.  Would you rather see them posted intact or rehashed through and cleaned up as Guides?  If you haven't noticed I'm also going to try and make an effort to make the &quot;not general&quot; forums interesting (and thereby keep things a little more focused, really up to all of you though).  I know the Combat and Tactics forum isn't posting numbers yet, I will look into that tomorrow as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">screw the colors. the performance rocks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Shaben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I recon we should go for a pink with yellow spots colour scheme! Maybe with brown boarders, and luminous green writing<br />
;) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Sverra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">New colors are nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Garreth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I like the new look :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Tohlagos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I like the new colors.  Much easier on my eyes.  Besides, whats wrong with a little redecorating every now and then?  :)</div></div><hr />
