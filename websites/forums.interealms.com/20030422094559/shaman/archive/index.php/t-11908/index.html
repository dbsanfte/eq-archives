<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So nobody really seems to recommend the luggald quest rings?  I figured our buffs would make up for the stats enough that 2 points of regen (both rings) would be desirable.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your opinions.  Would hate to spend countless hours camping luggalds to find out it wasn't worth it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
more hp, resists, mana, same ac, and can be had for a little effort and about 1kpp....and they arent that much of an upgrade?<br />
<br />
<br />
Unless you can't get in groups to get the metallic liquid and razorfiend talons id highly suggest getting them.</div></div><hr />

I did the Luggald Ring Quests, both of them infact.  You'll need to pickup some Illusion Dark Elf potions to do the one out of Neriak Commons if you're a barbarian.<br />
<br />
Can't argue about really nice rings with regen that cost you nothing in terms of platinum except maybe a few hundred plat for the illusion potions.<br />
<br />
The money saved could be spent better else where in my humble opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Post 60 with torpor, the choice is clear: HPs are god, regen is meaningless.<br />
<br />
Before that?  Every point of regen counts.  The faster you regen, the faster you can canni, the more mana per mob you can afford to spend, the faster you kill, the better your exp rate....<br />
<br />
These new rings are almost tailor made for a shaman.  AC, HPs, Mana, Wisdom, Regen.<br />
<br />
If you dont see yourself having torpor soon, quest up those rings and save the cash you would spend on valorium rings to buy torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jowjo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I searched, and could not find any info. on Luggald Ring Quests. What zone do these quests start in ?</div></div><hr />

The rings are quite nice,  I just keep finding other things to do fist and would like a bigger jump.<br />
<br />
I have only looked at purchasing them and not making them and I had one at one time that I got cheep but I resold it shorly after to upgrade a different slot and put my 6 65 back on my fat Ogre finger.<br />
<br />
I have not yet sorted out what I want for rings but if the price for the VRG get down into the 3k range or so I would be glad to pick up a couple to fill in the gap.<br />
<br />
But I also am in desperate need of a new head and range slot upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lohknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I quested both of the rings this weekend.  Soloed the whole quest up until the last step against the giant skelly in Toxx Forest.<br />
<br />
I must say that the rings are a definite upgrade on the 6 65's.  You get 2hp regen, and more HP/WIS/MANA from the rings.<br />
<br />
Overall, it took me about 5 hours for each ring, well worth the time, and you can get decent exp along the way.  The drop rates for fleshes are not as bad as some people have been saying.</div></div><hr />

Even with torpor regen is important.  As a 60 shaman with slightly above average gear for a 60 shaman and torpor I don't regret having 27 HP regen at all.  Escpecially when I'm soloing in Plane of Nightmare.  I was soloing side by side with another torpor enabled 60 shaman who did not have the regen that I have and I was doing 2 mobs for every 1 mob he was doing.<br />
<br />
Below is a quick guide to these rings:<br />

<br />
These quests were designed so that good aligned and evil aligned classes could get a similiar ring, with the introduction of illusion potions good classes can do the 2nd ring, which originates from an NPC in Neriak Commons.  Costs about 400p in illusion dark elf potions (which modify your faction).<br />
<br />
These items require Legacy of Ykesha and cannot be multiquested.<br />
<br />
Expect to spend around 5 hours on average per ring, with a fight in Toxxulia Forest for each ring.<br />
<br />
I suggest when camping the Luggald Flesh (Dulak) and Fecund Luggald Flesh (Nadox) to get 6 of each, 3 are needed for each quested ring.<br />
<br />
If you have a melee twink or friend helping  out you might want to check out these weapons, which can also result from the above quests.<br />

<br />
The following are a few nice items we got while camping the quests items in Nadox.  We also got 5 items needed for research No Component Levitation spell and Pure Blood, used for a shaman spell quest.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">dyrk - i like the coral ring in your magelo. where does it drop, or how much does it typically sell for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kashale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Coral Ring drops in Nadox off of a Water Torn (something-or-other).  Zone in from Gunthak, swim the lava river, exit on the right side just before the bridge, cross the bridge and set up camp on the left side.  Pull from the tunnels in front of you and eventually you'll see a Water Torn.  At least that's how I got mine.</div></div><hr />
