<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">They already announced that the new &quot;epics&quot; won't necessarily be weapons.  This could be a secondary slot item - which means you can keep your poker as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well we've all heard that epic &quot;2.0&quot; might require the first epic, and, if it does, it would be nice if on the way to getting the second epic, which might be a secondary slot item, you could get your current epic 1.0 upgraded to be more in line with the times.  This would be more important for melees, but also hold importance for shaman as well.  All they'd have to do is give it a better ratio, something more along the lines of 30/30.  There are plenty and I mean plenty of weapons that are easy to get and have a ratio superior to 20/30 out there.<br />
<br />
I don't think they should make them hand-tailored, like I've heard they might.  An epic is a certain epic item, and if it was crafted to the player's needs, it would no longer be &quot;teh epic&quot;, but merely an awesome craftable item which, if you changed your mind on, would be hard if not impossible to reconfigure.  I think they should just put in aug slots of a new type that can only be filled with certain &quot;epic&quot; augs, quests for which could be added at the same or perhaps a later date.  This would allow for both customization and the feeling of a unified &quot;epic&quot; class item... though it would require a tad of innovative coding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">if it goes live with a graphic like that it better be like 1h and ranged, because it's fairly absurd looking as is~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well we've all heard that epic &quot;2.0&quot; might require the first epic, and, if it does<br />

It won't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">well...it wont require it..but if you don't have it you will have to do a subquest i do believe<br />
<br />
btw i mentioned to the person developing the shm epic 2.0 quest...that we got a &quot;broken arrow&quot; in our Test of Patience and it was never used...what better way to show our Test of Patience then to use it in some way.  I kept mine :)<br />
<br />
<br />
also some more things about the epic...the mane and the animal will be animated...also the eyes/runes along it glow in the dark too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Still a dumb cat head on a stick. Can you imagine the p-ussy jokes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">But it ahem, meshes nicely with the Enchanter epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I can think of a lot of other heads that Shaman would rather have on as stick.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ghobster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I like epic 2.0 better.<br />

is it still going to be called Spear of Fate like I've seen people imply that it will be?</div></div><hr />
