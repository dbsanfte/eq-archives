<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fazzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I still need the translocate to bind point spell and the cobalt scar portal spell.  I believe they are drops--i dont think any vendor sells, although i'm not sure of that.  If anyone has one of these spells to sell to me, please post here :)  Or if you know of where I can buy them, let me know.  Also, there supposedly is a invis to undead wizzie spell that i think you can buy in skyshrine--if anyone knows who sells it in skyshrine, and what faction is needed to buy it (is dubious high enough?) lemme know.  Thanks :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Adelrune Argenti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know I have seen several Translocate spells drop. Last week in Siren's, we picked up two. Also, the Invis to undead spell for wizards is a drop spell. You can find it for sale in Freeport alot. The Cobalt Scar portal spell is something you can buy but only in Skyshrine I beleive. I am not sure which mob though.</div></div><hr />
