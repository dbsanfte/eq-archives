<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>JuyshinRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">[Wed Nov 19 03:24:48 2003] &lt;SYSTEMWIDE_MESSAGE&gt;: Brenlo : In the darkness the shout to engage was heard. Seconds later a huge burst of magical energy could be felt as the Wizards and Shadow Knights engaged, and huge volleys of arrows begin to rain down as one against their target.<br />
<br />
[Wed Nov 19 03:26:35 2003] &lt;SYSTEMWIDE_MESSAGE&gt;: Brenlo : The massive infantry then moved in to intercept Kerafrym in mortal combat, supported by a compliment of warriors. The clashing of steel and the screams of chaos echoed in the beasts tomb.<br />
<br />
[Wed Nov 19 03:26:49 2003] &lt;SYSTEMWIDE_MESSAGE&gt;: Brenlo : Over three hours had past since the epic confrontation began, then there was silence. As a cold freezing wind blew across the field of battle, hundreds had died and many more lay injured o*n the ground.<br />
<br />
[Wed Nov 19 03:27:03 2003] &lt;SYSTEMWIDE_MESSAGE&gt;: Brenlo : All was silent again for a brief moment as the image of the legendary Kerafyrm lay lifeless at their feet. Suddenly, the cries of joy and accomplishment began to echo through the decrepit hall and then rain across the land of Norrath.<br />
<br />
[Wed Nov 19 03:27:13 2003] &lt;SYSTEMWIDE_MESSAGE&gt;: Brenlo : The o*nce warring clans of Ascending Dawn, Wudan, and Magus Imperialis Magicus had put there personal battles aside and come together united as o*ne to accomplish the impossible.<br />
<br />
[Wed Nov 19 03:27:22 2003] &lt;SYSTEMWIDE_MESSAGE&gt;: Brenlo : They had triumphed where all others before them had failed, they had slain the Legendary Kerafyrm. As the victors departed the ancient tomb, rumors began to spread across the world of Rallos Zek. Rumors became Stories. Stories became Legend.  <br />

I just had to add that quip by a guild member... many got a good laugh out of it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">... and from some other source, it was said that it was indeed a wizard who scored the killing hit on Kerafyrm. His joy was not very long lasting though, as he was then promptly PK'd by few around him. Short lived glory, if this is the truth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I landed Blood of Saryn on Trylun when we monkey piled him. It's somewhat of an old tradition on RZ. When I got my just about every BP I've had, I usually get killed by the guild.</div></div><hr />
