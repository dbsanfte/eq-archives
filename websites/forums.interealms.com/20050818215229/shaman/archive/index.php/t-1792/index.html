<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mukka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Knew it from the log in msg but just cant find any special.<br />
someone said it happened in the everfrost but i've checked and nothing special.<br />
<br />
Anyone know what is the event about?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">AoW and named henchman were in FV last night.  Warrior in guild got a 37 ac, 15str/sta/agi, 70 hp BP off one of 'em.<br />
<br />
Dunno what else is going, but that's some of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kaytlin Snowstalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">On emarr, there was a war in FP and one of my guildies and some monk attacked and killed the leader of the good side.  Their reward was an old school DE mask(yes, usable from inventory by any class).  The warrior is now a DE 100% of the time lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Jeez leave it to me to pick this week to work on AA exp lol. Highly doubt some cool loot dropping mob going to show up in the place I'm holed up in but at least ive gotten my first aa point so far like woot and stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The Avatar of War showed up in FV to launch an attack on the outpost.<br />
<br />
From what I could tell, the event was very confusing to the players.  First of all, AoW did shouts asking the players who they were going to side with.  Many evils and Zek worshippers chose to side with the giants and were going to help slaughter the Tunarian citizens.<br />
<br />
Well, the way it worked out was that the Avatar of War (after going LD) summoned some forest giants that just stood around and were killed by the players.  I don't think they dropped anything.  There was a GM controlled elf commander who was defending the outpost also.<br />
<br />
Oh, there were over 350 people in FV.  You couldn't move.  And for some reason, all of the following seemed to be disabled somehow:<br />
<br />
- spellcasting<br />
- sitting/meditating/looking in your spellbook<br />
- zoning<br />
- gating<br />
- clicking on any buttons in the user interface<br />
<br />
And no, it wasn't due to lag, although that would have explained it.  It was very bizarre to say the least and really a very poor event.  After the giants were killed, the commander thanked us for defending the outpost (even though half of the players in the zone were trying to side with AoW) and that was about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>DarkPhase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There was a war in east commonlands/west freeport today. The Children of Darkness(evil) launched an attack on Bringers of Light(good). I was with the evil side. One funny thing was that they made some of us into dark elves. (Now I wish even more that I had that DE mask. Wanna see how I looked? Click on my magelo link in the sig.)<br />
<br />
The actual war was kind of a mess, with about half of the players going LD in EC. Then shortly after zone crashed. There was some who actually made it to freeport and bravely fought the Bringers of light. I'm not sure of the outcome, but I believe the evils(us) manage to slay the leader of the good forces.<br />
<br />
Would Verant listen if we started a petition to make the old school DE mask (guise of the deceiver) droppable? I could care less what the prices on it would rise to. I just want to have that option available to me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>WM231NIKE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Today in WC, there was a zone shout that said the evil vs. good battle in FP was about to take place, I logged shortly afterwards...</div></div><hr />

I seriously doubt it, not only would rogues and bards have a problem with it, but anyone who had a mask from before may have a problem with it.</div></div><hr />
