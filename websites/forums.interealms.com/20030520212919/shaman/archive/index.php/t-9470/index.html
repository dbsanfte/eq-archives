<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just got back from a 4-6 month break a few months ago and have been updating my gear with some PoP stuff (which is really nicely priced for its stats).  Anyways, how is my gear?  Any new priorities since PoP came out? Any recomended upgrades or things i should ditch altogether?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pretty good considering what I had at that level.  Keep working on your epic.  Coldain Skin Gloves would be an upgrade for your hand slot.  Pretty much your getting to where you need to start raiding to get decent upgrades that won't cost you an arm and a leg.  Some camps can be done with 1-2 groups.  Check out other magelo's for ideas and look up allakhazam's for locations of the drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i used to have coldain skin gloves, but i sold them after i looted those gloves, they where a slight upgrade and i used the pp for the earing quest</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>EverNewbie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I might sugest a little more wis gear and more focus effect items. Mainly haste and cost reduction items. If you get some reduce cost gear you could prolly get away with the lower wis. You'll wanna hit your soft cap though considering theres still mana to 255 wis. As grim said it would prolly be good if you could get your epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">actually, you need to work on hitpoints, not wis. You have plenty of wis but are pretty low on hps atm. What type of resourses do you have atm(guild/plat/farming type group) that helps to know when making reccomendations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Guild is starting to do good things, we raid planes regularly, are starting in HoT (im to young to go with ATM) and theres almost always a few dozen people to find a group with, might be harder for farming or camping but im sure i could do it<br />
<br />
I have about 3k in the bank and a few k of stuff to sell, but its not exactly main line popular stuff so it would take a while to sell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ditch the supple scale armband and replace it with a Coldain Military Bracelet ( see the quest section for a walk through for them, i wrote it).  Boots, Tribal warboots are nice.  Work on your epic.  There is a very nice shield from Katta (quest) that would be a good upgrade.<br />
<br />
Widda</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">thanks for the suggestions, ill get to work on those quests, which shield is it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">earring: black sapphire electrum<br />
bracer: barbed rubicite or coldain<br />
arms: camp hardened grey flesh(grey near ssra) or crystal chitin(velks)<br />
mask:crystal spider eyes(800pp or velks)<br />
bp: iksar regen bp(5k or trak teeth with a tracker)<br />
shoulders:Paldrons of witness(2k)<br />
back(shimmering terrorhide(200 or camp a heiro cloak in seb)<br />
legs:thurg or ss quest when you get a few more levels, also pog legs are nice or even brown chitin legs<br />
boots:boots can be tough, but I would go with dusty soriz boots for a great affordable option(700)<br />
gloves:those are ok, coldain are nicer as are shissar(camp shissar in the grey, near where the sleeves drop.<br />
<br />
Those are some easy upgrades to get you some more hps untill you have a larger cash base or are a bit higher to raid some nicer stuff.<br />
ps: that is shield of bane warding, your shield is nicer I think</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ya, id rather not spend 20k or do the quest for extra wis and loose my hp.<br />
<br />
I used to have an iksar BP, but sold it, the stats on the polished tin where very nice, and i made about 3.5k on the switch, i also used to have coldain skin gloves, but sold them for cash after i looted the leaf scale<br />
<br />
Thanks for the upgrade ideas tho, ill get right on those.</div></div><hr />
