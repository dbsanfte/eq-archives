<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Karadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">was looking on the MT board under tradeskills and I see 2 shamans with skill of 188, thought skill was capped at 180..am I missing something?<br />
<br />
KAradan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Typo, should be 180.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">188 is probly a miss type<br />
<br />
alchemy STOPS at 180<br />
<br />
there is no mystery .. no secerts .. was just a typo<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
now keep in mind 188 is the majic numberr for 2 other tradeskillz<br />
<br />
188 Pottery  is where it it STOPS BEING EASY .. you can do zombie skins up to 188 .. farm the hell outta unrest .. terrorize the noobs there .. KS the whole zone (hell i did) .. once your up to 188 it gets cant raise your skill with out expensivve components or enchantad clays <br />
<br />
 188 Baking  is where it it STOPS BEING EASY .. with the arrival of luclin baking got alot easier ... centi meats&amp;toes will PL you to 188 in a flash (mindwurm meats too .. but there a bitch to get and cant solo them) a simple easy 3 item combine that farming them gives good exp even at 60.. post 188 you have to do many trivial lower level combines .. with 8+ item combines ... farm green mobs all day .. its just a headache and not worth the time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, there are actually 2 ways to increase your EFFECTIVE alchemy past 180.<br />
<br />
1.  Philospher's stone - adds 10% to alchemy.  180+18 = 198.  Assuming this effect actually works (there was a patch that indicated once it had been fixed), you should do better on high level potions.  I haven't noticed a big effect on Luclin potions, but hey, I don't have that kind of pp to test it.<br />
<br />
2.  Alchemy mastery - this is one of the &quot;stellar&quot; shaman AA skills.  It has 3 levels, each of which increases the probability of making a successful potion.  Supposedly this is how to &quot;trivialize&quot; making Luclin potions.  However, AC1 costs 3 AA points, AC2 requires 6 AA points, and AC3 requires a whopping 9 AA points.  I know of no one who had put any AA points into this complete waste of time skill.  The bottom line is, who cares if you can make 10 dose clarity potions for 1600pp instead of 2400pp?<br />
<br />
So you want ubah alchemy skills?  Then head out to Greig's End for you philospher's stone, then spend the next 6 months compiling AA points.  You'll be the envy (or more likely pity) of your guild.</div></div><hr />
