<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This was just posted by Brenlo on the official site. Link &lt;a href=&quot;http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=62349&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.<br />
<br />
Here it is in full...<br />

-------------------<br />
<br />
Hey folks,<br />
<br />
I wanted to give you all an update on what we are planning for the coming weeks as we work on some persistent in-game issues.  We know that many of you are concerned with the current state of the game and we feel confident that the changes we have planned will help to alleviate many of your concerns.  <br />
<br />
First on our plate, and number one on your list of concerns, is collision in EverQuest.  We are working hard to fix the current problems with collision and have many fixes currently on Test.  We will most likely be pushing these collision fixes to the Live servers tomorrow, June 3rd at 3AM PDT.  Many of the current issues appear to be resolved with this latest push and our programmers are still working hard to track down and fix any remaining issues.  For those of you on Test, thanks very much for your help in getting these issues to Grumbak.<br />
<br />
We are also scheduling out many other fixes, with the first round going to the Test server this week, and subsequent rounds as the changes are made.  Currently planned to hit Test this week are the following proposed changes;<br />
 <br />
- Add a quest to allow the exchange of Gates of Discord spells.<br />
- Correct an issue with the berserker epic quest that left some berserkers unable to complete the quest.<br />
- Improve the Eagle Eye spell series.<br />
- Increase the spawn rate of the Shattered Emerald of Corruption.<br />
- Change berserker snare to have a set duration.<br />
- Correct the pathing in Txevu.<br />
 <br />
Please remember that this is only the first round of planned changes and there are many more to come.  As more changes are rolled out to the Test server, I will post them.  Please feel free to discuss these changes on the EQ forums at eqforums.station.sony.com.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all of your feedback this past week.  You have shown, once again, what a strong community EQ has, thank you for being an active part of it!<br />
<br />

I'm very happy about the idea to allowing trading of GoD spells.<br />
<br />
Edit: Actually, the way they worded the spells part seems like it can be taken a few ways.</div></div><hr />

I can see those spells in the bazaar for about onehundredbillions PP<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>MrWoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I hurt for the zerkers.<br />
<br />
Still it pisses me off that another class was added. One more class to balance. And now cause of all the work they need all the other problems with this game are just gonna get pushed farther back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">while we're at it let's make ensnaring concoction potions have fixed duration too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't see them making the spells tradeable with other players. <br />
<br />
I suspect (and I am making it up as I go along) they will implement a design to allow a player with another no-drop class spell to be able to swap it out for a spell of their class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">that would be a wee bit too complitated for words.  <br />
1) Wizard A loots shaman_spell1.<br />
2) Shaman A wants shaman_spell1, but needs wizardspell1, 2, or 3 to be able to trade for it.  <br />
3) Shaman A:  WTB wizardspell1!<br />
4) Druid A: I have wizardspell1, trade you for druidspell2<br />
5)Shaman A: ARgh!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Land,<br />
<br />
Only if you think to hard man. Sheesh.<br />
<br />
Turn in a spell of any class, to get a spell for YOUR class...<br />
<br />
Frankly it's just parchments, but the option of SOMEONE being able to scribe it immediately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">So EQ is at an all-time low in customer satisfaction and this is what they come up with? And this is still only on the Test server - not even any guarantee that this will go live or when.<br />
<br />
This sure wont make me start playing again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It sounds like the rangers did a good job convincing them. You guys who care about this stuff should go read the ranger board and see what it is they did right in communicating style. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tickmunki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I am still the wait and see mind set. I believe if you expect the wrongest, and the something better happens and its a improvement, I happy. In another words, I think they will do changes, but not as good, as the need to be. So therefore, any changes that improves, the game, is good thing. <br />
<br />
Peace OUT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Land,<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
I think they should just go back to parchments now, because if this is how its going to work, it kind of reverts us back to the &quot;Says shaman, but really, any class can &quot;turn-in&quot; and use&quot; thing that we have seen in the past with topic such as NBG vs /Ran.<br />
<br />
Shaman spell drops.<br />
Wizard_01 tells the group: &quot;Hey, can I roll on that, I am still missing some of my Gates spells, I can turn it in for a Wizzie one&quot;<br />
<br />
Shaman_01 tells the group: &quot;But I dont have that one, I can mem it now&quot;<br />
<br />
Cleric_01 tells the group: &quot;I want to roll too, I need ALL my Gates spells!&quot;<br />
<br />
/shrug. Make em runes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I agree. Runes would make a hell of a lot more sense. But the system I made an example of is STILL better than random nodrop spells</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Wulfgar pointed out in the &quot;Spell Distribution&quot; thread that there are now 3 types of Geomancy Stones on Lucy, so it would appear that it will be a rune-type system, rather than specific spells still dropping.</div></div><hr />
