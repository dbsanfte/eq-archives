<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thalarctos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, my guild is pretty small, and we just went to east ToV for the second time last night.  The first time they went was over a month ago, we had a lvl 60 shaman (who has since left) and I was lvl 50 and consequently didn't go.  So now we have two shaman at lvls 57 and 55(me).  Last night I had a great time, but ate 6 deaths and don't really know what I'm doing, so I hope one of you can point me in the right direction.<br />
<br />
So, when we got started in HoT, our debuff/slow team consisted of me and a lvl 60 chanter.  On the first could of pulls, she couldn't land a magic based slow on anything even after tash.  I got a couple resists and figured I didn't have a hope of ever landing a magic based slow.  So, I started waiting for the MA to get agro and call for the attack.  I'd cast insidious decay, and then go hide behind the wall for 30 seconds or so.  The chanter would land tash, and then I'd use plague of insects.  It landed most times, and helped a little I think.  I'd get them slowed around 75 percent health.  The downside was getting agro a few times and getting dropped like a box of rocks.  I read this forum a lot and I was lulled by all these uber-shaman saying how wussy some dragons were.  Well, my 2800hps and 1k ac didn't mean squat when I got agro from these dragons which I assume are soooo much wussier then the named ones people are solo'ing in WW.  We got 10 armor drops (6plate, 1chain, 2silk 1leather) which was pretty exciting and I had a great time even eating six deaths as I did (thank the heavens for an epic cleric!).  Of course the chain drop were gloves, which are not as good as my CC gauntlets I don't think, so I didn't roll.<br />
<br />
We're going back tomorrow night, and I'd like to help more and die less.  We'll have the 57 shaman with us this time, but I don't think he has plague of insects, and his ac is about 200 less then mine.  Can anyone give me some pointers for a situation like this?  or know of any 'lowbie raids for dummies' guide or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Get level 60.  Malo really is key.<br />
<br />
Beyond that, slow the mobs and eat a death is all that comes to mind.  If you have a choice between hitpoints or AC, choose hitpoints, that way the clerics can keep you alive easier.<br />
<br />
Got mages?  Presumably you don't have a mage that has Mala, but if you have one that can chain cast Malosini it will help you get the magic based slow in if they manage to get it to stick.<br />
<br />
Got bards?  Occlusion of sound (that right name?) is pretty handy for getting magic based slows to stick.  <br />
<br />
Blow some money and take some stinging wort potions with you for those moments when you have a cheal coming, but you probably won't make it.  Kind of expensive, but saves time because raid doesn't have to wait for rez effects on you.   It sounds kind of like they have it under control without slow though so stinging wort potions may be overkill.<br />
<br />
Edit: Make damage shield potions and hand them out to the main tanks.  Unslowed mobs tear themselves up on Mage + Potion + Bard damage shields.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah you're gonna need Malo or Mala to have much luck landing Turgurs consistantly, imo.<br />
<br />
If you have a bard have them use their drums to play Occlusion.  With good tash and good occlusion you could probably stick malosini.   Bards can also attempt to slow, while you do.  Keep good communication with the bard doing Occlusion, it doesn't last very long just like 12 seconds.  So let them know when the mob is slowed or when you are giving up.<br />
<br />
If you want to use disease based slow, split the duty with another shaman.  Make the other guy do insidious decay, then you do POI, since you said he doesn't have it.   <br />
<br />
If the 25% slow is making enough difference for you to use cleric healing mana or delay things by needing a rez/rebuff then keep up with it.  If your raid is doing fine without it...well...You can also get one of your warriors to use a slow weapon like a truncheon of doom or depend on an epic ranger.   There's been a few times in HoT where I couldn't stick slow for anything and bard slow or slow proc off the truncheon of doom has saved us.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One other thing that seems to help is when casting slow get right up on his belly. While you may need to dodge yer friends blades between magic blasts and claws, the proximity seems to help a fair bit.  This holds true for all mobs not just the dragons.  I have seen arguments that say proximity doesn't matter as long as your in range. All I can say is try it and draw your own conclusions. Lvl 60 and malo make a tremendus difference, but even with that I still just have bad nights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">IMHO, you need either mala/malo or OoS to land a slow consistantly in HoT. We tried it once without a 55+ bard and without a 60 mage or shaman. Me (59) and a 60 chanter landed like 3-4 slows in like 4-5 hours :) Here's the posted debuff order we follow in HoT:<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
The following information is geared to core debuffs on high-level, high-resist, raid-type encounters, like HoT. As such, I'm not dealing with non-core debuffs like SK ATK taps etc. <br />
<br />
Generally, you want a 55+ bard, 60 shaman with malo and a 57+ enchanter as your debuff squad due to spell selection and resists; however, a 60 mage can mala, a far more common spell, and then a 58-60 shaman can serve as a slower. Also, a 55+ bard, 60 mage and 60 chanter can work if the chanter slows, but this leaves the chanter casting two very high aggro spells, tash and slow. It works, just plan on rezzing the chanter a few times. Frankly, I even prefer a two shaman slow team to alternate slow attempts to keep aggro down. <br />
<br />
Debuffing should always be done in two waves, the low aggro and the high aggro. The low aggro spells are recants/annuls, malXXX, and occlusion of sound. Spells like slow and tash are terribly high aggro, and should be reserved for after aggro lock has been established. This is key in that the primary goal to having a whole debuff order is to ensure all the debuffs stack property and, most importanly, to make sure extra aggro is not built up by casting a debuff before resists have been properly lowered. Casting slow before tash and getting resisted will only get you A) killed B) extra aggro so that when you try to slow next, you've now built up enough aggro go back to option A. <br />
<br />
So, since the goal is minimize the number of debuffs attempts, you MUST ALWAYS ANNOUNCE IN THE PROPER RAID CHANNEL when a resist debuff has landed. ALWAYS. Do NOT tell me you always cast that debuff 30 seconds into a fight. People go LD, lag, pick the wrong target, whatever. Seeing the message triggers the next debuff in the chain while a resist may prompt other action. Communication is key here. That said, debuffs like cripple really don't require a call since no specific action will follow. Melee best not be waiting for cripple to land before they attack, while wizzies will most certainly be waiting for resists to be debuffed fully before unloading. But calling out cripple really doesn't hurt anything either. <br />
<br />
The order (paranthetical notation reflects cumulative resist debuffs): <br />
<br />
MA engages pull. <br />
<br />
1) recant magic, if needed, to strip off DS/buffs within the first 5 seconds. (annul is only half as effective) <br />
2) occlusion of sound (minimum of fire -10 cold -10 magic -10) <br />
3) malo (fire -55 cold -55 magic -55 poison -45) (if mala is subbed, then this is 10 higher) <br />
<br />
Wait for melee to lock aggro. <br />
<br />
4) tash (fire -55, cold -55, magic -95, poison -45) (note, some brave chanters do this before lock is called. I see no reason to since you won't be slowing until aggro is locked) <br />
5) malosini (fire -70, cold -70, magic -110, poison -60) (this may take a few attempts) <br />
6) slow (attempting before malosini lands is OK if you have gauged resist rates, but it's best to wait)* <br />
7) ro's disjunction (fire -133, cold -70, magic -110, poison -60) <br />
8) scent of terris (totally optional and not generally needed) (fire -166, cold -70, magic -100, poison -96, disease -33) <br />
<br />
The last phase of debuffs really can go in any order. <br />
<br />
9) cripple** <br />
10) asphyxiate <br />
11) mana pool debuffs (only needed on CH'ing mobs like Vox) <br />
12) ensnare (if needed) <br />
<br />
The end result, at the minimum, is this: <br />
<br />
fire -166, cold -70, magic -100, poison -96, disease -33 <br />
<br />
Note: If the bard has drums of the beast, you use Insidious Decay, the druid is 58+, the necro is 56+, you end up with: <br />
<br />
fire - 185, cold -85, magic -115, poison -99, disease -73 <br />
<br />
Not too shabby. <br />
<br />

The glossary: <br />
<br />
I've broken the debuff spells into five categories: primary resist debuffs, slows, melee debuffs, mana pool debuffs and dispells. This is mainly to highlight each effect, use and level needed to attain, so you can assemble the best debuff squad and assign appropriate duties. <br />
<br />
Primary resist debuffs: <br />
<br />
- Tashinian: decease magic resist by 39. 57 enc. No resist check. Poison curable. <br />
- Wind of Tashinian: AE decrease magic resist by 40; max 4 targets. 60 enc. No resist check. Poison curable. <br />
- Occlusion of Sound: decrease fire/cold/magic resist by 10-25, depending on level and instrument. 55 bard. No resist check. <br />
- Malosini: decrease fire/cold/magic/poison by 60. 57shm/58 mage. Magic resist check. Will overwrite malo/mala, which is key, tho it is not additive. <br />
- Mala: decrease fie/cold/magic/poison by 35. 60 mage. No resist check. <br />
- Malo: decrease fire/cold/magic/poison by 45. 60 shm. No resist check. Will overwrite mala. <br />
- Indsidious Decay: decrease disease resist by 40. 51 shaman. No resist check. Useful when landing Plague of Insects. <br />
- Ro's Smouldering Disjunction: decrease ac 26-27, fire resist 66-67, ATK 58-60, 150 DD. 56 druid. Magic resist check. <br />
- Scent of Terris: decrease fire resist 33-36, poison 33-36, disease 33-36. 52 necro. Poison resist check. <br />
<br />
Slows: <br />
<br />
- Turgur's Insects: decrease attack speed by 75 perecent. 51 shm. Magic resist check. Disease curable. <br />
- Tigir's Insects: AE decrease attack speed by 50 percent; max 4 targets. 58 shm. Magic resist check. Disease curable. <br />
- Plague of Insects: decrease attack speed by 25 percent. 54 shm. Disease resist check. <br />
- Forlorn Deeds: decrease attack speed by 70 percent. 57 enc. Magic resist check. <br />
<br />
That said, many mobs like AoW, Cazic 3.0 etc cannot be slowed. Before you bother attempting to slow a mob, make sure you're using the right slow (disease or magic based) and that the mob isn't flagged immune to changes in attack speed. Remember, even tho the mob may be immune, the aggro effects are added to the hate list. Seredith has compiled a great chart at: <br />
<br />
http://www.dith.demon.co.uk/slows/ <br />
<br />
Melee debuffs: <br />
<br />
Asphyxiate: decrease str 39-40, agi 39-40, 50 DD, 960 dot. 59 chanter. Magic resist check. <br />
Cripple: decrease dex 58-65, agi 68,-75, str 68-75, ac 31-33. 53 enc/shm. Magic resist check. <br />
<br />
Yes, cripple plays a key part in the debuff when you are dealing with 60+ mobs. See this thread. <br />
<br />
http://forums.interealms.com/shaman...ghlight=cripple <br />
<br />
Mana pool debuffs: <br />
<br />
- Curse of Simple Mind: decrease int and wis by 20. 29 enc. Magic resist check. <br />
- Torment of Argli: decrease int and wis by 21; 2 minute 960 DoT. 56 Enc. Magic resist check. Stacks with Curse, but not necro heart line. <br />
- Mana Sieve: decreases mana by 214 - 370. 34 enc. No resist check. <br />
- Theft of Thought: 346-400 mana tap for 25 mana with a 2 minute recast. 51 enc. Low resist magic resist check. <br />
- Color Slant: AE stun and mana seive, decreasing mana by 100. 52 enc. Magic resist check. <br />
- Lost Composition of Ervaj: decreases mana by 350 every 18 seconds, higher with epic and skills. 60 bard. Magic resist check. <br />
<br />
Note: Mana seives just reduce a target's mana. Mana taps like ToT increase the casters mana as well. <br />
<br />
Note 2: Contrary to popular belief, mana sieving has little effect on whether or not a mob is likely to gate or not, since the gate spell cost so little mana. It has more effect on mobs that cast large heals like CH, like Vox. <br />
<br />
Dispells: <br />
<br />
Recant magic: Will remove up to 4 buffs with little aggro. 53 enc. No resist check. <br />
Annul magic: Will remove up to 2 buffs with little aggro. Many classes. No resist check. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">58 shaman here. When my guild's 60 shaman cant make HoT that leaves the raid without malo. The following is my experience doing HoT without malo:<br />
<br />
Bard and chanter land OOS and tash. Then myself and a level 58 mage begin chain casting malosini. When it sticks I start casting slow. With tash/oos/malosini on I can usualy land turgurs just fine. <br />
<br />
This works fairly well for any mob that doesnt have the word &quot;ancient&quot; in its name.  However, neither myself nor the mage can usually land a damn thing on ancient -anything- (even after tash/oos). <br />
<br />
puller: &quot;inc Ancient Big Ass Wurm&quot;<br />
  mage: /tell Conas sigh:(<br />
<br />
Sometimes they never get slowed and the chanter and I die trying. But Frequently the mage and myself will burn whole mana bars getting malosini resisted while the level 60 chanter is able to land a slow (with just tash/oos on). I dont know if its the two level difference or what. Maybe its just that chanter slows are resisted less than turgurs or malosini. But that is what happens when I go.<br />
<br />
The solution? Level and get malo. Thank god my guild has a copy in the bank waiting for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My guild is kind of in the situation you are in.  We have been to HoT twice.  The first time I was level 57, the second time I was level 58 and 57.  We have no 60 shaman in the guild, much less malo.  However we do have a 60 mage, and we have a 60 bard, and an enchanter.  I noticed that i got a few resists after mala/oos/tash, but there were always 4 shaman, 2 level 54's, a level 55, and me.  Normally one of us would get it slowed eventually.  However Often times I would start casting malosini before slow, and generally once that landed, I could land slow with no problem.  The Aggro on Slow was really bad, as this was before the hate fix, and I ate alot of deaths.  Hence being 57 and 58 througout the raid.  <br />
<br />
On our secord HoT raid, the mage had to leave, and we lost malo.  After he left we stayed for about 4 hours, and nothing got slowed in that time.  After the umteenth death, we just gave up and started using POI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Qwantum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I had quite alot of fun doing this, so I hope it helps you, and lets you have fun.  The massive agro from PoI was the reason for doing things this way, and if today's patch message it actually true, probably not as neccesary.  We were also using this because we could at least slow with PoI early in the fight, which was better than Turgurs at 30% health.<br />
<br />
First thing to do is give up trying to turgurs stuff all the time.  It's pretty random without Malo/level 60.  We worked out this routine because the 60th shaman we had at the time didn't have malo and was dying all the time because his healer wasn't watching him.<br />
<br />
The group was as follows:<br />
<br />
Me, 57th shaman<br />
60 shaman<br />
60 Druid<br />
58 Druid<br />
60 Druid<br />
60 SK<br />
<br />
I brought the 60 shaman into our group because he died 3 mobs in a row because the cleric in his group wasn't aknowledging the agro from Plague of Insects.<br />
<br />
I had been casting insidious decay (1 sec casting) when I saw the 60th shaman start PoI, so I would initially have agro, then it would jump to him when PoI landed (or was resisted) and I would start healing him.  Once in our group, we had 2 druids dedicated to healing whoever was casting the slow.<br />
<br />
Once the slow would land, the 60th shaman would call &quot;I have agro&quot;<br />
<br />
The SK would step in and do his SK thing and get agro within about 2 seconds, which still impresses the hell out of me.<br />
<br />
He would call &quot;I have agro&quot;.<br />
<br />
Whoever made the agro call would be getting 2-3 chloroblasts every few seconds to compensate for the damage they were taking.<br />
<br />
The SK would maintain agro while I was watching the mobs health, and once it decreased another 10% or so I would call something like &quot;ok, dump it&quot; and he would FD and dump the agro to the, by this time, frustrated main tank.<br />
<br />
This let us slow the mob immediately, with the only real delays being spell casting times.   Once we had this system down my group controlled agro for maybe 30 seconds at the beginning of the fight, and then we would hand it back off to the main tank.  <br />
<br />
These were West ToV mobs, but I wouldn't expect a huge difference from the HoT mobs.<br />
<br />
The only mob we couldn't slow were the green drakes, btw.  This technique worked fine on everything else.  Blue drakes, blake drakes, ancient whatever.<br />
<br />
It was seriously fun to coordinate like this.  Xenomist, our SK, could absolutely steal agro from the slowing shaman, which impressed the hell out of me.  Normally there was at least a 20 second delay before the main tank reasserted agro control over the mob, which usually would = dead shaman.  (thats with both me and the 60th shaman having AC's above 1000).<br />
<br />
Anyway, this was fun, had good coordination, and was a group mix that got us xp once in a while (druid nukes land well on WToV mobs).<br />
