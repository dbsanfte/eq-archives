<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">PoH is an easy solo at 65now...it is a joke really..cleric mobs make life unhappy, if you pull 2 it is really bad.  anything near zone in is a joke.  you have to move really far from zone in before things can even hit hard enough to kill you.<br />
agro range is super small, only thing to watch out for is the golems and bone dragons.  golems will take grummus to slow and you need to be in melee range to slow the bone dragons.<br />
i farmed stuff for the ranged item quest and found that it can't be compleatly soloed.  i gave up since hate got boring REALY fast and no one ever wanted to go to help /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ah ok thanks for info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>golumm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well I managed to solo a few hours in the tiers 4 of PoH , but you have to know what you're doing . I think bringing a group to learn how the things work before trying to solo is a good idea , there are lots of wanderers . Xp is damn good , cash also ( up to 20 plats per drow ) , but if you come here for the marsinger quest , it's WAY better to bring a group , nameds are damn rare ( sometimes many hours without seing one ) and books / signets are painful to get alone , believe me.<br />
<br />
If you solo here , be sure to bring a 1K pp insta gate potion to save a trip back to POH for a summon corpse  ;)  .  A few things in tiers 1 -2 see invis , but after it's quite easy to visit the place and check the named PHs . <br />
<br />
In tiers 4 ( the place you ll want to solo if you want xp ) Drows roughly have 25k hp , they come as warriors , sk , cleric or necros . Nothing summons , even nameds wich are 65 ; normal mobs hit for 550-600 , nameds for up to 900 ; at 65 without any defensive/offensive aa and a humble gear ( I have 2k7 unbuffed ) , I can manage to keep a room of 4 mobs and a roamer or 2 down before repop . <br />
There isn't really safe spots so you will want to time the repop and check the roamers .<br />
<br />
As usual at this level , VP3 is the key ; you can single almost everything with it , aggro is really small .<br />
<br />
<br />
The tiers 1 to 3 are a joke for us , juste avoid the 65 nameds ( corrupter of life &amp; the 65 sk which is immune slow , forgot his name ) .<br />
<br />
PS:sorry for the crap english, I'm french .</div></div><hr />

that site has the best map of the new hate that exsists on the net.  For soloing your probly gonna want to stay in 3/4 th teirs (marked on map)  3rd teir stuff your looking at mobs about even with golems in Valor but less hp.  THe 4th teir stuff is 656 hitters.  The agro ranges in this zone are very low.<br />
<br />
If you can get a monk partner (I 2 box monk/shaman)  you can easily get the range item on both my cha's magelos.  Nearly as good as secrets of the planes perhaps better from a casters perspective.  Need to split some 3 spawn rooms  and nameds hit for 800's (4th teir ones that is) all fully slowable so not ot bad.</div></div><hr />

How long did it take you to get the etched priest crest (quest2) and tome of dark healing (quest3)?  I have been xping in hate very regularly the last few weeks and after many hours waiting for even the signet to drop, I have yet to see either the crest or the tome.  I have also read that the drop rate on the tome is about 10x worse than the other classes.  Also, when did you complete your quests?  Any info would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The drops are painful, and you won't be able to hold down more then a couple of the named spawns in tier 4 alone, most likely just one.  Your best bet is to bring a group with an enchanter or ballsy cleric to pacify pull the spawns, then all you have to kill is phers.  Doing it that way, you can easily hold down all of the tier 4 named mobs, whis will net you a full set of quest pieces in an average of 40 hours or so.  The tome of dark healing is the hardest of the drops to get.  The aforementioned website says it can drop in any tier off named priests, but I have only seen it drop from the Archon and Evangelist.  To give you perspective, I got mine finished with the help of friends and during the questing earned roughly 35AA's at a similar XP rate as 1 group fighting in Tactics.  It can be a hellishly long camp.  My monk was there the whole time too, and he still lacks 2 pieces.</div></div><hr />

With just me 2 boxing monk and shaman I was able to hold down 3 named areas down (when working on monks Overlord/dreadlord/spymaster and with shamans Arch priest arch lich and arcanist).  The tomb of dark healing is more rare than the dissertation of dark war,  however the pages for the 4th gem for preists are more common than the texts of pain that melee need.  Texts of pain are the most rare drop in the quest.  To get the tomb make sure you keep down the arch priest named spot that is what i got mine off of.    For me the first thing I got was the 2nd signet on both cha's.  Got them while farming the named in 4th teir  they are rare but the other stuff is more rare almost no doubt you will have it by the time you finally see tomb+ all your 4th teir pages.  Going back and getting the cards for the first one was the most annoying for me.  <br />
<br />
Getting both Marsinger gems took me about 3 weeks in hate I was getting 5-7 aa per day up there though so was quite nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grixx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I really like PoHate.  I'm using a 61 Shaman, 57 SK.  I've done some hunting right at the zone-in and it's pretty easy (other than the clerics which are a pain).  Any tips or suggestions you'd offer for better camp spots (I'm looking at the maps on that site - thanks) or what do you think I could handle?  Would like to do the quests for both toons.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ccoderman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">can you bind in hate? and if so where is a safe spot to bind at?<br />
thinking i might try playing around up there in a bit, but if i have to find a wizard port all the time and buy the component i won't bother.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My last visit to POH 2 months ago I could not bind at zone in.<br />
<br />
I think it safe to believe you cannot bind in that zone.<br />
