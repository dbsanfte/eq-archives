<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Durich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Recently my guild has been doing more and more non rooted or mobs that just are not practical to corner. Its becomming a cronic problem with our raids that we can not determine what is causing the mob to fly over the head of the MT. We also have the mob being tossed around side to side and the walking in the circle problem both of which are not being solved via balanced melee on both sides.<br />
<br />
We have tried balancing the melee, eliminating all knock back procs and so on. My Question to the Shamans out there is this;<br />
<br />
What Spells or Procs cause huge Knockback?<br />
<br />
What techniques can we use to minimize the mob flying over the head of the MA ( we all ready balance rogues on the back side with other melee on the sides)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All nukes push a little bit even though they don't have it listed in spdat.<br />
<br />
Simply alternate direction every 2nd nuke, ie turn north, nuke, turn south, nuke, turn north, nuke, turn south, nuke etc etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pets also cause significant push, especially Beastlord and Shaman pets.  Mage water and air pets can cause alot of push as well.  Either eliminate unncessary pets or you are just gonna have to have a tank that is able to move quickly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My guild does this:<br />
<br />
1) Pets are not allowed, especially AA swarm pets (this is for all classes).<br />
2) Rogues attack from behind.<br />
3) All other melee attack from the sides.<br />
4) Paladin stuns and monks with dragon punch are used for initial positioning and to compensate for overpush in one direction.<br />
<br />
Once your melees stop being tards and learn which side is &quot;the back&quot; and which side is &quot;the side&quot; you're pretty much set.<br />
<br />
All this is assuming that the MT can't back in to a corner and keep the mob pinned there (&quot;aow it&quot; as well call it).  If you can do that, feel free to go buck wild with the pets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So Like with our AA VP if you face one way no matter if your in front or back of the mob that is the way the push of you spell is going to go? The Velocity of you spell is in relation to the caster not the mob?<br />
<br />
Makes Sence to me as thats the one thing we have not tried yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That is entirely correct Durich.<br />
<br />
A clear way to demonstrate the effect is to get a cornerable target and part way through get all your nukers to face away from the corner, after a few seconds the mob will noticably be pushed out.<br />
<br />
Can be very clearly seen on Fenin Ro fights where he tends to get shoved into and almost through the wall of his building, get the wizards and a couple of Paladins to face away and cast and he pops back out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Try this - find a mob with some insane HPs(those things in growth are great for it). Take a day off exping and take your guild there to kill them. You'll get great practice in keeping them from moving. let MT build agro,then send all melees in. The tank chooses which way the mob gets pushed. All melees except for MT stays behind the mob. if the mob is getting pushed too far one way, the tank moves in the opposite direction and the rest of the melees have to move with him. Keeps everyone on their toes, my guild was doing it for some time, and it worked great.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, of all the mage pets the water pet causes the least push. It is a rogue and does not bash or kick. The Air pet is by far the worst for push, followed by the earth pet (shouldn't be used on raids due to root), and then the fire pet (minimal push).<br />
<br />
Also, all mage Magic spells have a very small pushback component. On fights like Fennin where fire spells won't land, magic is all we have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Eatbugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">All nukes push a little bit even though they don't have it listed in spdat.<br />
<br />
True, but this isn't the reason for push problems in most cases. (Chain casting a no-push spell can't push as much as one Warrior, Monk or Ranger in melee.)  There's a great list of push on spells at this site (http://personal.ghguild.com/croso/pushback.htm).  (Personally, I was surprised to find that a number of DoTs have push. Mostly the ones with an initial DD component, but a few without the DD have push as well.)<br />
<br />
As for pets - they don't actually have more push than a melee class with the same number of attacks, it's just that a pet will move in instantly to close the gap when something moves away from it.   Position a fast attacking melee class (same % haste as the pet) on the other side of a mob and the mob will go nowhere.  The problem with pets and raid push is that most pet owners don't reposition pets to account for push the way melee players reposition themselves...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">really, it is melee's problem, pet's push is really small compare to melee; I been test with a monk and he can out-push my 5+1 pet easily because fly kick !! <br />
<br />
also duo with rogue lots and notice their push is also huge too<br />
<br />
some stun line spell also have good push, like paladin or wizard<br />
<br />
anyway, people alway like say it is pet's fault when there are something wrong, it should be melee's fault for most of push</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Shrink the MT so he fits farther into the corner.<br />
<br />
Make sure the non-MT melee are at max melee range.<br />
<br />
No swarm pets if push is going to be a problem.<br />
<br />
The turning around to nuke thing is a great idea, never thought of that.</div></div><hr />
