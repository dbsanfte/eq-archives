<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Oongah Boongah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just curious how many of you old timers are still bound in the pot room?  With the release of Luclin, it's becoming more and more tempting to rebind in the Nexus, but I just can't seem to be able to do it.  Might be more for sentimental reasons, or just the sense that there's no turning back, but I'm finding it very hard to decide.  I'm just not sure the pluses out outweigh the negatives anymore.  It's great for Antonica and Kunark, but how much time do I really spend there anymore?  There's the occasional Fear raid, and now the new Cazic Thule, and of course access to my home town...and I do use the Cabilis pot all the time.  However, it sucks for Velious, and although the GFay spires are only a pot away, it still sucks zoning in only to see &quot;The Spires will become active again in 15 minutes&quot;.   Oh, let's not forget the random chance of a nice Faydedar death loop, though I've only died to him once in all the time I've been bound there.  Finally, I can't bind near where I'm raiding, which can't be problematic at times, expecially for something like a VP raid.  It's starting to feel more like burden.<br />
<br />
Anyone else fighting the same dilemma?<br />

<br />
Anyone want to let me in on the secret? :0<br />
<br />
Where and what is the &quot;pot room&quot;?<br />
<br />
From the way you are talking, it sounds like its teleports to other zones in it or something??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I used to be bound in the pot room.  <br />
<br />
About halfway through Velious though it was getting way too problematic with corpse recovery being a real pain.  By the time I got into Plane of Mischief, I changed my bind.<br />
<br />
If you spend any significant time in Luclin there is absolutely no reason to be bound in the pot room imho.<br />
<br />
With the way travel to Luclin the way it is.  I find it much easier to be bound in the Bazaar, rather then having to wait at the wizard spires for teleports to the nexus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Oongah Boongah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The &quot;pot room&quot; is the hidden room under the spires in Timorous Deep.  In the room is a teleporter to each city in Odus/Antonica/Faydwer with the exception Qeynos, plus 1 to Cabilis in Kunark.  For the first week that Kunark was out, people were allowed to bind in TD, but was removed, because Verant didn't want people binding in the pot room.   However, those that did manage to bind there were allowed to keep their bind spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hey, VI, here's a novel idea.<br />
<br />
How about changing your mind and letting people bind in the pot room again?<br />
<br />
Anyone from VI listening?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">/agree Gardeltron<br />
<br />
I go out there every few patches just to test if they've changed it.  Nearly everyone is bound in Nexus now, so not like it would matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Or at least let people bind anywhere else in TD. No reason to nerf a whole zone just for one tiny area. If they can make certain areas within a zone bindable (like FoB, FM, NK), surely they can do the opposite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Oh, let's not forget the random chance of a nice Faydedar death loop, though I've only died to him once in all the time I've been bound there. <br />
This doesn't happen anymore because he doesn't spawn.<br />
<br />
I am still bound there and I have ZERO intentions of rebiding anywhere else.<br />
<br />
It is still infinitly easier to self port myself to Gfay spires to wait for a luclin  or wizard ride, or to get to Misty Rings for a druid ride.<br />
This way you have easy access to any guild &quot;port-ho&quot; that happens to be out and about.<br />
<br />
And with the nexus gateway it's even feasible to get yourself to velious (great divide) in less then 10minutes.<br />
<br />
It's also great if you want to do some quick experience hunting in less crowded places like Permafrost, Hole, SolB, Cazic Thule.<br />
<br />
As I see it, there is no other place even remotely close to the versatility of the firepot room.</div></div><hr />

I wish...this is what happened the other night. Myself my wife and a wizzy friend were going to log out at the hidden isle for a fayd kill the next night. Wizzy ports us to DL we run to FV take the boat run though TD and get to the isle. We're all tired ready to get some sleep...well wizzy ports us to SRO by accident. /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Oongah Boongah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I thought he didn't spawn anymore either since they put in the druid epic trigger, but assure you the real Faydedar does indeed still spawn.  I admit I hadn't heard a peep from him in at least half a year to a year, but about a month ago, I was jacked by him twice within the span of about 2 weeks.    Went back with my guild to kill him on one of those occassions and he dropped malo as well as the regular assortment of kunark dragon loot/spells.  This definately wasn't the druid triggered Faydedar, as I know he doesn't drop anything other than the epic piece.  First time he attacked me, I was sitting on top of the spires naked, having died on a raid.  Needless to say, that was the one time I died.  Made for a fun corpse recovery, since my corpse was naked, and all the guild clerics were still on the raid.  After the raid, I began pulling the corpse towards the ogre island, but I missed a /corpse at one point right in the middle of nowhere, and didn't notice for quite a while.  Spend about half an hour trying to relocate it.   After finally finding it and dragging it to the chessboard, I stopped for a second to get my bearings, but accidently right clicked on my naked corpse when I went to turn.  You can imagine the panic I must have felt :)  I tried to stay in loot mode until a cleric made it out there, but apparently you time out of loot mode in about 10 minutes.   Fortunately, it seems that naked PC corpses don't poof if they still have time on the rez clock and a friendly guild cleric made it out there in time to rez me.   Have to say that was the worst corpse retrieval experience I've ever had.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
He does still spawn there. I use the firepots quite a lot and the first I knew he was about was when I was feared, then about 10-20 seconds later I was dead. ;)<br />
<br />
The non druid version heads towards the chessboard to fight the iksar grandmaster, who defeats him everytime. Or so I've heard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">ok ok OK....maybe he still does spawn :( , but he doesn't last long.<br />
<br />
I haven't had a run in with him for over a year, or so. <br />
Whenever they made the druid epics go live more or less.<br />
And I am at the pot rooms several times a day.<br />
<br />
He use to be quite an occurence and a pain (ie several deaths), but I haven't heard hide-nor-hair of him in eons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I never did bound there, but I sure used it alot.   Although nowadays, I don't.   I'm bound in Shadow Haven, so I can use the bank/get supplies/get to Nexus quick.  Not that it gets me everywhere close, but good enough for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I would bind in that room in a second if I could. Gets me to Cabilis, Neriak and Gfay in a hurry. I love that place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">A funny thing with Faydedar is if you try to trigger the druid epic version and the real Faydedar, is up the trigger mob will despawn and nothing will happen.<br />
<br />
Though the real version should still load Nagafen loot. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Andras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Being firept bound has kept me playing the game, even with less then 2 hours of play time as the longest time I get in game in one session.  I'm never more then 15 min from any zone in old world and kunark.<br />
<br />
I've been spending time in Velious zone recently and replaced 'gate' with 'SoC' cause I did not plan on leaving until I could get my range-slot Seal.  (8 snow griffen eggs, argh!)<br />
<br />
I cannot imaging being bound anywhere else, I still fear to use my 'bind' spell and I'm freaked out every time I play an alt and end up anywhere other then the pot room after a gate.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Berserker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I'm Still bound in the Pot Room.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have no idea where the bind spell is except way way back in my book.  And I refuse to bind anyone.  There is always someone else available.<br />
<br />
<br />
Remeber being bound in the pot room means never having to be nice to a druid!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>AlynaRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'm still bound there as Gyrospherus, I've been tempted many times to rebind elsewhere for convince..  <br />
<br />
But being bound there comes in so useful at so many times. Gate potions for Thurdigan makes nexus the only place I can't get to instantly..<br />
<br />
But If I want to go to the nexus I port to Felwithe which is right next to the wiz spires in G fay and its a 15 minute wait at most to get to the nexus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Another option for the Nexus portal, is to run to Dreadlands from cabalis. With a horse, or with cheetah/scale this isn't too bad.<br />
If your really lucky, you have a DL port range item from Grieg.:D<br />
<br />
Dreadlands portal always seems to be on a different timer then the Gfay spires. Gfay and Odus spires always seem to be in sync.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">And I refuse to bind anyone<br />

&quot;I go out of my way to be an ass&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Before you take something out and start acting like a jerk lets look at the facts.<br />
<br />
1.  &quot;I have no idea where the bind spell is except way way back in my book&quot;  Guess what I don't have access to bind for all intents and purposes its lost.<br />
<br />
2.  What is lost if I have the wrong thing targeted when I cast bind is to great to allow even a mistake to happen.<br />
<br />
3.  Pretty much everyone who is bound at the firepots will never cast bind on anyone.<br />
<br />
<br />
So just cause you are not bound there and love to take things out of context shows who is the real Ass!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">rotfl.<br />
<br />
thumbs up! class act!<br />
<br />
I'll try that one next time....<br />
<br />
oh you wanted X buff? Oh thats in my spellbook somewhere, not really sure where so I cant cast it on you.<br />
<br />
Just poking a little fun at you dont get your panties in a wad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I changed my bind to the Bazaar. I looked at it in this way. How much time do I spend in any zones other than the moon or ToV lately? For the most part the answer is I spend no time in the old world, and very little in Kunark. For those rare instances that i DO travel to Cazic/Fear or Sebilis, I have potions with me for that. Now, if the firepot room had a firepot to ALL cities in all continents and the moon, then that would be pretty sweet. However, since it doesn't, I am not missing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I dont even bind in the nexus cause im too lazy to run to Sebilis.  Swamp is a pain in the ass so I usually stay bound at seb bub.</div></div><hr />

Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />
