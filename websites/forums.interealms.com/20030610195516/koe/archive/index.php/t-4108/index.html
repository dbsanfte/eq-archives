Early this morning Infinate Lyife was summoned away from the world of Norrath shortly after a small band of comrades and himself went into a charge to slay the evil beasts that have taken over the gathering place know to many as Chardok. While he sits impatiently awaiting the Gods to allow him to return to save his brethren he ponders how many of this merry band lost their life in the line of duty sworn to them by the masters of their trade. His heart grows heavy as he starts to mourn perhaps the loss of all that where relying on him to keep them alive, but he is greatly saddened as thought of what could hurt the worse…. the possibilities of a total wipeout of everyone that was there. His mind races with fear that they will never return to life to be by his side once more. &quot;Revenge!&quot; he yells, &quot;Revenge on the gods!&quot; After what seems like hours and hours, he falls asleep. Tears trickling down the side of his face from the thoughts of the loss and disappointment from the ones that might have survived the slaughter from the hellhole know as... Chardok.<br />

Earlier today the gods granted me journey back to my home world of Norrath. At times I think the gods have a poor sense of humor.  Upon awaking I found myself surrounded with the beasts that have taken over Chardok. Feeling the blows coming swift and hard on this aging Cleric I decided to try to escape the evil forces. We the speed of swift feet I ran as I felt the lashes hit my backside, cringing with each blow. As I saw the woods that burn in the near distance I felt my life force withering away to nothing. Strange enough the closer I got to these woods the less hits I felt upon my back. After the hits subsided to nothing I turned to see the creatures returning back to Chardock to regain the strength they loss from the chase. After finding a same spot to rest for the day I healed my wounds and my life force back to full. The chase has weakened me so I must rest. I will return after I’ve rested to look for signs of loss and life of the merry band that I vowed to defend.<br />
