<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kuma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am lvl 46 right now (know it is still kind of young to be thinking about it) but I was wondering what is a good lvl to start epic? I see some people start around at 50-51 while others have waited till 55-60.  Just want some adivice ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can easily start it at level 46, there are a few good reasons to start it pre-50.  The two additional rewards (shield of falsehood, black fur boots) are very nice.  Black fur boots with insta cast SoW usuable from inventory will be a vital tool for the rest of your character's existance!<br />
<br />
Another good reason is the pages you have to collect from CoM.  It would be much better to collect the pages while the area still gives you exp, rather than wait and have to camp it for days when it's green and pretty much a waste of your time.<br />
<br />
With the help of a 50s group to kill Black Dire, you can do the whole quest up to killing Kirn pre 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I started mine at like 26.  The shield and boots are pretty nice low-end items, if you can get them.<br />
<br />
You can go through the shield part with a partner at 34 easy, I soloed it at 39.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree with Glorianna. The sooner you get the boots, the better. I always thought the shield stank, but that's my personal opinion.<br />
<br />
The first bit can be done as low as your 20's, if you can do Invis Vs Animals correctly. I couldn't, so I came back at 49 with friends.<br />
<br />
The shield bit can be bought in the bazaar, but at 46, should be a breeze.<br />
<br />
Dire requires a few friends, a solid group of high 40's low 50's can take him.<br />
<br />
At 46 you can solo the entrance to CoM and get the pages, only the spectral courier requires a friend with track to get.<br />
<br />
Ghiosk books rot frequently from reaver raids, just shout that you want them and you'll get :)<br />
<br />
Kirn, Neh, the tear, and Rak all require raid forces. So you could get it as early as 46 (assuming you wanted to get your own tear), but it is only clickable at 51, IIRC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Started mine at 21 by accident... Poor Peg Leg, had to chase me to the dwarf guards...<br />
<br />
Of course, I'm 53 and still needing the tear... dammit<br />
<br />
The shield is actually pretty good until you can get an SBS or crystal chitin shield. Plus it's pretty unique-looking. I think there's maybe two other shields with the Atari graphic, both uber-level. The hardest part about getting the boots is actually turning in the pelt... There's ALWAYS some ape or raptor or something next to the puppy in the jungle. Getting to Black Dire is no problem for a few high 40's. Of course, if you have to spawn him, then you need a tougher force.<br />
<br />
A 49 shaman, 54 paladin, 53 cleric, and 56 druid is more than enough to clear the zone and waste the Advisor. You'll get some moonlight stuff, too, easy sell in the Bazaar 20pp a pop =)<br />
<br />
Also, if you're a lazy bastige or just can't get your guild excited enough to farm The Hole and CoM for days, you can faction-pump by doing the gems and shield quest. No doubt it's more fun to go the whole way, but the epic's a pretty needed piece of gear, and it's already easy as hell, compared to others... (Ashenbone drake hides, 7th island of Air, yum!)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess a tracker would be helpful, but you don't really need one, since in my experience the Spectral Courier has a set spawn point.  If you are in the stables, looking at the hallway you came in, there is a door to the right, he spawns behind that door.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">He spawned in both the east and the west stables for us. That may be his west stable spawn point, but he also spawned in the east stables as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fonzerelli SZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">at 46 bring a friend at 49 you can do it all solo up until lord ghiosk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Elder Galond</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I started at level 9.<br />
<br />
I was running through BB and the spirit was up, waited untill 14 to do the test of Patience, now I am 34 and Raiding MM with my guild on Sunday for my Pelt :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shaazharm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The question I have is in regards to equiping the Spear.<br />
<br />
Can you do the final hand in before lvl 50?  <br />
<br />
I'd love to get the epic pre 50, since I've really only used piercing and its another slot I dont need to constantly think about upgrading.<br />
Im currently lvl 39, but am mostly done except CoM battles and Hole.<br />
<br />
<br />
My other guildie done hers and is waiting on the Tear.  Apparently she by passed the Hole by doing the shield quest 4 times.  <br />
<br />
Will this still work?<br />
<br />
<br />
Looking forward to your replys.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm thinking 46 is a good level to start the epic.  If you read other posts on this board, the only thing you really need is to max ally faction by doing the Woe/Envy portion of the quest 5-10 times (skipping everything else), and then either have another shaman with a Tear MQ it with you for Rak Ashir, or loot the Tear yourself, and turn it into Rak Ashir.<br />
So really, this all boils down to two steps.  Woe/envy, and the Tear.  Good luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think Gloriana is right about doing it while you can still get XP from it.  Makes it a ton more fun and exciting.  Do a little bit at a time too so it doesn't seem like an eternity.<br />
<br />
I did the Test of Patience at about 20 and was terrified.  Great fun.<br />
<br />
Did Envy, Woe and Marr's promise at 32.  Both MoBs were even cons.  I learned a ton doing them solo that way.  DoT kiting a pally till he burns his LoH is a blast.  Seemed like it took forever to get him.<br />
<br />
Black Dire is my stumbling block now.  Unguilded and the few friends I have don't seem to play at the same times so I can never get  group together and get him.  Been considering hiring some assassins.<br />
<br />
I already have all six of the reports and Ghiosks books and I really would like my bank space back.</div></div><hr />
