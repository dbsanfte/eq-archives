Its a secret hush hush covert operation, if I told you I would have to kill you. =p<br />
<br />
P.S. It has nothing to do with giving dogdog two 1handed weapons to make him dual wield and do more damage, so whatever you do dont do that!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">give your mutt (level 44 and upwards only I believe) 2 weapons and he will dual wield, doubling his average DPS. Very, very, very useful. People are secretive about it because they think its funny, and also because they think it is actually a bug in the game that is being exploited, and if anyone ever blurted it out like I'm doing right now, SOE might see it, fix the bug, shaman class crippled, yadda yadda.<br />
<br />
But the fact is SOE probably has known about this ability of shaman pets since a looong time ago, and although it might not have been intended, they without a doubt do know about this 'feature' and as we all know, SOE wouldn't think twice about beating shams with the nerf stick (again) if there was a real problem with the pet.</div></div><hr />

(I do remember reading it yesterday, but I could be going blonde).</div></div><hr />
