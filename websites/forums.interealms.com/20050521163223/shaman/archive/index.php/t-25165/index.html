<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I expect we will find out on December 15th.  <br />
<br />
That patch will likely be the factor many players will use to make their final decision on whether to stay or go.  With several truly viable non-SOE games on the market players no longer will have to come back because the competition isn't good enough.<br />
<br />
SOEs reluctance to make any drastic changes to the game has caused the game to slide downhill for a long time.  The typical corporate mindset of &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it&quot; has brought the game to a crucial point in it's development.  If they can't come up with something soon you will see the game shrink into a cult favorite that's only played by a handful of old-timers.  <br />
<br />
The game will not likely completely disappear for years but I doubt new players will look at it as anything other than a relic of an older time.  Remember how much fun you had playing original DOOM 10 years ago?  Do you still play it?  Some people always will but I wouldn't call it a viable community any more.<br />
<br />
I expect the patch to include a lot of eye candy and convenience changes we have been asking for but no real constructive changes that will re-energize the game.  Things like pet dual wield and innate SoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The smartest thing they could do is:<br />
<br />
1) Adopt a spell system similar to EQ 2 where you get downgraded versions of all your spell immediately upon levelling. They can still use the normal hard to get versions as a useful upgrade.<br />
<br />
2) Add a lot more solo/duo content, even if it doesn't have great loot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I would say that WoW has taken quite a few people out of playing EQ, it hasn't taken nearly all the 500k+ subscribers from EQ.  Many of these people are new to the online gaming world.  Many of the servers have probably taken big hits but I am guessing that some will come back as soon as they level up their characters (I am hearing 1 month for hardcore gamers to get to 60).  People will get the longing and reminisce of how it was back in EQ1 and come back for a while then get bored and head back out and rinse and repeat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kinadorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't think the patch will change anything.  The patch will bring a few zone revamps (Splitpaw/Mistmoore) to Stormhammer, the back flagging changes, GoD AA refunds,  and an upgrade to Tacvi.  That is all I have seen mentioned.  I'm sure there will be a few other bug fixes included too.  I haven't seen anything that will make the average EQ player care  or decide to come back from WoW or EQ2.  Not that the changes are bad since they all seem like good changes but it has been almost 2 months without an update so I kind of expected more.<br />
<br />
The zone revamps would have helped but since they are on Stormhammer only most won't see them till January.  Stormhammer does deserve them first though since they pay the premium price.<br />
<br />
The Tacvi upgrade was needed back before OoW came out.  By now anyone that has Tacvi access most likely has Anguish access so I'm not sure if that revamp is going to make any difference at all.  I guess if the new items are worth it people will go back and clear Tacvi on off days.  They could at least make the Tacvi focus effects work on level 70 spells.<br />
<br />
There are still plenty of players playing EQ so I don't think any server mergers will happen.  Some players will quit while others will come back and some guilds will disband or be absorbed by other guilds.  Then things will get back to normal around January.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One important thing to remember is that just because a person might not be playing EQ every night anymore doesnt mean that they have cancelled thier account.  I have one friend that  quit playing 6 months ago and last week finally pulled the plug on her account, because she hated to lose all the effort that she put into the character.  Thats 6 mos of account time she payed for without once logging in.  Ive another set of friends that have 6 accounts between them that are now playing WoW, but still maintain the 6 accounts even though they havent logged into EQ for over a month, and have no plans to any time soon.<br />
<br />
From a financial standpoint I think that EQ has lost some subscribers, but not as many as you might thing.    If I had to guess, Id say that more than half (possibly MUCH more than half) of those that are playing another game are still paying for thier EQ accounts.<br />
<br />
I do however thing that the patch on the 15th is going to be an important one in showing how SOE is working to keep its current consumer base.  IF the flag changes go live I for one will have an incentive to continue to keep paying and playing my way through eles and finally see time/upper GoD.  <br />
<br />
Im just wondering what happened to the retroactive graphics upgrade that was being spoken and written about a few months ago.  I guess, like many things, its &quot;currently under evaulation&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Personally think SoE wont do anything.YET.<br />
<br />
As Tugela states lots of the people will still be paying for their accounts even if theyve cancelled them.<br />
<br />
At the moment all SoE will see is population on the servers being down but since when has a server being too full or too empty worried them.<br />
<br />
SoE tend to try and fix things when its too late,ie the GoD debacle and the letter from Smedley and revamp.<br />
<br />
When this will hit SoE is when peoples subscription actually runs out and the cash flow gets hit this may be when they decide to do anything.<br />
<br />
And when they do decide to do something it will probably be too little too late or they'll pull off another Guild Summit type ploy and after the hubub has died down totally forget about it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rgallnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It will be at least six months before they react to the new games at all.  Thats about how long it took for people to come back from DAoC and CoH and they found out they didnt have to do anything at all.  The real impact of WoW and EQ2 will truly be felt in six months when they see the subscribers not coming back...then we will see some action...maybe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Think u'll find for next 3-4 months ppl off playing eq2 and wow but if boredom sets in and games give nothing for hardcore players they will come back</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I tend to agree with the other posters. EQ may be aged, and withering, but its hardly dead and it certainly has a significant amount of life in it. I am willing to bet that a GOOD 90% of the people playing WoW havent actually cancelled their accounts. Wulf is right, until they see BIG cancellations, they won't make any rash decisions. <br />
<br />
Eventually, I think we are destined for some server mergers. But I dont see them going for it til Spring. Let the Holiday Blitz and the &quot;freshness&quot; of the new games wear off, see how many accounts actually get cancelled, and then they will see where they stand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">people can keep their accounts active for months, and if they don't log on the game will still die.  It's no fun to play a MMRPG without other people to play with.  They'll log on, see that nobody is around, and log back off.  Meanwhile the people who only play EQ will lose interest fast.  <br />
Server consolidation couldn't happen too soon at this point, for the health of the what remains of the game.  <br />
<br />
Btw, WoW gets a big two thumbs up from me for fun playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, maybe I'm different, but I kept my account active for all of 1 week while I played and explored WoW.  As soon as I realized how much fun a new game is, I dumped my EQ account.  I'm not gonna waste money on a game I will never play again.  Even if I get tired of WoW, I could not imagine going back to the 5 yr old EQ engine.  Just too dated and worn.<br />
<br />
Since I'm a casual player, it will take me months to get to level 60, with PvP and raiding along the way, in WoW (took me 2 yrs to make 65 in EQ btw).  So I know I have months of gameplay to look forward to.<br />
<br />
Sure, some folks have made 60 in less than 2 weeks in WoW.  If I recall, people have made 65 in less than 4 days in EQ, and when omens came out, a group made 70 in about 26 hrs.  Those that want to race to the finish will always do so.  But thankfully, those that would rather enjoy the journey have the opportunity.<br />
<br />
BTW, WoW has now exceeded 400k units sold.  Europe and Asia go live in a few weeks.  I'm sure they will get to a million units sold in less than 6 months.  Now that's nice revenue.</div></div><hr />

Your missing the difference here.  <br />
<br />
In EQ, due to 5 years of history, expansions, mudflation, etc, leveling from 1-65 is not too difficult (although the 53-60 grind still sucks), but usually requires powerleveling of sorts.  With the OoW release, you had select groups hitting 70 in zones designed for fast XP from a previous expansion.  Additionally, those people normally had out of group DPS to help them.<br />
<br />
Whereas in WoW, its a brand new game.  Hitting lvl 60 in under 2 weeks without power leveling highlights just how simple it is to level.  If it takes this long now, how will it be after 1 year and 1-2 expansions come out?  A better comparison is EQ2 where i dont think anyone has hit 50 yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">hmm for someone like me that intends to play WoW casually that will last a fair few months. I guess it all depends on how hardcore a player you are. It doesn't really make the game bad one way or another. If you play a single player game it could perhaps only last about 2 days as well. And with WoW the game doesn't end when you hit max level, you've got reply value of another character, which is perhaps more viable than the more longer timesink games, and you have the prospects of the highend game. I guess it all depends on your expectations on how hardcore you are. If you want a game that is more hardcore based then eq2 looks pretty good for that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know that my eq guild went from an average attendance of 50 to about 12 when eq2 and wow open beta started. We were a very active raiding guild 2 kills away from time. Even if I didn't like WoW after playing the beta, there wasn't much to go back to eq for. I have heard the same story from many guilds out there.  <br />
<br />
I do however extremely enjoy WoW and I'm sure there are many people that feel the same way about EQ2. Whenever I've tried another mmorpg I've never felt any kind of attachment too it like I did with eq and always went back. This time WoW just feels like too much fun and there is no question I'll be playing it for a while to come. <br />
<br />
EQ will need to start adapting some aspects of the newer games that people are having fun with if they wish to draw them back. A quest system that works would be a good start. The task system was such a piece of crap it was just an advertising gimic to try and lure some people into buying omens. The system should be more like go to city of dranik and kill 10 kyv's, 10 nocs, and 10 ukans. Give credit to the entire party for doing it, and dammit give me a good story reason to do it. Finally, the reward has to be something actually worthwhile. At level 26 in wow much of the gear I'm wearing I either made myself or got as quest rewards. Even when I first started EQ I could get much better stuff then what the newbie quests ever gave me and when you get into your 20-30's there are no quests at all worth really doing in eq. <br />
<br />
Their forced reliance on downtime especially in the early game needs to go. After combat ends it takes me about 20-30 seconds to go from zero mana and low hp to full up and rebuffed in WoW. I never did play a new character in eq for long after they enforced the buff level requirements because it was just too damn boring. Creating new characters is something that keeps a lot of people playing a game. <br />
<br />
Spell rariety is another annoying issue. I love the fact that in WoW I either need to do a quest for some class defining spells or just buy most of them off a vendor. Later on getting some upgrades may require a bit more time, but like someone else said about eq2 you will have a very useful version to begin with. Trying to get omens spells for my characters in EQ was a friggen nightmare. After losing the 20th roll on lvl 69 spells and never even seeing a lvl 70 one, whats the point?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>DevvNull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Just cancelled three accounts this weekend.  Personally, I see a lot of opportuntities with WOW, and I wouldn't be suprised to hear about the first expansion by summertime.   I actually feel that EQ is a decent game, but I'm just bored with it.  I went ahead and upgraded my account to a station pass to try out EQ2 but I just dont have the attention span to play more than one game.  If WOW was not out, I would be playing EQ2 guaranteed.</div></div><hr />

i think you are selective in your memory. when i first came to eq and they opened a new server  back in 1999, it took all of 2 to 3 weeks for the first guys then to hit 50 (the then highest level) and it was alot slower than today. for me to do the same thing took a few months.<br />
<br />
poeple in eq are close to 50, i seen sevral 44 and quite a few past 40. bound to be someone close to or actually 50.</div></div><hr />

Hmm I think its been much less than 500k subscribers since GoD. I mean these boards are partial testament to the fact eq is much less busier now.  I reckon theres about 150-200k max subscribers now.</div></div><hr />

thats a good point, and poeple left will mainly not be the old timers as it was a different game that we joined. ( note most i know some will be exceptions)</div></div><hr />

Just because you read that people on this board cancelled their accounts doesnt mean that over HALF the EQ subscribers did man. Come on. Wanna put that number at the 300-350K range (from 450-500 a year ago) then fine, but even if we took THIS board as a barometer, and added up all the accounts cancelled against the non-cancelled, you would STILL only see about 20% &quot;TRUE&quot; cancellations. <br />
<br />
So many people ready to shovel dirt on EQ. Got some news for ya, its gonna be a while. I just hope that WoW can keep up, honestly. Innovation and freshness are awesome, but when they run out you get . . . the same **** we see in EQ, people tired of the &quot;same ol&quot;. Take your time getting to the end of that &quot;same ol&quot; line in WoW guys, but if you hit it, EQ is gonna be here, like that old favorite pair of jeans that may not look so cool, and may not fit THAT good anymore, but still feels comfy and great to slide on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">unfortunately, eq would have to have a management change and alot of work done to it before i would &quot;come back&quot; , it wasn`t the same old same old that put me off , it was the lack of thought and ability in the poeple running it that made me quit, and i did that before i played wow or eq2.<br />
<br />
if you still like it thats great but the 150 to 250 mark is about where the last population count was before eq2 or wow opened. it hasnt been near 500k for a long while, still 250k is still pretty decent, most dont have that many.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Blazz I'm not shovelling dirt on Eq. I'm not talking about cancelled accounts on here either but the amount of traffic here. Yes it could be argued that it could be just a lot of people left playing their shaman, but the ranger board is only quiet. I may have been a bit low on the subscriptions but I can't really realistically think it has much more than 200k. And that is still a decent figure, all that suggests is that eq is no longer in its prime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Pretty sure they were at 400K Jan 1 2004, down from 490K Jun 1 2003. I dont think that they have had half their accounts &quot;cancelled&quot;. 250K would a conservative estimate, IMHO, and just so you know, thats $2.75 MILLION dollar a month. Until I see some actual official numbers, I am certainly not going to use the &quot;logged in&quot; or the &quot;3/4 of Shaman Crucible DAILY posters has quit&quot; as an official estimate. On this mesage board, just like in EQ, there is a MASSIVE population of people who basically dont say a thing, just hang out, and keep paying month after month. And like I said, I would be SHOCKED it more than 90% of the EQ players who are in EQ2 or WoW right now have fully cancelled their accounts. <br />

I guess we will see, but trust me when I tell you that I think EQ1 has at LEAST another good year left in it.</div></div><hr />

If the poll was in general it might have a more accurate display, although still not complete.<br />

I agree with your thoughts about the 69/70 spells and task system. <br />
I have almost all my 66-68 spells now.  I have one level 69 spell that I was awarded off Alpha in NC (I had lost all rolls on them from previous raids).  I've not seen one level 70 rune drop, although I haven't been able to kill anything that drops them yet. It is very irritating to me that it's so difficult to attain all my spells, besides ancients.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I plan to play EQ till May at most. I don't want to play any MMORPGs afterward, or simultaneously. Once EQ life ends for me I don't want to be diverted again.</div></div><hr />

That was my original plan once this subscription ends (May) I was going to head back to real life EQ1 has become to much of a time sink for me but with reports that WoW maybe playable as a casual game i.e. a few hours at a time I think I might give it a try. I love playing games and if I could play a game where I could log in get something done..... feel a sense of achievement then I will play as long as that feeling lasts.<br />
<br />
Recently like others I have become a little jaded with EQ1 and have been contemplating going cold turkey with games but with new options I might just give WoW a try when it gets released in the New year in europe if it starts feeling like EQ1 does now I may have to get a real life again :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Before EQ, I was a console-gamer exclusively. It is my intention to return to that state when I quit. So not totally cold turkey. hehe =)<br />
<br />
It's just the social part of the games that is most addictive to me. Before EQ I was actually addicted to just posting on a message board community for Zelda, which also had a chatroom I would be in 12+ hours a day. I need to really cut down on my internet socials...they take up so much time...man I'm such a geek. =\</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I guess we will see, but trust me when I tell you that I think EQ1 has at LEAST another good year left in it.<br />
<br />
I'd say a year would be a bit too conservative. After all, aren't there still like 50k+ people playing Ultima Online?<br />
<br />
While I would agree with Blazz that the numbers may not be as dire as many people think, I don't think the trend bodes well. SoE did it to themselves in several ways (for one, EQ2 should've NEVER been a sequel if they intended to keep the venerable game active). The Christmas season should bring a new influx of people to the genre (it usually does) and personally, I don't see them gravitating to the 5 year old game when there's &quot;better&quot; out (and with much better shelf placement, if the stores in NYC are any indication).<br />
<br />
But yeah, it'll take at least a quarter for things to fully shake out. Problem is, EQ1 is going to be broadsided several more times over the next year (Middle Earth Online, Vanguard, etc, not to mention the Matrix Online which will probably draw cursory interest). However, I think some major changes will have to be made to some core systems in EQ to keep it competitive within the marketplace. I don't think there's too many folks left (demographically speaking) who relish the idea of having to get 50 friends together to accomplish anything worth mentioning. Those logistics worked fine when you had a playerbase bigger than the population of Omaha, Nebraska but I don't think it'll work too well with a much smaller base from which to pull from.<br />

You cant kill the Dragorn Laborer by the tree near the statue in RCoD? Pretty sure I can duo that guy with a RANGER tanking. You having a hard time with Blind Hunter in PG? Theres almost always a pick-up group there on my server, its one of the easiest camps in the zone. Or Odi? Another no-brainer if you stage to the South instead of the North, but even the North camp near the &quot;box&quot; is pretty simple. Alll 3 of those mobs drop lvl 70 runes, FOR FACT because I have seen them drop them. <br />

There are TONS of others as well. Dont assume tht 69-70 runes are only dropping in deep PG, or RSS, or off Raid mobs. Either do your homework, or stop complaining about things you havent bothered looking into. <br />
I don't think there's too many folks left (demographically speaking) who relish the idea of having to get 50 friends together to accomplish anything worth mentioning. Those logistics worked fine when you had a playerbase bigger than the population of Omaha, Nebraska but I don't think it'll work too well with a much smaller base from which to pull from.<br />
Thats kinda funny, because I think thats the largest demographic still playing EQ. The &quot;middle range&quot; raiders who still have a lot of content ahead of them, and are still working through the content they are currently in. My guild is a classic example. Farming Time, working on Ikky, using PG trials and RSS groups to gear up individually, and XPing all over in just about any rune-dropping spot you can find. I honestly think this is the demographic thats gonna stick to EQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is what I stated in my theory in another post.  The end-game guilds always get the shaft, because SoE doesn't cater to them well enough.  By &quot;catering&quot; I mean releasing a fully working and tested expansion, not specifically bowing down to hardcore raiders.  The top guilds are suffering quite a bit from EQ2 and WoW and there is evidence of that by looking at all the recruitment announcements on their websites.  <br />
<br />
Eventually, a majority of top end guilds will capitulate and leave EQ, most likely to WoW, and the group of guilds that was behind them will become the new &quot;top guilds&quot; who will be satisified as long as the former top guilds &quot;tested&quot; the current expansion enough to iron out the bugs that made them quit the game.  This is unless SoE keeps with their current focus of placating the masses with more open zones and seemingly good, easily obtainable loot.  In general, SoE also tends to make their raid encounters from past expansions easier; directly by changing encounter and indirectly by adding more loot, AA skills, spells and levels. So this will speed up the consumption of content and reinforce the cycle.<br />
<br />
Now that the EQ family has a major competitor, they're going to have to make some tough decisions, and they will most likely alienate a big portion of their EQ players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And there never were as many as some of the raiders on this board imagined.  If the majority of players in EQ wanted to raid, then raiding guilds would have no difficulty replacing members who have left: there'd be massive competition for those supposedly 'elite' positions.<br />
<br />
It was the raiders who wrecked EQ, and turned it into a 2nd rate game with no chance of competing with WoW.  The amount of money spent developing EQ over the last 5 years should have meant it was now unassailable - if only that development had been focused on genuinely improving the game and expanding the frontiers of what could be done in it.  Instead we got a Devteam that focused on providing ever more phat loots for a spoilt minority, while excluding most players from more and more of the game.<br />
<br />
Ironically raiding might be the salvation of EQ.  Furor, his minions, his imitators, have jumped ship and are now busy wrecking WoW.  WoW started off as being committed to rewarding equally all styles of play.  Now I hear that the endgame in WoW is PvP and/or raiding.  That means that for the majority of players WoW has a life of about 6 months - not the years that EQ gave them.  So its possible that next year a lot of players will return from WoW if the redirection of EQ evidenced in OoW (with decent gear becoming available to playing styles other than raider) continues.  We live in interesting times.</div></div><hr />

Yes I agree with that, I can see eq actually going on for another 5 years perhaps even if at the end of that 5 years its just one server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">That was my original plan once this subscription ends (May) I was going to head back to real life EQ1 has become to much of a time sink for me but with reports that WoW maybe playable as a casual game i.e. a few hours at a time I think I might give it a try. I love playing games and if I could play a game where I could log in get something done..... feel a sense of achievement then I will play as long as that feeling lasts.<br />
<br />
Recently like others I have become a little jaded with EQ1 and have been contemplating going cold turkey with games but with new options I might just give WoW a try when it gets released in the New year in europe if it starts feeling like EQ1 does now I may have to get a real life again :P<br />
<br />
WoW is definately playable in much smaller chunks thank EQ and it is almost impossible not to do something that will help you progress. You will more often than not have too many quests thats you want to do that all give good rewards - very unlike Ever&quot;Quest&quot;. And tradeskills are also much better implemented. They result in very nice items all the way through your levelling and there are no failures. Worst thing that can happen is that your skill wont increase but you will always succeed in making the items. And you can sell items for a profit (a small one) to vendors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Numzan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">EQ2, WOW isnt what i wanted. I found out before most players actually went to those games, i didnt care for it.<br />
<br />
<br />
We decided to fire up the accounts, head off and make our own guild up. <br />
<br />
SOE needs to get there heads outta there assses and fix the flag, keys to zones that crunch you down for weeks. I enjoy eq, but there is no reason to have to compete like we are for flags. There is no Backflagging going on like it once was.<br />
<br />
I heard a rumor that high end guilds are charging for flags on Time. 200k or something like that. WOW great but 200k isnt that easy for our toons.<br />
<br />
I would rather do it the hard way with the guild, but no way can i recruit 100+ to do them. <br />
<br />
Since i returned, i have been burning myself out to recruit 65+ members. I offer help on epics, zones. etc... i even started to recruit 50+ to involve them. Its harder, they expect to be handed 1mill plat and an epic just to join.<br />
<br />
/ sad isnt it.<br />
<br />
I am a fair person, i enjoy helping others out but come on!<br />
<br />
in short SOE needs to fix something or the server pops will go down farther.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WoW &amp; EQ2 won't &quot;kill&quot; EQ1 for quite a long time. Sure, the subscriber base and server populations will decrease (server consolidations will be a part of EQ's future, bank on it), but EQ will be around for quite a while.</div></div><hr />

They are making some fairly drastic changes. For example, if you get 85% into an EP zone, and kill the God of that zone, you gain full-time access to that zone without the back-flagging required. Also, Time and KT are going to be 85%-able, and from what I understand, there will be FULL keys dropping randomly off various bosses there. These 2 features will solve a LOT of the back-flagging problems. <br />
I heard a rumor that high end guilds are charging for flags on Time. 200k or something like that. WOW great but 200k isnt that easy for our toons.<br />
Well, there are no such rumors floating on my server, so I have to write this off as a community-specific thing, not an EQ wide thing. One thing I can see my guild doing is allying with a smaller guild that is on the verge of disbanding due to low attendance, and bringing them in to supplement our numbers, letting them have some of the loot, and helping to get them flagged overall. Its all gonna be tricky though. There is so much guild back-stabbing going on right now its not even funny. Every guild is overly suspicious of other guilds recruiting out their members, and with good reason. <br />
<br />
But I can only speak for my own guild, and we dont play that way. There will be no charging by us. There will be no recruiting of active members of other guilds unless they come to us first. We have absorbed smaller guilds in the past, and may do so again, but that is more of a merger than anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">It seems theyre merging Vallon/Tallon servers. This is a player made request and will help Sony to bring life to PVP while cutting server maintenance costs a bit...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Trena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Blazz, you're probably right. The folks still playing EQ now are probably of the mindset that they have a lot of content yet to conquer so they don't want to leave until they do it. However, the lifeblood of any MMO in times like this (with the market being saturated by acclaimed titles) is how it balances its rate of attrition. With that in mind, how many truly new players (who have never played EQ before, even if they've played a competing product) are going to pick up EverQuest 1 to play when it's buried on the store shelf by WoW, WoW Collector's Edition, EverQuest 2 (the sequel!), EQ2 Collector's Edition, etc?<br />
<br />
When people find out that they'll have a month of easy, breezy play where they can solo (though they'll be &quot;encouraged&quot; to group) after which they'll need to somehow gain entrance to a large guild in order to progress at a decent rate, how many folks are going to choose that over the alternatives? That's basically what I meant.<br />
<br />
The group you describe sounds eerily similar to those folks still playing UO. There's nothing wrong with that (actually, it's a good thing that folks have found a game they truly enjoy). But given SoE's track record of knee-jerk reactions, how long do you think that's gonna last?<br />
<br />
Like I alluded to earlier, EQ1 will continue to &quot;live&quot; (in a manner of speaking) until SoE decides to pull the plug. But as someone who once enjoyed the advantages a large playerbase provides, I really don't want to see what EQ becomes when it doesn't have a ton of people playing. Seems like the game has been designed (post-Velious, at least) for lots of people on every server in order to progress. We're now seeing the first symptoms of uncontrolled attrition (guilds recruiting far more frequently and in some cases, having to lower their requirements to fill gaps. Guilds that were formerly thriving on the cutting edge now finding themselves dangerously understaffed.). It may very well get worse before it gets better. What's SoE going to do to not only keep its current active players, but also to get those cancelled and/or inactive accounts back to active status? I'm not going to say Rome is burning but I see some tinders smoking out by the west gate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Omens did give non raiders some decent gear, but it was still crap compared to what raiders could get. It was a nice improvement over the previous commonly available level of loot, but when you're just pushing 100hp in each slot when raiders are unlocking 250-300 hp a slot it doesn't seem like a big improvement. For the most part the gear is about luclin endgame level (the quest items) which are about 30-40% of the stats available to raiders. I think people were just happy to get anything good given to them (I agree), but it isn't the great salvation many made it to be. <br />
<br />
I do agree with the setement about Furor and pals with WoW. My biggest worry is they'll completely manage to screw up the end game.</div></div><hr />

It would still be inaccurate.  These forums are primarily visited by Everquest players and former Everquest players.  Class forums have never had a complete cross-section of the player-base; they've had the more vocal component.  Those vocal supporters are also going to be the most vocal and bitter critics when they become disillusioned.  <br />

Posting such a poll on an Everquest board would be like posting a poll on a Diablo II forum asking how many people have stopped playing Diablo II on Battle.net since WoW came out.</div></div><hr />

We're watching with interest what Blizzard does vis a vis content at level cap.  And by content, I don't strictly mean raiding content, I include solo and group content.  If the game goes 100% raiding and the future expansions are also 100% raiding I think WoW's success will be short lived.  The Battle.Net crowd which is flocking to this game in droves will not be tolerant if they have to find 50 other people to progress- they'll just cancel and move on (as will we).<br />
<br />
So far I can't say enough good about this game.  Our first dungeon foray for my crew consisted of 3 of us (all paladins) and we had a flat out riot.  Off tanking, heal chains, invul switching, tank switching, aggro and dps tanking... oy vey what a blast.  Dungeoneering is so much fun.  Every time we came to a door we were pumped about what lay beyond.  Getting a 4 pull of elite mobs with three of us was such a rush, not to mention doing the minibosses.  Tomorrow night we're taking the full crew down for another run- it was shades of the first time the crew killed king in Chardok.  Yes, that much fun. :)<br />

Just yesterday, while running to RSS with a group, Odi and BH were up with no one camping them (was 4 other people total in the zone, doing Neuromancer), and BOTH dropped a Glowing (I lost both rolls, grrr, I am like 0-30 on my next 70 rune now). We were stunned, but thats the RNG for ya. <br />
<br />
Neuromancer and Sent Sig (the named Dragorn near the Projection of Tactics) can also drop Glowings (again, first hand, I actually looted one off each of them myself, my first 2). Yeah, they are rare drops. Thats nothing new. But the XP there is reasonable, the group make up in PG is flexible enough if you stay within your pull limits, and there is damn solid random loots dropping as well. But dont go there EXPECTING to get a rune, or you will be disappointed. <br />
Can this pally (level 68, attunable earring from WoS replacing EoS) tank the mobs that drop greater/glowing runes? Is it possible for me to duo them with him or should I stick to full groups to kill the named that drop greater/glowing?<br />
He would probably strugggle in a duo situation, but in a full group he would do fine. That area has 3 nameds that are easily pulled. Get a map of RCoD with the nameds listed on it and get busy, honeslty. PG sucks for rune drops compared to this candyland zone. Every time I do a session there we get a LOT of loots and runes. The loots sell well, and I filled my 66-68 spells MOSTLY from there. Its also good faction and items for the armor quests here (http://www.misgnomer.org/omens/oowquests.html). There are a few 2-named camps in this zone. Here (http://thedruidsgrove.org/forums/showthread.php?t=10283) is another guide to a zone PACKED with Runes and loot, but mostly 66-68 runes and medium level loots. However, most is doable with smaller, less geared folks.<br />
<br />
I didnt mean to snap at you Racc, and I apologize for it. The fact that you looked beyond my snotty, abrasive tone and actually gave me a positive rep bump for helping you with information showed me a lot about the kinid of person you are. I fully understand the difficulty for some folkks to get items and spells in OoW when it first came out, but now the info has been disseminated and its out there if you want to look. These zones are a BLAST to hang in as well, time FLIES for me in places like Fillignos room in RCoD or Neuromaner camp in PG. I bounce around a ton now, so I dont get too bored in one spot. <br />
<br />
I went LFG the other day, got a tell asking about a WoS group, and since I wasnt having luck finding &quot;good&quot; groups I went, and it turned out to be one of the funnest groups I have every been in. Granted the puller was a 13K bard from one of the top guilds, but he MADE it as fun as it was, and each time someone left, the slot WASNT replaced by some Uber guild-mate of his, it was replaced by someone from a smaller guild working it. He never rolled on loot (after my first rune, I noticed what he was doing, and didnt roll anymore either, and actually gave the rune to the guy who had to go and had lost 3 rolls). He later told me he wasnt gonna ask me in, since he knew I didnt need the gear, but the Druid was leaving, and he couldnt find another healer. Spent 4 hours there getting OTHER people a ton of spells and loots, and had the TIME OF MY LIFE doing it (he was an insane puller, and one point, he had 2 named and 2 other mobs in the camp, all rooted, mezzed, tanked, etc, LOL, omg what a riot). <br />
<br />
Lots of people talk about how much fun WoW is, and how little fun EQ has become, and I just dont understand it. I havent had this much fun in EQ since the beginning, OOW just totally blew me away. Still does, even after 5 more levels and DOUBLING my pre-OoW aa total. Granted, Gates sucked, hardcore, and nearly drove me out of the game myself. PoP was TOO long between expansions (LDoN and LoY were add-ons, not &quot;expansions&quot;), and the one they gave us for progression was Gates. I said in another thread, if they had out out OoW first, and Gates was the reecnt &quot;expansion of an expansion&quot; (which is EXACTLY how it was supposed to go, which is totally obvious to anyone who looks at the 2) then I am willing to bet that WoW and EQ2 wouldnt have been AS BIG (still big, but not AS BIG) a success. But PoPs long duration, combined with the Gates debacle, was enough to shovel about 2 feet of dirt over the zombified corpse of what was once a fantastic game. Fortunately, OoW finally arrived, and the near-corpse of EQ wasnt buried THAT deep, and we managed to claw out of the dirt and even jump up a couple pegs. Too little too late for many, and I fully understand and appriciate it. But OoW, IMHO, is JUST about right for loots, spells availablility, quests, zone layouts, and high-end content. Took em 5+ years, but they finally &quot;fixed&quot; a whole lotta things that were wrong with EQ.<br />
<br />
A member of my guild is in the navy, and spends 30-90 days out to sea and cant play at all, but he has given his Clerics account info out to be used for the guild. Last time he was in port, I handed him 2 runes, and he was ESTATIC. Man, can WoW give me THAT feeling? Somehow I doubt it. But I dont exect it too. WoW and EQ have differntent forms of gratification. <br />
<br />
