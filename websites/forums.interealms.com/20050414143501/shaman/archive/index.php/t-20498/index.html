<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm at work and this last patch has me very scared. I two box with a desktop and a laptop. My desktop runs fine on DirectX 9. My laptop has a Mobility Radeon Graphics card and the last time I tried to upgrade to DirectX 9 I found the two to be incompatible. I ended up having to re-build the entire Windows operating system from scratch (Microsoft doesn't support reverting from DirectX 9 to DirectX 8). I've been running fine on DirectX 8 till this morning's patch. Anyone else having issues with DirectX 9 incompatibility?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cuetzpali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have a Sony laptop with a mobility radeon card and booted up just fine after installing DX9.  Didn't have time to play tonight, but zoned a couple times and was ok, seemed a bit laggy and choppy, but others in zone were complaining of the same thing.<br />
My husband however has a laptop with an Intel card, no longer supported by SOE, so not sure if we'll ever be able to play at the same time again.   :(</div></div><hr />

It took me a few hours last night, but I finally hunted down an updated driver for the Mobility Radeon GPU in my laptop. Turns out that ATI doesn't support these chipsets very well since they are put into laptops made and configured by various different manufacturers. Thankfully I have a Dell and they keep their drivers up to date. So I checked Dell's site again, and this time there was an updated driver with DirectX 9 support (wasn't available last time I tried to upgrade to DX9). EQ is up and running and pretty well I might say. I'm experiencing far less video lag in low/med population zones. Large tight groups of people are hell for it (MGB's in PoK) but they have always been that way. I can even turn on the target ring and some of the environmental effects without dragging.<br />
<br />
All in all, I'm pretty pleased.</div></div><hr />
