<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Check out http://eq.castersrealm.com for the latest on Luclin changes.  They are upgrading ALL the old world textures with a bonus CD that comes with Luclin.  They also talk about the changes 51+ for new skills and skill advancement briefly.<br />
A few screenshots of the new textures too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Windigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nice.  That was my biggest letdown that only part of the world would look new and the rest would be 3 year old blockiness.  If this is true it's going to make the game brand new and exciting to see all of the old places again.<br />
<br />
Woot!<br />
<br />
<br />
Would be nice if they redid npcs in the old world too, but textures are always a good place to start.</div></div><hr />

Is all I can say right now. I want it. I want it. I want it.<br />
<br />
ok now that that is out of my system. All I can say is WOW. This is the first time I've reviewed anything of the new stuff. I now have 3 goals for myself that I will try and complete before the release is out. <br />
<br />
1) have mish to level 60 with a full exp bar so he can do switch the exp toggle<br />
<br />
2) have all my trade skills maxed<br />
<br />
3) have my epic completed<br />
<br />
Ok start laughing at me now:) Also remember I work full time and goto school at night</div></div><hr />
