<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I got a new hammer today! I was fighting in dawnshroud with a lvl 60 rogue from E'Ci's uber guild, Reconstructed, as well as a bard, when a lvl 60 necro called a sambata advisor spawned carrying a wierd looking hammer.  We got some more people together (a wizzy, warrior, and cleric) and killed the sucker, he had an Intel's Hammer on him (13/25, 4 wis, 1hb).  Me and the cleric rolled on it, the seed was 984, she rolled a 54, i rolled an 18 (i was feeling really bad about that roll at this point, especially since the seed was so high).  The cleric got the hammer and decided she didnt need it since she had a 5 wis primary item and didnt need to be bashing anything anytime soon.  So i am now the proud honor of one awesome hammer, and have an insentive to work on my 1hb!  Oh yea, i also got lvl 44 the other day (new spells, yay!)<br />
