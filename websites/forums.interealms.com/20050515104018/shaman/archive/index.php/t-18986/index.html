<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Walor_Spiritweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hullo all...I have tried to solo Yeldema three times now and my downfall is I can not seem to get him to a safe spot where no wondering mobs come in mid fight  and mess me up? Can someone tell me where they might be a safe spot so I don't get adds? I've died once and had to gate twice. Thank you. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Entrance hall to TOV when sontalak isnt up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Walor_Spiritweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the reply. :) If you could expand a bit on it...seems  dangerous to me to run across the ToV entrance with a highly angry dragon following you...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Le..Le.. Lenine? Thought you had stopped posting I hadnt seen you so long.<br />
<br />
And dont pull Yeldema to ToV entrance unless you are adept at avoiding the 3/4 wanderers that sometimes path there and the static spawns. I usually head directly to the sea, down to a little ledge at the bottom of the cliff, if you dont let her run its usually safe there. Once got a drake, that was nasty, but thats all so far ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walor_Spiritweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So take him into the water? Will I need to stay underwater with him or is he tell enough  that I can cast on him when he's in the water and I'm not?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've solo'd Yeldema over 30 times looking for easy Giant faction, each time I've done it right in her nest.<br />
<br />
Must be lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The spot where yeldema's nest is, is one of the safer spots in the zone.  I normall pull him slight west of where the nest is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I use the spot Urdegish referred to.  First I take a look around and wait for any wanderers to path away.  Then I hit her with Malos, run to edge of cliff, slow her, then run down the the water's edge where my pet is waiting.  I fight on the beach at the bottom of the cliff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you go straight towards the coast from yeldema's nest and go down the cliff, you'll find a pretty sizeable ledge down there where the cliff meets the water.  Nothing will aggro there, and there's enough space for yeldema + you + dog without anyone having to go in the water.  Just make sure that the dog is pushing him up the cliff rather than in to the water.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you're non-kos it's a lot easier.  Drakes won't agro you at that point, and most of the things that wander over Yeldema's nest are drakes.  There are a few safe'ish spots north of Yeldema, there's a sort of indent in the ground near one of those little spire things, only a very rare velium hound walks by.  There's also a few spots near the water you can find where mobs very rarely path through.  From there it's just luck or waiting till the pathing mob goes by.<br />
<br />
Mostly, you're going to need to explore around and see what you can find.  Pathing has been changed in this zone numerous times (to make it a little harder, especially to solo), so there are precious few &quot;safe&quot; spots.  Key is to kill as fast as you can, and hope most of the time.<br />
<br />
The ToV entrance is safe though, if sont isn't up and you can drag the dragon down there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The few times I've done it and been successful I have been at her nest or just towards the water/cliff.   Course, be careful when she runs.  I had her run towards one of the other named dragons.. Hecheva or something.  Ugh.  Killed Yeldema, but had to Gate from him.  Nasty brute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">pull to the water straight from the next, there is 1 wandering drake, but once it passes you have a long long time before it coems back.<br />
<br />
Plus you can always drag yeldema to where you need once the fight starts, if something comes.</div></div><hr />
