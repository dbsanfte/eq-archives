<br />
I have been addicted to Nardox as of late. :)<br />
<br />
I hunt the fire elementals off the tunnel to Gunthak.<br />
<br />
Sweet exp, great loots. . never need a kei. . . lava swimmin' fun ;)<br />
<br />
SOOoo my hunt is over I gained my two yello for the day and dinged lvl 54 /CHEER!<br />
<br />
I deside to gate back to PoK (where I AM bound) to grab up some spells, bank and call it a great night.<br />
<br />
/em begins to cast a spell<br />
<br />
/em gate collapses grrrrrr, rinse repeat. . . . <br />
<br />
***POOF***<br />
<br />
hmmm this isn't PoK. . . <br />
<br />
I had somehow succor'd to the other side of Nardox. . . . wth?<br />
<br />
Kinda scary for a person who never went there before. . got lost in the mines too lol. . .kept goin' back to some warlord. . kinda funny lol was in tells with my necro budy preparin' the CR n' everything  :D <br />
<br />
But odd bug is. . .  when gating in Nardox you succor to the other side. . . thats kinda fruity eh? <br />
<br />
Rofl<br />
<br />
had to share :)<br />
<br />
(btw was able to gate to pok later on in diff zones. . just not in Nardox)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">POK was down for a while last night, around 8pm EST I believe, you probably tried to gate while it was down</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Whenever the game isnt sure what to do with you it sends you to the default location for the zone.. aka the succor point.  This has been commonly exploited in zones such as Sirens Grotto where people would camp up against a wall and return to find themselves inside the wall -and instantly warp to the succor point.<br />
<br />
I have had the same failure with gate happen in Ssraa and ToV before.  *POOF* &quot;why am I at the succor point instead of my bind point?&quot;  Usualy you can just gate again to get to where you really wanted to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Speaking of bugs. I found last night with the new spell menu. I can auto run and mem spells at the same time. Anyone else notice this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Also happens when &quot;You should be dead&quot; like if u have a train on u you have about 2 pct health when u zone it takes u to succor point of the zone u zoned into kinda funny<br />
<br />
What the heck? where am i? wow i almost died</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aikoiko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Funny bug happened to me (well my partner) last night as well.  A friend of mine (52 pally) was helping me take down Advisor in Mistmoore when we got swarmed near the balcony.  I died first and pooped in PoK at bind point and started my CR.  Unfortunately, my partner went LD immediately after my death.  Of course he re-logged and ended up dieing as well, but here's the strange part...  His corpse ended up at zone line in Mistmoore, and he lost no xp.  Lucky Bastage.<br />
<br />
Worst of all, we got Black Dire to spawn thanks to a very hepful 61 Monk who took him out, but he ended up expiring in the wall, so no pelt.  Grrr..  Wasn't meant to be last night I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Asyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">wow lots of &quot;funkyness&quot; goin' on that day eh? :D<br />
<br />
but info for dah readers :)<br />
<br />
At the time the &quot;funky bug&quot; happened pok had come back for 4 hrs after its crash on Terris-Thule.<br />
<br />
<br />
And OMG on the dire wolf! <br />
<br />
I personnaly had my bro in law (level 65 druid) pull that dire for me. . . was a tuff lil' bastage, would have truely bummed me out to have that happen <br />
:( <br />
<br />
ehheh the druid had a blast pullin' him fer me ;)  Seems druids absolutly love palyin' puller :D</div></div><hr />

Actually they claim to have fixed this longstanding bug in the May 14 patch.<br />
<br />
<br />
- Zoning and losing your buffs - There has been a long-standing problem that could cause all of the buffs to be stripped from a character if they zoned with fewer hit points than they had bonus hit points granted by items.  For example, if your character had only 10 hit points left when zoning, and had an item that granted +15 hit points, all of your character's buffs may have been stripped when you completed zoning.  We have fixed this bug.  You should now retain your buffs in this situation.<br />
<br />
<br />
The side effect was it also stripped you of negative effects, so I had friends who would wait until a DOT had them down to 100 hp and then zone to get rid of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">no weissblau u misunderstood me thats not what i was talking about, i wasnt talking about losing your buffs i was talking about warping to the succor point of a zone u hit when u were about to die or <br />
&quot;Should be dead&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I had that happen a few times in Com. Get trained and zone out with enough health for one hit and zone out and end up being up by the zone line to FOB which happens to be the EJ evac spot. Groupmate trying to heal me outside wondering why i am low health and being dumb and going out of range til i told him where i was at lol.</div></div><hr />
