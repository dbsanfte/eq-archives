<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ACK!!  EQ on a MAC!?!?!?!<br />
<br />
They can't do that!  It's positively illegal!  EQ is SUPPOSED to crash every 10 min and be laggy with lots of bugs and if you play on a mac you might just miss the &quot;real&quot; EQ. :p<br />
<br />
Oh, and the only advice I can give bout EQ is don't start on Sullon Zek and explore lots!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mukumuku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Trolls are ugly.<br />
especially in old models.<br />
they sag and their ass shows.<br />
<br />
I like Ogre Shamans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What what I've read (and this could be misinformation) the Mac version will have it's own server(s) so that the code can be maintained separately. If that will be the case, you will at least get to experience a fresh economy with no twinking, and will probably be surrounded by almost all true newbies.<br />
<br />
Grobb is the starting city for Trolls; there is no choice. The starting hunting zone is Innothule Swamp, which is a good newbie zone. Plenty of Frogloks to kill, who drop Rusty weapons and Netted Armor. Verant recently accelerated the leveling rate between Levels 1-10, which I can see certainly has some benefits, but the downside is that you'll never have enough money to buy your spells. Do the quest given out by the Shaman guild leader (the one you give your note to) and you're pretty much set with all the decent Level 1 spells.<br />
<br />
Once you get Spirit of Wolf at Level 9, you can visit Oggok (Ogre city) and Neriak (Dark Elf city). As a Troll, you won't be welcome in a lot of the pinky (Human, Wood Elf, Dwarf, etc.) cities, so be careful when traveling around.<br />
<br />
And as for guilds, since I believe it will be a new server, any guilds will be new ones created by the players there. Just make a note of everyone you've enjoyed grouping with, and try to keep in touch with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">trols are just plain cool . ogres just have no style . no matter what you put them in they always look just big dumb and ugly .<br />
<br />
trolls have style , its a evil style , but its a ttractive style . ive seen some decked out trolls ad they look very cool .<br />
<br />
ofcourse , you cant beat a barb on sexiness .<br />
<br />
<br />
iskars ... well they whine too much about the jbb ;)<br />
<br />
only real advice i can give is stick through the 20's . it was rough for me caus ei was reduced to a fake cleric . as you get up the levels bpast 34 your abilities come into focus and you arent the wanna be cleric anymore . right now with my jbb im finding im a soloing machine . i would like to see someone beat me . maybe a necro can . snare/fear/pet attack might be kinda hard to beat<br />
<br />
point is not to claim im uber , im not . point is to let you know your not always going to be the fake cleric . once you grow up a lil you will have alot of fun . unless you like being a fake cleric ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's like being a Mac user.  <br />
<br />
&quot;We've implemented this awesome new quest, and it should go live in tommorrow's patch.  Mac user version should be available in 3 months.&quot;  <br />
<br />
I love the Mac of course.  But they need serious market share ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">No one has mentioned it, as a Troll Shaman, make sure you pick Innoruuk as your god. Talk to the female Dark Elf in back of the shaman guild in Grobb. Get the note, when you have SoW at lvl 9, run to Neriak, go to the cleric guild, turn in the note to the head cleric, and hope you have the faction to start the Disciple of Innoruuk quest. If not enough faction, go kill halfling in Nektulos and build faction until you get the quest. It's the first of 3 quests with the final one rewarding you with a snare neck item.</div></div><hr />
