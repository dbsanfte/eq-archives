<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Don't know if this is temporary or what - but INT casters can raise their research skill to 250.  Cost me about 4750 last night on Xev.  So if you need something researched send me a tell. (Check sig for appropriate toon).<br />
<br />
Personally I like the idea. Course I also think that Shaman should be able to research their own spells too and that a Jenny McCarthy - Monica Belluci pr0n video would be a big seller - so hey, I'm full of great ideas.<br />
<br />
P.S. (MODs delete if you don't want this out of the bag. Although I'm pretty sure it's common knowledge)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, we all know Jenny McCarthy and Monica Bellucci are hot.  Yes, the contrasting skin tones would make for good cinema...<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, was there more to the post?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Does anyone know the answer to this:  If I've got a necromancer friend with a research skill of 200, is it possible for him to research Mage spells for another friend?  I thought this was possible last night but we tried and could not do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope, not possible. INT Casters can only research their own spells and the spells for the three WIS casters. The Mage must either research his own spells or have another Mage do it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">correct me if I'm wrong, but int casters can not research other int caster spells 16-50, but they can research their dropped ones. I may be totally wrong but I always thought thats how things worked</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope - they each have their own research tome that they get in Gunthak, and each of these special tomes can only research their own high-level dropped spells and the high-level dropped priest spells.</div></div><hr />
