<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,<br />
<br />
I have heard that whith the bown chain bridle a shaman can torpor himself and still move freely (forward, backward, and at an acceptable rate).<br />
<br />
Is this true?  I'm looking for a qualified answer from someone who has the chain bridle, and torpor, and can speak definitively.<br />
<br />
So, some specific questions:<br />
<br />
1) can you backup?<br />
<br />
2) at top speed with torpor on, about how fast would you say you are going?<br />
<br />
3) how severe is the runup/rundown time on the chain bridgle vs. the el-cheapo bridle?<br />
<br />
Basically I'm looking for an alternative to quiessence, since quiessence seems not to be available for sale on The Rathe (by anyone).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have the small black drum (el burro) and I cannot back up or move much faster than a walk when torpored.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Yes, but not VERY fast<br />
2) Forward, probably about runspeed3? I really don't know, around that though.<br />
3) I believe it's the same, but there's a neat-o trick I can show you if you send me a tell (;tell tallon.Nakukak, woo!)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I didn't notice much of a difference in run speed on my leezord (cheapo one) while torpored as opposed to not being torpored while going forward. I couldn't back up well though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've noticed a couple interesting caveats with horses.  First would be the use of the strafe key (Ctrl) to get a fast start with them.  More interestingly would be what I would have to classify as a bug - that totally negates the start up and slow down curve of the horse.  It's an instant thing like walking.  They'll probably fix this soon, and I have no really consistent way of making this happen.<br />
If I am the puller in PoD, I tend to click off the horse pull and when I get back to camp use my hotkey'd bridle to summon my horse back.  After about an hour of this, without fail one of those casts will put me back on the horse, only WITHOUT the movement penalties.  It's sort of random.  When I get this, needless to say I don't click off and on the horse anymore.  I just leave it on.<br />
Hope this helps.  Code Red Alpha over and out.  Roger!  Nakukak's post sparked this recollection.  I'm too lazy to send you a tell in game.  You find anything different?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have a white chain bridle.  When mounted I can Torpor (I use Q tho now) and still move in reverse at about a walking pace, and I can run forward at about run3 speed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">HI DERIA,i am from rathe server and bought a copy (quiescense).<br />
BTW spells in rathe server are really expensive.<br />
65k for regular torpor.<br />
50k for malo.<br />
one selling pox for 45k.<br />
ferine avatar 60k.<br />
<br />
well i bought my quiescence for 100k.well i wanted it and it was the first time i saw that one for sale.<br />
<br />
i have a friend playing mathaniel server,and told me quiescence was 35k<br />
malos 25k.............</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, pricing on The Rathe is dramatically higher than other servers for the most part when it comes to rare spells.  Strange, considering how strong the rest of the economy on The Rathe is.  I think a large part of the problem is the relative rarity of runes.  When I was searching for my copy of Q, I spoke to *alot* of shaman and 99 percent of them did not themselves have the spell (and alot of them were in guilds that I would have expected to have a never-ending supply of runes).  <br />
<br />
That being said, it was the probable price of Quiessence that prompted my question regarding horses.  I eventually decided that as much as I wanted to run like a bard, I needed a torpor-without-ill-effects more.  I eventually found the spell through Kongming (who has been very helpful in the past as well when it comes to spells -- nice person).  It was more money than I've ever spent on anything, but its also one of the few spells that I *knew* would be absolutely worth it (and it does rock, beyond question).<br />
<br />
So in the end, no bard-speed for me but I'm very happy with Q.  Since I also have Ferine Avatar &amp; Malos (both from turn-ins of runes) I'm actually in a pretty good situation spell-wise.  I could care less about Blood Of Saryn (which sounds odd, I realize, but the agro on our DoTs is just too much to bother with when I can do more damage in less time with our nukes) and while I would certainly like Fo7th, I can live without it until I get it as a turn in.</div></div><hr />
