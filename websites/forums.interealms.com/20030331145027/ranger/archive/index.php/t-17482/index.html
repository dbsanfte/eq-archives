<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Weedleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I have three heads from the arena , about time I'm 58 and stuff. I have checked everyday for the Frost Giant Overseer with my lower druid that I have parked in WL in front of Kael. I never ever see this guy. Is there a &quot;Best time&quot; to check for the spawn please? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not really, just check often.   I was doing it 2-3 times a day once I had all the kael heads, took me about two days of this before I found him up.  Just check as often as you can and you'll get him.  He spawns every three  days (RL), so it shouldn't take too long. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rounlin Starwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">his ph despawns i think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've seen him up a lot lately, not sure why. Just keep checking, though I'm not sure you'll be in tracking range of his hut with a &quot;lower&quot; druid. Check with your Ranger...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cymrich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">try to check right after patch when server comes up. is how me had to finally get mine, he just wasn't spawning :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>TalvaranRW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i had him in 2 days, i checked twice a day .  just camp there and log on when you have the time, he is trackable from the zone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Doon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Overseer is a 3 day spawn and can be up for days or droped quickly after he pops, its really your luck. Gluck. :)</div></div><hr />

Is it possible to chain the heads for the helm of the tracker <br />
&quot;Chain&quot;? Do you mean multiquest, or chain kill the FGO to equip several people in succession?<br />
<br />
You can MQ it, but all participants must be level 55+.<br />
<br />
You can't chain kill the FGO IIRC. He spawns once every 3 RL days and has no PH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Eurakin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've been keeping an eye out for the Overseer again too, mainly after the servers come up but no luck lately. <br />
<br />
Had the unfortunite accident when the first time I went to turn in all the heads in PoG I had one of the wrong giant heads. Went back to get the right one from my bank and by the time I zoned back into PoG the mob was dead. Another guild was clearing the zone and had taken him down. Now all I need its the Overseers head once again to get the helm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kevaran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have seen the Overseer spawn right after he was killed, and while doing Geo's several spawns in one day(other people came in and poked him).  It was rumored that he shares a spawn table with Priest Grenk and only one or the other is up at one time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>slig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You can MQ it, but all participants must be level 55+.  <br />
<br />
Do you have to be level 55 to do this quest at all?<br />
I am currently lvl 51 and have all the heads minus the WL guy.  Should i not even try to camp him until I am level 55?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Samoht_BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Cant do til 55.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>TalvaranRW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">check 1-2 times a day every day, you will get him</div></div><hr />
