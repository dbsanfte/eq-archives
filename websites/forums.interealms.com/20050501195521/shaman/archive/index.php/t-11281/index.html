<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hargin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I remember level 59 was a long crawl to 60 before PoP, when 60 was the max level.  I've heard that wasn't the case now that the levels were expanded to 65, but man if it didn't take forever for me to get 2 blue bubs into level 59.   The mobs I was fighting in PoI were dark blue.    <br />
<br />
Is 59 still the long crawl it used to be?  So far it seems to be, but would love to hear from the voice of experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">PoI's the problem.  The mobs there aren't so great for exp, I'd go to PoN to speed it up.  And level 59 used to be the LONGEST level of any in the game, it's changed a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kareck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just dinged 59 last night and I only had 1 group kill after I dinged before I logged so I can not give you any knowledge of if it is still the longest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">59 is the longest, but no longer by as much.  It's only slightly longer than 58 now.  However, the stuff you are killing might be too low level for you anymore.  PoI exp sux unless you go to the factory or perhaps the boneyard.  Boneyard exp was good at 61 if I remember right (left turn, go quite a ways, door on right).  Also factory was good until it greened out, plus you might find an upgrade or two in the factory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Exp at 59 is 30% more than 58 doing the same mobs.<br />
<br />
I had aaxp at 30% in 58 for awhile before turning it off and it was the same rate when I dinged 59 :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Peonthis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">59-60, best spot is POD, LCY/RCY/CCY in front of castle. Did it w/ my cleric friend and random lfg ppl, replace atleast 30ppl in and out, but we pulled 12 hours straight. We pull both RCY and CCY, so there was like no downtime. Dinged just alittle past the 12th hour. Hope that helps. Or get a monk go to PON Hedge, pull on the right side from the 2 forboding guardians, seem like a safe spot for me. I duo boxed there, get 1percent every 2kills, or 2percent AA per kill. Banshees and wraths. Also got 2 parchments too. But shhhhhh, don't tell ppl you can still duo in POP plzkkthx    =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Halycona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I duo in PoN at the hedge with a 60 sk friend, pretty easy exp, I can slow straight off b/c of his agro control and he sometimes only needs a kragg's a kill, or at most 1.5 heals a kill. <br />
Never any downtime either with horse and canni4, a c3 is just a luxury but not crucial :)<br />
Spiders in PoN are very nice exp too, almost 1% per kill but can be hard to get a group there purely b/c it's often in demand. <br />
Once I hit 61 I'm planning on going AA for a while anyway so be nice to see the exp flowing again :D</div></div><hr />
