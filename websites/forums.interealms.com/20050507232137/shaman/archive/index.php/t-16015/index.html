<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was curious what other shaman are doing in high end PvP.  I used to enjoy pvp at lower levels and I felt that if I played well I could win, and did.  Lately I am starting to feel that shaman don't have a chance in the very high end game when people got tons of MR.  If you are on a blue server, you probably don't understand the gross amounts of MR that some people on Red servers have.<br />
<br />
As an example, last night I am exping in Sol Ro and here comes local uberguild #1 Defiant.  Defiant has most of the upper upper end of VZ to itself and thus should be very well geared.  Anyway, so I open up with malos to debuff em.  We hadn't gotten zerged yet ( that happened later ) and we still outnumbered them 4 to 2 at that point.  I am thinking to myself &quot;I know they are well equipped, but I think we will win this one&quot;.  After malos, I couldn't land a single spell on any of them.  I spammed my ornate pants like you wouldn't believe and landed I think 1 or 2 out of 20 or 30.  I spammed blind and they were all resisted.  I tried to land a few Blood of Saryrn thinking that their PR may be lower than their MR, but that wouldn't stick either.<br />
<br />
So, my questions is what do you other shaman do for offensive in high end PvP?  There seems to be a certain points where resists get too good and I just can't do anything in PvP other than malos and maybe heal.  Sure, I got dogburn, and it works great when I can get root to stick, but I have seen too many people kite the dogs for 1 min then go back to chasing me around the room.  Regular dogdog is nice too, but he is nothing compared to a decent damage shield.<br />
<br />
I still find pvp fun when I am pvping against some of the lesser guilds and can get my spells to stick after malos.  PvP just seems frustrating and pointless when I can't stick anything after malos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From my experience messing around in the arena, once they get 200dr/pr, you basically can't do anything to them, MR is wierd however, 250mr seems to be the magic point, although amusingly a 17 necro managed to snare me first time (337mr with my self clicks).<br />
<br />
In short, unless resists are drastically different on pvp servers, shaman = malos and harrassing people with turgurs/blind whilst throwing heals about if you get a chance.<br />
<br />
Pure melees I can generally still run and wear down slowly although monks with good gear, resists and technique are nasty, pal/sk with that level of gear are basically unbeatable, all I can do is RB up and proc ToT a few times then die or just run in circles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jyphant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I play in arena quit often.  I think maybe your best bet is to malos then decay.  Try to get desease to stick.  Its slow but works sometimes.  Also mem the best cold nuke you got.  Lots of times people have high mr,pr, or dr and are a bit low on cr.  On high end people you bassicly have to try anything and everything.  Also make sure and get lr5.  If a high end pal, or sk is on you just say your prayers, you dont have a chance if you cant stick a slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sebazy  - I checked out your magelo and you have awesome gear.  I wasn't trying to indicate that anyone on a blue server had sub-par gear, but only that people on Red servers will generally place MR as a much higher priority.  Even stupid little things ( like your windrider trinket ) just aren't available in the bazaar on my server.<br />
<br />
so, other than malos ( that you already indicated ) what to you do to kill people?  In mass pvp our job is to malos and root / blind.  But, what about one on one?  How do you go offensive when everything you cast is resisted?  Turgurs and blind are great and all, but in the end they are are just debuffs and don't kill anything. <br />
<br />
I think your numbers for resists are pretty right on.  200 PR / DR and 250 MR are about the point where everything changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wolfdale01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Poor you.  Give me their names and I'll make sure they get their lashings. :)<br />
<br />
One comment though.<br />
Sure, I got dogburn, and it works great when I can get root to stick, but I have seen too many people kite the dogs for 1 min then go back to chasing me around the room.And while they were kiting yer dogs around in that minute, what were you doing? Them kiting = them not hitting you = able to cast spells unharassed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Agreed, in general BB's arena crew have a few people that are quite skilled pvpers and have good gear for that purpose, most of the people with a clue in the arena have at least 200mr, although my resists are at the extreme end of the scale really =)<br />
<br />
For the most point, I'll just malos, and just wade in with Blood/Ancient bane.<br />
<br />
Clerics/druids/shaman and paladins will usually require more work, for paladins if there gear is sub par I can usually just blind then overpower them and just lay on damage before they realise and start curing.  If there gear is good its simply a case of chipping there mana pool down.<br />
<br />
For healer/curers, generally I'll feign a slow steady pace with them, not putting on too much pressure, not blinding, just a bit of melee, a little light dotting and stuff so they get comfortable, then blam, knock it up a notch (I couldn't resist) with blinds, AA pet swarm to start pushing them back and just hammering on as many dots as I can forcing them <br />
to start inefficiently panic healing once they realise.<br />
<br />
A cleric with high resists is pretty much a lost cause though, usually I'll just melee till we get bored and give up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Poor you.  Give me their names and I'll make sure they get their lashings. :)<br />
<br />
One comment though.<br />
And while they were kiting yer dogs around in that minute, what were you doing? Them kiting = them not hitting you = able to cast spells unharassed.<br />
<br />
Wolfie, what are you all teaching your guys now? They should know to take out the shaman first! Everyone I've talked to in opposing guilds have told me they have hotkeys targetting me and our other shaman specifically in mass pvp, kinda disheartening to know I'll be one of the first few to die, but oh well! Debuff what you can and hope for the best.<br />
<br />
All we can really do from my experience in mass pvp, is throw on what debuffs we can and heal. I can occasionally land dots, but with the way assisting works at the high end. Once someone calls the target you just debuffed with malo(s), their life expectancy is rather short, thus negating what dmg our dots can do. Dogburn is my main source of dmg, as well as cold or poison nukes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Mostly it goes like this.<br />
<br />
With people getting unbuffed resists of 300+ a alone shaman cant do jack.<br />
<br />
MR and PR are our greatest foes (Dr stuff lands but take to long to do anything).  Even After Malo/s lands if any resist is 150+ good luck on getting it land.  I had a person with only a 125 PR resist 6 out of 7 Blood's. Then once/ if it lands it only does 66%.   Any Melee (well rangers bows now do 66%) can wail on you manaless and it they hit its 100% damage.  Every been double backstab for 1700+ its not fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
Most melee got MR heavy.  This means no roots, blinds, slows, cripples.<br />
DR you MIGHT land the aa root and if lucky a DR based Dot.  But the dot takes so long to kill they have time to heal/regen/ call random_guildmember 101 for back up.<br />
<br />
Resists and the 66% on our dots make it VERY hard to pvp at the upper end.  When 6 of 7 of our best level 65 dot is resisted then only does 66% to the tank with 8k+ hps your a dead man.<br />
<br />
Best to travel with a Enchanter and Bard.  Then you can get spells to land.  I so hope the Curse spells are true.  It may put the fun back into pvp for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I believe there's more to resists than what's shown on lucy.    Druid dots will land on anyone, snares land much easier than other magic based spells as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Some friend of a friend of a friend of a friend (/wink) told me he heard from someone that Bane was resisted multiple times on someone with 150 MR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>cepheusRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah, I'm on Rallos Zek with some of the top gear on the server and I don't even bother with pvp unless I'm part of a crew where I can help augment the damaging abilities and debuffing abilities of others.  Anyone worth their weight on Rallos carries cure potions and pumice so our dots and debuffs are just a joke anyhow. <br />
<br />
I'm really hoping this curse line from LDoN might make shaman viable in solo pvp once again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Asraguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hey Guys/Gals,<br />
<br />
Its definately the case that shamans suck at dishing out damage in PVP at the high end cuz you cannot land DoTs, Slows, Roots or Blinds even after Malos and our cold nukes are way to slow casting to be effective.<br />
<br />
The reasons Dr00ds and Necros dont seem to have any problem landing their DoTs in PVP is cuz they have an innate resistance modification. For example I'm pretty sure that the necro boil blood range of spells gets -100 to its resistance check. The only damage dealing spell that shamans get that has an innate resistance modification is our epic DoT that also gets -100 (I'm fairly sure) to its resistance check. <br />
<br />
It really sucks that shamans have to cast Malos/MD to have any chance of our spells landing when necros/dr00ds can have there spells land consistently without even requiring a debuff. Guess the advantage is that their innate resistance mods stack with Malos but that really doesn't help a shaman much in dishing damage in PVP!<br />
<br />
Cheers,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The only thing shamans are good at that applies to PvP at the end game level, is surviving.  We can survive better than most other classes.  Sometimes that's all you need.  Other times, it only prolongs the inevitable.  Getting special items with key procs/abilities is key to being effective in PvP.  Against a warrior in pvp you'd need to debuff any haste buff they have with Annul magic, then melee them in rabid squirrel form with a DS on yourself (potion) and Q, and the occasional Tnargs.  You'll want a weapon like Staff of flames (drops off a bird in PoFire) for this cuz it procs a 400 DD.  However . . that might not even land on a well equipped melee.  I use mace of dark thought in pvp vs any caster because sucking mana is way kewl.  <br />
<br />
Shamans are probably the weakest class in PvP at high end game.  At any lower level of equipment, we can rock.  But give them total immunity to our spells and there's really very little we can do.  <br />
<br />
This game isn't balanced for PvP anyway.  And they've always claimed it wasn't meant to be that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Not meant for PvP, but it wouldn't be that hard for them to make manaburn, harmtouch, and lifeburn PvE only...    only way I die anymore really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">nice mask loid =P.. you leave bp? or are you on legends now? i dont' see you anymore... for the shaman that posted.. you didn't say that you nullified magic with the crystal pumices... that should help.. since every uberguild has either just raided or is about to raid and probably has raid buffs... then nuke nuke nuke... (Loid taught me that)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I don't play on a pvp server, but I have been a part of a few arena brawls, and have done a lot of dueling.  For mass pvp against very resistant people, there just isn't much we can do.  We really desperately need a lure dot.  It doesn't even need to be a strong dot, we just need something that we can do to hurt people that they cannot resist.  In brawls, I just hang towards the back, malos the enemy and throw out heals like mad on my friends.  I am sure you pvp people know far more about this than I do, though.  One thing I thought of, though.  On blue servers at least, there is something strange about the resist rate on our rain spells.  They get resisted in PvE more than any other spell we have, but in PvP, they will land at least partially on ANYONE.  I tested it against a bard singing resists, who had 500PR.  He chain cast mana drain on me while I chain cast rain on him.  I got him to 40% before I was oom.  I don't know if this works on red servers, and I also do not know if rains will hit people on your own team, so this may or may not be of any consequence.  It also kills your pet.<br />
<br />
If you want to duel, though, I honesntly believe we can beat just about anyone, regardless of their resists.  Anyone know doesn't resist MR, PR, CR, and DR based spells is going to get demolished by me, no ifs ands or buts.  Low resists usually goes along with crappy gear, which leads to low HP.  Blood of saryrn and chain nuking will drop these people fast.  No further discussion needed.<br />
<br />
For people with great resists, though, it becomes much more challenging (and fun).  By &quot;duel&quot; I mean two people, with nothing but self buffs, square off in the arena and go at it, one vs. one, until one of them is dead or gives up.  I realize that such a situation will almost never arise on a pvp server.  Even if you did manage to get someone alone, it takes us so damn long to kill someone, they could probably crouch-walk backwards to the nearest zone line, stop to take a piss, and then zone out still alive.  The advice I am about to give requires that your opponent wants to fight you.<br />
<br />
We have two major advantages over every other class.<br />
<br />
The first is that we can heal ourselves.  The second is that we regen mana better than anyone else.  These two characteristics make us extremely powerful in a long, drawn out duel.  Our greatest weakness is that our damage-dealing abilities are pitiful against resistant people, but you all know that.  It is practically impossible for us to outburn anyone, so we have to outlast them.<br />
<br />
Int casters are, imho, the easiest opponents.  They have low HP, cannot heal themselves, and they cannot melee you.  If they go oom, you win.<br />
<br />
If you have good MR, an enchanter is powerless against you.  The worst they can do is dispell your buffs, but you have several instaclicks, right?  If you have bad MR, this guide is really not for you.  You should dot yourself, though, in order to keep their mezz from sticking.  I typically use epic dot since it does insignificant damage for most of its duration.  The downside to this is that they can dispell it, but I usually place it at the very end of my bufflist, so there is little danger of that.<br />
<br />
Magicians are easy as well.  Their pets are not resistant at all, so just sic your pet on it, back up, slow their pet, root it, and turn your pet on the mage.  They do not have any lures that I know of, so if you have decent resists, they aren't much of a threat to you with their pet out of action.  Just quiescence yourself and beat them down.<br />
<br />
Wizards are a bit tougher because they have lures and a manaless rune (epic).  They also have harvest, which is sort of like a miniature canni5.  It doesn't give them a lot of mana, but it gives them enough for an extra nuke or two.  To kill a wizard, you have to heal yourself while they chaincast their lure on you.  It hits for 706 I believe in pvp.  Every wizard I have ever dueled has gone full tilt nuking me from the start.  Just quiescence yourself, and throw in a tnargs when you need it.  Don't let your hp get too low, because he can crit very hard, and he will do it often.  All you have to do to beat a wizard is outlast him.  Once he is oom it is game over for him.  While he is nuking you, take the time in between heals to dispell him.  Just dispell dispell dispell until you take his rune.  Send in your pet(s) on him, and melee him down.  If he reapplies the rune, just dispell it.  Don't spend your mana trying to damage him, use it to heal yourself.<br />
<br />
Necros are hands down the hardest int caster to kill, and probably one of the tougher classes.  They typically have more HP than most int casters, they can heal themselves with lifetaps, they have an annoying pet, they have a great PR buff, and most importantly, their mana regen is on par with ours.  Start the fight by putting his pet out of commission.  Slow it, root it, and either forget about it or just kill it with a few velium strikes (spear of torment doesn't work very well).  Most necros will start the fight by lifetapping the living jesus out of you.  Just stand there and take it, like vs. wizards.  Most necros throw in dots as well, so this is what you have to do:  Get three instant clicks.  Click all three, then click off the first one.  Leave this slot empty.  If he dots you, dispell it.  If you have to quiescence, click the instant for the first slot, cast q, and click off the instant again.  If you screw up, that's why you have radient cure.  Eventually he'll start to get low on mana and will slow down.  This is your chance.  Dispell dispell dispell.  You HAVE to take his lich form.  If you don't, he will never go truly oom, just like a shaman.  By now, his pet should be under control, and your pet should be bashing the necromancer in the face.  Let your pet slowly wear him down.  You can melee as well, just make sure to dispell his lich whenever he recasts.<br />
<br />
That's it for int caster.  Other posts to follow.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Other priests are a real pain in the ass, because they can heal themselves.  However, they are not particularly dangerous.<br />
<br />
Clerics are a giant pain in the ass, because they will bash you over and over again, and their stupid hammer interrupts a lot.  On top of that, if they have ornate pants, they get a free hammer pet, which is also very annoying.  However, these are the only things a cleric can do to hurt you, assuming you have decent MR.  Even if you don't have decent MR, you should be able to outheal their nukes.  If they spend all their mana nuking you, they are oom and you win.  Most clerics will save it for heals, though.  Just get your pet on them and melee them down.  Test out their resists and see if anything can land.  If it doesn't, just settle in for the long haul, because this is going to take a while.  Most duels with clerics do not end in a death.  It usually ends in someone saying &quot;f this&quot; and leaving, a raid getting called and me having to leave, or someone falling asleep at the keyboard.  The only problem I can really forsee is a cleric that has a VT mace that procs manadrain, and remembers to use it.  However I have never run in to this.<br />
<br />
A well played druid is a challenging and fun class to duel.  Like dueling a necro, you need to set up your first few buffs so that you can dispell their dots.  They have a good CR nuke and a decent CR debuff, but you can dispell/RC the debuff, and the nuke takes considerable time to cast, so it isn't too much trouble to just outheal it.  When he figures out his nuke won't land, he'll start to use dots.  These are unresistable, but can be taken care of with dispell/RC.  A druid I dueled had the following items:  Epic (dot, resistable sometimes), Mithaniel Marr Scimitar (click unresistable? dot), one of the ES pieces (dot, unresistable), a freaking mistwalker scimitar, and a VT mace that procs mana drain.  This is hands down the longest fight I have ever been in.  Just shy of an hour, start to finish, even though he was oom 5 minutes in to it.  These dots, while not powerful on their own, add up to do some serious damage.  He was dotting me almost as fast as I could dispell them.  Occasionally I would screw up and get a dot at the end of my bufflist, and just have to eat it.  Eventually, though, I didn't have any buffs due to mistakes on my parts and chain dispelling on his.  These dots kept me on my toes, and his mace of dark thought kept me lom and him from being completely oom.  Spirit Call won this one for me.  This, however, was an exceptional druid, in both gear and skill.  Normally you can just outlast them.<br />
<br />
Other shamans is more of a contest of wills than anything else.  As long as you have it in you to say &quot;Hell no, I'm not going to die!&quot; then you won't die.  Sooner or later someone breaks.<br />
<br />
Rogues are the easiest class to kill.  Use a DS potions, quiescence yourself, and back in to a corner.  He'll kill himself faster than he kills you.  He can't heal himself and he can't pull out a twohander.  Rogues are completely helpless against a DS.<br />
<br />
Fighting against Warriors and Monks is like fighting a rogue, except harder.  Unless they're dumb, they will pull out a big whoopass twohander as soon as they realize you have a DS.  It takes a while, but eventually the DS and your pet will do its job, and they will die.  If you are getting low on health and their kicks are interrupting your heals, just run away, cast Q, and run around in a circle for a while until you are full health.<br />
<br />
Bards, contrary to popular belief, are beatable assuming they do not have an entire zone to kite in.  If they can just selos away, regen, and come back, then the fight will go on indefinately, because you will heal yourself as well as replenish your mana while he is running around.  Assuming you are fighting somewhere like bazaar arena, though, you are going to have quite a fight on your hands.  First off, if he has ancient mezz, you won't win.  Just give up, it is impossible.  He will just mezz you and manadrain you until you are oom.  Dotting yourself won't work because he has cure songs to get rid of it (note, this applies in arena fights.  I am not sure if you can cure your opponent if you /duel).  Assuming he doesn't have ancient mezz, though, you can win the fight, especially if the bard is dumb.  Dumb bards are probably the easiest class to kill.  I had one bard mezz my pet and then melee me.  While I had a DS.  And he didn't sing resist song.  Or his heal song.  Or cure songs after I hit him with BoS and BoN.<br />
<br />
To beat a bard, you are going to have to pay extremely close attention to what songs he is playing.  Bards can do everything, but they cannot do everything at once - only 4 things.  Most bards will manadrain you until you're oom, then finish you off.  If this is the strategy he is using, chain cast both of your rain spells on him, and pray that it kills him before you go oom.  If he has a lot more HP than you have mana, it won't work.  If the vice versa is true, you just might win.  If it doesn't work, don't worry, not all hope is lost.  Once you are oom and he is dotting you, this is what you do:  Wait until he manadrains you, then immediately cast canni4 twice, then quiescence yourself.  Manadrain has a 18? second recast timer, which is just barely enough time to canni enough mana for a Q.  You can fight him to a stalemate like this.  Also, you can dispell or RC his dots.  If he comes in to melee you, you have your DS potion (you do have one on you at all times, right?).  Bard melee is rather unimpressive, and like rogues, they can't use twohanders.  A combination of melee and full array of dots can be kind of hard to survive when oom, but if you can keep it up he'll eventually kill himself on your DS.  Do not melee him, though, because his DS is a lot nastier than yours.  Bards are definately the trickiest class to fight.  If you are a great dueler, though, you can beat a bard who isn't quite up to your skill level.  If he is as good as or better than you, though you will more likely than not lose.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">It is a very simple strategy (albeit difficult to execute) for beating rangers:   Don't let him bow you and instead force him to kill himself on your DS.  There is a very fine line you can walk that is just inside his archery range, and just outside his melee range.  If you watch what weapon he is holding in his hands, you can see what he is trying to do and adjust accordingly.  Let him melee you and let your pet wear him down.  He most likely outdamages quiescence, so when you start to get low, apply a fresh Q on yourself and kite him in the manner I described above.  It can be tricky to do, but if you have played any FPS games or just have a naturally good ability to move precisely in a 3D environment, it shouldn't be too hard.  Took me about 30 seconds to master.  This can take a while because rangers can heal themselves, and good ones will pull out a twohander.  Not only is a ranger with punishing blade AA and a nice twohander a beast for damagedealing, the twohander also means that your DS potions aren't doing much.  They are, however, doing something and eventually you will win.<br />
<br />
Beastlords.  This is the class I have the least experience with.  They aren't particularly dangerous, but their pet is a giant pain in the ass.  Their pet is the only pet that draws its resists from the master.  This means that if you have a hard time slowing the beastlord, you're going to have a hard time slowing the pet.  The pet doesn't do too much damage really, but the biggest problem is that it quads and bashes you in the face constantly.  This makes it damn near impossible to channel a spell through one.  Against players, you can usually run past them and it will take them a second or two to turn around and catch you, giving you time to cast something, but this won't work on pets.  They track you flawlessly, which means that you cannot get away from the bashing for long enough to cast a spell unmolested.  You have to channel, and if you just get an unlucky string of interrupts, it can be lights out for you.  This is the biggest problem I have with beastlords.  If you can manage to slow the pet, you have pretty much won.  Beastlord melee is not impressive at all, and their spells are all easy to resist.  Just let your DS do its work and your pet wear him down.<br />

Paladins and Shadowknights are very similar, so I will group them together.  In short, an uber knight is the most dangerous opponent you can find.  They use twohanders almost exclusively, and almost all high end knight weapons proc either a heal or a rune, or some other nastiness.  The twohander means that your DS won't be doing much damage, and the insane amounts of worn regen on their EP+ armor means that almost all of that damage is going to be negated.  On top of that, many knights also gear themselves to have considerable FT.  This means they won't be going oom for a long time, if ever.  Even if they do go oom, it doesn't make much of a difference.  They will still be able to outdamage anything you can throw at them, just by melee alone.  If they aren't oom, expect the shadowknight to be reaming you a new one with his nukes and lifetaps.  The paladin can also heal himself indefinately with both direct heals and a decent HoT.  Hopefully you have the MR to resist his 10 second stun.  If you don't, you're royally screwed.  On top of all these things, they also get damned twohanded bash, the most annoying AA of all time.  I literally cannot channel a damn thing through a bashing knight.  I have had strings of 15+ interrupts on a 2.8 second tnargs.  All you can really do is try your typical strategy of healing yourself and praying you outlast them.<br />
<br />
Basically, a knight with EP gear and a ton of AA is a monster.  I have only had my ass truly and thoroughly kicked once, and it was by a beast of a shadowknight (he soloes gorenaire =\ ).</div></div><hr />

On topc though..  mages are the worst class period in PvP.   (besides pure melees)    Pets are easily slowed/rooted.   Pet burn?  Run in circles, they'll never hit ya..  they poof rather quickly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't duel very often at all, but I remember a guild Arena bash (the zone off Lake Rathe) where the mage was the hardest person to kill. It helped that at 60 he had a few levels on most people and had oodles of AA.<br />
<br />
This was pre-PoP, and I was playing ranger at the time so I couldn't comment on fighting him as a shaman, but he'd run around in circles on his chain horse, set a pet on someone, and when the pet was nearly dead, or if it was slowed/rooted, he would reclaim, and cast another one. With all his AA, he cast the pets really quickly and reclaimed more mana than he spent.<br />
<br />
He stayed out of melee range all the time, and was very hard to retarget if you'd switched to his pet, and of course had a damage shield up on himself. For me archery (pre AA) was my best bet, but he certainly killed many people that day.<br />
<br />
I'm just curious how you'd fight a mage chain petting like this? I would guess sending Dogdog on the mage, and keeping the pet rooted would help. A shaman could heal himself against the pet when it got the hits in, to an extent that a ranger couldn't, and could heal Dogdog against nukes and the damage shield.<br />
<br />
But it seems to me that a mage who knows what he's doing would be harder to kill than people give the class credit for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A mage can't heal himself. Ignore his pet and kill the mage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The only reason people aim for shaman in mass pvp is that they become lethal in the combination with a chanter (and a bard). <br />
<br />
For solo pvp, which is where I spend 90% of my online time, at the high end (230mr+, rest 200+) a shaman wins by boring the opponent to the point of falling asleep/zoning or by draining their mana empty. The latter which only really has any effect on a caster. Then we win with melee power. Naturally, this does not work versus a chanter. He has complete control and will get us oom faster than us him.<br />
<br />
A rogue we beat by porcupining in a corner.<br />
<br />
The rest of the melees and hybrids we should not be able to beat.<br />
<br />
PvP had some semblance of balance pre Velious. Why I insist of keeping it up and not rolling up yet another hybrid_twink_023 is beyond me too.<br />
<br />
<br />
Jinheim, you have some good hints and pointers. I'd like to comment on some of it. As you obviously took some time to write all that down I'm sure you wouldn't mind some constructive critique.<br />
<br />
Again, remember I am talking of elemental+ geared people here. High resists, high atk, high hp's. They have the clickies and have met shaman before. Our dots will be resisted 90% of the time or more, even after debuffs. Our nukes/rains can do partial damage still. Our pet will do near insignificant damage to melee classes. They will outregen its dps.<br />
<br />
Enchanters:<br />
Sorry to say, but a shaman should loose to a chanter nine times out of ten. They beat us at our own game. Even if you use a crimson potion (selfdot) they are in control. Their rune is more manaefficient than our nukes/rains. Potions cure our dots should they ever land. The rune keeps them from being interupted. Insta AA rune for emergencies. The enchanter drains our mana faster than we do theirs.<br />
<br />
Their pet wins over ours since the chanter has runes for it and because chanter pets are (at least on red servers) still very bugged. In tests I have run the enchanter pet has resisted two full manabars of dots after debuffs. All nukes but one were resisted. A wizard had lures resisted. It took a lifeburn and HT to bring down the pet. Our best bet in taking out their pet is using melee and damage shield. Both which the enchanter can counter using rune and dispells.<br />
<br />
Chanter pvp may not look very powerful, but in essence they have every tool they need to counter any and all tricks we can pull off. Automatic cast interupts using mez, pro-active healing using runes, best manadrain, best dispells, pet and nukes for finishing off. The nukes may not be top notch, but they dont need to be. The chanter wins the mana game, thus their nukes can be as inefficient as you like. They still win.<br />
<br />
Mage:<br />
Mostly agree with you here. Once their pet is slowed all you have to do is outheal their nukes, should they ever land, and stay wary for their swarmpets. The mage cannot debuff more than you and they cannot cure their pets slow (unlike beastlords for example). <br />
<br />
I usually slow the mage pet, let him use his swarmpets and after that is done I'm in control. Nothing he can do we cannot counter. Heals take care of nukes, slow takes care of his pet (blind/root usually dispelled by a competent mage), annul takes care of mala.  Then I stick my swarmpets on the mage to keep him busy, and while he is kiting those I kill off his pet quickly. After that it's just me and the mage. I melee better, I regen mana and hps better. The mage has nothing to counter. Pretty easy kill. We win.<br />
<br />
Wizard:<br />
General strategy as you point out is to go very defensive with the spellcasting. More so than against others. But by all means stick to him with the melee all the time. It's free damage for us.<br />
<br />
However as pointed out already, their Xcul pet is a threat once they start laying on some serious nuke damage and you have to channel those heals. <br />
<br />
Our swarmpets and normal pet is usually the tideturner here. Versus an elemental geared wizards ac our pets will still chew through his best rune and do some solid damage unless he kites them. Which buys us the time to recoup hps and regen mana.<br />
<br />
In the end we should win by superior mana/hp regen and our melee. Surprise.<br />
<br />
Necro:<br />
In pvp you can usually work on the assumption that offensive dispelling is a waste of time and mana. People have 2+ instaclicks and know how to use them. You will not be able to strip his liche. Enchanters and those int casters with the Aten bracer can usually clean you out on buffs though.<br />
<br />
The positive thing with necros is that malos overwrites dmf. I know alot of necros who arent aware of this, and they will fall prey to our nukes/dots because they never put much priority on their unbuffed poison resist.<br />
<br />
To counter some of your arguments. At 250mr you will start resisting necro lifetaps pretty regularly. The -250 resist modifier is not working in the same way other spells do. A smart necro will use your pet to heal himself on (or use eye of zomm), thus a smart shaman wont use a regular pet against a necro. Swarm pets are still good.<br />
<br />
Killing a necro is very much like killing a mage, only its alot slower since he will still land some of his lifetaps, and he also has two invulns. Just remember that while the lifetaps are pretty scary stuff, as long as the necro keeps on using them (450mana) you should win. You are more manaefficient. Generally just staying out of range of the necro as much as possible will prevent him from using liche to its full extent. <br />
<br />
Something to watch out for is wake the dead. When used on the corpse of a wizard (heavy lures), chanter (nukes, tash--&gt; his lifetaps will start hitting, mez, charm) or shadowknight (harmtouch) this ability can be lethal.<br />
<br />
Should be a win, but very tricky.<br />
<br />
Clerics:<br />
Agreed. With the exception of shaman vs shaman this is the ultimate valium.<br />
<br />
In the end it will be your pet, your superior manaregen and better melee capability that wins. Swift like the wind and avatar works wonders. If one person has ToT hammer the balance strongly tips in that persons favour.<br />
<br />
Don't underestimate cleric nukes. Sometimes they will land for full and will crit. Don't fall below 50% hps thinking this is a pushover fight.<br />
<br />
Also, turn on damage shield reports to make sure you are not beating yourself to death on kilvas skin of flame and the chardok ring (total 31+25 pt dmg shield).<br />
<br />
Boring but pretty safe win.<br />
<br />
Druid:<br />
A druids dots are not unresistable. At 200mr you will start to resist quite a few of them. They have a -100mr modifier.<br />
<br />
Should they land at the top of your bufflist, by all means dispell if you have the time. Otherwise a quiescence will outdo them.<br />
<br />
Dispell ro's fiery sundering. It debuffs your fireresist and can lead to some pretty heavy nukage hitting you. While we loose mana relative to the druid by dispelling it, we regen mana faster so this is ok.<br />
<br />
Fighting a druid is like fighting a gimp wizard/cleric. Preserve your mana and go mostly defensive. When you pop swarmpets, try to wedge into his defenses by going full offensive. If that doesnt work, back to defensive and recoup mana. <br />
<br />
Our swarmpets and regular pet is our ace versus a druid. However, in the end its the manabattle all over again. Who has the ToT mace and who has better manaregen.<br />
<br />
An annoying item is the druid PoGrowth gauntlets that casts a damage shield. Can be countered by pulling out the good ole JBB and laughing at the druid. Mostly a joke, but can be done.<br />
<br />
I've had fights with druids where neither of us could use spells to kill the other. Swarmpets were just kited out of range of me. I could not use melee to kill the druid because of their damage shield. It ended in both of us just standing there looking dumb.<br />
<br />
We should win most druid fights based on superior manaregen, but no safe bet.<br />
<br />
Shaman:<br />
Futile.<br />
<br />
Rogue:<br />
Agreed. Dmg shield and defensive. Get in a corner to disallow proper backstabbing and help with channeling.<br />
<br />
Warrior/monk:<br />
The problem with the pet strategy is that our pets wont do enough damage versus these classes. Lots of block/parry skills and the ac to go with it.  A warrior/monk can beat up our pet in mere seconds. If we resort to healing them we will go oom fast.<br />
<br />
Most warriors and monks also have very high hp regen. Monk also has mend. In the end I think this is mostly a loosing battle for a shaman. They wont be able to kill us, but we will run oom trying to land anything on them. A dmg shield wont do much against double (and triple+ attacks) from insane ratio 2handers.  <br />
<br />
Lucky warrior kick coupled with stun disc when in berzerk mode (dont ask me how he got berzerk) or monk with a lucky hundred blows proc is their finishing moves. Otherwise we are just going to see alot of shaman running around in circles and them chasing.  Either way, loss for us.<br />
<br />
Insert any hybrid class:<br />
This is getting too long, so I'll just add this up by saying that fighting hybrids is a loosing battle. They all have the melee dps, yes even bards do good damage at high levels, and have either the versatility to counter anything you do (paladin/bard/ranger) or just the plain out insane dps to go all out offensive and never give you a fighting chance (sk). Add on abilities/spells such as:<br />
<br />
-high ac, high regen and selfheals<br />
-bard aria of asceticism (instant shaman ownage)<br />
-bard manadrain (most broken spell in game imo)<br />
-paladin touch of crusader (instant shaman ownage)<br />
-solid 2handed melee from all but bard (bard compensates with ok 1hand melee and twisted dot songs)<br />
<br />
and you are basically fighting a warrior/monk on steroids with the ability to finish you off.<br />
<br />
<br />
Other stuff:<br />
About your weird experiences with resists using nukes Jinheim. This is not widely known, but at 400+ in resist the PVP resist system starts to act strange.<br />
<br />
Casting root (+25resist modifier) on someone with 410mr:<br />
Fifteen out of 100 hundred stuck.<br />
<br />
Casting greater immobilize (-30resist modifier) on someone with 410mr:<br />
Two out of 100 hundred stuck.<br />
<br />
Perhaps this sample is too low to show anything decisive, but over the last year when people have reached 400+ in resists I have noticed very strange results in resist rates. Versus a top notch geared player with 360mr I dont bother with malos. Instead I buff them with resist magic. If nothing else it throws them off guard totally and you have something to blame if you loose. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
The rampant inflation in resists on items has totally killed the shaman pvp game. If you want to pvp as a shaman, stay with the lvl50 crowd. It is somewhat balanced here.</div></div><hr />

Hi Asta, your first comment about sums it up.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>mediman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I am currently part of a 20 person guild , battling a 80 member or so EP geared guild. Pvping solo, is pointless.  Unless i know person has crap resists, or just cant play their class, its a waste of my time.  However, give me one other class pvping with me and i can generally complement their abilities.   One thing i havent heard mentioned is our aa ability virulent paralysis.  Even tho its 3 min recast i find it very useful.   It usually sticks after i toss a dr debuff.  yes people can cure it with a potion fairly easily, but i find that spamming your debuff keeps enough counters on them to make it harder.   fighting a bard, sk, chanter, or pally is generally pointless.  wizards or necros w/o their burn up are doable if you can play the mana game.    druids , you can generally out last , if you keep their fr debuff dispelled.  rangers if they dont have a good 2hander are killable also.   mages cant heal so they die also.   I play on Rallos Zek, most people at my level are very prepared.  They all carry cure potions, many have 10 charge heal potions as well.   Life as a shaman in pvp is not balanced anymore.  Other classes get much better aa for pvp.</div></div><hr />

We annul, pumice, etc... strip the buffs.<br />

I agree, resist factors against shaman are brutal esp when you can just cure our dots with a potion, we NEED lure dots that are uncurable.<br />

I STRONGLY suggest we get:<br />
<br />
Silence spell dot for 60 seconds (Lure, recast 60 seconds)<br />
Manadrain dot to steal up to 1500 mana in 45 seconds <br />
Lure dots that are uncurable but deal out say 512 damage a tick for 4 ticks (curse line, only can be cured by Remove curse or GRC)<br />
<br />
NOW these would make a shaman a shaman!  We can curse our enemies, steal mana like we steal hp and silence those that oppose us with our tribal chantings.<br />

<br />
At 400 MR in PVP the resist rolls over.  It effectively becomes zero.  This is *after* resist modifications on individual spells are tallied.<br />
<br />
-30 MR resist mod spell vs 420 MR = 390 net MR = likely resist.<br />
<br />
0 MR resist mod spell vs 420 MR = 20 net MR = likely hit.<br />
<br />
There are chanters in our guild that have to tash themselves before going pvping, it's a real problem.<br />
<br />
That said, sometimes the best spell to lead with in PVP is resist magic (assuming your opponent is in the dark on all this and doesn't just click it off).<br />
<br />
This is only true of *MR* - other resists do not roll over.<br />
<br />
Lately I am starting to feel that shaman don't have a chance in the very high end game when people got tons of MR. <br />
<br />
At high end PVP our offensively abilities are reduced to that of a cleric's.  No dots will land, no debuffs, our nukes are chain resisted.  We become very inept meleers that can heal.  But we can heal efficiently.<br />
<br />
If your opponent's resists are borderline good, then a tash stick + malos can help.  If time isn't a concern then after both are on (if they dont just get cured/dispelled) then you can work on malosinia.  Once he's tashed/malosiniad then maybe you can stick some stuff.<br />
<br />
Probably the best advice I can give you is get a nice weapon.  Mace of Dark Thoughts sucks in my opinion but if that floats your boat great.<br />
<br />
I'd recommend the mace from plane of water, Sharkspine Club.  Has a 450 point lure attached to it that you can crit for 900 (pvp modifier applies).  I have never had it resisted in pvp.<br />
<br />
A good weapon will be your only effective way of doing damage.  Your pet will die make no mistake.  <br />
<br />
DR is often the worst resist that people have - often not always.  Not a bad strat is to wear people down through melee then once you have them low quickly DR debuff, DR root, and spiritcall.  Spiritcall is best used as an interrupter - if you can get people low enough, and can make someone stationary then they will not likely be able to channel a thing with 5 dogs and yourself beating on them.<br />
<br />
<br />
But you're absolutely right about high end resists.  Pre-VT we were perhaps the most formidable solo PVP class.  With the resists blown through the roof by VT/PoP gear we've become an afterthought.<br />
<br />
If VI was serious about PVP then imho they would do another resist balance similar to the one they did a year ago - just move the modifier for pvp spells again.  But, they're not~</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, all pvp servers were brought down for an update yesterday, and rumors are that they fixed the rollover problem. Test it out!<br />
<br />
About peoples disease resists. Dunno whats up with elemental gear, but everyones disease resist has really taken a huge jump. It cant all be stonewood compound bows either.<br />
<br />
On weaponry. Haven't been very lucky getting the sharkspine club unfortunately. No luck on staff of eternal flames either. However, just got Time flagged so I'm holding out for a Hammer of Hours (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=21886) instead I think. 750dd means 500dd pvp damage (1k critted!) with a -200magic resist modifier. Leading with malos that should actually work for pvp against everyone but the very insanely geared. Or bards. As usual.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Yes Kaneex. There's a 75% rule. In pvp you cannot take more than 75% of your total (not current, but total) hitpoints in damage from one single spell source. This is not really a problem for a shadowknight anyway. Againsta a low hp class like shaman he just whacks you a couple times for 150+ a pop, then HTs for 75% of your total hp, then finishes off with a 310dmg lifetap when you start to run/heal. This is one of the problems fighting a shadowknight. You are in essence dead once you reach 75% hps. There is no margin for error.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Koridar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Occasionally It will. the Problem is that anything other than spear and Malos will get resisted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">&quot;After malos, I couldn't land a single spell on any of them&quot;<br />
<br />
that single sentence is all you need to know about endgame pvp as a shaman. <br />
<br />
slow the opponents? what the hell? where do you find room for slow in a pvp line up at 65? malos+sini? same question. (edit) duh, damn time clicky!<br />
<br />
poison nukes land with a fair amount of regularity but are often partials. <br />
<br />
against enemy casters I find that the best method to force them to gate (cause you aint gonna kill them unless they are stupid) is to out heal them as best I can and chain cast saryn. if it lands they cry, refresh it before it runs all the way out, if you can refresh it before they run/gate (you can smell it when they are about to bail on ya) its really our only spell that posses much threat to casters and at least on sullon people are just idiots when it comes to pvp clickies. they think they are the **** with a gobbie ear but dont carry cure pois potions or pumice/crimson pots. <br />
<br />
the difference between the vt/ep geared crowd and the bazaar geared is just insane. vrs the uber geared sk I just zone. vrs the bazaar n00b who just blew his dt on one of my group I decay/vp/malos/saryn/petburn/mem slow/cripple/Bane and hit him with those, blind his ass, and before vp is up hes dead. he never even got a swing on me, I resisted what ever he cast on me. the difference gear makes is mind boggling in pvp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In mass PvP I tend to spot heal and spam malos. Sometimes if I'm lucky I will let loose the puppies of war on someone who is low health (although it wont be me that got them to low health)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Skyline_SZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">SUP diabalein!   yea Shaman pvp is pretty lame.  if they nerf SK's ht and spears resistance   and upgrade shaman to have another poison based nuke with at least 1k based nuke, im sure alot of shamans will stop bitching or bitch a whole lot less.  The reason most of us dont regularly use the nukes( 650) is because its usually resisted or does like 200 damage pvp.  I have max out my DoT AAs (crits) and have Dot haste/ damage/ extension... but its only nice versus trash newbies with their bazaar gear.  <br />
<br />
the only role a shaman have in a group PVP battle (versus uber gear)right now is Basically  Chain pelling buff/ Qing  and healing whoever takes damage/ Malosing/ and slowing melees with turgur (Yes it lands frequently with people under 270ish MR (considering malos/tash combo).<br />
WHERE'S THE FUN WHEN U CANT COIN/KILL ANYONE!!</div></div><hr />
