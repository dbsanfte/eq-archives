<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lalaas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I have to admit I'm still in a bit of shock here. Last night my guild went to CoM, with a few friends from GWM and the Tarew Marr Alliance.<br />
<br />
Friday night we participated in a raid to PoA, and it ended nearly before we started. We got wiped on port to isle 2.<br />
<br />
So, I wasn't too optimistic about the CoM raid, but I was slightly hopeful. Once we got inside the locked door, there were 6 reavers on track. We took out the first one, close to the door, and the raid leader shouts out the link: &quot;Jade Reaver.&quot; I thought, &quot;great! at least one's dropped. Mebbe there's hope, with some of these longer chains I've read about at the Glade.&quot;<br />
The group just before us had apparently had a chain of 68 (IIRC) reavers spawn, with 6 JRs.<br />
<br />
We killed the other 4-5 that were attainable, not the one that spawns the uber-mob. I died once. None of the reavers we killed chain-spawned.<br />
So, about  3 hours after we ported over there, and about 35 minutes after the last reaver, to my amazement, I was awarded my Jade Reaver!!!!! <br />
<br />
&quot;Holy Cr#$%!!!! &quot; I thought. This isn't really happening, is it? Sure enough, I was given the reaver. The group decided not to wait the 4-5 hours for another black reaver spawn, so we left around midnite est. With a druid friend of mine (Thanks, Kiyraah!) I ran around Norrath working on the next sections of my epic.<br />
<br />
Now, finally, I'm ready to face VSR. All of a sudden, Swifty, which seemed beyond my reach, is light-years closer!<br />
<br />
Thanks to all in BRR, GWM, and the others in TMA that made this truly an amazing night for me.<br />

&lt;edit&gt; By the way, I have to also thank Crydee for his excellent guide, and Sunmoon for the Glade. Also, all of you who post here. I've been in EQ for 3.5 years, and found the Glade 2 years ago. Took until Sept to register &amp; post, though. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ralv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm in the same boat Tinolan.  Seriously considering selling some equipment to just buy the damn thing and be done with it.  Oh yeah, congrats Lalaas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thandal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Congratulations Lalaas!! Look for me when you go for VSR. Would love to come help you beat him down when the time comes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>akgriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Gratz , I just lead a raid to CoM on sunday but alas no drop and our little raid got wiped when our Enchanter accidently mezzed the the lord and he AoE'd us to death..oh well heading back this sunday and hopefull will get the JR !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Eorlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hey, while people are posting stories, I figure I may as well add mine.<br />
Quick note on VSR: He is a friggin' pansy. I was in a 17-person raid that was pieced together from KC groups that wanted to come. There was only one cleric, and several people (the main tank included) attacked the vsr skeleton. Still, we owned him with four deaths (the level 52 MT couldn't keep the aggro...). The raid leader got one stone and I lost the roll (with a 31 vs a 39) on the 2nd. The winner had no idea what it was, and he was one of the people to attack the vsr skele. Usually I oppose giving epic drops based on what you have (entirely because I have done everything BUT the stuff you have to fight for :p ), but I am considering changing my mind... :p<br />
So VSR should be easy; he requires little to no planning and to own him with a zergling rush, which you can make from random people in KC. There truly is hope!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gilorien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Grats, Lalaas! <br />
<br />
I'm glad to hear that there is hope. I need only the JR to finish Swifty and will be going on one (maybe two) CoM raids in the next few days. Cross your fingers for me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tirronan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I went in with a 2 group raid for him, he was so easy that I came away feeling 1 group was more than enough.  Level average was 58.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Forestknight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">since this is about thankin mates for helpin get a JR... and stories about getting one... thought i would post here<br />
<br />
lvl 43 Ranger of Karana<br />
<br />
mates from Dawning Eclipse and i went to CoM and i was 3rd in line for a JR, thinkin i was gonna just have a ton of fun and learn about the area... i headed in with mates.<br />
<br />
first round of DR yielded 1 JR for first mate who was a lvl 59 druid, second round started what 2 hours after first round? and first DR spawns 4 more in a chain and no JR... so we head up the elevator and wait for spawns there.. and boom first DR drops a JR, and wait for second to spawn.. and boom second one drops a JR... so anyway got mine... thanks for ye help maties (Dawning Eclipse, Bertox server)<br />
<br />
reading these boards i was sceptical i would get my round.. i was hopin for some practice and just prepare for future...<br />
<br />
but everything turned up great</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lalaas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Grats, Forestknight. :)<br />
<br />
It's good to hear other successes here. Without all the ones before, I prolly wouldn't have even started on my epic, and now I'm just a couple of fights and a SSoC away. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tienas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hey Forestknight yeah that was cool DE rocks. I actually got the first JR then Sedira. man we were so lucky to have 3 drops. This is my VSR story anyway: I was just grouping in KC and this druid was starting a raid for it so I said I'd join we took him down with 2 groups and I won the roll on the second one!! That was exciting I was too lucky.  But after I got the Jade Reaver I was finally able to move on I only have 3 pieces left now.<br />
<br />
Soulbound Hammer - Jaeil the Insane (easy)<br />
Sphere of Swirling Colors - Essence Tamer (medium)<br />
Shattered Emerald of Corruption - Hate Mob (Hard!)<br />
<br />
Think I will get the hammer early February! It's easily chain quested too so it should be very eay to get as long as we get to him. Good luck to everyone else.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sembrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My guild took down VSR with 7 people, think highest was 61? at most.  Get slow off and yer fine.  Runes help a lot too, though he doens't proc his lifetap THAT much, nothing like VS heh   Got some friends for Reaver hunting, had, again, 7 people - pulled the easy ones, got 2 reavers, only person who died was me (the tank, 58 at the time) - though I forget why hehe  Got the PoA stone from MQ (knew like 5 peeps who had extras, ask around, or offer to buy) THANKS WULFSOUL! =)  The Hole kill is a joke to be sure.  It's harder to get to the guy than it is to kill him, by FAR.  Still waiting on the Hate stone for sword number 2 though.  All this and it only took 9 months... hehe I'm slacker.  GL to all those who are still after this weapon, it's worth the hassle, the haste anyways... =P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Hawkwind Dniwkwak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Killed him with a 65 Ranger, 65 Bard, 65 Cleric, 65 Monk, 57 Rogue, and 52 Ranger (at the time I was 52). Was a fun fight, and I let one of them loot the stone since I didn't need the other one. :)<br />
<br />
All that's left is Hole &amp; POA; not gonna bother with Hate stone unless I'm invited to a POH raid or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Popigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">PoA is cake, My guild did it with about 20-25 people, 5 hours AND killed the big pony boss on that Isle. About 7 SSoC's dropped. Also got 2 outta the 3 peices for my DCoS, heh. Going on a CoM raid on Wednesday, will post results if any.<br />

Pray for me :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
