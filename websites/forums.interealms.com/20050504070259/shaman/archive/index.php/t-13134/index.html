<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yes, but the effects dont</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tailz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">OK, and I assume celerity has a higher percentage than SQ?... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Spirit quickening is like certain chanter hastes that also have additional effects beyond Haste, like an ATK Bonus primarily.   The Shaman line of Hastes are just raw Haste.   The haste component of spells do not stack, so since Celerity is faster it stays, but it won't outright cancel Spirit Quickening due to the ATK Buff component.<br />

They DO stack.  But it breaks down to simple haste stacking.<br />
<br />
You can stack ONE item, ONE spell, and ONE song that have haste components.  This has been known forever.<br />
<br />
What you are doing when you stack Celerity and Spirit Quick is trying to stack 2 HASTE spells.  The higher one will cancel the lower one out, so celerity (50%) will cancel SQ (30?%).  However, because SQ aslo has an ATK bonus and an AC bonus only the haste portion of the spell is overwritten.  Your pet will still get the AC and ATK bonus that SQ gives, but will use the haste from Celerity.</div></div><hr />

yay n stuff</div></div><hr />

Yes and No...<br />
<br />
ONE ITEM<br />
ONE SPELL/SONG<br />
<br />
with the exception of a few Bard songs that stack with everything.<br />
Melody of Ervej(sp) Battlecry of the Vah shir and Warsong of the Vah Shir<br />
<br />
other than those 3 songs(i don't think there are any more) Spell = Song</div></div><hr />

You are correct of course.  Pardon my gaffe, but in my own defense at the time of the writing I had not had my coffee yet.  Also, its been awhile since I was with a bard that did not use one of those 3 songs (usually battlecry) so my brain took it as fact.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>CaradocBertoxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah,  My main is a Monk, and playing a shaman aswell now, it's fun.<br />
the thing that gets me is people STILL trying to tell me that Alacrity(40%) and monk epic (40%) stack - as in the haste components stack.<br />
<br />
what i'm going to do now.. I have a hammer 4 / 60.  going to go to bloodmaw with a shaman friend.. going to parse 10 min NO haste/epic<br />
and just autoattack.  and parse that, ( removing all double strikes )<br />
<br />
then do it with Alacrity 10 min.. removing all double strikes<br />
then do it with Epic 10 min.. removing all double strikes<br />
then with Alarcity and epic 10 min.. removing all drouble strikes<br />
<br />
i'll post the results,  the RAW logs and the edit'ed logs ( double's removed)<br />
<br />
and we'll see how things go.  I just want proof for myself.<br />
<br />
and for casting SQ on other peoples pets.. i tried once and it auto targeted my pet.. so never tried again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">One other point about stacking haste: there is one other instance where you can stack another item: the Fleeting Quiver stacks with all the other listed above, so archers can in theory use two haste items at the same time, if one of them is the quiver. <br />
<br />
I gather this is because &quot;technically&quot; the quiver isn't a haste item, it reduces the built-in delay on arrows. But the practical effect is that archery happens faster...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">BTW you can cast SQ on other peoples pets <br />
<br />
Is this a recent change? I haven't used the spell in about 4 months but I know when I did cast it that it autotargeted my pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You never used to be able to cast SQ on other people's pets.  You would get a message to the effect that &quot;this spell can only be cast on your pet.&quot;<br />
I have no idea if this has changed since that spell has been in the back of my book for ages now.  <br />
<br />
As far as spell/song stacking.  There is a monk semi-epic weapon from an iksar quest that has a clicky song effect that stacks with spell haste buffs.  Not sure why you would need that tho, since a chanter haste buff or even a 63+ shaman could put a 41% hasted melee over haste cap.  <br />
<br />
But otherwise, ya it's either the song or the haste buff that takes the effect.  I really don't understand how the over-the-cap bard haste buffs work tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'll try it again tonight but last time I tried it (about a month ago) I was able to cast it on a mage pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jeradin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Our pet buff is a joke, if haste on it was more inline with other classes pet buffs it would maybe be worth casting.<br />

<br />
You could give Druids a 5,000,000,000,000 % pet haste, and all it'll do is make the pet miss 50 billion times faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Maybe if they cast it on their summoned pet, but charmed pets are a different story.</div></div><hr />
