<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>iasmin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Friends and guildmates took me to Plane of Valor last night and I thought to report a few things about grouping experience since I went twice with two very different groups. I'm not sure how much this will ultimately help other shaman, but I'm reporting it here because it's information I would have looked for ahead of time had I known we were going to Valor.<br />
<br />
Group 1<br />
Personal XP: 90 minutes. XP roughly 12% total (straight XP, no AA%)<br />
Makeup: 62 PAL, 62 ENC, 56 SHM (me, horse, DogDog), 57 PAL, 57 CLR, 58 BRD<br />
Location: East Wall<br />
<br />
Notes: With the Enchanter casting Tash I was golden landing my spells. It was rare that I had to cast the malo line at all as nothing much seemed to be resisted as long as I began casting after the Tash started. With KEI and my beloved horse, Pokey, I could cast slow, Bane of Nife, Plague, and still buff people in rotation as they came up, and still canni to near full between pulls without any trouble.<br />
<br />
Assuming we got single pulls, that is. The 57 pally did an excellent job of single pulling. He writes (privately to me), &quot;There was a string of 4 static spawns, in a rough line away from our camp point near the wall. Given that mob assist agro radius seems significantly smaller for proximity pulls than hard-agro pulls, I just snuck near each mob until it noticed me and came at me. One thing this let me do was to bring the mobs in with minimal agro on me. I didn't want {the cleric} to have to heal me - I wanted his mana focused on {the 62 pally}. So when she landed a stun or two, she had good solid agro. Each of those mobs is a single static spawn, so they're not tied to spawn together. Now, the roamers could (and did) move around in tight groups sometimes, so I was careful to avoid them.&quot;<br />
<br />
In terms of spell timing, as I mentioned, I cast slow when I saw the enchanter's &quot;begins to cast a spell&quot; message. My slow would typically land after his tash. Then it was a matter of having Bane of Nife work its magic until it ran out. I typically got two casts of this plus one plague, if I recall correctly. Rather refreshing to actually have DoTs run out for once. I've not had much experience with DoTs going to completion. Another thing I noticed was that unless I was standing right on top of the MoB, I never pulled agro. Dogdog happily chewed on Golem butt, and our pallys took care of that nicely with knockback and sheer force of will, I think. But it colored me for the second group...<br />
<br />
Group 2<br />
Personal XP: 90 minutes. XP roughly 12% total (straight XP, no AA%)<br />
Makeup: 62 WAR, 65 CLR, 56 SHM (me, horse, no DogDog), 58 BRD, 57 PAL, 57 ROG<br />
Location: West Wall<br />
<br />
Notes: Mob was in the castle when we arrived and the Warrior who scouted ahead was dead before we could reach him. We pulled a second errant mob out of the castle onto the bridge and dispatched him before rezzing the warrior. *somewhere* in there, I managed to fall off that bridge due to a lag spike and found myself on the Eastern Wall staring into the somewhat surprised faces of two corpses and a man on a horse, while some golems were pathing away. Thank god for bardic invisibility catching up with me. The bard on the bridge above was in just close enough range that I could hide using his song's invisibility. But I loaded mine just in case because it took me a minute to figure out why I was there and what had happened.<br />
<br />
With the East Wall effectively camped, we swung around to the West Wall where a group was leaving. The new group makeup should have had me casting my spells differently from the get go, but I wasn't thinking clearly and simply assumed it would be business as usual. I followed the same basic pattern of casting as on the East Wall, but learned that I really needed to cast the malo now all the time and often repeatedly because the bard was playing his tash song and you have to time slows differently when casting with a bard song active. Above all, I learned that I had to wait until the mob was at about 80 percent health to cast Bane of Nife and then I only cast it once per mob as opposed to twice per on the EW camp. I did not cast plague as I did in the EW camp. And I used a different set of buffs entirely, this time casting my Regrowth group spell on a whim and having everyone say &quot;oooh, coool.&quot; So I kept it up.<br />
<br />
Here's the thing I'm constantly forgetting: Warriors don't get agro like Pallys do. You have to wait a little longer to cast or you'll take more hits than you'd like. If I'd been thinking with that in mind, I wouldn't have cast Bane so quickly right away the first few pulls. Got munched on, but not so bad that my gear couldn't handle it. Still, being consistently first or second on the aggro list is a position I'd rather not be in for long. Realistically I know it will happen, but that doesn't mean I have to like it.<br />
<br />
I did not have Dogdog there the second time because I was too busy on the insertion to remember to do it and he stayed sleeping the rest of the night. The puller again as the 57 pally though as the rest of the night progressed, the 58 bard started pulling a bit too. The pally writes (again privately) concerning mob placement, saying &quot;When they were fully popped, there were 2 mobs in the SW corner or the spawn area (closest to the cliff) who looked too close together for a single pull, even by proximity pull. That's the pair where I wanted a lull. Once we had the camp broken up, and the mobs respawning singly, there was MUCH less worry about getting an assisting add on a hard-agro pull; that made it a lot easier for {the bard} to snare/slow pull. While the first group {of mobs} was in a line moving away from the EW in a north-south line, the WW mobs spawned in a cluster around the rocks there. I believe there were a total of 7 mobs in the pull area.&quot;<br />
<br />
Edit: added one last comment on the WW mob placement from the pally puller.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Whackiest and most fun time I've had in PoV was an outdoor cave kiting group. (Pre-cursor to HoH GY kiting groups).  Ranger pulled and the Mages / Wizzies / Necros absolutely destroyed the MOB. I was there for C5 and ....well....an occasional DOT. <br />
<br />
NO healer required. Load up on your DoTs and go to town.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did the kiting thing too, my friend necro and I duo'd. He'd run in, pull, and kite it around. I'd throw on malo, dot and send in doggy. Any adds I'd kite it around untill I could land root and help with the other. It was fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Patzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Had a great Pick up group the other day in PoV. We had all your group requirements, War, Ranger, Cleric, Chanter, Sham (me), Mage, and something else I can't remember maybe a druid?... We went in the tunnels (left from zone in) and plowed through all the mobs in tunnel and camped in the back room where The Sleep Walker spawns. Dropped him in a good 10 minute fight (with two deaths) I won a Signet of Valorous ring and also an Eth Parch dropped. Was a lot of fun and really really good exp. I managed half a level of reg exp and half a lvl of AA exp.</div></div><hr />
