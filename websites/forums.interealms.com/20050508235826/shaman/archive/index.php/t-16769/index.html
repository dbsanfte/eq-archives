<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Working on the wood elf crown for Chubs and since it's been like 2+ years since I've been in Seb I was wondering if folks could give me an idea of where the Reets are and how hard it is to get to them if I bring along my bro's 65 SK too.<br />
<br />
SK is pretty pimp ~1450AC &amp; ~5000hp with sham buffs on.  If I need to I'll also bring my 65 wiz.  Just like doing stuff with 2 instead of 3 or 4 since the other computers are my wife's and not as easy to reach except for the occasional nuke.<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">look at this map of the lower level of sebilis:<br />
http://eqatlas.com/kunark/sebilis2map.html<br />
<br />
the reet room is the one straight through if you were going from point 3 (go the right when viewing the map).   from the top of the map, find about -500 and draw a line straight down, and on the right side find about -1500 and draw a line straight across to the left.  that's the reet room...only two or three in there.  they're about as tough as juggernauts, which you will have to kill a few to advance to the room, and some are casters that nuke pretty darn hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>M. B'fang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">To make this a might bit easier, you can invis past most myconid mobs you'll encounter enroute from the illis jail to the jugg/reet area.  IIRC, only myconid adepts saw through invis, shaving much off your travel time.  <br />
<br />
In my experience only the wandering juggs see invis, however it may be completely random.  The first two juggs you encounter (static spawns, guarding the archway) you should try invising past.  Careful if the roamer is in the area behind them, it will see through and aggro the other two.  <br />
<br />
This leads you to the area marked &quot;3&quot; on the map provided by Mojo.  Inside are a total of six juggernauts - four static and two roaming, along with a total of four reets (two in each alcove).  Of the roaming juggs, one moves between alcoves (left to right), while the other wanders out toward where you enter.  Best bet is to ambush the latter jugg as it wanders outside room &quot;3&quot;.  Invis up and head into &quot;3&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Directly across from where you entered &quot;3&quot;, you will notice a wall.  This is a false wall, and beyond it paths several juggs that see invis.  What you want to do is position yourself in &quot;3&quot; in such a way that when you toy with camera angles you can see just beyond the false wall.  When no juggs are present behind it, and the remaining roaming jugg in &quot;3&quot; has pathed into one of the two alcoves, run yourself through the false wall into the either left or right corridor.  Remain there and kill the wandering juggs from that area (will be approx 3-4).  <br />
<br />
Once the juggs are downed, you're free to break the reet spawns which are housed in the three alcoves beyond the area marked with a &quot;3&quot;.  Please note: when running past the false wall from &quot;3&quot; bewteen reet spawn locations, hug the bend (you'll see when you get there) otherwise, you'll have the two static juggs guarding the false wall in &quot;3&quot; aggro.  <br />
<br />
Froglok reets are comprised of three classes: warrior, shaman, and wizard.  The shaman and wizard reets will gate when low on health and start summoning.  Just be prepared.  <br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just past the Juggs, on your way to Trakanons lair.  I expect that a 65 shaman/65 sk duo could handle them no problem.  Drops are streaky.  One night we went after them we got one drop.. the next time we got all we needed off of back to back to back kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brodda Thep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The biggest problem you will have is getting through the jugg room.  The one with 4 statics and two wanderers.  All juggs have a chance to spawn and see invis.  If you get lucky all those jugs won't see invis and you will be able to get past.  Otherwise you are going to have problems.  Though with the SK snare/FD splitting it shouldn't be a problem.  Just have to make sure you have enough dps to clear all the juggs that see invis before respawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You should be able to handle 3 juggs at a time imo.  Well, if you weren't boxing that is.  Depends on your 2boxing skills I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I admit I dont have as much experience running both the sham and SK as my bro has running them both.  Since when I run my sham I typically run my Rogue as main but he's better at running *MY* sham and his SK as main.<br />
<br />
So I ran in with the SK, Sham, Wiz.... I got chased out on the first friggin 4  froggies when you swim down and pop up by the cells.  I was going to pull one or two and pull them back to the wiz/sham.  But I suck so I got run out... w/o a doubt if I had 3 people running these 3 classes we'd have owned our way all the way in.  <br />
<br />
Already have a bud's 63 SK lined up for tomorrow.  Thanks for the info and I'll see how well I do tomorrow. (GAH guess it's today already)</div></div><hr />
