I fell out of my chair when I was told that, and very nearly missed slowing a mob. *shakes head*</div></div><hr />

it was a zerg rez fest for melee.  Some took upwards of 27 deaths.  If the GMs were gonna despawn should have done it at 50% when it was obvious who would win.  and saved many people a lot of xp loss.  4% xp at 27 deaths (or pallys and necros were even rezing, so add 7% and 10% for some deaths, and 500pp each Necro death) if you wanna think about what that meant.  Totally willing to do it with no chance of seeing any cool loot, just to be the first people to do it.  But no.  were just hoping the GMs will respawn the warders if they are gonna be meany-heads about letting us kill the sleeper.<br />

I have never heard of the &quot;sleeper&quot; before this thread.  It sounds really cool though.  What/where is it located?  I guess I should start reading more about the storyline for the game.  :rolleyes:  /agree with the fact that GM's should have de-spawned him earlier than 24-25% though.  A 3.5 hour fight would mean that there would have been around an hour and a half of standing around gawking instead of the numerous deaths with preciuos XP loss.  Hindsight though, if I ever have the chance to fight it, 30 deaths or not, I will be there I am sure!  :D  It definately sounds like a good piece of EQ history to be a part of.  Another gimpy question though.  Has he/she/it ever been defeated before?  I wouldn't mind taking a run past it to get a look at it, then gate out.  :p  Just another reason I can't wait to get behind my EQ wheel when I return from the coolest place in the world called Iraq.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sleeper is THE toughest mob in the game. <br />
<br />
The story goes a very long time ago two dragons of different colours (NOT Vox and Naggy) mated (which is extrememly illegal in the dragon world) and made a super dragon, Kerafrym. The story goes it took all the dragons of norrath to put him to sleep and many died but eventually it was done, in sleepers tomb (located in WW, requires a key). All the servers had 4 warders that guarded him, once all are killed sleeper will spawn (a one time even on all servers, except AB, where it happened twice due to GMs pissing about). Once awakened a script goes off when dragons in skyfire/skyshrine starting saying some text like 'he has be released, run for your lives!' and the whole zone despawns.<br />
<br />
No one ever managed to get him below 98% HP before wiping unless using the bug or in this case time equipped 150 people.<br />
<br />
It's believed he is part of the story in EQ2 when Luclin and all the gods are destroyed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">how to be refined and discuse something of this nature.....<br />
least i can say is, it is rubbish to make a game and then take away the fun (which is what happened to many many many people, not just the people actually there.)  a bug or a gm despawning, the result is the same.  they ruined a lot of fun for many many people.<br />
<br />
when people do things that require a large amout of time and effort, plus includes NO fun, that is commonly refured to as work.  We payed sony to do work.  i am boggled by this.<br />
<br />
this is upseting to say the least.  thousands of people are mad at Sony over this event.  i am one of them.  I as well as many of my friends are deciding to quit or not due to a build up of events peaking with this this.<br />
<br />
btw my 65 shaman has over 175 days played + being ep able...my brother's 65 druid is at least 180+ days played and EP able.  we have a 3rd account with multiple toons with many many days played.  we have been playing eq since 2k.  loyalty to a corperation who makes games can only go so far.  if they games are no longer fun why play...<br />
<br />
what happened on RZ is rediculous.<br />
<br />
ps spelling errors are due to the hour at which this post was typed, sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">as ceno mentioned in another thread ...... sleeper isnt ment to be killled  you will screw up the story line for eq2 and so on <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
told ya he would despawn  in some sort of way</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">even before we saw time loot and 10k tanks we knew the sleeper had a chance to die with over 150 people zerg....it has been talked about.<br />
<br />
The only reason i thought it was an impossablitiy was because of greedyness...<br />
<br />
sony has people we, in essance, pay to work on the game.  they should have forseen this event and, even thought it in all likely hood it wouldn't occure anyway, take steps to prevent even the possability of a raid like this coming about.<br />
<br />
this event proves the lack of customer service/support shown from sony. it happens time and time again.  They have made a broken game, and obviously don't want to fix it.  (anyone that you know who has gotten baned/warned for a &quot;sploit&quot; proves this point..the lack of compeation of the shawl quests...much of luclin is still broken without fix...aren't the sol ro minis STILL broken...my god, look at what they did to the corinav encounter to help prevent more people from entering Time...)  i don't mean to rant, just provide my opinion for others to contemplate.<br />
<br />
btw i also figured some kind of depawn would occure, but i hoped i was just thinking poorly of sony =(<br />
<br />
time for me to zone to my bed and catch some zzzz...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yes, the Sleeper poofed on us then, zone re popped, and we had the Master of the gaurd back up. Had nothing happened, we would have killed it, and we were ready for any other spawns as far as the warders go. In the first picture, you can see how somehow I managed to get control of Slithur's pet, weird. Anyhow, I will try to find a log of the fight and put that up somewhere.<br />
<br />
Edit: By the way, thanks everyone who smapped the petitions to the GM's for ruining the event. I don't know how many they got, but from what I understand, the play by play Slithur and I were giving in the crucible channel was the same with all the other classes in our guild, and the channels all pitched in and petitioned. Thanks again for the nice words and all cheers while we faught this guy.</div></div><hr />

Sleeper's Tomb is not in WW, it's actually in Eastern Wastes (err, I think that's the name of the zone ... whatever that mid lvl zone is off of GD).<br />

Should swing by and see it even if you don't have a key, the dragon statue is pretty cool.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Sajem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">ok...i dunno much about the Lore part of EQ, except that i'v eheard Veeshan isn't really a dragon and made dragons in her form (sumtin else about her), the 2 Dragons that made Sleeper were Vox and Naggy, which is why they're stuck in Permafrost and Naggy's Lair and Keryaferm (sp?) is multi-colored. I've also heard that when she wakes up, if no1 messes with he, she kills everything in the zone, then depops and goes to Skyfire (?) and kills Veeshan or another Dragon boss. does anyone have a link to the Lore material of EQ ? need to do some reading  :D<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;edit&gt;&gt;what happens when she's woken up? does she go back to sleep or stay awake forever? and does anyone know if she's been woken on Cazic-Thule? i'd REALLY like to get a screenshot ofme standing next to the most powerful creature in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know if it's been awakened there or not, but I do have answers for your other questions:<br />
<br />
1) Once it's woken, it is gone forever. The 4 warders stop spawning (which means a lot less primal weapons or whatever it's called now).<br />
2) You need a sleeper's key to get in there - and you would have to get in that deep which requires more force than just yourself, or so I would presume (I'm keyed but haven't ever raided there). To get a key, you need to kill a 1st brood dragon (Sontalak, Zlandicar, Klandicar, Leandinaria (sp?) the Keeper, and I think a couple of other wtov dragons that I'm not thinking of - or one of the mobs in the Statue cycle has a chance of it (or all of them?) as well as Vindi and Tormax having chances of dropping them, though I'm told it's slim.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Aekhold</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">People who fought him really thought they would get phat lewt from him ?<br />
He has been made to be invincible, you really think Sony would have itemized him ? :P<br />
I just think GM's made fun of players by waiting so much, but you obviously can't make anything that would break the story line...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Lanadary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I'm pretty sure its Vox and Nagafen.  The two dragons that created Kerafym were Red (Naggy) and White (Vox).  They were exiled (Permafrost and Sol B anyone).  The dragons actually fell in love or something (Vox and Naggy do indeed like each other).  When the sleeper is actually awoken Vox and Nagafen will broadcast in their zones like their child is free or something like that they are the only dragons that are happy when he wakes up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i did some research on The Sleeper, and discovered that my server has yet to awaken him. (read text from someone that he/she copied i'm guessing from a log that an NPC refers to Keryaferm as &quot;he&quot;. the link is below) i wanna pic!!!<br />
<br />
2) You need a sleeper's key to get in there - and you would have to get in that deep which requires more force than just yourself, or so I would presume...<br />
<br />
i kno that much  :p . Illia's has him as lvl 75, and i've heard alot of stuff about the Sleeper. i have my own theories as to whether or not all this is rumors or just a pile of bs.<br />
<br />
here's a link to the web site: Kerafyrm, The Sleeper (http://www.albrandes.com/skden/articles/sleeper.asp)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Neyl Dew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Was not Vox and Naggy.<br />
<br />
A red and white dragon mated and Kerafyrm was the spawm. I dont recall if this is WHY Its Forbidden for Diff colored dragons to mate. Or it was already forbidden.<br />
<br />
Subduing Kerafyrm was difficult, I dont recall if the Dragons themselves managed it, or if it required Veeshan herself to do it. But Kerafyrm has reason to hate Veeshan for that. He is supposed to be the destroyer of creation, and Supposedly the only match for Veeshan herself. Ultimatly he wants to track down and kill Veeshan.<br />
<br />
Vox and Naggy wanted the destruction of the dragons and or Veeshan so they attempted to mate to create a second Kerafyrm. They where stopped and punished. That is why they are imprisoned and cursed now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Sajem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">possible it was Gorenaire? she's in Kunark, and Veeshan is Velious, so that would partially explain why Kerafyrm hates Veeshan (tho if he hates her because she enprisoned(sp?) him, this theory is partly down the drain). they're on different factions/continents. but if i'm rite, then who's the male red Dragon?<br />
<br />
**edit**can't spell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Neyl Dew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">To my knowledge the parents of Kerafyrm where either never named or Killed at some point. I dont recall ever seeing their names in the lore I have read.<br />
I am not sure that the reason Kerafyrm hates Veeshan is that she impriosoned him. Perhaps he just has an Inferiority complex. My understanding is that she is the &quot;Creator&quot; and that he is the &quot;Destroyer&quot; in the EQ mythos (which is weird because she didnt create anything, the nameless was supposed too have, all she did was deposite her brood on Norrath, slash it with her claws to mark it her territory, then Leave)<br />
<br />
And Boo GM's.<br />
To the players who did this, you might not have had the chance to kill him, but grats, if you where allowed he WOULD have died.<br />
<br />
Also, to my knowledge he has been awakend on Cazic-Thule</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I just wrote an angry email to SOE, and I hope other people will too.  If SOE receives enough negative feedback from the player community, they will have no choice but to re-enable the Sleeper on RZ.  As I see it, this matter affects players on every server, as SOE has violated the basic trust between themselves and the players.  Now everytime a group tries to take on a new raid mob, there will always be the fear that said mob will be despawned by vengeful GMs.  So please, /petition, /feedback, email, or do whatever else, but let SOE know that it is not ok to break the very rules they created.</div></div><hr />

Not sure if &quot;****ed up&quot; is strong enough for this. Reimbursement for what? Being stupid and trying to zerg **** that isn't meant to be killed?<br />

<br />
<br />
Course not they cant be killed. The Sleeper can. <br />
<br />
If the sleeper where invulnerable there wouldnt be any question, but the sleeper isnt invulnerable, therefore it is a killable mob. <br />
<br />
The GM Stole their kill, and the glory of being the First and perhaps Only to do this. The GM Screwd up, so they are fixxing it in normal their fashon, pretend it didnt happen.<br />
<br />
They where reimbursed because the GM removed the reason for their accepting those deaths. No doubt the AA's where to just shut people up.<br />
<br />
I can see how the killing of The Sleeper will screw up their story line. <br />
But I have to say, So what!?<br />
The story has more holes in it than worth mentioning. How many times have the gods been killed, and are still there when you come back to kill them again. You would think orcs would know by now not to follow those pesky Woodelves back to the lift guards. How many One of a Kind Epic Weapons are there in the game?<br />
<br />
I have to say, Good job guys, they finaly listend to public outcry on something. I have seen Verant and now SOE screw players more times then not, especialy as we are paying them to do it. I'm glad they will get a second chance.<br />
Unfortunatly next time they try it will likely be a GM Controled mob, that will just kill the clerics first, or that has been beefed up or made to be invulnerable in truth.</div></div><hr />

Second, if you plan on trying to kill it again, dont be suprised if somethign else happens to *stop* it from happening.  The Sleeper is not suppossed to be killed (whether its EQ2 storyline, regen, or just left over Aradune pride, it dont matter).   The GM's have showed on many occasions that the mob is not to be slain (or someone above them has, they just enforce it).<br />
<br />
And lastly, <br />
The story has more holes in it than worth mentioning. How many times have the gods been killed, and are still there when you come back to kill them again. You would think orcs would know by now not to follow those pesky Woodelves back to the lift guards. How many One of a Kind Epic Weapons are there in the game?<br />
<br />
The *Gods* have never been killed, only thier Avatars. <br />
The orcs following players back to guards is mob AI, has nothing to do with storyline.<br />
There has never been epic weapons.  It's been stated at many a Fan Faire that *Epic* weapons (Spear of Fate, Swiftwind, etc), are NOT epic weapons, but referred to as kunark era weapons.<br />
<br />
Anyways, grats on an awesome attempt RZ ... tips my hat.</div></div><hr />

I believe the Reimbursment was because it was a mistake.  Every other time that the sleeper was nearly killed was due to bugs in the game.  That was not the case this time.  He was being killed legitimatly.  That was what the outcry was about.  It wasn't a hush hush secret operation in which no one wanted the GMs to know they were exploiting a bug either with a bridge or with negative regen or whatnot.  This was public multiple servers in support.  A Three guild colaberative effort in good will on a PvP server.  And he would have died.  And he probably wasn't going to drop any loot.  But that doesn't matter.  PvP servers get a lot of bad rap we don't deserve.  sure some of the worst people come to play on our server, and we have to deal with them, but also some of the best.  And especially on Rallos Zek, if you haven't been on the server for years it probably doesn't make much sense to you.  But all you guys have your firsts, and your shining moments, and we sit by being the laughing stock, the butt of jokes.  and apart from the best of the best tournaments a few years back, this has been our moment to shine.  The Sleeper will be killed. And it will be killed by the great guys of Ascending Dawn, Magicus Imperialis Magicus, and Wudan.  And thistime I don't think GMs will get involved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Grats to the guys on RZ for trying this.  I think it's amazing and I do hope something drops for you, but the bragging rights alone would be unbelieveable.  That this was done on a PvP server is even more amazing.  Hats off to you guys and good luck.<br />

I'm glad the reinbursement took place, but despawning the sleeper was a pathetic move.  I'm sure Vox and Naggy will be around in EQ2 and they've been killed more often than I have.  Of course, I won't be around in EQ2, but thats another story.  Lame GM move, decent recovery by SoE, I look forward to seeing what happens next.  My guess is that the sleeper isn't even itemised or drops cloth armour ;)</div></div><hr />

Some guild has apparently killed The Sleeper.<br />
<br />
The date on that message board says February 2003.<br />
<br />
Edit: Nm, its probably when that user was registered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">From my understanding, there is a Korean/Chinese group of EQ servers that have licensed EQ from SOE.  That game does not have the expansions past Velious, and there are many changes from the EQ we get.  The Sleeper on those servers is toned down quite a bit and respawns every few days.</div></div><hr />
