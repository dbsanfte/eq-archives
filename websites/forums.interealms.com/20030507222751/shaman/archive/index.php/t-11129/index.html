<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have started to 2box a ranger. This is mainly to see xp fly once again :)<br />
<br />
What is the best method to do this? Should I fight red cons, or blue cons? If I do blue cons, I would need a steady supply. Any sugestions for places to do this (lvl 20 atm).<br />

PCaverns, follow path, killing p...the monster mob thingies<br />
good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Doing this with a monk atm. <br />
<br />
Palaudal Caverns until i was 23 pulling right along the outcast beetle tunnel to the big shroom (rhebyscian??) and back again from 17 - 23 (took only 2hrs), started red and left when some started to con light blue.<br />
<br />
Next stop DSP pulling shrooms from the fungal temple. These are red at 23 and turn yellow at 24 so then i started pulling red velniaks as well as shrooms.<br />
<br />
I only stayed and pulled db mobs in pally because the XP modifier is soo good.<br />
<br />
So to answer your question, pull reds and yellows :D<br />
<br />
This was/is being all done with a lvl46 SHM, buff monk with Tuna, Stamina, Agility, Rising Dex, Guardian, Chloro, Alacrity and then pull mobs with Togors....<br />
<br />
With slow my monk was literally beating them all day with a 2hb 8/20 weapon to drive up my 2hb skill and chloro could keep up with the damage..gotta love that slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've done a bit of pl'ing at the zone in to ct, pl'ing a de sk. Due to lag i avoid the moon. I pulled with slow, buffed with hp buff, stamina, chloro and haste. At 49% i sicked dog dog on the mob to speed things up even more. Seemed to fly through the uper 20's, getting maybe a level an hour or so up til 31. I think I started pl'ing here at 23 with my druid and it took twice as long since i wasn't actually helping to kill the mobs once they hit 49% health. Started with shammy at 27 and flew through levels from there. Thinking of heading to Iceclad to camp stormfeather next and pl some there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Try not to slow mobs when PLing a melee.  It makes their defense fall WAAAY behind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Step 1) Find a druid friend and get his login<br />
Step 2) Cast a damage shield<br />
Step 3) Hit the mob for at least 1 damage with the lowbie<br />
Step 4) Root stuff as if runs so that it continues to hit the damage shield</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I pl'ed my sk from around level 15, and also did cb belts most of the way to 15, and his defense skills are still maxed. Probably has to do with pl'ing in uguk with my druid, basically ds and train him while he hit each mob at least once then beat down the casters. Of course dark elves have decent secondary stats which help raise skills even though thier strength and stamina suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kolte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yep, I'm using my 53 mage to PL my Shammy .. got to 24 in about 4 days or so .. casting DS and train em..  AE DOT could hit them all at once :)   Am doing needlites but stopped for a coupel days cuz i was about to fall asleep in there waiting for the spawns .. anywhere else to go where the spawns are faster?   Wonder if I should just get some cleric buffs and head to Netherbain Lair .. am Iksar so SK is almost out I think.</div></div><hr />
