<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A while back when I was level 10, I was having a hard time even locating where a mission I was supposed to go to in Perez park was. I asked for help and a healer hooked me up... So we cruise around in the forest a bit trying to get to this mission enterence.... and we find that there are 2 seperate groups of very lareg congregations of mobs guarding the enterence to this mission all are level 15. The groups were clockworks, and lost. So as we try to run past we get decimated by the mobs massively, now I would have just called for some high level help... BUT the healer guy that was helping out says... hey no we can do this... so while I am running back and getting lost trying to find the enterence again, he attempts another run in, and dies again. So I am like...&quot;Hey man just forget it, I will just get it next level or something.&quot; he is (Foaming at the mouth) and tells me &quot;NO I AM GETTING TO THAT GOD DAMN DOOR!&quot; then proceeds to die like 3 more times in attempts. Runs 2 zones away to his contacts dumps all his inspirations and buys like 10 luck. Comes back and starts em all up so they are like half way across the screen with little shields, and makes the run then Teleport friends me in. It was hilarious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tikcuf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Was it a door close to the lake?  If so I have had that...   Had to ask a group of higher level mobs killing Hydra's if they would mind clear out the clockworks...  After they was done was able to waltz right in but it cost me a death the first time...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That's a great story.  ;)<br />
<br />
If we get any Perez door missions anymore, we just wait until we're 10th level or so, so there are no more purple cons.  *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jenavyra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I haven't had anything like that, exactly, though I have gotten more than a little lost in the woods trying to find a door mission with my husband.  He was 13 at the time, I believe, so I was SKed up to 12 (tanker), and most of the stuff in the area was Green / Grey con.  I can see how someone of the right level to fight there would have trouble though; we must have killed 30 groups of 8-12 Circle of Thorns baddies while running around in a circle trying to find the bloody door (happened to be down a path we missed because a group of Thornies just passed it started picking a fight with us.. &gt;.&lt;).  Perez Park is fun, but only when you're high enough level that the huge groups don't wipe the floor with you.. ;)  Maybe with a full group or something, but not just 2.<br />
<br />
Anyway, as for stubborn: I have had cases in other games of just determining that I WAS going to beat that monster, ##@$&amp;@&amp;*$, and God help anyone standing in my way, regardless of how many deaths or how much time I took to do it.  This happened a lot in Diablo II, I'm embarrased to admit.  It's just principle sometimes..and sometimes it's more of a rush when you finally DO it than you'd think. *grin*  Now, whether it was worth it in that instance or not, I dunno.. but I can understand it. <br />
