<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok--i'm at that point where i feel like it's time to go work on GoD spells (65th with 73 aa and climbing), and my friend is 65 SK (9 aa so far)...so here's what i was wondering.<br />
<br />
first--is it possible to enter the Sewers solo or duo? can you instance them without a larger group?<br />
<br />
second--would it be possible for a 6100 hp, 1300 AC SK w/o defensive aa's to tank mobs in any of the sewer runs with me healing? (so far only healing adept 1, but my Q is six ticks, and i have Scaled Avatar's Sleeves/Improved Healing IV)<br />
<br />
of course, since the main point would be getting the spells, are the mobs that drop spells here duoable by this combination?<br />
<br />
any help would be appreciated. i'm trying to come up with any way possible to aquire them without having to resort to depending on too many other players. any other GoD areas we could duo would also be welcome topics of replies.<br />
<br />
thank you very much.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
add--Breath of Trushar--any comments on that one? do those of you that have it use it more than Q, or vice versa?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I can answer your first question,  yes you can instance the sewers solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">IMO that duo would have a very difficult time against any &quot;named&quot; mob in any of the Sewers. <br />
<br />
The Sewers vary in difficulty quite a bit--IIRC, Purifying Plant is the hardest, while Crematory is easiest?? (Purifying Plant has golems that are non-slowable, so you won't ever even get close to where any named might spawn). That duo might be able to handle the yard trash in Crematory (since you have to kill 20 mobs before any named spawn) but after that, since you have no tracker in your duo, you are going to have to just crawl from end to end of the dungeon to see if any named are up, and getting a pull of 2 or more mobs will destroy you. Yard trash hits at max of anywhere from 400-600, and they tend to have large aggro ranges.<br />
<br />
I'd really suggest recruiting a full group to do the crawling. Some of the gear that drops is nice enough for any pre-Elemental PC to use, plus spells drop and BiC pieces drop. I'd also strongly urge you to make sure you have a tracker with you--spawn the instance, kill 20 mobs near ZI, then track to see if any named popped. If not, kill the instance and start over. It will save you a TON of time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">it *might* be possible for you to keep the SK up, but i would really doubt it.  <br />
<br />
But yes, you can get an instance of the sewers with just 1/2 people, add/subtract more people when ever you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have been soloing in there to get drops for BiC quest so yes its possible to get a single or duo adventure.   The trash there hits for 1k's so not sure if you could handle it tho,  I have some fairly nice gear and even full buffed I have to be careful on the trash.<br />
<br />
Add a cleric to your group and you could do it easy tho.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Question:<br />
<br />
How do you get an exp group for the sewers?  I 2 box a 4500hp 1300ac SK with CS2, CA3, LR5 - I can add a cleric or an enchanter (63 and 62 going to 65) or both on a good day, so presumably I'd be ok there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Go talk to the elf dude at the corner of the building just as you enter the open area,  Gamesh I think his name is.  Just hail him and ask for one of the sewers.</div></div><hr />

I was referring specifically to Crematory there, although even at that, my recollection could have been low. Certainly by the time you are doing Purifying Plant, the yard trash is hitting for 1k at times (although they do seem to have retuned all of the sewers so the per-hit average is lower than it was when GoD came out). I know the golems certainly it for over 1k, and some of the ghosts do as well. Do you recall which sewer you were in with the fly and the gnat?<br />
<br />
BTW, another little twist: in at least 2 of the Sewer instances, yard trash summon. I don't remember which two, and it could actually be all of them, its just been a while since I was last in them all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think gnats and stonemites aren't rootable, but you can get into the sewers solo and just solo 20 mobs.  I've done that for the Bic quest parts, and then used bind vision to hop through the dungeon and scout for nameds.  If you see one, call for help from friends etc.  That way you aren't tying up a group for your spells, but you are still working on them.<br />

<br />
i appreciate it, thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Do you recall which sewer you were in with the fly and the gnat?<br />
<br />
I was in Purifying Plant.  And the fly model mobs are not rootable, you have to tank them.  So I don't recommend it for everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I duoed or trioed if a few of them.  Tank was usually a Time Geared Ranger, Time Geared Rogue, and myself.  Sometimes we would make a 6-man group, but that was only for the 1st trial to kill the named.  Most named were quite easy and they died fast ( Ranger can box an Enchanter if he feels like it :P )  I usually the only one healing unless our cleric friend is with us.    But, again, we try to stay away from the first trial unless we have a decent group.<br />
<br />
I tried soloing a few of them, but mobs are iffy if they can be rooted.  Going toe-to-toe could mean death if you pull adds.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
If you can, your best bet is to get KT flagged, and kill named there.  This would net your spells faster, and you would get decent xp for your trouble.  I have been slacking in my spells, and I still need to get BoT.  BiC quest is the DEVIL!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">&quot;Kill 20 mobs and check for named&quot;<br />
<br />
I understand that Named will not spawn until after 20 mobs are dead, BUT<br />
<br />
a) Do they only spawn in the places that you have already killed (ie as part of normal respawn)?<br />
b) Do they 'pop' in a previously unoccupied spawn point?<br />
c) Does a trash mob despawn and a named one appears in it's place?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well, I'm honestly not sure which, Snap.  I think it may be a combination of all of the above.  After 20 are dead, a named can spawn in various places in the dungeon.  Some spots are wanderers, some are statics.  I honestly don't know if it's an empty spot until 20 die then named/ph spawns, or if it starts with ph's up and then it's a chance of despawn/respawn as a named.<br />
<br />
After 20 are dead, if you know the PHs, you can kill and hope for respawn if one isn't up, of course.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ive seen and killed PHs before the 20 minute or 20 kill limit and had a named spawn in that spot on repops.  I've also seen spots where there should have been a mob where a regular mob spawned after that time (could have also been a ph).</div></div><hr />
