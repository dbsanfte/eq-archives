<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Weski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'd like any advice on how to upgrade my gear.  I'm an Iksar Shaman who primarily solos.  I'm not guilded, and I don't have alot of cash.  Here's my profile.<br />
<br />
My stuff (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=322753)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You are in the same boat I am (except I ONLY solo). Iksar shaman here and unguilded (by choice). <br />
<br />
The only glaring hole in your profile I see is the left bracer. You can cast root faster with that thing, but it's not worth it. You've got great AC and HP considering your level.<br />
<br />
Check my profile in my sig for some ideas. If I were you, I'd get to Dalnir and you should have no problem getting a Gooey Adhesive and a Coercion Implant so you can quest yourself a Scaled Mystic Bracer. You should be able to find a Seb Scale Cap for a couple hundred PP in the bazaar and that's a slight upgrade to a Scaled Mystic Helm. <br />
<br />
Considering you have a couple low AC items because of their Focus effects, I would think that you should be able to hit 900 ac easily with a few upgrades, which is more than I have at 55 when I use my 2hb! The boots (and the CBB) won't be any good to you once you get your 49 spells, so you may want to keep a lookout for replacements when you're in the bazaar. A second Scaled Mystic bracer would be an easy upgrade at 49.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Weski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the advice, I had read most of the gear posts here, just seeing if I missed anything.  That bracer would actually be empty if  I hadn't walked through guk one day.  I was pleasently suprised to find it worked with root.  I had bought a Barbed Rubicite bracer the first week of the bazaar and was angered when I noticed the reccomended level.  At least I sold it for a profit.  Thanks again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nubok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">How come his AC is way past 800? My own is much lower, even though I have equipment with high AC. My defence skill as around 190, but still I have to buff myself to get past 800.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eepjr24</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Maybe it is purely defense skill? Take this with a grain of salt, I am no uber shaman, only level 41. However, I started at level 38 with a 180 defense. It took me all of level 38, 39, 40, and most of 41 to get those 20 points. I started very early watching my AC as I increased it, each point got me 3-4 AC, without a pattern that I could discerne. So 10 points would probably equal around 35 ac at level 41. Your best guess as to how that is affected by levels, any one with more knowledge out there who can help?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nubok - something is definitly screwy with your AC.<br />
<br />
I am also an Ogre Shaman, lvl 51 and my AC is hovering at almost 900 unbuffed.  Defense is maxed at 200.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gronk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">weird... Magelo does that to my profile... my unbuffed ac is 1043 at the moment (just dropped some ac for hps) before that it was 1070 but Magelo always displays my ac in the mid 900's.<br />
As to why the iksar's ac is so high... Iksarac bonus ? /boggle<br />
<br />
and as to the level question to my knowledge shaman ac is not in any way affected by level, aside from the obvious skill caps at levels 1-39. The only factors seem to be armor, Agi, and buffs. maybe the 10 points will help ya catch up a bit but iksars always have more ac than comparibly geared ogres, trolls, barbies etc...</div></div><hr />
