<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys. its been awhile since I posted or played much. Ive been playing EQ on and off for the past few weeks again and finally got canni 5.<br />
<br />
well now that I have canni 5 I want to play again /shakes fist at sony =P I have access to a 65 Ench with DC and a pretty full spell book. I was wondering where would be a good place to 2 box them for AA or normal XP.<br />
<br />
since I havn't got a single responce  Ill add a bit more info. I have malo/torpor/pox and play during the off hours.</div></div><hr />
