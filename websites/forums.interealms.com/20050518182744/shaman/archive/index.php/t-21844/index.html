The summit wasn't about shaman or any other single class.  It was about the game in general, and why uber guilds like FoH have left.  <br />
<br />
They are NOT going to focus on class issues until they address the global GAME issues and try to get folks to come back.<br />
<br />
Doing strikes or protests is NOT going to work.  They don't have the resources to address our issues at the moment.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm going to wait and see what the new tweaks to GoD and the global game do to our class before making demands.<br />
<br />
It's a game folks, try and remember that...its a giant chat room with a game wrapped around it.  Relax, enjoy your time on line with your friends and go keel sheet.  If they restore shaman to our former place of glory and power, so be it.  If they don't, well, then you can decide.  But they WON'T do anything in the near future.  They have too much on their plate atm.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I said something similar to that a while ago too, and was promptly told this:<br />
<br />
The sham. community has been begging for some changes for a while with well thought out posts, chats with devs and petitions.  There has been a prob since before GoD which came along and messed it up even more in the first place.  (para phrased cause it was a bunch of posts)<br />
<br />
This summit was a small light (no matter how dim) at the end of the tunnle for some of our issuses to be addressed.  They were brought up, then smacked down.  That is why people are upset.  Its not just that SoE has a lot on their plate atm, its that they blatently refuse to 'fix' us shamen because we had power at one point in time in one type of fight (long duration fights).<br />
<br />
I dont think that people are upset because the summit wasn't about classes or shamen specificaly, but that our suggestions were shot down so fast there.</div></div><hr />

Yep all i can repeat here is the famous quote from Fan Faire.<br />
<br />
Dev &quot;EQ is no longer about long fights nobody likes long fights&quot;<br />
Attendee &quot;So does that mean Shaman will be made more useful in short fights ? &quot;<br />
Dev &quot;No because Shaman are to powerful in long fights&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Not the exact wording but if that sums up SoE's attitude to Shaman are you suprised Shaman have this attitude to SoE ?.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Monjay-Tunare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This should answer your question:<br />
<br />
<br />
Hey guys,<br />
<br />
Exciting news. I've been invited to attend a small gathering of guild leaders and class community leaders in San Diego the weekend of June 4th. <br />
<br />
This is a GREAT opportunity for me to bring shaman concerns/issues/questions directly to the people who can make a difference.<br />
<br />
I want to take the next week and a half to poll this community, to gather our top issues with the current game and proposed expansions. Until Friday, I would like you to just brainstorm on this thread. I'll print that thread and take it with me so the developers can see a broad spectrum of shaman issues and concerns. <br />
<br />
I know that we are all very passionate about the game and shaman, but I'd like to ask everyone to view this as a chance to do something positive. If you want to vent, please start a separate thread, try to keep these threads as useful as possible.<br />
<br />
Starting on Saturday, I'll attempt to narrow down our concerns to the top 10. We can hone and refine our top 10 until next Thursday, June 3rd. Big thinkers, number crunchers - our issues need to be succinct, try to think of the best ways to make complex issues easy to understand.<br />
<br />
I know we had a lot of great ideas in the Voice proposal and some of them came true (improved blast heal, improved heal over time, improved balance of the Nihli). You worked hard, we made progress, let's do it again. <br />
<br />
You guys know I love the Crucible and our class and I am really grateful to have this opportunity!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It was sold to us as a great chance to make a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah ok,  lets wait and see just how incredibly broken we can get until they decide that we are not worth fixing again.   It worked last time right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nothing I've commented was inteded as a personal attack on you, fwiw. The invitation letter you recieved from SOE obviously led you to believe the summit would be more like what you wrote in the above quote. Likewise, the quote above led us to believe the same. <br />
<br />
The dissatisfaction comes as no surprise.<br />

Only quoted it above to answer the clueless thread-starter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, someone needs to sit back and relax.  He asked a question, and gave some good advise about it being a game (giant chat room).  I seriously doubt he's &quot;clueless&quot;, rational maybe, but not clueless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I thought the recent changes to our GoD slow + heal was good.  Im not too sure why everyone is still so angry.  Did we all forget we just got upgrades?  <br />
Generally speaking, I think our class is as balanced as it was in PoP (no need to flame me on that, I've heard it before).  No, we arent as powerful as we once were back in the Kunark days, but I dont see that ever happening again anyways.  What I would like to see now mostly are changes that affects the game as a whole, like the stupid GoD spell drops.  That quest they posted for the trade-in is a good start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think at the end of the day. Shaman are tired of the run around. <br />
<br />
Being told go play in traffic gets old. Especially as an Adult. And you know what. we can't hold our breath to get our way. <br />
<br />
Cancle your account. You can still play till the Renewal comes up. Then it is simply a matter of putting in your Card number and reupping if you feel like it.<br />
<br />
But cancel the account and feedback with E mail. Why you are cancling.<br />
<br />
It probably won't do a damn thing. But if enough cancled With Feedback and E mails saying why Something will happen. And it won't be good for The people standing there saying Stat buffs have meaningful effects on combat. And that 10 seconds worth of slow on a monster makes us Useful members of 6 person groups. <br />
<br />
Cancle your account with feedback as to why. and hit thier wallet for a change.<br />

Well, to be honest with you... the new slow makes little difference when you can't get a group to even use it, and you can't get a group to use it because that so called upgraded heal doesn't do squat, except make you feel like you are spitting into the wind.</div></div><hr />

We did not even get a tenth of what we slowly lost over the last six expansions, nor did we get anything to make up for faster encounters and slow mitigation.<br />
<br />
That is why so many of us are angry - we got less then we needed and now we are expected to be happy about it.<br />
<br />

We are not. Not even close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>smaaltz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Class imbalance is a huge problem for this eroding game.  When certain classes are so underpowered that guilds don't recruit them if they already have 2, it's a problem.  When certain classes can be LFG in Kodtaz/Ikkinz any other high-end content for 12 straight hours while a chanter can get a group in 15 minutes, it's a problem. <br />
<br />
Of course they won't realize it's a problem until it starts impacting the bottom-line, and at that point they won't be getting any of us back.  This summit looked to me to be a very good indicator that they realized their last expansion really, really sucked and their playerbase while loyal was really, really unhappy.  Class imbalance seemed like a logical topic, especially for the gimp SKs, Pallies, shammies and zerkers.   Those 4 classes are really very underpowered in the high-end game.  Even after the &quot;retuning&quot; of GoD events..  sure you made the mobs hit for a little less BUT warriors still tank better than knights, so why invite a knight?    This Ikkinz group is much better off with a second cleric or druid rather than a shammy, why invite a shammy?   <br />
<br />
I guess I'm rambling, but I'm extremely dissapointed to learn they didn't touch on shammy imbalance in a meaningful way during the entire weekend.  We all assumed they would, because we all assumed they were intelligent enough to see their playbase leaving.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Quiinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Im not upset that the Summit didnt do much to address class balance in regards to shaman.  But I'm appalled to think that 95% of the summit was based on the Raiding portion of the game.  There are a lot of players who arent in the Plane of Time and the last three zones in GoD.  But these players managed to have absolutely ZERO voice in this so called SUMMIT.  Oh and before you brandish this into a 'casual' vs. 'uber' thread, just consider this.  I play 20-40 hours a week.  I am in a solid guild and we can handle most 3-4 group raid targets we can find up.  But thats all we have for numbers, 20-25 highly active players.  So lets look at how progession works.  Plane of Nightmare.  It requires a Max of 18 (easy with 12) pre-flag event.  So why does TT require 35-60 people?  PoV?  Every mob required to get the BoT flag is doable by a 3-4 group raid, which is ideal.  In BoT, EVERY Mob to get to Agnar (all the keys and preflags, and tower minis) are 3-4 group raid doable.  But Agnar requires 40+.  This is my number one complaint with EQ.  Why do the progression mobs require 35+ people when every other mob in those same zones are doable with 20?  Why bottleneck progression to 'casual' guilds by requiring ridiculous numbers to progress.  Probably the wrong spot for this rant, but there it is.<br />

They didn't need to have such a huge gathering of people to just basically say, &quot;Our CS sucks we're going to work on that.  Oh and there are some global changes coming.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seriously, they could have done that in a patch message.  This summit was about community relations, much like a mini fan faire, to speak with the heads of various guilds and community boards.  Their interaction with the leaders of specific communities, such as the Crucible, should have been to talk about that communities problems with the game such as class balance / improvement discussions.</div></div><hr />
