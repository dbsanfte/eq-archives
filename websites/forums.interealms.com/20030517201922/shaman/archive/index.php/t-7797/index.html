<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sharrah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was looking for a little help/few idea's.<br />
I am currently playing a shaman.. and have her to lvl 49.<br />
My husband plays a 54 war.. and we were looking for idea's on a good spot for me to catch up to him. grped.<br />
The catch is: I dont have Luclin or PoP.. nor have the ability to upgrade my comp to do so.<br />
Anyone have thoughts on this. Trying to avoid having to get grp's just yet.. as with 4 kids.. we often afk/2 box to deal with the little *&amp;^%$!'s</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">City of Mist would be good. Most mobs from the bowling alleys on each side back around to the bridge/gazeebos will still be dark blue to him, just on the verge of turning light blue (at the bowling alleys). Most of the mobs on the bridge/gazeebos are still dark blue to my Shaman at 55.<br />
<br />
FWIW...I p'leveled my warrior there from 40 to 51 in just a few days. Great experience, at least when I was there. Then again there's always KC if you can stand it. Nice thing about both is that they're outdoor zones, but still considered dungeons.<br />
<br />
Good thing about CoM is it's deserted most of the time so you pretty much have the entire zone to yourself except for when a group/raid comes through for epic quests. Haven't been to KC in a long time, so not sure of it's population since before Luclin, but it sure used to be a fustercluck and a half.<br />
<br />
G'luck! Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>sharrah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Been to CoM.. collected all my pages.. and the 3 books of the Ghost (name escapes me atm) at 47.<br />
War and me grp at gazebo's for an hour.. then a reaver grp basically took over.. as they were pulling out to gazebo's .<br />
been back twice since.. and its always busy around that area.<br />
But huge thanks for the suggestion. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Quanit Icebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There is two places that this goes really really well.<br />
<br />
Burning Woods and Chardok<br />
<br />
I used to do the ruins over to the left after entering from DL, a few roamers, but mostly easy mobs.  Slow and these things are gravy.<br />
<br />
Once you hit 50 or 51, move to chardok and never leave.  It is the best xp you can get, and usually not very crowded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I heartily endorse the CoM and BW ideas... you might run into trouble in Chardok unless you stick to entrance/exit mobs.<br />
<br />
CoM is particularly attractive for you because some of those mobs will be turning light blue/green for your spouse, meaning you'll get a chance to catch up.  Green to him and blue to you is ideal for catching up, because you get FULL XP for the kill (yes, I have tried this with my own second account).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We're headed back to CoM this weekend to plevel my wifes 38 rogue. Grouping her with my warrior while buffing/healing/slowing/snaring with the Shammy/Druid. She'll be 50 in no time. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>sharrah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The chardok idea sounds awesome. any mobs we should really avoid? I know some of the deeper stuff can be nasty.. but we will stick to exit/entrance.. as suggested. )</div></div><hr />
