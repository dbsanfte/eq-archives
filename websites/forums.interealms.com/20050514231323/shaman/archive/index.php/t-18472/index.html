<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I rejoin an old guild that I was in 2 years ago ... I was a cleric back then, back then everyone was 50 and everything was hard ... I have noticed now a days when people ask me about mob X .. I tend to go over board about how hard they are .. .then others will contribute and say nononon thats easy now ... <br />
<br />
Its like I was in a black hole for a while ... but it seems like everything outside of the planes is trival?  Does everyone else feel this way?<br />
<br />
I know certian classes can solo old world (kunark dragons) stuff but i assume that they are in time gear or at least elemental.<br />
<br />
This thread isnt about &quot;oh the good old days&quot; ... its about the last 4 years of my life becoming trival =)<br />
<br />
Ding BTW !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, most stuff has been heavily trivialized w/ PoP levels and gear upping people.  We used to regularly kill Dozekar with 5 people with no problems at all.  People do Vindicator with a group, and clear all of NToV with 12.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not to mention that Dozecar and NToV are Velious-era. The right AAs made the Velious stuff a lot easier even before PoP came out. With PoP AA and level 65? On xev, we have half a dozen guilds in the current VT rotation... and that with the top guild having dropped out because VT isn't as rewarding as the Elemental Planes or Time for the effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I find it more helpful if you look at it like this way:<br />
<br />
Just imagine how much more you can do with a group  :D <br />
<br />
Instead of just grinding or heading out on a crawl, you can finish someone's epic or slay a dragon or a dungeon boss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">from the rumors the next expansion is only going to push this further.  it should make nearly everything prepop either soloable or doable with a small group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>enarcheos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Level 65 compared to level 50 DOES trivialize things. That would be the same as a level 38 watching you take down EF ice giants and being amazed at how you can solo them so easily. Wizards alone will nearly triple their firepower from level 50 to level 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>khazmun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As a guild leader of a small family guild I find what you are talking about to be true all the time.  When seeking out targets and fun stuff for my guild to do I'm constantly running into old posts saying how you need 30+ people for X mob, then to walk in with 10-15 of us and handle it without a hitch.  Generally I cut the number of people in half when I see an old post stating how many people required for a raid.  <br />
<br />
Its kinda sad that some of the older content has gotten so trivialized, but for a guild my size its actually very nice.  We can do epics, most of the Velious content, and some of the Luclin content with our small raiding force of 15 or so.  It opens up a lot of the things that we wouldn't have been able to do without the 50+ levels.  So maybe if they keep adding levels we'll get to kill gods one day even :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I recently did NToV for the first time with my just-short-of elemental guild with 3ish groups, maybe 20 people total.  It was fun, but a lot easier than I expected.  Easily half the loot rotted too, the drops just don't compare to even low end PoP stuff.  A few nice haste items do drop there still, but the caster loot is sub-par as Velious predates most of the useful caster add-on effects.  I scored a facesmasher just to say I had NToV loot :).</div></div><hr />
