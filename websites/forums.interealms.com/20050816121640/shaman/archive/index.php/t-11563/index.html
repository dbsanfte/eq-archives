Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Occuring on all pages so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It made me reset my password, I don't know why. Or is the username case sensitive?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The grapic at the top of the page (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/images/shamanlogo.gif) just has a red X in it.<br />
<br />
In doing this reply the &quot;Message Icon(s)&quot; were displaying a bunch of red x's too.  The first 2 rows were displaying correctly.<br />
<br />
At the very top http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/index.php? I could see this logo http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/images/vBulletin_logo.gif not sure if that is an error or not..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not sure if this is a &quot;bug&quot;  but it took me a minute to find my &quot;View New Posts&quot; button since its a itty bitty arrow on the top left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Password messed up, I had to have it reset.<br />
<br />
And when it reset, it sent me 2 confirmation emails w/ the new pw (both the same, so it didn't reset twice).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Urnti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The main site (not the forums) is showing up forbidden to me, as well as the main site of the rangers glade.<br />
<br />
Other than that lots of images are showing up as red x's, including most of the smily things above where the reply box (place where you type your reply when you click reply).  The first two rows are working, the rest are red x's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks Sun for getting this up - I was in withdrawals on my Crucible fix.<br />
<br />
In the upper right hand corner ... getting temp buttons for Open Buddy list, View New Posts,Mark all forum read, log out, and simple search.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">new look is an abombination to my eyes, but that's ok, if it's cheaper or easier for you guys...<br />
<br />
<br />
but I can no longer resize the font of the whole board with ctrl-mousewheel, I don't know if you set that or what, the text is way too big now..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Search function is throwing up &quot;Sorry - no matches. Please try some different terms.&quot; for anything it cannot find a match for on page 1.<br />
<br />
EG:<br />
<br />
&quot;wolf&quot;<br />
&quot;Sorry - no matches. Please try some different terms. &quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>WasOldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Couldn't get in under my old name &quot;Oldshaman&quot; and password. Couldn't have the board send one because my e-mail changed since I registered and I didn't change it (my fault).<br />
<br />
Also noticed that posts between 3/3/2003 and sometime when the board came back up are missing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">a lot of boken links when posting (smilies are broken)<br />
This hurts my eyes what was wrong with old version.<br />
<br />
Was betetr IMO.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Had to reset password(expected to with the move actually).  Email notification was within the posted time limits.<br />
<br />
A lot of the little graphic images are broken for me(and on the Glade as well)smilely faces, thumbs up, etc.<br />
<br />
Threads load slower than before(I'm on DSL).  I'm not experiencing this on other sites.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i havent been able to get here for what seems like 2 weeks ?<br />
<br />
says i dont have permission.<br />
<br />
i only gothere by clicking on a old link.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The time on the main page is wrong (for me at least).<br />
<br />
For example when the real time was 10:30 am GMT, the main page said 11:20 am GMT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Another possible problem:<br />
<br />
I don't think it's right to use character entity references in links. For example, the &quot;edit&quot; link on a post looks something like this:<br />
&lt;pre&gt;<br />
&amp;lt;a href=&quot;editpost.php?do=editpost&lt;b&gt;&amp;amp;amp;&lt;/b&gt;postid=128689&quot;&amp;gt;<br />
&lt;/pre&gt;<br />
I *think* that's wrong, and more to the point it confuses my browser :) If the &lt;b&gt;&amp;amp;amp;&lt;/b&gt; is changed to a plain &lt;b&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/b&gt; then all works well. <br />
<br />
My reading of the HTML 4 spec is that the &quot;link&quot; part of an anchor tag is of type URI, whereas you're only allowed to use character entities in CDATA types. I could be wrong here, I'm no HTML expert.<br />
<br />
Edit - I knew I'd have to edit this a couple of times to get the HTML working right :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>millman007</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Millman account cant login, cant reset password, says invalid email address, but has not changed. Thought i was only one, heh, this first time been able to view message boards starting yesterday.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mill the sad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Bump.<br />
<br />
Any chance of a fix for the HTML problem I mentioned above?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Bump.<br />
<br />
Any chance of a fix for the HTML problem I mentioned above?<br />
<br />
Hail,<br />
Most smilies appear as red x's as others have reported.  Sometimes all of them, other times all but first two rows are x's.<br />
<br />
The above quote from Grippa showed up unasked for when I hit reply.  This happens frequently when I respond to a post, the last poster's message (partial or complete) is automatically added into my post text box.  I don't know if that's working as intended or not, but it wasn't happening with the old boards.<br />
<br />
Also, boards seem to be EXTREMELY SLOW to take me to the reply text when I hit the &quot;reply to&quot; button.<br />
<br />
On a good note, I'm no longer barred from viewing the boards at work. :D<br />
<br />
The new look doesn't bother me.  If it is cheaper to maintain, keep it. :)<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Hail,<br />
<br />
I don't know if this is a bug or just my incompetence, but I can't seem to change my signature information. :(<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kaytlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hi sunmoon!!  I need my password reset as well, my old account doesn't seem to work so made this temp one.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The way I used to get here was the following link:<br />
<br />
http://interealms.com/shaman/<br />
<br />
That comes up forbidden, it was by luck alone that I happened to find a link directly to the forums (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman).<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, in the edit post screen, most of the smileys are red x'd out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>EvelTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Hey Sunmoon,<br />
Im having the same password reset problem for my 'Evel' account. Im using a different e-mail from when I joined and am unable to reset it my self.<br />
I tried to PM you, but your box is currently full.</div></div><hr />
