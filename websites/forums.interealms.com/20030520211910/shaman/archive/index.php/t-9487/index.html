<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beranor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I tried soloing my way down there - I was unsuccesful (this was at 57).  However if you join a group or follow a group down there you can easily camp just Arch Duke Iatol for the Bracer.  He is on a 26 minute timer.  <br />
<br />
When I tried I didnt make it to the ICG's because the first room in the crypt is 3 spawns and they all came.  ICG's won't split either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Waredan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Crypt can be done by a 58. With no epic or JBB it comes down to a wire depending on ur mana pool and hps. The best way to get there is to skip all the mobs from the locked door to the ICGs. Just get an undead potion and run like mad after you get through the locked door. All mobs should be undead from there to the crypt. Then once you are there, you'll have to use regular invis to get past the ICGs. <br />
<br />
When I did it I didnt make a pet for the first kill. I was afraid the ICGs would agro me if i werent invis. After that, I did though and the fight is way easier. So basicly, if you kill the duke the first round, you are good to go. <br />

<br />
I'm a bit confused as to your use of invis and the pet. Are you saying that after you killed the duke you cast your pet and then did the other 3 rooms without using invis to get past the ICGs? Or did you just camp the duke and not move from there? It'd seem a shame to miss out on the chance of a heiro cloak too :)<br />
<br />
As to getting past the locked door, you have to ask a friend/passing rogue to do it for you. Once you finish you just gate out, or ask someone to reopen it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Celestin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One other thing - the pesky caretaker (cube that wanders down the center of the crypt end-to-end) can see invis.  So blast down there with IVU but don't go down the stairs until you check for him.  He's got a pretty big agro range - you may need to kill him.  You can fight him at the base of the stairs with no ICG agro.<br />
<br />
When I did this - I lapped the named (including emp) with a monk/rogue team for hours.  Came out with quite the haul.  Not exactly solo, but we used the invis past the ICG's trick to save time like 50 times at least, so that works like a charm.<br />
