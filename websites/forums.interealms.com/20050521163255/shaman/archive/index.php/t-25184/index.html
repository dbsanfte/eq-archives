<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>lordhiss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i say we shouldstart an shammy organization serverwide that involves alchemy. we will havecertainprices on each potions that any member cannot go lower than.  if anyone u ee goes lower tell them about the group so they know the rules.it i wllmake the prices for us much better and not have us lose money while selling em.  all in favor post and leave a comment if u feel</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As an entrepreneur who wants to make plat selling potions, are you attempting to fix prices across servers in an effort to head off the numerous entrepreneurs who will stock up on the cheap servers and pay $75 to transfer with a full load of potions to more expensive servers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wakonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's a nice enough idea at heart but i don't think it is a very practical one.  Its completely the nature of business competition to get your item sold quicker than others, under-cutting the competition is the real only viable way to get rid of stock to gain the money to make more product for the consumer, at least that is the way i see it.  If somehow you could put up a logical enough reasoning that would better all shaman around somehow equally I am definatly all ears, although I am not sure how, but my ears are open.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Only way such schemes work in the real world is if there are negative consequences to going against the &quot;union&quot;.  In the case of EQ, there is nothing you could do to someone who undercuts, therefore, it won't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>lordhiss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">actually i have contacted a GMand im sreeing ificould get a waytomakea item for making people un able to go past a certain price</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was going to type something snarky, but I'm laughing too hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've found farming to be more profitable than alchemy (haven't skilled up from 167 since before LDoN). I might be missing out with the new augs, but oh well...I'll eventually raise my skill, unless a GM stops me. =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, call it OPES.  The Organization of Potion Exporting Shamans.  <br />
<br />
Cartels are bad in general, because it's a known consequence from Game Theory (invented by John Nash, Jr. - the subject of &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;) that cheating on the cartel, by lowering prices, is always beneficial to the cheater.  Cartels with many members are even worse, because it becomes impossible to monitor every member to see if they stick to the agreement.<br />
<br />
In short, this idea wouldn't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kiebler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">All hail Lord Hiss (if thats your real name).  Savior of the universe... well at least the part that deals with something so trivial as shaman potion prices.<br />
<br />
You will make more off one aug then you will in a year of potion vendoring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Magni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Is there a server out there that even has a potion market?  Other than the occasional gate potion, I am not asked to make anything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">An organization like that on a server to server basis might have some chance of succeeding, but uniting 40 odd different server economies and a rigid price structure would be impossible, or at the very least very unproffitable.  You'd have to set an average price, so some servers would have cheap potions based on their economy and others would be more expensive than their economy can support.<br />
<br />
IF you could find a way to bottleneck ALL the supplies for alchemy it might be possible to set up such a cartel.  However, since 80% of alchemy components are vendor bought and price fixed across all teh servers there is no way to limit the supply.  The other 20% of components are dropped or stupidly rare (slugworms run 75K and up on my server) that the price of components will very widely per server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The only place this could succeed is on the RZ server.  Why?  Because it would require some sort of racketeering w/ detrimental punishment to be given out for going against the cartel.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I actually had someone send me a tell once when I was selling DS potions, I had mine for about 10p less than the ones above me (was only making them for skills, not for profit) and was bitched at for degrading the shaman class and that I should stick to the prices out there and if I don't Im being a horrible person :/<br />
<br />
and Lordhiss...thank you for making my morning :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Buy the under-priced potions. Resell them, or as I often do, destroy them :) It works to some extent.</div></div><hr />

Actually, the best positive benefit of this suggestion:  boy, was it effective at clearing out my sinuses.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, it didn't do much for my keyboard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I've been makeing a tidy little profit for abit on alchemy, 200+trophy.  The way I've been doing it.<br />
<br />
I make a couple oddball potions, bout 6 gates, 6 sows, a couple stacks of quints.<br />
<br />
I sell for what I feel its worthwhile for me to make them, bout 90pp for sow, 3k for gate, 125 for quints.  And I don't go makeing more till they are sold out and I don't go lowering my prices just cause I want them sold quick, I just leave em and forget them till they are sold.  People undercut me constantly, but I still sell mine.<br />
<br />
And when I see people truly cutting their profit margins to the bone, I advertise for them, I let people know that that is the lowest you will see them sold and go buy from them.  I figure the more they sell for 2pp profit a potion the quicker they'll raise their prices or just swear off alchemy as a plat loosing crap shoot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">OMG, fighting fair!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I made 2 million platinum creating and selling augments.  I wouldn't have made that much in my 2.5 years of playing by just selling potions.  If you want to make money with alchemy, make the augments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Drib's got it — there were three people last night OOC'ing for commissions for making augments. They each were (200) alchemy with their GM trophies and the salvage AA (one of them also mentioned the &quot;alchemy AA&quot;). So I asked one of them if he ever got work doing that, and he said he'd made 30k in just that day. He'd only been logged on for 45 minutes.<br />
