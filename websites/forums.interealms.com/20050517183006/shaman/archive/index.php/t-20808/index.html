*************<br />
Use these solutions to resolve your issue:<br />
<br />
1) CANCELLING YOUR SUBSCRIPTION (NON-EVERQUEST)<br />
If you would like to cancel your subscription to one of our games other <br />
than EverQuest, you can do so from our official website at <br />
https://store.station.sony.com/  <br />
    -Click Sign_In Log in with your Station Name and Password <br />
    -Click &quot;Subscriptions&quot;<br />
    -Click on the subscription you wish to cancel <br />
    -You will then be presented with an option to cancel your account.  <br />
<br />
<br />
2) CANCELLING AN EVERQUEST SUBSCRIPTION<br />
If you have an EverQuest subscription and would like to cancel it, you <br />
can do so through the game itself:<br />
<br />
    -Enter the EverQuest game client <br />
    -Click on &quot;Account&quot; <br />
    -Click on &quot;End Billing&quot;  <br />
*****************<br />
<br />
Hmmm, only with EQ can you not cancel your account from the webpage.  I wonder why that is.... Oh yeah, that's right, half the time you can't even LOGIN to get to the &quot;End Billing&quot; button!!!  Stroke of genius on the part of the marketing department.  Bravo, boys, bravo!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">two words ... stop payment.  It costs most people more at the bank, but it's well worth it to fight corporations that abuse your pocketbook and sanity through designed flaws that prevent you from otherwise preventing payment for a service you don't want (anyone remember the &quot;pre-purchase&quot; crap with the GoD expansion?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just tried login myself (because for some reason, couldn't login to the boards at all) and had no problem...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you are paying with a credit card, call your CC company and explain to them that you did not authorize SOE to charge your account for the amount in question, but specificly told SOE to stop the service and cease billing.  CC companies will almsot always side with the consumer, unless the corperation has direct evidence (i.e. a real, not carbon, signature agreeing to the transaction) that you authorized the transaction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Oukast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What I love is that they call these emails &quot;autoresponses&quot;, when in fact they are not.  Never heard of any auto response ANYWHERE taking from one to three days to make it back to your inbox, and then another week or two to actually get an email from someone with &quot;power&quot; to help you.  But this is SoE that we are talking about....freaking retards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It looks like Laughing Woman is pointing out that the email seems to specify that you can only cancel an everquest subscription through the game interface, and not through the website.<br />
<br />
The auto-response is incorrectly worded if that's the case, I just don't know what she's trying to say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Oukast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">no no no...this isn't just her email....this is SoE emailing their customer complaints / issues we are talking about...<br />
<br />
Don't be so nit picky geezus...get laid or something</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">no no no...this isn't just her email....this is SoE emailing their customer complaints / issues we are talking about...<br />
<br />
Don't be so nit picky geezus...get laid or something<br />
<br />
erm, I think you are a little excited there Oukast.... no one was nit picking. It was simply a clarifying post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>circuits</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well in that sence you failed to clarify.<br />
And since you admitted at the end of your own post you don't know what she meant, there was no reason to post in the first place, you might as well have chanted &quot;spam&quot;.<br />
It is thinking before typing, not the other way around</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Taladorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just for refrence you can cancel your Eq billing from there web site.<br />
This is from the SOE knowledge base.<br />
<br />
You can also cancel your EverQuest account through our website: www.station.sony.com/en/. Once at the website, select My Account in the upper right corner. After signing in, Billing Info will be in the upper left, directly under View Registration. On the Billing Information page you will find Subscriptions on the left, click it to display Your Subscriptions. Under My Subscriptions choose EverQuest (# Month) Active. On the following page, click Edit Subscription and then Cancel Subscription.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Good gravy, that was buried!  I *knew* I'd been there before, but couldn't find it again.  Thanks Taladorm.  I prefer cancelling my account when I take my EQ vacations as a way of saying &quot;I'm really not enjoying your game right now&quot; ... I've been canceled for 5 months at a time before, never had issues with it.</div></div><hr />
