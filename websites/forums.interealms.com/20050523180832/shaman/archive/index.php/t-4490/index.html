<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, so we, as Shamans, were the recipient along with all other casters of Durability and Stability AA Skills...  I rejoiced.... for about a minute.<br />
<br />
Then I read my guild's message board.  The melees were FURIOUS that  Casters got one of their skills.. and that we were taking away some of their &quot;uniqueness&quot; or talents, or values, or whatever.   I felt quite bad... not for the melees, no not for them.<br />
<br />
I felt bad because, I came to a realization of sorts.   While in a discussion defending the sensibility of giving casters more HP, I saw a glaring disparity.   A Warrior began complaining that Casters just recieved another &quot;bone&quot; from VI that would only help to make us more &quot;overpowered&quot;.    Then he pointed out how casters were overpowered as it was.   He sited such examples as Manaburn, Direcharm, Critical Nukes, Critical Heals.. etc... etc... etc., also, how our AA point skills were giving us benefits far exceeding what melees got.<br />
<br />
I read.. then I read again.. and I posted a rebuttal... and it was in my rebuttal that I saw something I had not noticed before...  It was like waking up and realizing all the other kids had got Ice Cream but me.<br />
<br />
We don't nuke (much)... so is Casting Fury of use to us?<br />
<br />
We cast Torpor.. not Spam heals... so Critical heals seem a little pointless.   At one point..  Reinforcement could lengthen Torpor... by accident or design, I don't know, but it was taken from us.<br />
<br />
I've seen Enchanters with Dire Charm solo the Kael Manor.   <br />
<br />
I've seen Paladins and SK's soloing, and doing REAL DAMAGE.<br />
<br />
Druids Have had better ratio nukes implemented.  Plus Spells that give them GOOD mana regen.<br />
<br />
Rangers have gone from being the joke of EQ to being a valued damage dealer in raids.<br />
<br />
Monks?   They're just unreal now.<br />
<br />
Necros can now get Funeral Pyre.. a DOT with an amazing Damage/Mana Ratio.. and Dire Charm of Undead... a Necro, in the right zone, is a killing machine.<br />
<br />
Garrison's or Elnerik's?  Okay, bad examples.. those spells really are overpowered.   Any spell that can Crit for over 5000 is just insane.<br />
<br />
Then, I looked at my spells.. and Gear. <br />
<br />
Pox... Yeah... Had that since Kunark.<br />
Bane... Had that since Kunark too.<br />
Avatar... Never use it.. too small a return.<br />
Torpor...  Nice, Very nice.. okay, VI, you did well here.<br />
Malo...  a Raid spell.<br />
JBB... Had that since Kunark too... yeah.<br />
<br />
I began looking for anything from Velious or Luclin that said the me, &quot;Hey, we're handing out new spells that will improve a Caster's Damage output.. and here are yours....&quot;    None.<br />
<br />
Oh, wait... there were those two poison nukes in Velious...  Have I even cast those?  I forget.<br />
<br />
Oh, new buffs.. LOTS of new buffs... I can see that.  But all the new buffs are aimed at Raiding...  GROUP Focus,  GROUP Stamina, GROUP PR/DR.   A new slow, that we would only use on the 2-3 mobs that were specifically designed to only be slowable by it.<br />
<br />
I realized... Shamans, as a class, have not had a single increase in our day to day damage output since Kunark.  This shocked me, then upset me... now I'm just back to being shocked.<br />
<br />
When I posted this in the discussion about casters being overpowered.. no one could answer me as to why this would be, or whether or not it seemed right.<br />
<br />
So I'd like to ask the people here... does this seem right to you?  Is this okay?   Should I not feel like I've been left out of the party that is increased Spell DPS for all Casters but me?<br />
<br />
and if I am justified...  what options are there?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Breathable</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">&quot;Monks? They're just unreal now. &quot;<br />
Very Untrue, monks got almost nothing in DPS upgrade via aa, and very few aa that are even worth it. They have always been a valued character, but have gotten very little upgrade through AA, but I dont think they really should, as they are pretty much balanced.<br />
<br />
Shamans get canni V and many other aa skills worth getting, we are alot balanced that many other classes. Theres no reason to complain when they just gave us an upgrade for more AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shamans are buff and slow whores, welcome to EQ.  You want damage, roll a wizard or a monk.  We're not supposed to be damage.  <br />
<br />
We can solo, heal, slow, buff, SoW (godspell at low levels), we're flexible, we group well.  We are not supposed to be damage output.  Save wizards I'd say shamans are the strongest casting class (probably just my biased view) but we really don't have much to complain about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh, I have Cann V.. and Torpor...  I'm the top shaman on my server... I can do a lot of things... I've Killed Yaldema... I solo in Ssra for laughs...  I've taken a decent poke at Cliff Golems.. OT Guards and even Lodizal.   I've soloed my way to both the NG and Disco Camps in OS to meet a group.   I've held the NG camp solo.<br />
<br />
My point is this.. we can solo just fine.   I almost never run out of mana.   But when they tuned our soloing abilities, it was based on us doing slower damage, over a longer time.  <br />
<br />
I can kill anything that is slowable under level 60, or at least give it one serious bloody nose.  But it takes a very, very long time.<br />
<br />
I just feel kind of funny that we're still using DOT's implemented over two years ago as our Primary mode of Damage... see many 60 Wizards throwing around Ice Comet lately?<br />
<br />
When I solo for XP, my XP influx is not a function of how fast or how hard I fight...   I can't &quot;squeeze&quot; out more damage in a shorter time like some classes.<br />
<br />
Soloing for XP has become a function of how much time I want to sit there.  <br />
<br />
My point I guess is every class that can solo a mob, can solo a mob faster now than they could 2 years ago.   We still kill a mob at the same pace now that we did 2 years ago, it's just that it takes the mob a lot longer to kill us.<br />
<br />
You see... I see other classes ripping through AA points solo at a phenomenal pace...  monks/bards/rangers with over 100 AA solo.  We just chug along at Kunark speeds.<br />
<br />
I can pull off stunts what wow people with how I can kill that one mob that just reamed a party of level 50's, but it took me 20 minutes... and all I got was blue XP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree Warg...and I don't see this changing anytime soon.  I don't see us getting an real upgrades in damage or even the debuff area anytime soon.  Maybe with PoP but I doubt it.  The only thing we might get a nice upgrade in is how many hit points we can get on someone.  Not sure I see them giving us a bigger better Malo, improved Turgurs, improved DD's or DoT's (yes I know we get Scourge of Nife, maybe).  <br />
<br />
But what spells do we, as shaman, complain about NOT getting the most....Kunark spells.  Spells that have been out for two-years.  While classes like Druids get upgraded heals, debuffs, DD's, DoT's, mana/hp buffs; we get Group Focus. <br />
<br />
YEA, GO US!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bartmeista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We cast Torpor.. not Spam heals... so Critical heals seem a little pointless. At one point.. Reinforcement could lengthen Torpor... by accident or design, I don't know, but it was taken from us.<br />
<br />
that's incorrect, the SCR and SCRM lines of AA skills still lengthen Torpor and its effects...  i did C5, MGB, qbuff3, scr3, scrm and am very happy on how it turned out.  3.0 second casting, 1800 hp torps = heaven...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ouchy Dathurts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'll give them natural Durability back if we get back hmm lets see. Primal weapons, the BPs off Cursed that have a Foc equivalent, the instant casts sow boots (forget what drops), cobalt bracer, any weapon that procs a shaman slow, and god knows what other items there are out there that use our spells to help other classes. <br />
<br />
If they think casters are overpowered maybe they should go look at monks. Even pallys with slay undead can rake in xp like freaks. Last time i checked we worked together to kill big ****. Its not like we're against eachother at all except on the few pvp servers. And the game shouldnt be ballanced around a few servers. Hmm let me see, oh yes thats right, HP help me live through that mob thats kickin my ass cuz slow resisted. Which in return saves the clerics/enchanters/pallys/shamen mana from having to rebuff me from my death. Which saves the healers mana to help heal the melee. I really dont see the problem here. Just a bunch of people bitching cuz the grass always seems greener on the other side.:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brothers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">actually we need a 50% rez (or more) .. then we will hear them all cry bout Shaman's :D <br />
<br />
to be honest tho, with out a Shaman so powa~ as we are today .. would raids even happen? I mean think bout it, we have a 75% slow with out that slow on alot of raids the tanks would be so dead so fast the clerics would be so much out of mana they wouldnt even have a chance of surviving longer than hmm 10 min?<br />
<br />
I mean lets stop and think bout this for a second, if we arent as powerful as we are considered today all raids would be like AoW or Doze our HP buffs would mean the tanks would be that much lower in HP, our stam buffs would mean the tanks would be that much more less in HP, our stamina regen buff (Acumen) would mean the tanks would be whining bout low stamina or running out. our 59 cha buff which is suppose to be the best in game (only VI knows why) the bards would be whining then.<br />
<br />
i mean tell me another class who is mana effectient as a 60 Shaman or any shaman with canni spell for that matter. we can solo dragons and named dragons for that matter. we can buff raids and be the main reason of the whole out come of a raid. when it comes down to it its the High end of the game were we as Shaman shine the most. with out us Shaman there wouldnt be no High end game .. would there?<br />
<br />
to me the added Durability and Stability AA skills will make us that much stronger YES .. and better tanks in the long run. but we will never equal to that of a REAL Tank who can get up to 6K unbuffed HP's just thru quested gear the added AA skills for TAnks isnt that much in HP. I mean its the REAL TAnks who takes the damage for us and keep the rest of us alive.<br />
<br />
the added durability and stability only keeps us alive that much longer on any given raid or even when out and grinding exp as normal<br />
<br />
but to answer your questions, yes I think we are a powerful class as it is alrdy, Yes we have slow DPS when it comes to dmg output but while those spells we are casting that are doing slow DPS we have the ability to canni back our lost mana for which we just casted on. <br />
<br />
as for the velious nukes, I use them on ever raid i get a chance too. with added focus items my nukes are even that much stronger. sure there a small increase in dmg for using focus items but that much more dmg for a givin amount of mana is and can be of great outcome on a raid.<br />
<br />
somethings that would make us GODLY and truely something to cry bout is giving the Shaman the ability to Rez ppl for 50% or more thru AA points or a better heal between Greater heal and Torpor thru AA points like maybe a mini Torpor thru AA or as a spell before 60<br />
<br />
shamans have the ability to buff/debuff/ part enchanter thru haste buffs/ we have Alchemy skills that when used in the right way we can regen at enormous HP rates with normal regen, regen buffs and a fungi on stacked with regen potions/ we can port ppl to certian locations with port potions/ we can heal with Torpor at 60/ we can snare mobs with the right diety or right weapons/ we can DS the tanks/ we can pretty much do it all except REZ ppl <br />
<br />
give us REZ and we would oWn NoRRaTh :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Call it egoistic, but I see those skills as natural evolution to our class (and to a lesser degree to Clerics). But I tend to agree that intcasters with these AA Skills feel just wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I agree with ouchy and warg.  Melee cant complain.  <br />
<br />
Shaman were better soloers before aa points.  Back when the only reaosn to solo was just to look cool (yeldema) or for loot ect.  Now that you want to solo for xp, you really cant beat a monk, or even a paladin ranger warrior or sk.<br />
<br />
Our aa abilities arnt bad, its just that when I look at them I think they were made by a cleric or a druid.  Heal and nuke aa's dont go with our torpor/dot theme.  Can V is really to good (not complaining tho ofc), and I dont think they put in qb to make torpor better, seems like a side effect to the ability thats actually its most useful aspect.<br />
<br />
Now ND, thats our first real aa that seems to fit the class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Katyana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think that the Shaman Class is a shining example of good class balancing and feel satisfied that VI has left it alone for the most part. The only thing that I would have complained about pre-Luclin was the dramatic gap between a fully spelled 59 Shaman and an Oracle, but they addressed that issue extremely well with some &quot;mini&quot; versions of our powerful 60 spells. DPS is not a high priority to a group/raid Shammy. We have the most powerful de-buff in the game (Slow) and the means to set it up (Malo).  We can buff groups or Raids like no other class. We can heal quite well. QB3 and SCM3 have made Torpor incredibly powerful. Once you have Cann V and Torpor you are looking at a full tank of gas just minutes after battle. If I want DPS in a group I want a Tank with taunt and a pair of Rogues. If I was to choose any class pair in the game to duo with, I would choose a Monk/Shammy combination. If I was to pick a basic &quot;dream&quot; group, it would always include a Shammy. Burning mobs fast soloing may or may not be a class strength for a Shaman but I think enhancing our capabilities with hotter Direct damage spells or snare would seriously over power our class. I feel sorry for Druids. They are still far to &quot;one dimensional&quot;. I still feel sorry for Wizards despite their upgrades. I tend to stick with Rogues for DPS over the long haul. I feel sorry for Shadow Knights who I think really have been ripped. I think that the few Bards that have taken a &quot;broken&quot; class and prospered should be recognized as true EQ heroes. I have played 9 different classes and enjoy the Shaman the most. Yes my Druid can solo rings around my Shammy in terms of amassing xp. But that same Druid cannot dream of the experience my Shaman can rack up in a good group. If you want to solo in ME, play a Druid or Wizard by all means. If you want to enjoy the level 60 playground VI created in CT, play a Shaman. I for one hope that VI continues in its attempts to preserve its vision of class balancing. Maybe the best way to do that is to approach it from a different perspective. Instead of fiddling with Classes, maybe they should reconfigure more zones to create opportunities for narrow classes to expand their playing options.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">We do a massive amount of damage to mobs.. but in a very indirect way.<br />
<br />
We buff a raid - making it say 10% more effient.. now that means we do 10% of the damage without actually hitting the mob.<br />
<br />
Show me another class that does that.</div></div><hr />

Sure some classes outdamage me but in general I can keep my DPS at around 180 without losing mana. (Asuming my twink Chanter gives me a C3 every now and then)<br />
And with some addded equipment I am sure I can even push that A little further towards the 200.<br />

<br />
Raids would still happen without us.  Since they implemented the unslowable flag last summer and generously applied it to mobs from Sontalak to level 40-something guards in icewell, I'd argue that guilds are completely acclimated to fighting unslowed mobs.  Two years ago shaman were much more essential than they are today.  Now, it's all main-tank and CH chains.  I've seen raids where they forget Klandicar is slowable.  We still shine in groups for zones like CZ and Umbral.<br />
<br />
I agree with Warg.  Somewhere along the line Verant equated &quot;balanced&quot; with &quot;forgetable&quot; and we became the class that gets worked on five minutes til launch.<br />
<br />
We are their customers.<br />
We pay the monlthy fee.<br />
We buy the expansions.<br />
<br />
EQ is the best MMORPG out there; a wonderful game that I really enjoy.  I've been pretty disappointed since Kunark though.  Some say we don't deserve more power, but I say we deserve more fun.  I really hope Planes of Power brings more than Ancient Talisman of the Serpent.<br />

- 3rd best healer in the game ( considering torpor is group only, and druids have a 900 point targetable heal )<br />
- ability to do large amounts of damage on exp mobs ( and some raid mobs )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Since VI is so intent on giving everyone everything right now perhaps looking at giving melee - particularly hybrids - some channeling capabilities would even things out a bit. A 15% chance of casting through being hit seems to me to be on par with 180 or so extra hp. <br />
<br />
As for the rest of the thread here, I find it rather funny. How the Shaman community can go from one discussion saying how godly they are to another saying just how broken as class they are has always confused me. Like Krakster said, change for the sake of change is stupid. Upgrading a class that admits regularly how great it is because they feel left out is equally as stupid. <br />
<br />
A new DD would have been nice, new things are always nice. But is it needed? Not really. Shaman do great with the tools they have, as this board boasts on a regular basis. So, to me, complaining now that we were somehow ripped off sounds more like jealousy then anything else.<br />
<br />
And with that, I'll get flamed *shrug*</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">what does our channel cap at? is it 215? 220?<br />

Hybrids deserve a higher channling cap. Otherwise they'd never get a friggin spell off while tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">But funny thing is. I played a thief to 60 before I finished up Snoww. (she was 45th when I decided meele damage was needed more at the time)<br />
<br />
Snoww Makes my thief look stupid with her verastility. I can do damage, heal, slow, buff, haste, command a pet, shrink, wolfy feets, buff attack massivly, give hitpoints and everything else that a shaman can do.<br />
<br />
You know what My thief can do. Sneak places. Do massive damage in meele, and use poisens to do one shot effects that will probably be resisted anyways. (She can do more than that, but I am trying to make a point, Shaman have options. Tons of em)<br />
<br />
If I had three shrooms on Feather she would be running for zone. Solo.<br />
<br />
Snoww thinks three shrooms is a good start on a pull.<br />
<br />
I want to see another class that can do what a good shaman can do. <br />
<br />
It doesnt exist.<br />
<br />
As for fast damage. try this. combat fury 1  and torrent of poisen. I get crits on three of the four damn waves.. (Thanks RNG)  Was two mobs.. 720, 720, 720, 540  2700 damage from a level 55 spell aint too bad.  Once I get CF 2 Ill let you know how high I get. Then at CF 3 there will be the chance to do double damage 14% of the waves that hit. In other words it will happen sooner or later 1080, 1080, 1080, 1080.  4320 damage.  from a single spell. <br />
<br />
We don't nuke much with the ice strikes. (Damn spells) But with a bracer from a mage, and a haste ring crits can be respectable. And noone has the mana we have.<br />
<br />
Yes it sucks that we have not gotten any damage spells from the last two expansions. Yes other classes have gotten stronger than we have. Wah.  They are stronger at specific things. We are across the board a powerhouse.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Since this thread is still alive, I'll respond.   ND and Stability are just generalist archtype skills.  There is NOTHING special about them.   Every melee got it.  It wasn't a warrior nor a monk thing.<br />
Class skills are suppose to be the skills that define the class.   However, many melee's (especially warriors that I know) like the archtype over class, simply because it generally improves them overall.<br />
<br />
I'm going to assume the original team that thought up the AA system for classes are either not at VI anymore, or are working with newer people that are now above them.    I seriously think the original AA team made a general database, and slapped classes in them without thinking what was best or worse. <br />
Check out shadowknights archtype skills.   Not only they have the melee options, but quite a few of the int caster ones, INCLUDING Subtley.  ***?   Now that's an abilityl as a shaman, wouldn't mind having.   Obviously they didn't take the time to observe class by class, what AA abilities would suit each well. <br />
<br />
I'm sorry to say, and I'll know some will disagree, but Spell Casting Fury and the two healing abilities are the most worthless ones a shaman could waste points into.   Verant could have from the start, given us Casting Subtely and ND instead of worthless abilities.   So now, we have Combat Stability and ND, and it's a good start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">You DO realize hybrid channeling has a higher cap than pure caster..right?<br />
And? Giving them access to the AAXP ability to up that just a bit more seems fair to me given that Verant decided to give casters the ability to up their HP just a bit too. Like I said, since Verant is intent on giving everyone everything...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">What are the two things most shaman complain about frequently here. (No not spell drops and Alchemy, the other two)<br />
<br />
Damage, and healing ability.<br />
<br />
Spell casting fury 3 will give you the ability to do double damage on DD spells 14% of the time.  Sure with Ice strike that isnt that great. But with Torrent of poisen the numbers get alot better. <br />
<br />
So that covers an increase in damage. <br />
<br />
And healing ability. it is stupid to require 24 AA points to make us much better out of group healers. But they are there. And they do have an effect. I think my chloro does 868 point heals with Healing gift 1 (the crit one) If I had the 10% bonus one it would be like 900+ and with the 3rd level crit thing it will go off on a regular basis. With a heal 3 item you get even better efficency. And with Super heal you could be doing a heck of alot of point blank heal power. <br />
<br />
All it takes is time. No it isnt as good as whining and getting the game changed to suit your purposes. But it can be done.<br />
<br />
I would love to hear from a shaman that has all the archetype abilities, and a heal 3 item.  If one exists.<br />

<br />
my main is a rogue, and I'm pissed that casters got ND and CS....not so much because they got THOSE skills, but those shows to me that verant hadn't totally locked axp abilities before PoP, and now they chose to give some of the best abilities to casters instead of looking at the hoarde of useless things and adding some of the thousands of reasonably suggested abilities on all kinds of message boards.<br />
<br />
as for melee getting weapon procs and clickies.....well being a melee would be damn boring without spell effects on armor/weapon. play one and you'd see....never being able to cast a spell ever, just pure melee, would suck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
These 2 new AA skills for us are just some small improvments, more hp will help us do our jobs better, and CS will make tank-soloing easier, or possibly save our life in a bad situation.<br />
<br />
Idealy, these skills should have only been given to warriors; but they wern't so there's no real harm in giving it to the rest of us.<br />
<br />
I'll personally break 5000 hps raid buffed with ND3, but you wont see me tanking, I'll still be doing my job as normal - just that I'll be better at it.  And if I draw aggro from monster_of_dewm maybe the extra HPs and the CS AA will help me survive long enough for a real tank to save my butt.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Snoww is right that with SCF3 shamans can possibly crit for double damage on rain wave spells.  But she is OVERLY optimistic in the EXTREME about how often those crits will happen and how often rain spells even land!  Usually when I cast a rain spell I get two hits for up to 540 dmg and one resist.  That's the average on mobs that have low low PR.  Sure there are times when all three waves hit for full.  But there are also times when only one wave hits for reduced damage, or none of them hit.  Add to the fact that NO waves will EVER hit when the mob is below 540 hps, and the spell gets darn silly darn fast.  Fizzle rate is also absurd, even at MAX evocation, and the mana cost is steep.  Snoww, get 60 and the aa skills you mentioned, then see if you still feel the same way.  <br />
<br />
Ok that out of the way, I want to pose one question to you oracles out there.  When was the last time you invited a SECOND shaman into your group?  <br />
<br />
Monks stack, so do warriors, rogues stack like crazy good!  In fact, all melees stack in a group.  Necros stack, wizards stack, even druids with DC pets and KEI stack rather well.  Clerics don't stack, but you want one along anyway for their vastly needed rez powers and vastly superior healing spells.  <br />
<br />
Enchanters can do our slowing job just fine.   <br />
<br />
So basically shaman is the only class that does not stack in a group except for clerics.  Where's my goddam rez spell?  <br />
<br />
DPS is the end all be all of the end game, and shamans just don't have it.  <br />
<br />
I want a new nuke.  That's what I want, and that's all I care about.  No I could give two farts about another stupid buff that nobody will want cuz their buff slots have been full since velious.  No I don't want ancient focus or whatever.  I want a NUKE!!!!!<br />
<br />
I'm with Gart, gimme my ice comet. <br />
All the NPCs got ice comet, regardless of class I swear every caster NPC has ice comet from lvl 44 on up.  <br />
<br />
It's just pathetic to see clerics outnuke us with such authority.  We haven't gotten a nuke upgrade since Kunark and it's about dam time!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I realized... Shamans, as a class, have not had a single increase in our day to day damage output since Kunark.<br />
<br />
Not exactly true.<br />
<br />
DOTs<br />
Added extended affliction items for one tick Bane and 3 more Pox dot damage. <br />
Added affliction haste for 3 sec casting dots.<br />
Added affliction efficiency for 25% mana cost reduction?<br />
<br />
Pets<br />
Buffed the 55 pet a little<br />
Maxxed their level<br />
Made them non-kos, more easier to work with<br />
<br />
I find if i can load 3 dots and have my dog biting on the bum of something, and then bracer nuke or melee on top, the DPS is pretty incredible.<br />
<br />
Of course the problems are not necessarily having the tools, its being able to use them. Resistant mobs i start looking around for someone to torpor. A lure DoT for those occasions might be good. Aggro from dotting is very heavy. And so on. Some of those things could maybe could be addressed.<br />
<br />
But, seems to me looking for fast damage off a shaman is never going to be pay off. We got torpor, malo, slows, dots and a dog and a bag full of buffs. Hard to plead a case for having fast damage too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with most of your points, but I will quibble with this one. My one-word rebuttal:<br />
<br />
Bards<br />
<br />
My long-version rebuttal:  As a player with a main-bard and an alt-shaman, I feel your pain. Let's see, epic proc, twist three songs on group and one on mob, maybe another haste proc if you have certain high end weapons. A bard has to take up a third of a groups buff slots just to do his job.   A second bard can't possibly buff effectively in the same group and has to stick with dots/debuffs that are not very impressive in effect. We won't even talk about what a third bard could sing in a group, as we dont' even have nukes to speak of.  Bards don't stack decently in a group, either. Yeah, we're &quot;melee&quot; classes, but our melee DPS is a far cry behind any other melee classes, even the knight classes since the 2H weapon fix. <br />
<br />
I'm not saying all is right in the world with shaman. I guess my point is just that you do have a brother class on a lot of these issues (eg buff slots and sloooow damage). <br />

As a purist, this idea for int casters is silly. At least shaman are supposed to be battle friendly, ie rabid bear and self only buff like the rage/vob line. So, it makes sorta sense for us at least imho. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Heh.  I posted a rant about this too, War.  About 7 months ago.  I seemed to get almost universally jumped by people disagreeing.<br />
<br />
For the record, I agree completely.<br />
<br />
For all of you folks pointing out focus items, my only response is that everyone else got them too.  An 'increase' isn't much of an increase if everyone else gets it too.  You have to look at the 'increase' in relative terms--and relative to everyone else, we didn't have an increase!  :)<br />
<br />
Shaman can no longer DoT as well as any class in the game.  Necros put us to shame.  Even druids, who have blasts that are 2x ours (and can use fire as well as cold) have DoTs that are the equivalent of Envenomed Bolt.  For that matter, the resist rates on our DoTs, thanks to the DD component, are insane.  Even clerics, the 'healing specialists' do more damage than we do.<br />
<br />
I don't believe we have had a damage upgrade since Kunark.  We are still using the same DoTs and DD spells.  We recover mana faster, with canna 5, but we cast the same spells.  Everyone else is doing damage faster and killing faster, but we are still killing at the same pace as we did in kunark.  Our DoTs take time to kick in.  Iksar don't even have the advantage of a JBB.<br />
<br />
Everyone else gets damage upgrades, we get group buffs.  LOTS of group buffs.<br />
<br />
Even our AA skills reflect the same issues.  Most of them are not very useful.  Canna 5 is great . . . the rest . . .?<br />
<br />
Healing adept and gift are a 10% bonus and a chance of crits on . . . chloroblast.  What's the point?<br />
<br />
Spell casting fury works on DDs . . . almost all shaman use DoTs more often.<br />
<br />
Alchemy mastery . . . not even going there.<br />
<br />
Pet hold . . . trying not to curse . . .<br />
<br />
Spell casting mastery and MGB are mana saving items--like we need more!<br />
<br />
Spell casting reinforcement and quick buff--these are essentially good for ONE spell--torpor.  This represents a total of 39 points for ONE spell.  Yes, a 200 mana heal for 1800 points is NICE, but THIRTY-NINE AA points?!?  When Vi gets around to nerfing this one, it's going to really suck for some of our more AA enabled shaman.<br />
<br />
No, War, I don't think you are mistaken at all.  It's been rubbing me the wrong way for many months.  Shaman have been getting the nerf--not directly, but an indirect nerf is still a nerf.  Making all the classes but us more powerful effectively makes us weaker by comparison, and everything is about balancing.  If they get stronger and we don't, then we are weaker in relation.  This fact seems to escape some people.<br />

(in my mind)...    I feel both would be workable and not too problematic...  but one appeals to me more personally.<br />
<br />
1. (the sensible choice)  Improved DOTs...  or at least a Lure/ No DD component DOT that has a much better chance of landing.<br />
<br />
2. (The one I like)  Raise our Offense, Defense, 1HB, 2HB and Piercing Caps to 225.<br />
<br />
They proved with Rabid Bear, that for a short duration, they can imbue a class that CANNOT Double attack with the skill of double attack at about 200 Skill.   So why not an AA that would push our Melee Caps by 25 points permanently?  It would pump up our melee some to round out our uses in Groups and when solo, but would still keep us well below the melee output of Bards or Beastlords<br />

As for melee's.. I can understand a warriors pain.. they are becoming a bit overshadowed in anything but the most uber situations by other melees with lots of AA. But really.. melee in general is VI's little pet. Its inline with the vision to give melees weapons that proc our Ultimate buff.. its inline with the vision to give melees weapons that proc large direct damage spells. A melee with a fungi can far outsolo us(or any other caster) for AA.<br />
<br />
But really.. so what. Who cares. Excerpt from a conversation I had yesterday.. I was soloing in PoG and a group of 4 epic mages and a cleric zoned in.<br />
<br />
me says ooc &quot;hey if you guys need any buffs or need a hand let me know&quot;<br />
them ooc &quot;okie we will let you know if anything shamanish drops&quot;<br />

me tells soandso &quot;yeah I just tank em&quot;<br />
soandso tells you &quot;LOL wow&quot;<br />
<br />
Im perfectly happy to sacrifice raw DPS merely for the power to impress the hell out of people =p Noone thinks its cool or impressive that wizards and druids quad for mass AA.. noone thinks its out of the ordinary for melees to solo in FG for AA. Noone is suprised that clerics cast CH. However, peoples jaw drops when you solo mobs with 30 minute corpses =p(even if it takes 30 minutes to do heh)<br />
<br />
Prestige my friends.. prestige. Im not concerned in the slightest that the end game(or what some people perceive it to be) is &quot;all about DPS&quot;. Im not out to hoarde as many AA points as I can to get the l33t title. Everyone knows that xping is all about the least common denominator(velks anyone.. basically a least common denominator zone.. both in difficulty and the people who go there =p). <br />
<br />
Holy derailment.. anyway.. Im excited as hell about Combat Stability and Natural Durability.

Krakster says, &quot;You want everything!  You'll get nothing!  And like it!&quot;<br />

Krak, the fact is, the shaman class has been stealth nerfed.  Yes, it's a comparison thing, but it's a nerf nonetheless.  ONE more DoT at 60, or ONE more DD would help.  Personally, I don't see that as overpowering.  Perhaps you disagree.<br />
<br />
As for your comments on AA skills . . .<br />
<br />
Yes, we get AA skills to blast higher.  However, all the casters can get AA skills to blast more--but the increase is based on the spell cast--and ours is still the same ones from kunark!  <br />

Our AA skills to cast spells faster and longer . . . only work on buffs.  39 AA points to buff faster with longer duration.  Yes, torpor is included, but still!  I don't normally buff during fights.  Time for buffs isn't that important.  It's only decent effect is on torpor.  THIRTY-NINE AA points for ONE spell.<br />
<br />
An AA skill that gives double attack--for three minutes every two hours. . .  Can we say toy?<br />
<br />
Go back and read the other posts.  Pretty much all the wish list items that you have summarized and implied we all asked for are suggestions for a SINGLE upgrade, not all of them.  Listing them all and saying, 'this is overpowering' is unbelievably stupid.  Of course that would be overpowered.  People are asking for some upgrade and making possible suggestions--they aren't asking for ALL of them.  Geez.<br />
<br />
One last thing--I think (at least hope) people were kidding about ice comet.  However, do you think it would be game breaking to have an 800hp nuke?  I don't.<br />
<br />
Why don't you go see if you can find another caster class that doesn't get a level 60 damage spell--DoT or DD--besides shaman.  (Ancient Scourge of Nife doesn't count)<br />

Natural Durability for all classes is an of course, all classes should have had that ability from the beginning. <br />
I can't see why you would need to be a melee to be able to strenghen your physics to get better hit points. <br />
Remember ND gives a percentage of your hp and stamina, thus not giving us quite the same bonus as melee classes get.<br />
Combat Stability for casters......i don't know, not complaining at all.<br />
The argument could be the same, why would you need to be a melee to be able to avoid an attacker better than a caster, however CS seems to me a clear melee skill.<br />
If anything melees should be given aa skills that gives them an added percentage for double attack, dual wield, flying kick, backstab, taunt and whatnot.</div></div><hr />

Dude... who said I wanted double attack.. stop and READ the posts.. No one has asked for permanent Double attack... my proposed Melee increases would only let us hit a little more often, for a little more damage.. No double attack beyond Rabid Bear.  None.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Canabull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Shamans solo faster (and better) than druids.  Trust me, I've got a 51 druid main that I rarely play anymore except on raids while I'm leveling my shaman.  Sure, druids can outnuke shamans, and outheal shamans, and outport shamans, but that's about it.  I've become a port whore to my guild, as that is all I'm good for it seems.  Shamans get Malo, Torpor, decent pet, chain armor, stat buffs, and more ATK than druids, allowing them to do the unthinkable when EQ first came out...  SOLO DRAGONS.<br />
<br />
Druids only outnuke shamans at 54, with Scoriae, and before 49 my shaman buddy was outnuking me at almost every level.  Until Nature's Touch, Shamans and druids heal the same, with shamans actually having an edge at some levels through the regen line of spells.  JBB is broke, and for the iksar who can't use it, I do feel for you, but you got what, 15 more wis?  Not bad at all.<br />
<br />
IMO, no one can complain about their abilities in EQ, with the exception of the 7 caster classes.  Having to blow 5 minutes plus of med time because of a green mob that a warrior would crit and kill makes me sick sometimes.<br />
<br />
Why on earth is a warrior complaining about everyone else surviving longer?  Heck, I die on my druid to AOE before I get all my mana out on heal spells.<br />
<br />
Fact of the matter is that shamans, as of Kunark, were overpowered a little, and with Velious and Luclin VI has brought the rest of the classes up to par with the shaman.  Only one class has one gripe...  Warriors need AOE taunt...  too many times have I died because the puller brought back 3 mobs and 2 agg'd on me because I healed the warrior.<br />
<br />
Now VI is looking into stacking issues with dots, because groups with 2 shamans or druids or necros had a member that was, in a way, dead weight.  I don't see that at all, some people just need to learn how to play their classes (necros have reverse mana tap, fyi).<br />
<br />
Oh, by the way, Clerics got undead dots, one more nuke, and haven't recieved anything worthwhile in the way of healing spells since the game first went live.  Keep that in mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">with out us Shaman there wouldnt be no High end game .. would there? <br />
<br />
We are a powerful class, but that is a significant overstatement.  Without shamans, everyone would have 430 less hit points and mobs would be slowed by 70% rather than 75%.  Yeah, the slowers would die marginally more often (less and less all the time though<br />
<br />
Of course, no class is truly essential in the end game other than the Cleric.  They are the only one with a truly powerful and unique ability (2 of them, actually).<br />
<br />
As for soloing, yeah we are unmatched melee defensive soloers, which lets us (eventually) kill some big game.  The thing is, Everquest doesn't give XP for defense, it gives XP for offense.  It is balance.<br />
<br />
Once dot stacking goes live, we are pretty close to perfect balance.<br />
<br />
If you want to be a god at every aspect of the game, be a monk.  If everyone was as powerful as they are, the game would get much more boring very very quickly.</div></div><hr />

We can solo stuff like no other class, we can amplify the abilities of ourselves, our pets, our group in a ton of ways, we can debuff the crap out of the enemy, we can recover mana like no other class in the game, we can pinch-hit in many different roles, and we have some unique spells and AA abilities that are simply amazing.<br />
<br />
And yeah, our damage output is only so-so.<br />
<br />
I don't think that the end-game shaman needs any help at all.  I think the early shaman and mid-game shaman could probably use some help, though I haven't played one for a long time.  It was hell getting to my 40's, and I had not much to offer groups until then.<br />
<br />
I am not defined by my damage output.  If anything, I am defined by my ability to survive, and to assist my group/raid in surviving.<br />
<br />
Last night, pulling in fungus grove, doing the fungusbeasts in the back, a level 60 warrior asked me if I was 'expert' at pulling them, because he couldn't always get single pulls, and the groups would frequently wipe out on fungusbeasts.  I said, yeah, I'm an expert.  I then pulled, and my 3rd pull was a chain agro of 8 fungusbeasts.  Not once did anyone in the group get below 50 health, and I tanked 5 of them for a while.  And you whiners want more?<br />
<br />
Oh, and on group buffs, if you don't love em, you probably love tradeskills (click click click click click click click).  I'll cast group buffs even with just myself and my 2-boxed warrior, simply for the convenience!  Hell, I once cast Khura's Focusing on myself, solo, because I couldn't be bothered to find Focus in my spell book.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I'd have prefered that system too. Or, make it possible to drop AA skills by a quest or something so you can earn new points and change skills. With the current system everyone just aims at 100+ aa points and everyone of a certain class becomes more powerful in the same way. It's basically the same as adding a couple levels, which they said they wouldn't do because that would break the balance of highend encounters. But this is doing just that.</div></div><hr />

One of my best friends in EQ plays a shaman too. And what really hurts is that we barely play in thew same group because of what you said. Get 1 Shaman into a XP group, you won't need another. Sure I can heal or throw some Cripple at mobs .. or just speed myself and beat the hell out of mobs (rofl, You try to hit XXX, but you miss !).<br />
That stacking issue is the same with raids, just it is nice to have another shaman ready if the first dies before doing the job (eq. Slow).<br />
And the new DOT stacking ... if they don't increase the number of buff slots on mobs, we all have to go for 3-4 dispels before starting debufs just to get more slots free.<br />

With out those there would be no high end content.  With out other things like slow, life would be rough, but it would proceed.<br />
<br />
Back to the point though:<br />
<br />
. (The one I like) Raise our Offense, Defense, 1HB, 2HB and Piercing Caps to 225.  <br />
There were also refrenced to rabid bear, and double attack.<br />
<br />
To me, increasing our melee abilities isnt the direction I want to go in.  I think dot stacking is a real step in the right direction, the next progression is to reduce our aggro generated by such spells.  But the melee option is worth of persuit, if for no other reason it is an avenue we can persue when our dots fail (resistance, overaggro).<br />
<br />
I dont really care what our 1hb or Piercing caps are, as a class that cannot dual wield we will be using 2hb for melee damage.  I think the idea of 225 2hb is a great one, really.<br />
<br />
I also think that the next step would be to reduce the reuse time, and legnthen the duration of rabid bear to make it a truely useful ability.</div></div><hr />

The great thing about Shaman is that you can fit different roles as your whim strikes, the price you have to pay is that none of these different roles will fit perfectly in every situation, especially not if applied over the course of 60 levels.<br />

It is about balance, but we are not balanced in the DD department. In Kunark we did 0.5 x the damage of a wizard. While all classes progressed to SoL, we didn't. Today we do 0.1 x the damage of a wizard. This IS the problem. This needs to be balanced. I pulled those numbers out of my arse to illustrate a point, incase you wonder.<br />
<br />
Shamans never ment to be nukers BUT the gap between us AND other DD classes is growing too big. Soon, rangers will do more damage with DDs then us.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Im too lazy to compare our mana regeneration compared with the mana regeneration of other classes during the expansions now. But I have the slight feeling it skyrocketed in comparasation to other classes though (with Canni4 and Canni5, Torpor provided).<br />
<br />
At the same time our buffing duty became faster and less burdensome (equal strength group buffs, Focus Spell Line).<br />
<br />
Some slight increases in damage output (and different resistance checks to some) may well be in order, but it is untrue that Shaman were never upgraded during the expansions. Its just in more subtle ways, ways that most of us forget because they are second nature to us already.</div></div><hr />

I torrent Alot.  Probably as much or more than any shaman on the board. I do not raid much due to running a guild of 15 or so people.  But we do CT, tons of chardok, Maidens, Umbral plains minibosses, Howling stones, Aekva, Deep, Dragon Necropolis, Fungus caller quests, and every other low budget targets we can find.<br />
<br />
Sure you get resists on torrent. So? We always have mana. Toss another one. If stuff is dying in 30-45 seconds after engadgement then you dont even barely have time to epic.  (Or pull 5-6 like I do and ignore the first target cause it is gonna be dead soon.)<br />
<br />
Because I don't raid much I am getting Spell casting Fury 2.  Then depending on my whims I may get Natural Durability, or Spell casting Reinforcement 2. After that I am not decided yet.<br />
<br />
I belive on the Wizard board they tested Spell combat fury however and it came out to 14% chance of a crit with spell casting fury 3. And crit damage was x2 total damage. That is where I based my figure from. Since our rains are consecutively fast (as in the waves hit in streaks) Each time you cast the RNG may smile upon you or frown. So it will be flaky I am sure. But I am willing to get Spell casting fury 3 and see for myself.<br />
<br />
Maybe by then the whiners will have gotten shaman a new shiney 850 point nuke and Ill be doing close to 2 K crits with a mage bracer. (Laughs) But since I do over 2K now alot of the time with Torrent it isnt really a big deal to me. <br />
<br />
Our Damage upgrade for fast damage is in Crit hit ability. If you don't have the skill then you don't want it that badly. You would rather whine and get it handed to you. <br />
<br />
Spending 9 points on MGB when you can easily Suck down a few mod rods, Canna 5 twice and have a whole raid buffed in 4 minutes to me is silly. when for the same 9 points of conveniance you could have Spell casting fury 2 and Quick buff 1 (Or healing crit 1 and longer lasting food. (Mmm Grobb Liqufied Meat and Halas 10 pound meat pies.)<br />
<br />
Bah I don't even know why I bother. Keep on bitching about the nukes. Ill keep on with what I am doing and having fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">Enkebesh, you're preaching to the choir.... I'm in it.   If you want to be a healer, play a cleric.<br />
<br />
Orakul... you're comparing instant heals (chloroblast) that a druid also has.   How does that make us better?    Torpor is awesome, but it ain't going to save someone getting hit fast.   It takes time for it to heal.   A good ratio instant heal that druids have been choking for, might.<br />
<br />
But I don't want to preach about getting better heals.  I want us to do what shamans should be doing, and that is debuffing/curses.   That's how I envision a shaman.   <br />
<br />
I have hardly ever flamed people, but damn, I'm tired of people that just want to sit on their asses and say &quot;I love healing. That's all I want to do.&quot;   Most of the debuffs we have now, are &quot;one-casts&quot; except a few high-end incidents.   All I care about are some various curses that do different things that various shamans can cast on mobs.   DoT stacking will help some.   Doesn't this sound more fun?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">For those of you unable to grasp the speed of killing argument, let me offer an example--and no, the times are not exact.  Think OUT of the box a little.<br />
<br />
Shaman in FG.  Pull a shroom with slow.  Epic, Pox, Bane, Bane, Epic, and melee with pet.  The shroom will be dead in about 2-2.5 minutes.  This may be faster with JBB, but . . . hey!  Some of us don't get a JBB.  We get 15 extra wisdom (which is vitally important since some level 60 shaman are dropping to 180 wisdom or lower to increase hp/ac).  Again, for those of you pundits who espouse 'reroll then', it's not a valid argument.  Double over and blow youselves.<br />
<br />
So, let's look at a monk.  They can beat a shroom down in about a minute if they're decently equipped.<br />
<br />
Okay, so, you have to look at downtime some too.  A monk has mend and bandages.  We have canna.  Frankly, a monk with a fungi has as little downtime as a shaman.<br />
<br />
Ergo, a monk can get exp in FG twice as fast as a shaman.  When a shaman has 20 AA points, a monk has 40 AA points.<br />
<br />
Yes, clearly killing speed doesn't matter.  We should continue to kill at the same pace we have since kunark because we are so versitile.  &lt;sarcasm intended&gt;  The fact that all the other classes are killing faster is not a valid argument, because they can't take 30 minutes and solo Ydelma.<br />

To compare to our favorite other class, druids only had 1 dd upgrade with velious, and it was outdoor only.<br />
<br />
Saying we haven't gotten any damage upgrades since kunark is blatantly untrue. No 50+ damage upgrades perhaps, but then look at all the other things we got(ala group regrowth, focus, group resists(that stack with other resist buffs), bear forms, pet buff, group focus , plague of insects,  etc.<br />

Now in the mid 30 game you dont have the options that some of you higher peeps have but at my lvl to have 2 shammies is just an awesome damage output in a group.   Now follow me here we had a tank 2 rangers 2 shammies a druid and we where chain pulling 2 hill giants at a time in rathe the other day.  The other shammie and i just split duties up a bit and made sure that we both understood our jobs well.  I actually got bored it was so easy to do that i logged and went out to the bar lol.  Now as far as a shammie being unbalanced i would say that no we are very balanced even at lvl 36.  I have yet to get a character up to post 51 as i have only been playing for 5 months.  So the aa thing is still a mystery to me but if VI puts something in eq for the class to use just enjoy it or dont play the game.

Pull another while first, second, and third one beating on me. Ignore the others. Epic him also then Epic first one again. <br />

Break out Poisen Wind censer, and start swinging. Torpor when needed. Dot if I am pushing the 6 minute mark for  the first slow or Torrent on Mutt and get a quick 2K damage in on the four. Or bracer. or Go to the Barb spiritist hammer. <br />
<br />
Once they mostly dead Pull more. Redo a couple Buffs if fungus really camped. <br />
<br />
Shrooms are such a joke damage wise that my 1011 AC ass can ignore thier damage with a torpor or two. And when the mana free dot is ticking on 3-4 at a time and you have a 31 point damage sheild for them they do hit you (thanks 180 alchemy) it all comes together pretty well.<br />
<br />
Sure I get interrupts. Sure I get stunned and shroomed and Dirty looks from the single pullers. But So? It is fun. Good xp. And I get to meele.<br />
<br />
If I get a bard. Then we can clear 3-4 patches with little trouble before repops. 4-6 at a time.<br />
<br />
If I use My hotbox chanter and her little blender of doom pet then It goes alot faster than that. And can chain stun for added safety.<br />

Also duoing with a bard in Cappy in karnors + most of the rest of the courtyards with slow AE is a good way to pass an afternoon and get some decent xp as well. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">To drag this thread down a few levels (gaming levels that is) and throw in perspective from below:<br />
<br />
At 55 we're a tad more limited; no grp buffs beyond Bih'Li, no Torpor, and AAxp takes much longer to get.  Aside from Run3, there's not a single AA ability that called out &quot;get me NOW.&quot;  A system that was billed as promoting individuality and unique character skills has done almost everything BUT that, until now.   Rabid bear alone is a shining example of something that can allow true uniqueness--as opposed to &quot;eh, I'll get them in THIS order instead, that'll show 'em I'm unique!&quot;<br />
<br />
So they gave casters a better chance of not dying.  I agree, give the hybrids Channeling Focus.  They need it.<br />
<br />
Archetype abilities I wouldn't mind giving them:  None.  Likewise, I can see a way to use anything they have as an archetype.   Can't really see trading class-specific stuff, tho.   Somebody suggested a &quot;pool&quot; from which you have a limited # of choices.  Excellent idea.  And add to that the ability to improve some things like Rabid Bear and such.  Or versions that have different procs.  Or the ability to gain dual wield or double atk (capped at 100 or so) or to improve our offense/defense by 5, 10, 15 points.  If Bind Wounds is an example, there's a phenomenal amount of improvement in skills just getting from 200 to 201.<br />
<br />
But Shandy the Rabid Dual-wielding double-attacking Durable,  Stable (hah--me, stable...) and spell-casting Furious shaman would never be able to heal worth a tinkers' darn, and could kiss Spell Casting Mastery good-bye as she chose Combat Fury.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Besides. I like throwing my money away. You have too to get alchemy to 170 before luclin.  &lt;shudders&gt;<br />
<br />
The point is Shaman may suck at doing singular fast damage to an opponent. But we do not suck in <br />
<br />
Damage avoidance (I class Slow in this area 75% less damage means I can pull more), <br />
<br />
Healing (with torpor, Without torpor you better have a cleric that loves you)<br />
<br />
Sustained Damage (Epic, Bane, Pox, Plauge, E bolt, Scourge from a Blight hammer proc)<br />
<br />
Put those three together against a monster that has almost zero damage output. And it just makes sense to pull 4 of em and keep em all rotting at the same time. (I use the poisen Wind censer because with buffs and Voice I have 255 dex and that damn weapons procs like a firecracker.)<br />
<br />
Also I don't always push like that. sometimes I Pull singles and let mutt kill them and do the slower dot kills. (Chatting and such do take time) But when I want to burn, I burn bright.<br />

It is all based of location when you start casting, compared to location when you finish casting.<br />
<br />
When you are hit it generates a small amount of push. So you are moved a bit. The farther you are away from where you started is a harder roll to make for channeling skill. <br />
<br />
So When casting in combat And you are getting smacked around. MOVE up a little. You will channel so much easier. <br />
<br />
I proved this along time ago with my thief. Stand in a corner using a thief and a summoning bracer. Start summoning. Run around in a big loop and end up in the exact same spot as when you started casting the bracer. A thief with ZERO channeling skill will cast the spell. <br />
<br />
No matter how much damage you take. If you are in the EXACT same spot as when you started casting you wont even make a channeling check. If you are a little off then you have a simple check to make. <br />

Try it. Hybrids are having problems because they don't pay attention. (Too busy looking at damage numbers.:))<br />

What I don't agree with is people who say we HAVE to have a new nuke NOW NOW NOW!!<br />

I know that with my play style of multiple mob fights and Proccing weapons that I like Crit hits. It will not make me a powerhouse of nuking goodness, but it is an addition to my abilities. And it is fun to rattle off a torrent for 720 720 720 540. (I wish I took a screen shot, ah well)<br />
<br />
We are not a primary nuking class. We never have been. We never will be. Sorry, unless verant has lost all sense they should never let us have a casual nuke like that. We can do respectable damage, even amazing damage in a short burst if you focus all of your energy into doing it, but tossing off a 4 K nuke should be beyond us. <br />

(Of course a nice 4K critical hit Extended Affliction Dot would be really nice, but Verant won't listen to my idea of making spell casting fury effect the damage of dot's if you get a process.)<br />

For the records, I would like to have curses as well, I would see stackable curses as a great way to make Shaman stack on raids and not overpower Shaman in single groups.<br />
<br />
I dont want to be reduced to a one trick pony, though. And I dont care if that pony is named healing, damage dealing or debuffing. Maybe you misunderstood my focus. I started as a healer in my teens. And on the way to level 60 I discovered what else I can do. Now I heal, buff, debuff, Crowd Control, pull and deal damage (according to whom I group with and my whim of the day). And I dont know what of those I would want to give up just that I debuff a little better.<br />

Yes, debuffing is fun, so is everything else in our line of work. In my humble opinion of course. <br />

If you like using Torrent so much then you chose the WRONG AA skills to pursue.  Instead of pursuing a once-in-awhile eye candy crit on your torrent, you should have been focusing on the one skill guaranteed to help you actually CAST that cranky spell!  It's Spell Casting Mastery, it lowers fizzle rates dramatically, and on a spell like that you really need it!  I've been maxed evocation for over a year and I still couldn't reliably cast the dam thing without fizzling twice, three times in a row far far too often.  I got one level of SCM (5%) and the fizzle rate dropped by half.  I imagine it would just about disappear with 3 levels of that skill and you'd save a lot of mana per spell cast besides.  <br />
<br />
Also, quit comparing everything to Fungusgrove.  The shrooms there are 1) gimpy 2) unrepresentative of mobs in general, and 3) overcamped.  It's kinda like someone talking about mobs that drop loot and comparing everything to the Frenzy camp in LGuk.  Who even goes there anymore?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its just in more subtle ways, ways that most of us forget because they are second nature to us already. <br />
- Focus items affect all caster, critical nukes also. It won't shorten the ever growing gap between us and other casters.</div></div><hr />

In &quot;relative&quot; terms we gained a lot of power, More HP, faster hitting mobs in Luclin makes slow and dotting a better way to deal with them.<br />
And when you do the math and work on how to solo you will find that the only limiting factor is the amount of mobs you can find to kill, that is I have up to 8-10 at a time dotted and dying while a few try to hit me. It racks in XP way faster then most other classes can do. You just have to think outside the box, killing fast is not what we are good in, we are masters in killing a lot of mobs while staying alive and keeping our mana.<br />
<br />
Now when we are going to discuss raids it will be a whole different ballgame.</div></div><hr />

I so fail to see why some are speaking about a gap with the other casters.<br />
<br />
Pre Kunark: we do 10 DPS. Another class does 15 DPS.<br />
Kunark: we do 12 DPS. Another class does 18 DPS. Ratio is same or similar wich should be. Mobs are harder. Every class gets DPS upgrades.<br />
Velious: we do 12 DPS. Another class does 24 DPS. Ratio is NO LONGER the same. We are falling behind.<br />
Luclin: we do 12 DPS. Another class does 30 DPS. Ratio is even larger. Gap is even bigger.<br />
<br />
Again, I pulled numbers out of my arse to illustrate the point.<br />
<br />
Now let's not get into the we got Canni 4 and 5, and all this mumble jumble, mana regen for other casters has been ALSO increasing. Our is still the best, but the other classes are also gaining a lot of regen. Clarity (Pre Kunark) =&gt; C2 (Kunark) =&gt; C3 (SoL) =&gt; gather mana, bard song upgrades, Rod1 =&gt; God Rod, necro mana taps/transfers and so on.<br />
<br />
Hp for other casters increases also, resists too, skills too. It doesn't matter. All those changes affect ALL classes. My extra 200 HP won't make my BoN do more damage. <br />
<br />
And as I said, focus items, AA skills affect all casters.<br />
<br />
In &quot;relative&quot; terms we gained a lot of power, More HP, faster hitting mobs in Luclin makes slow and dotting a better way to deal with them.<br />
- a moss snake has resisted your Pox of Bertoxxulous spell! Slowing has nothing to do with DPS increase.<br />
<br />
Now when we are going to discuss raids it will be a whole different ballgame. <br />
- My post was on a raid perspective. I couldn't care less if a shaman is a solo machine. Getting us DD/DoT upgrades/fixes will only make shamans more stackable. And it's not like asking for CH or triple backstab.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">Only significant upgrade we have recieved in terms of spells, in the last two years, is Tuna &gt; Focus &gt; Group Focus.  Otherwise nothing.<br />
<br />
To say we &quot;gained&quot; power because they adjust mobs to a 2-year old spell is, well, just wrong.  We gained nothing.  No new debuffs, no new significant slows.  PoI is a PoS.<br />
<br />
Well, I take that back.  Two spells you can at least look twice at since Velious was released.  Group Focus and Chloroblast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">I'd like a new direct nuke, but I really can't say I loose a lot of sleep over it.  I find it annoying that clerics can nuke better than me from time to time, heh.<br />
<br />
Why don't  I use torrent very much?<br />
See attachment  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u109"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p109">If you only take damage spells into consideration, you are right Zorlac. Our damage capacities havent been upgraded, those of most other casters have. Happy now?<br />
<br />
The difference is that we can keep applied our dots non stop now, do our other duties and come out of the fight nearly FM, whereas the other casters are hard pressed to keep their dps over long periods of time. Mod Rods are an universal tool to keep casters stocked up on mana. Guess which spell keeps the casters healed most of the time while the cleric does the tankhealing? If available Shaman do that with Torpor.<br />
<br />
And Canni5/Torpor IS that powerful. Most of the Mana Regeneration capacities stack with our own. So its a unique uprade on top of all the other ones.<br />
<br />
And yes, lower resist checks for our dots would be in order. Every time a green mob resists my bane of nife I am on the edge of manicial laughter.</div></div><hr />

Ironically, that might be the one thing we do get.</div></div><hr />
