I have a lvl 36 bard that xp's here fairly regularly and imo, these mobs at seriously tough. The bard is pretty well equipped an I have found that I need to melee the owlbears because of the screech ( ranged stun attack ). Pretty easy to single pull and don't hit too hard. The Sonic wolves, must be kited because they will rip through me pretty quickly. If you decide to xp here, i would suggest root rotting owlbears and staying in range of the guards. If the wolves are in control of the zone, come back some other time.<br />

You may have better luck on the hoppers/stonegrabbers in Marus Seru.</div></div><hr />

To be honest, these mobs hit harder and give less XP than most 20-30 zones.  But, you will rarely have competition for mobs :D<br />
