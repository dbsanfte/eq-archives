<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm trying to come up with some numbers similar to ones I saw posted on this board long ago (before the wipe) regarding the relative benefits of Cannibalization versus simply sitting and medding.  The question has come up several times recently, so I'm trying to create a definitive answer.<br />
<br />
I'm a bit stuck because I can't find any numbers anywhere telling me how much mana you get back by meditating at various levels (assuming meditate skill is maxed per level).  I'm fairly sure it's 12 mana/tick sitting and 1 mana/tick standing at level 60, but level 24 is when we first get Cann and it's there that the &quot;edge&quot; of cannidancing gives you the most benefit.<br />
<br />
What I have so far:<br />
   At level 24: Cann I gives 20 mana for 50 health every 3.75 seconds (cast time + recast time).  A level 24 isn't going to chain-cast for long at that health cost, of course.  The ratio goes up from there so that at level 39, when we can cast Cann II, you're getting 23-24 mana for the same health hit.<br />
<br />
   Now, in addition to the direct health costs, chain canni will cost you your sitting health and mana regen.  For a non-regenerating race this costs you 1 health/tick and an unknown quantity of mana/tick (must be less than 11 since that's what a level 60 sees as the diff between sitting and standing).<br />
<br />
   Therefore, chain canni is by far faster than simple sit-and-med, but it has a very substantial health cost.  It still might be the method of choice if you're near full health and your partner/groupmate needs a heal RIGHT NOW.<br />
<br />
   On the other hand, cannidancing gives you one cannibalization per tick.  You get the full sitting health regen (2/tick or 4/tick for regen'ers) and mana regen (?/tick) plus the 20-24 mana from the cann (depending on your level).  The net cost is 48 health, or 46 for regen'ers, which can be mitigated further by using spell or item regen.<br />
<br />
   If you are lucky enough to have a horse, you'll get the sitting mana regen but not the sitting health regen.  In the grand scheme of things, the extra 1-2 points of health regen you get at that level are not that big a deal, but the ability to med while casting IS a big deal - you no longer have to time your canns.<br />
<br />
   By the time you get to level 60 with Cann IV, you're looking at 148 damage for 81 mana in 5.5 seconds.  The 3 extra HP/tick that a non-regen'er will get by sitting kind of pales by comparison.  The 11 extra mana/tick is more significant but still dwarfed by the Cannibalize mana.  Furthermore, if you have torpor, you'll get the health AND mana back faster by canni'ing down and torporing up rather than sitting.  It only takes a bit more than 2 cann IV's to pay for a torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The numbers you're looking for don't exist.  They're much too dependant on the Shaman in question.  Do you have Can V?  Do you only use Can IV?  Do you have SCRM?  Do you have any cost reducing equipment?  Do you have a horse?  Do you have Torpor?  Q?  Those are quite a few things to take into account when crunching numbers<br />
<br />
All of these will add up to one thing at your level: the only time you'll sit down is to change spells <br />
<br />
afternote:  since you have a lizard, all of these figures are kind of academic, sit AND CANN</div></div><hr />
