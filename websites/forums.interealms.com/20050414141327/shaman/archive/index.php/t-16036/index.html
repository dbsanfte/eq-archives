<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tat2demon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well with the lates EQ patch combined with my ultra crappy laptop I am unable to play.<br />
<br />
So Ive made a decision I need some help with.<br />
<br />
I want to build a decent gaming comp. SOmething that will last a while.  &quot;Hey thats great&quot; you say. :D Well I happen to be a computer retard. &quot;Hey thats not so great&quot; you say. :\<br />
<br />
I saw the other BYoC thread but I need more specific info.<br />
<br />
I need competent advice on how to go about doing this. Since I am not able to work I will be doing this one piece at a time. I want to get everything on line so need some good web sites to go to. I want this as inexpensive as possible but want to have a good machine afterwords.<br />
<br />
I need EXACT details on what I will need. Everything from processor and motherboard to wireing harnesses and everything else. I really dont know all the exact parts in a comp. And of course they will need to be compatible parts.<br />
<br />
I would like to keep it under $1500. Not including monitor, keyboard, mouse.<br />
<br />
Any and all good advice I can get would be great.<br />
<br />
Edit - Ok I checked around on Newegg and decided to do it right. I want to try staying below $2500.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Oh, you have a lot of reading to do, my friend!<br />
<br />
http://www.tomshardware.com<br />
Articles on what hardware to buy, which brands to stick with, etc.  On the left, under &quot;tom's guides&quot;, pull up some articles under &quot;PC's &amp; Howto&quot; -- step by steps on building your own.<br />
<br />
Now that you know what to buy...<br />
http://www.pricewatch.com<br />
Get some price ranges on your parts.  Not that I recommend actually buying this stuff mailorder.  Because totally reputable computer parts still go bad for no reason whatsoever.  <br />
<br />
Unless I'm feeling well and truly lucky, I'll still buy from my local http://www.micro3000.com/ because if something breaks, I waltz in with my receipt and the part, and walk out with a new one.  No argument, no paying for shipping, no 2 week wait.  What you're looking for is a little computer geek shop in a strip mall with 18 year olds behind the counter.  Hopefully they'll have a price sheet (bonus points if it's on their webpage).  All these guys do is buy PC parts in bulk and sell them for close to what the mail order places have to offer.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps, good luck!  The more you read, the less you'll spend on mistakes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ok, you will need<br />
case, w/ power supply, should be 350 watt minimum<br />
motherboard<br />
cpu, buy a retail version for the 3 year warranty<br />
memory, 1 GB min, that stuff is cheap now<br />
hard drive, get 7200 rpm 8 MB cache if you play a lot of EQ<br />
floppy, CD-rom (or burner)<br />
<br />
now, your first big choice is, which processor line.  I personally went for Intel lately after years of AMD, the price advantage of AMD for equal performance is gone and the Intel CPU's produce less heat and need less obnoxious fans<br />
Then you need to pick a motherboard, I usually suggest reading the latest reviews at Tom's Hardwareguide (http://www17.tomshardware.com/).  They also have a number of graphic card tests, again, you have to pick between to base choices, ATI or GeForce.<br />
Here is my current &quot;machine I build next when the old one pisses me off enough&quot;, $2200 w/out case, floppy and burner at newegg.<br />
It has 3.2 GHz cpu on top of the line motherboard, w/ a (0+1) very fast SATA raid array.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tat2demon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well Im getting a &quot;wish list&quot; put together and IM stuck on something. I see a lot of people recommending the Asus P4P800 Deluxe. From what I read it sounds good but what the heck is RAID and do I need 2 HD's for it? If I do which ones would I need? I see talk of RAID controlers and its confusing the hell out of me.<br />
<br />
Ive been reading so much I think Im having a brain melt down. Im sure Ill have some more questions though.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Raid is a form of &quot;improved&quot; data storage on multiple hard drives.  There is usually raid 0 and 1, one is striped (the data is written on both harddrives sequentially, leading to faster read and write performance), the other is mirrored (the same data is written to both harddrives, giving you an instant back-up).  Then there are other forms, usually requiring more drives (like 0+1, raid5, raid 1.5 etc).  It's something for the advanced user.<br />
Raid has it's own controller chip on the board, and it's own connectors too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tat2demon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well I have a decent list with what I believe is everything I need except monitor (can get a sweet one through stepmom). One thing Im wondering is if theres anything wrong with DX8 video cards now that DX9 is out.<br />
<br />
This is the list so far. Prices will be different on the final product. I will be looking at several places for these items.<br />

I really like the liquid cooled case but may end up going with a standard case to cut cost by quite a bit. Also may go with 1 Gig RAM at first instead of 2.<br />
<br />
If you see anything that is missing or should be changed let me know.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Very nice system, so the Asus board didn't cut quite as good a figure in the tests.  The Asus are very reliable, the warranty support is excellent, and very fogiving in the set-up I put about 20 Asus boards into machines over the last 3 years).<br />
Water cooled systems are nice, but unless you plan massive overclocking it's realy not necessary. And going past 200 MHz on the FSB will probably force you to use less aggressive memory clock settings, eliminating much of the speed advantage, unless you go to PC4000 modules. The P4s run very nice even with just the factory air cooler at &quot;regular&quot; speed settings. My 2.4 GHz P4 runs  it's fan at slowest speed even during the toughest raids. If you have money left over go for the 3.2 GHz processor intead of the 3.0 watercooled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tat2demon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok I changed some things. Different case (air cooled with 7 fans), 1 Gig RAM instead of 2, and took out 2 of the 4 HD's. 2 will be plenty for me right now and can always add the others later unless I must have 4 with the RAID system?<br />
<br />
I added a Logitech speaker system.<br />
<br />
With all that I cut the cost by almost $600. That should buy me a nice monitor.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tat2demon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Any thoughts on the Video card I chose?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I personally would go with a FX5900 card.  The machine you're building is pretty much the end of the line 32 bit machine, so I'd put a graphic card in in that can handle whatever comes in the next couple years.<br />
Going to 2 hard drives means you have to pick raid 0 or 1, speed or data security.  For a pure gaming machine I'd go striped.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If your gonna spend alot of money WAIT WAIT WAIT!!! Get an athlon64  comming out soon.  If you can't wait you can pick up an Opteron 100 series and an Asus SK8N motherboard (nforce 3) right now from newegg.com.<br />
<br />
Oh god, not again. Tomshardware are idiots.  Oh, Asus sucks balls too.  Someone said they have built 20 asus systems over 3 years. I have built 1500 amptron based systems in the last 3 years and there is no comparison on stability - amptron/ecs/pcchips kicks asus' ass.<br />
<br />
You can get a 1.4ghz opteron system for the same price as a p4 3ghz. You then need to get a beta copy of winxp x86-64 (not hard).  Running only 32bit windows won't give you any performance increase over an Athlon xp.<br />
<br />
BTW if your on a budget skip Intel. AMD cpus are VERY VERY cheap and damn fast. I run 5 amd systems right now.  Where do you spend money?<br />
<br />
Oh another thing. Audigy and audigy 2 sound cards are incompatible with Hyper-threading.   <br />
<br />
1. Video card. Go 9800pro (make sure its pro and not normal/se). ALOT cleaper than 5900's right now. <br />
<br />
2. Hard drive speed. Stripped (raid-0) raptors are the way to go.  KT600 boards now have sata built in so its not limited to intel chipsets anymore. Add a 5400rpm drive for data storage.<br />
<br />
3. Don't get a cheap power supply.  I personally not a fan of Antec but would say Kingwin or Sparkle or Enermax.<br />

Ok, what does &quot;stripped mean? And do I need a 3rd HD then?<br />
<br />
Also what are some more thoughts on AMD vs Intel? I really dont know the difference and see a lot of people talk about the -<br />

I mean, if I can get the same performance and stability for less cash thats the way Ill go, but I dont want something thats goin to take a dump on me either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">on the AMD vs. Intel debate, mosts tests have the recent P4's way ahead of the equally numbered (but running at much slower speed) AMD Athlons.<br />
AMD is currently starting to introduce their new Opteron processor series with 64 bit capability.  Since there aren't any 64 bit applications out there I would wait on that one for the time being, especially if you're looking for a gaming machine.<br />
I personally switched to Intel simply for the better heat management.  I have 3 machines running in my EQ set-up, I don't need all those 8000 rpm fans the high end AMDs need.  Intels run with 3000 rpm fans.<br />
Raid 0 means that your computer writes to 2 hard drives at the same time, very fast. When you look at your &quot;my computer&quot;, you will see only one partition, the 2 drives are combined into on. Unfortunately also not the most secure way of doing things, since a crash of one of the two drives will kill the data on both.  But with the 2 high quality drives you're looking at that should not be too much of an issue.  You can always add a cheap IDE hard drive as a 3rd drive and back-up your important documents to that drive.<br />
Asus makes very reliable motherboards, no questions asked.  Never used any of the high end MSI boards, so I can't comment on the one suggested above.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No offence, but this is just plain wrong.  In fact, high-end intel cpu's put out 20-30W more heat then high end AMD processors right now.  (103w for 3.2, 77w for 3200+) The new prescotts comming out are going to dissapate well over 100W !!!<br />
<br />
All the boxed cpu fans from both intel and amd are pretty darn quiet these days with the high-end ones thermally controlled.  There are more than adequete 3rd party solutions that are ultra-quiet for both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well not sure if some one gave you good link to a Online store thats has nice track record and most likely have everything your looking for.  Will save you ton in shipping costs.  Alot those places out there make a good bit of thier profit on the shipping cost.  <br />
<br />
http://www.newegg.com <br />
<br />
I've order from them on 3 different occasions and so have couple of my friends.  They're fast organized and have good prices.  I didnt feel they were over priced on thier shipping either.  When I go make my next upgrade they are the ones I will be looking at first for what I want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tat2demon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yeah thats the first place I went. Everyone says to buy through pricewatch and stuff for better prices, but so far newegg has the same prices and their track record for the best customer service is outstanding. I ordered some of the parts yesterday and should have them in the next day or two. Ill spend the extra couple dollars for good service. You can also buy an extended warranty through them for a few bucks. Example - The motherboard has a 3 year warranty, well for 5 bucks I got another year through newegg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tat2demon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well the case and the extra fan I ordered arrived today. The case came with a PSU. I was wondering if the PSU can be powerd up by itself (to test the fans and light), or does it need to be hooked up to the mother board? I dont want to do anything to it till I know for sure. I dont want to mess anything up.<br />
