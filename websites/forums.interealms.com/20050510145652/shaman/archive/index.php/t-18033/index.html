Started this topic on &quot;rating the expansions topic&quot; http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=17960<br />
but it was a shameful hijack so here goes. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Favorites:<br />
Old World - Mistmoore, Blackburrow, CT <br />
<br />
Kunark - Dalnir, Kaesora, Droga, Chardok (probably spent more time in those dungeons levelling up than anywhere else.  One way design kept kaesora and Droga relatively empty which was great for my group that liked to actually crawl the zones, same with Chardok pre-revamp empty and crawlable.  Post Re-vamp it was still damn good xp and fun though.)<br />
<br />
Velious - ToV for raiding.  Raided there mostly, avoided it like the plague outside of raiding though.<br />
<br />
Luclin - The Deep for the invisible bridge if nothing else. :D<br />
<br />
PoP - PoWater xp group.  Challenging, good xp/loot.  Uncrowded.  Win!<br />
<br />
LoY - Who cared?<br />
<br />
LDoN - there's a difference from one to the next? :p<br />
<br />
<br />
WORST ZONES:<br />
<br />
Old World - Fay-Mart and EC.  Morons that put auctions in OOC to make it harder to avoid their spam. :/<br />
<br />
Kunark - OT, DL, KC (havens for idiots and generally boring zones)<br />
<br />
Velious - Velks (see above comments.)<br />
<br />
Luclin - ME and UP.  Outdoor zones attract the worst elements. :p<br />
<br />
PoP - PoWater raids.  60+ people in small areas underwater is bad.<br />
<br />
LoY - waste of an 'extension'<br />
<br />
LDoN - There's a difference from one to the next? :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Favorites:<br />
Old World - Lower Guk. What a dungeon should be.<br />
<br />
Kunark - City of Mist, Sebilis. CoM is to this day one of the best themed zones in the game.<br />
<br />
Velious - EW, Skyshrine, Western Wastes, ToV, DN (DN's theme is awesome).<br />
<br />
Luclin - Umbral Plains, because it's always been a challenging zone. Akheva<br />
<br />
PoP - Tactics. Rallos Zek is the biggest badass in EQ. PoK ought to be on the list for travel but the spam drives me crazy.<br />
<br />
LDoN - I enjoy Miragul's theme and the Rujark orcs are very cool-looking.<br />
<br />
<br />
WORST ZONES:<br />
<br />
Old World - GFay, THE KARANAS!<br />
<br />
Kunark - OT, DL, Kaesora, Dalnir. The latter two are great dungeons that were wasted.<br />
<br />
Velious - Cobalt Scar. $^#@ing othmir. SG cause underwater zones suck, and getting charmed sucks. Putting them together is really bad.<br />
<br />
Luclin - DSP, Maiden's, Acrylia <br />
<br />
PoP - PoWater, anything above Tactics really. Zerg = Suck<br />
<br />
LDoN - The idea of &quot;sand elves&quot; is just stupid.<br />
<br />
I've had LoY for a month now and still haven't visited it. :|</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>NipperRipper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Favorites:<br />
Old World - Lower Guk (when there would be 80 people there and the mob repop time was 40 minutes), Mistmoore (train central but it was so challenging to get deep in the zone), Runnyeye (lotsa areas in here people never see)<br />
<br />
Kunark - Sebilis (Lower Guk part 2), Howling Stones (took months for this to become a common hunting place)<br />
<br />
Velious - Skyshrine (being KOS and fighting all the way to Yelinak was fun), PoM (most unique zone in the game)<br />
<br />
Luclin - none<br />
<br />
PoP - PoFire (level 68 mobs that don't summon rule), PoTorment (hey I like the music)<br />
<br />
Least Favorite:<br />
Old World - Highpass (100 people trying to camp 5 orcs)<br />
<br />
Kunark - Karnors (train central and it screws up faction for evil people), Firona Vie tunnel (damn SoW speed mobs casting on you)<br />
<br />
Velious - PoG (boring looking zone and even more boring to play in there)<br />
<br />
Luclin - ME (yay I love fighting wimpy blue mobs to camp a shard that drops every 8 hours)<br />
<br />
PoP - BoT (it was fun before it was opened to everyone, now its the new Karnors), PoJ (62 shm lf trials group plz, for 3 weeks straight)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Old World - Lower Guk, Sol B (Efreeti was a pretty decent crawl back in the day, and fire giants was an awesome encounter).  Mistmoore was the neatest outdoor encounter bar none, you really had to be on top of your game to get in deep and not wipe.  Permafrost, excellent dungeon.  Cazic, decent outdoor dungeon.<br />
<br />
Kunark - Sebilis (towards end though only shroom--&gt;Jugg run was viable), Howling Stones (Best dungeon, EVER), Chardok, CoM.  Never did much in the other dungeons because I was too high a level by the time we got done with CoM.  But they were pretty nice.  Best expansion, EVER.<br />
<br />
Velious - Velious was kind of flat.  Velks was decent until they revamped it and all the newbs came.  Sirens was fun until you figured out how small it was.  Same with DN, the place just looked huge, but it was really small and simple.  The HoT was neat for a weak until you figured out that it was a very simple maze with very few mobs in it.<br />
<br />
Luclin - 2nd Worst expansion ever.  Every dungeon was horribly done.<br />
<br />
PoP - Worst expansion ever.  I hope the dumbass who made pop gets bitten by his mother when she runs out from under the porch.<br />
<br />
Least Favorite:<br />
Old World - Don't have one.  Most old world zones served a decent purpose.<br />
<br />
Kunark - Karnors castle, lamest zone ever.  Dreadlands and LOIO, what were they thinking?!?!<br />
<br />
Velious - Kael, Skyshrine, WW.  The myriad of Dreadlands 2.0 zones that they added for the gimps to play in.<br />
<br />
Luclin - The myriad of Dreadlands 3.0 zones that they added for the gimps to play in.<br />
<br />
PoP - The myriad of Dreadlands 9.0 zones that they added for the gimps to play in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Kaesora's layout is crappy at spots but is very well done thematically, I think.  It rivals CoM.<br />
<br />
Blackburrow is one of my all time favorites.  We used to have so much fun in that dungeon in the early days of EQ.  This is the kind of dungeon that would really rock if instanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I see everyone dump on LoY... why? I liked the pirate theme of it. Torgian mines had a definate Goonies/Temple of Doom feel to it... in particular the lava bridge. The idea of named mobs popping from corpses is really good. It encourages crawls vs camping, since in a crawl, you tend to screw yourself since all you do is clear ph's for people following you. Theres some good loot for the level in those zones. The only thing I dislike is the hp of the mobs are too big.... kind of the anti pop. Plus the models for Overlord Ngrub and Nadox are sweet. I would kill to have a troll that looked like them. Its not &quot;endgame&quot; but not everything needs to be, and coming right after pop was released, LoY gave a few interesting zones.<br />
<br />
Kunark - UGH. I hated kunark for soooo long. I remember months of going there with people to some ass end of no where (Dalnir or whatever) only to have somoene go ld, and another need to go. Grats waste of time. Only with pop books is it bearable to me. Got to say, chardok halls of betrayal, veksar and droga 2.0 have been fun, at least loot wise.<br />
<br />
Old World - Fave: Upper Guk: Got my dungeoning start here, all I can say :)  Least favorite: Karanas - lootless runs killign animals or bird men. Whoopty crap.<br />
<br />
Velious - never played a lot here. I quit eq shortly after it came out, so missed a lot of velious raid stuff. (I restarted about POP) I played a bit in the ToFS, which I found very enjoyable, with its themed levels. Not sure what zone is my least favorite... perhaps Eastern wastes with all the whining at the rygorr fort.<br />
<br />
Luclin - Favorite: Ssra. Good loot, failry good fights. Moreover, no long ass clears. Least Fave: VT. I love the loot. I'm fine with the clears. The key isnt hard like people say. I hate how the zone works. Any zone specifically designed to be handed to euros sucks. My server resets non stop... we busted our asses to get into VT, and havent seen it in forever, since by the time any US players get off work, its cleared. Our euro guild averages 3 clears a week since the gms reset it for them whenever they want.<br />
<br />
PoP - Favorite: ummm.... none? Tactics I guess. Fast aa at least. I enjoy the Rallos event. Havent gone to the elemental planes, since I am waiting on my girlfriend (she needs agnarr... ugh) so cant comment. Least - take your pick. Single pull and lootless. So exciting. zzzzzzz<br />
<br />
LDON - I liked ruj, especially the wind bridge sub zone. Tak also, since I dont need a chanter to mez if we get a few too many adds. Hate guk theme, since I travel with a ranger. Root cc hard here. Just annoying in general. Miraguls hurts my eyes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Runnyeye back in the day.  Those messages scared the hell out of me.<br />
Tactics - I love Tactics.  It was great to group in and it's still fun as hell to solo in.  I died atleast 10 times trying to figure out how to single pull the piglet.<br />
Lower Guk - I loved this zone.  It was seriously uber back in the day and now it's like a joke zone people AE for a crappy wood elf hat.<br />
Howling Stones - I didn't get to experience it back in the day when it was super popular.  But one of my favorite zones.<br />
Dalnir - I can't explain it.  <br />
Pretty much all of Kunark.  This is still by far the best expansion that was ever put out.<br />
<br />
Worst<br />
<br />
Bastion of Thunder - when it got more populated.  Actually it's not too bad of a zone but towards the start of PoP it used to be such a nice place to exp without having to worry about people who sucked at Everquest.  <br />
Vex Thal - I've seen it break up 2 guilds.  It is by far the worst zone ever created.<br />
Ssra - For non raiding, key camping, it should have more random nameds that drop some kind of twink loot.  It would make life so much better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Like:<br />
Everfrost, I was born there, and if im lucky the will bury me there when I die.<br />
Eruds Crossing - Pina Coladas anyone?<br />
Basicly all of outdoor and most of indoor Kunark, because its beautiful and varied.<br />
Great Divide - it aint everfrost but its still a fun zone with varied content.<br />
I was quite stunned with Hollowshade Moor also with the odd trees, bridges and paths.<br />
The Karanas back in the days when they represented distance and adventure to cross.<br />
<br />
Dislike:<br />
Nexus -  Wich was is bazaar now?<br />
Mons Lethalis -  It took me months to figure out the easiest path to the Grey and Ssra.<br />
Maidens Eye - Train this way, that way or both?<br />
Greater Faydark - Wonderful place but the crowd...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Velious likes:  Crystal Caverns, Tower of Frozen Shadow.<br />

Luclin dislikes:  Shadeweaver's Thicket = 1001 deathtraps for the unwary and uninformed midlevel character.  Famous last words:  &quot;How bad can this zone be?  It's the Vah Shir newbie yard.  Hail, Jynhadar.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Favorites:<br />
<br />
Old World:  Splitpaw (was most fun when you tried to crawl through it instead of just camping a spot), Unrest (soft spot because i met the people I formed a guild with there)<br />
<br />
Kunark: sadly i didn't spend much time in Kunark until i was in the 40's but droga has been fun since the revamp as has Nurga.  Veksar has quickly become a favorite zone of mine.  Good exp even in the 60's and nice drops.  The look of the mobs and the zone itself is great.<br />
<br />
Velious: Tower of Frozen Shadows... a challenge for the right levels.  Great Divide, not the whole zone just the Tizmak Tunnels was great spot for the 30ish group.<br />
<br />
Luclin: Shadeweavers... best newbie zone in the game with enough level variance to have fun for a good while.  Still haven't done much on the far side of the tunnels.  DSP was good to me as I almost maxed Def there soloing zelniaks.<br />
<br />
PoP:  not flagged so have only been to the planes open to players 62 and down.  Halls of Honor has a cool look to it.  The mobs in CoD were also neat.  PoS frogs look cool as well.<br />
<br />
LoY: I was right in the &quot;level range&quot; when LoY came out so I found great use in it.  I like Dulak and Nadox quite a bit.  Expanded bank slots and Stoicism were worth it for me<br />
<br />
LDoN: i like the mobs in the Everfrost theme, the big decaying mammoth looking mob is really cool.<br />
<br />
<br />
Worst Zones:<br />
<br />
Old World: HHK... a waiting list for groups is a bad sign, Gfay, Lfay<br />
<br />
Kunark: DreadLands... ick.  KC was rarely visited but not as bad as it's reputation (for me at least)<br />
<br />
Velious: Velks... again not as bad as advertized but the ice ramps were hell.  <br />
<br />
Luclin: PC... the best xp in the game breeds the worst in people.  Even nice people that were &quot;respectful of camps&quot; in other zones don give a rats rear about it in PC.  The bandit camps are horrible.  However solo up to about 16ish i love the zone (the shadeweavers and hallowshade sides of the zone).  Lag on Luclin is still bad and has forced many to stay away from it.<br />
<br />
PoP: Never liked PoNightmare... <br />
<br />
LoY: Haven't been to Hate's Fury, only bad thing for me is getting there.<br />
<br />
LDoN: finding a group sucks when you don't have a cleric or chanter because the one never comes without the other... wimps!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Dalnir, Droga, and Kaesora were great dungeons that failed mainly due to fear of failure/CR.  <br />
<br />
Dalnir was actually a fairly popular place to level in your mid 20s to low 30s when I was at those levels early in kunark.  The XP was very nice and there were usually at least 3-4 groups of people camping the 1st and 2nd floors.  It was one way to an extent but not really a horrid place if you died to CR.  Invis could get you to most places.<br />
<br />
Droga was great xp and really well laid out to crawl through.  Again though, the one way nature meant that first time explorations needed either an evac class or someone who could invis and had a map/knowledge of the zone heh.  I drug 'raids' from the Soothsayer area to zone in before as a shaman with nothing but unreliable invis.  CRs kinda sucked but at least nothing saw invis.<br />
<br />
Kaesora was fun as hell to, once again, crawl.  But CRs absolutely sucked.  Mix of undead and live creatures made invising to drag near impossible, although I did do just that a few times with invis and itu potions and a fair bit of luck.  The other downfall of Kaesora was horrid pathing and pet poofing walls.  Still though, if you had a group that could get down to the library and crawled around that area, the xp was unbeatable at the time.  High Risk but High Reward available... IMO balanced out, but most people are chickens heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>taggletoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Antonica Favorites:<br />
Blackburrow, Runnyeye, Lower Guk - The dungeons I explored and died in with my earliest EQ friends.<br />
<br />
Antonica Nightmares:<br />
Befallen - I dislike keyed dungeons in general.  At level 10 with a curious halfling and an open well they just plain suck.<br />
<br />
Faydwer Favorites:<br />
Unrest and Mistmoore - Some of the funnest trains I've ever seen.<br />
<br />
Faydwer Nightmares:<br />
Kedge - Always thought an underwater zone sounded like the greatest thing in the world until I went there.<br />
Crushbone - I grew up in Blackburrow and found this zone not half as interesting.<br />
<br />
Odus Favorites:<br />
Warrens - Terrific dungeon after Blackburrow.<br />
The Hole(old version) - I remember one pull that a guildmate said lasted 27 minutes.  It started out as 2 golems and they just kept coming and coming.<br />
<br />
Odus Nightmares:<br />
Tox - I feel sorry for any Erudite that actually tried to level up in this waste of a zone.<br />
Kerra Island - This zone must have had a purpose at one time?  Am I missing something?  Some people don't even realize this is actually a zone.<br />
<br />
Kunark Favorites:<br />
Chardok, Sebilis, Kaesora - Great dungeons though CR's can be a pain.<br />
Veksar - honorable mention<br />
<br />
Kunark Nightmares:<br />
KC - Trains just weren't as fun as they used to be.<br />
<br />
Velious Favorites:<br />
Crystal Caverns and TOFS - A keyed dungeon gets a pass from me.<br />
<br />
Velious Nightmares:<br />
Siren's - I'm just glad evacuate takes you to Western Waste side.<br />
<br />
Luclin Favorites/Nightmares<br />
Are there any good dungeons in this expansion?  Not really any zones I hate either.  I hunt here only when a guildmember needs help or the guild is raiding.<br />
<br />
LoY Favorites:<br />
Nadox - Alot like Veksar though for slightly lower levels.<br />
<br />
LoY Nightmares:<br />
Hate's Fury - Pain in the ass to get to, pain in the ass CR if you wipe, pain in the ass quest to spawn the boss mob, and subpar loot.<br />
<br />
PoP Favorites/Nightmares:<br />
I don't think I've ever been so bored getting such fantastic experience.<br />
<br />
LDoN Favorites/Nightmares:<br />
I like this expansion for the simple fact I enjoy a good 6 person dungeon crawl.  Though none of these dungeons hold any of the mystique of a true dungeon.  What is the difference between the Frosted Halls and the Silent Gallery?<br />

Bad Old World Zones -- Steamfont (mino hero), Qey Hills, W and S Karana, HHP, Runneyeye (any dungeon with shamans made me mad), Permafrost, Oasis (100 players, 50 crocs), WC, Tox -- Crushbone is the clear winner here.  Trains galore.  Back when there wasn't a L25 around to derail a Crush train -- I used to fish in zone for the *** reactions.  Unrest -- trains not as often as Crush, but of a much better quality.  Always loved seeing 4 hags, the knight, and the hand at the zone in.<br />
<br />
Good Kunark -- Pretty much every dungeon I can think of off hand.<br />
<br />
Bad Kunark -- with the exception of KC.  Invaded by tons of L50s that had levelled exclusively on the FoB, LoIO, FM, OT, DL circut.  No clue whatsoever about how to play in a dungeon.  Luckily the learning curve isn't too hard and it's fixed easily, but there was always another dungeon newbie zoning in.  FoB, LoIO, FM, OT, DL for ease of levelling (risk/reward).<br />
<br />
Velious -- Never explored enough here to care<br />
Luclin -- Same<br />
PoP -- Same<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Old world<br />
Favorite zones:<br />
Everfrost...great newbie zone, confusing as hell but great way to learn eq<br />
South Karana...only zone I can remember that has ever left me with a sense of awe<br />
Cazic thule (before revamp)....great 30s leveling zone.  Plenty of camps and decent loot (at that time)<br />
Hated zones:<br />
Befallen...keyed dungeons at level 10 is so wrong.  voted worst newbie zone to die in<br />
Unrest...every time I have hunted here for xp I have died in one form or another<br />
Sol B....buggy zone+see invis mobs+small spaces+camp lists= PITA<br />
All other Karana zones<br />
<br />
Kunark<br />
Favorite zone:<br />
Chardok...great zone before and after revamp.  decent loot table<br />
Charasis...by far best designed kunark zone.  key was a pain to get but it was worth it<br />
Dreadlands...first zone I hunted in following kunark's release.  Combine ruins are great eye candy and they area around there is rarely hunted<br />
Hated zones:<br />
LOIO... why people hunt here with one of the lowest xp modifiers in the game with crappy loot to boot is beyond me<br />
Overthere....see LOIO<br />
Karnors...for obvious reasons, even though the loot was decent at the time<br />
<br />
Velious<br />
Favorite zones:<br />
Tower of frozen shadow....never had the pleasure of hunting here for xp but I swear its one of the best designed dungeons sony ever created<br />
Velks lab...great zone design.  I got lucky and quit during the time that it became a cesspool<br />
ToV...Hey, I love killing dragons :)<br />
Kael... I love killing giants too<br />
Hated zones:<br />
Iceclad...BIG zone, too big for my tastes.  Besides I still have bad memories (and good ones) with Lodi<br />
PoG... I hate, hate, hate, hate, HATE PoG<br />
Sirens Grotto...ended up dying 3 or 4 times before I figured how to get to WW zone safely<br />
<br />
Luclin<br />
Favorite zones:<br />
Paludal caverns...yeah i know its the new Oasis, but its still the best way to get to 25.  and if you cant get into the bandit camps you can always hunt the fungi fiends.  Good zone to learn how to pull and deal with aggro issues<br />
Teneberous mountains....coterie are a pain but the other mobs are easy kills and decent xp.  If only the loot was as good<br />
Hated zones:<br />
Maidens eye...trains galore, mobs have WAY too many hps for their level.  Boring zone design<br />
SSra temple...beauiful looking zone but emp key+ VT shard camping nearly tore guild apart.  <br />
<br />
PoP<br />
Favorite zones:<br />
PoI.  First PoP I both grouped and soloed in.  Behemoth fight was a blast....literally<br />
Tactics... cool looking zone with one of the coolest looking bosses in the game... nuff said<br />
CoD... prior to flag requirement removal on this zone me and my guild used to tear through zone.  great xp pre 60<br />
<br />
Hated zones:<br />
PoJ:  After going through my trial to get entry to PoV/PoS I never set foot in this waste of a zone again<br />
All other tier 1 and 2 outdoor zones.....I got sick of OT and dreadlands when I was in my 40s, I do NOT want to experience the same crap again<br />
<br />
LoY<br />
Yeah, like I am going to waste $35 on more bank space, a playable race I have no desire to be, and only five zones that are a pain to get to an nobody goes to anymore<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">My favorite zone of all time is Kedge Keep. The mobs are very good looking (rehashed for plane of water), and the whole zone is just pretty to look at. Plus the challenge of underwater zone makes it fun to play in.  <br />
<br />
The one zone to this day I refuse to set foot in is Kaesora. Long story, but suffice it to say I had a really bad experience and will never go back !<br />
<br />
Second place is VT. Talk about mindless.  Not only is it a major PITA to get there but once you get in, it is only a repetitive slaughter of the same thing over and over. *yawn*</div></div><hr />

Favorites<br />
BlackBurrow - I absolutely loved this dungeon.  I've created several alts just to level them in BB.  What a great dungeon, I wish there were more like it.<br />
SplitPaw - Especially before the revamp.  Yes it was out of the way, but because of that there were very few people there.<br />
Worst<br />
Lower Guk - Great design for a dungeon, if there were a way to keep other people out it would be on my favorite list.  Since lguk was at one time the &quot;end game&quot;, everyone ended up here.  Constant bitching, shouting, whining, training, etc.  If only it could have been instanced...<br />
Sol A - Again, the people.  Not too bad of a layout, but the people ruined it.<br />
Fear - /twitch<br />
Air - Why should it take 2 days to raid this zone?  I'm sure it sounded like a great idea on paper, but in reality it was just slow and boring.<br />
<br />
Kunark<br />
Favorites<br />
City of Mist - What a great zone!  The locked door was kind of a pain, I wish they hadn't done that.  This zone was almost always empty and provided nice, peaceful entertainment.<br />
Timorous Deep - Raptors were the first time I had used root/rot since I had gotten my pet.  I remember soloing on one of the raptor islands when some wizard dropped his quad-kite on me as he ran to the spires.  I dragged all 5 raptors (my 1, his 4) over to the chessboard island and just lined them up on the beach.  Only used epic and JBB for dmg, all my mana was spent on keeping them rooted.  That felt great when the last one died!  Doesn't seem like much now, but things were different back then.<br />
Howling Stones - The first time I realized I could solo here I thought I had found heaven.  Almost always empty, and even when other folks were there they were always crawling.  This should have been the model for other zones.<br />
Honorable Mention<br />
Sebilis - A great zone, in spite of the locked door and the people.  Every moron I was trying to avoid was usually in Seb, but if you came with your own group it was a blast.  I made most of my EQ friendships in Seb.  It became even better after Velious, when everyone left.<br />
Worst<br />
Dreadlands - Was Al'Kabor some kind of a moron?  Why the heck did he put his portal so far out of the way?  I hated running across that zone all the time.  And the groups here...yikes.  This would have been a much better zone if KC (and the other zone lines) had been one-way.  Then maybe it might have been fun to hunt there instead of just mindless pulling.<br />
Karnor's Castle - A great layout for a dungeon, but it went all wrong.  It might have been a great dungeon if it were set up with one-way zones.  The constant whining and training was nearly unbearable.  Actually, it was.<br />
<br />
Velious<br />
Favorites<br />
Plane of Mischief - The original one, not the new crappy one.  Interesting layout, interesting mobs, almost never anyone there.  It made it tough to learn the zone solo, since I had to eat several exp deaths due to lack of available rezzes.  But it was soooo worth it!<br />
Kael - I love the layout of this zone.  Plenty of spots for groups to set up and keep away from each other.  Yes, many morons would fight over stupid corners in the arena, but what can you do?<br />
Western Wastes - A zone full of dragons!?!?  What a great idea!!  They should have made it easier to clear wanderers prior to engaging a dragon, other than that, great job!<br />
Worst<br />
Velk's - Good lord, how can I describe how much I detested this zone?  The only good thing was that I didn't have to go here often.  And when I did, I made sure to turn off /ooc and /shout.<br />
Iceclad - Why make the portal so dangerous?  It would have been simple to have the mobs path around the portal instead of through it.  Would have made it much more enjoyable.  And ***??  Pelzin just stole my turtle!!!<br />
<br />
Luclin<br />
Favorites<br />
Fungus Grove - 2 great concepts in this zone.  First, there were plenty of camps.  Training was hardly ever an issue since the camps were generally not on the way to the zone line.  Second, the caller quests were great!  If there was nothing going on you could always get some friends together and go do caller quests.  Not exactly an instanced dungeon, but pretty close.<br />
Sanctus Seru - I don't know why this zone was always empty.  I could go up top and solo around the hallway up there for as long as I liked and almost never see another soul.  Great exp, ok loot.  Only bad thing was most of those mobs were Pallys, so I had to kill them twice.<br />
Honorable Mention<br />
The Bazaar - Once the bazaar was fully functional it completely changed my EQ finances.  I hated selling things in GBay, the constant bickering and begging caused me to just give away anything I didn't use myself.  The bazaar generated hundreds of thousands of plat for me.<br />
Worst<br />
Vex Thall - I spent how many hours camping shards for this?  Intentional mob rarety is just not fun.<br />
Maiden's Eye - If you don't want to be trained, get the hell away from the zone line.  'Nuff said.<br />
<br />
Planes of Power<br />
Favorites<br />
Plane of Justince - Not the trials!  The basement makes a pretty decent place to get some nice quiet exp and a little loot.<br />
Valor - Was a nice place until Sony opened the doors.<br />
Earth - Rarely other folks there unless they are raiding.  Even so, this zone easily supports 3 or 4 exp groups.  Nice exp, nice loot, easy with less than a full group.<br />
Worst<br />
Nightmare - What a nightmare!  If you don't want people to enjoy a zone, just say so.<br />
Bastion of Thunder - See notes on LGuk, KC, Seb and Velk's.<br />
<br />
Legacy of Ykesha<br />
Uhh, there are zones here?  Blood of Nadox was nice, but was the only reason I ever went...that 1 time.<br />

These are my favourite zones, getting together with new people, trying a new dynamic, seeing which classes you can do it all with, okay so get you some trains - it adds to the risk, and can be exciting! XP without risk is boring!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Meryll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Favourites:<br />
<br />
Old World: Lower Guk, one of the best dungeon designs in game... though that may be a touch of nostalgia.. I hated the place when there were 70-100 people in there.<br />
<br />
Kunark: Chardok and CoM.<br />
<br />
Velious: Iceclad...but only because of the Gnome's ship =)<br />
<br />
Luclin: None really, some were fun like SSRA or Grieg's but none of them were outstanding.<br />
<br />
PoP: PoK because it's very convenient to have all those merchants, guildmasters, etc in one spot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Most hated:<br />
<br />
Old World: High hold pass... this may be hard for players who started after Kunark to understand but the KSing over the Mucktails (?) and named orcs, and just KSing for exp in general, was ugly... possibly the worst i've seen in game.<br />
<br />
Kunark: Karnor's... though I think it's a pretty fun design it was unfortunately always filled with F'wits =P<br />
<br />
Velious: Thurgadin, too many Dorfs!<br />
<br />
Luclin: Vex Thal, Candyland... as long as you didn't mind spending an evening killing 317 million mostly identical mobs in 500 mostly identical rooms.<br />
<br />
PoP: PoK because of the books, yep I know it was my favourite PoP zone too, and I love the convenience of the books but i've met players who can't get from Qeynos to Halas without using PoK.<br />
<br />
PoWater.. I just hate the place.</div></div><hr />

I still get all misty eyed and nostalgic when I hear [u]that music[/url]. Brings back very fond memories of when I looked at Norrath with &quot;new eyes&quot; and was in awe of it's majesty.<br />
<br />
Most hated zone: Lake of Ill Omen.<br />
<br />
I spent WAY too much time there leveling my Shaman and Druid on Bloodgills. Constant n00b arguments in shout or OOC. Sheesh!</div></div><hr />
