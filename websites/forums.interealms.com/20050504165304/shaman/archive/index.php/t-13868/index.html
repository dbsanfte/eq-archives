<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Newbie Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am starting a new char. This one I will want to lvl up very fast for twinking and such. Which will lvl faster? Shaman or Beastlord?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tolby Da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Either IMHO, I group and duo with 2 beasts on a daily basis. We Shaman are capable of soloing mobs a few lvls higher than they are at times because of our higher % slow's but for the most part your looking at a pretty even class comparison. A 56 beastlord can solo the mobs I can solo at lvl 54. <br />
<br />
Do you want to BE a pet class?<br />
Remeber though, beast spell line-up is always more than a few lvls behind a shaman.   Thier warder is a powerful presence though, it can take massive amounts of damage in comparison to shaman pets and deals massive amounts of damage with the buffs Beastlords get as well.  Without the warder beasts are very ineffieciant.  Without a pet a shaman is still very effiecient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Newbie Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So, are you saying a shammy lvls faster?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Twinked a BL will level faster to 50 IMHO.  untwinked and after 50 a shaman will level faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Newbie Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">this is untwinked, so u sayin shammy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">How fast they level depends on how much time and effort you are willing to put into the character. If you are serious about this new character and are willing to put in 5 or 6 hours a day then you could get either character , twinked or untwinked, to 51 in about a month.<br />
<br />
Remeber about exp penalites as well.  Frogs and Vah shir dont have an exp hit, but barbs (5% penalty), ogres (15% penalty), Trolls (20%) and iksar (also 20%) do.  That will affect your leveling speed, but not noticibly untill the late 40's and early 50's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think a BST will level faster simply cause they come into their power faster. it isnt untill 34ish that we start really becoming strong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, based on my somewhat limited exp with a BST I disagree.  Ive got a level 21 vahshir right now that was a pain in the ASS to level. <br />
<br />
I dropped about 3K into twinking him, just to see what the class was all about.  And in my opinion BSt just plain suck untill they get higher.<br />
<br />
Every time I turned around the poor creature was getting his tail handed to him by a blue exp mob, and try as he might the warder couldnt seem to to jack about it.<br />
<br />
Stripped him, sold the gear, and left the cat to nap on the front porch....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shammann65</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">BST &lt; SHM <br />
<br />
Why would you ever think about making anything other than a shaman? The fun factor we have in the high-end game is far more superior than any other class. When you level with a Beast Lord you will suffer from the Pet KSing your exp. If your planning on going all the way to 65 then a Shaman would be the funnest play imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>zensation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Before you make a character go with your main to the bazaar and look up bst usable martial weapons. lets check the money curve here.<br />
<br />
5pp.....100pp....1kpp...2kpp??......45kpp!!!!!!<br />
<br />
this is not a joke. the availability of some of there weapons are very lacking. Yes i know they can use other weapons but they skill cap at 200 which means after level 40ish your gonna need a h2h weapons or your not gonna kill anything. sadly i know this cause my roommate plays a bst and bitches about the price weekly. besides that they are alot of fun (as far as i can tell) they can beast (no pun intended) anything, solo like madmen, and have that really nice mana/hp regen buff later on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Both are really good classes.  Which character will level faster is entirely up to the way you intend to gain exp.  If you want to group, go shaman since shamans get groups like mad from about lvl 19 on.  And they only become more desirable for a group later on.  Frankly, having a shaman makes a group possible.  So it's cool being a shaman because you are a group unto yourself.  Just add other classes and season to taste!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">this is not a joke. the availability of some of there weapons are very lacking.

<br />
Not really... A BST wont run into a different cap with h2h and other skills until 51+... up until 50 all weapon skills are capped at 200 after which h2h goes inceases at +5 per level until 250 while the rest go at +3 per level until 225.<br />
<br />
I also found it hard to get some uber BST weapons as I am back playing casual with a BST twink.  I ended up going with some mid H2H weapons and bought him some great equipment for AC purposes since I made a Ogre.  But even the mid BST weapons have good ratios on them and such.  I just got him 22 and that seems to be the BST 35 lvl for shaman.  The 22 pet rocks and the ogre is just a plain ass kicker and I can easily take down reds in the old world.  With the little or no downtime it doesnt matter if the pet takes some of my xp as after each kill I am pretty much ready for the next and can go for a decent period of time before I have to rest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I vote Beastlord. They are easier to gear and their epic can be duo'd for 99% of it. A jade mace &amp; hand to hand weapon will carry you till the 50's easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Beast + Kei = fast leveling. When you can chain cast your pets without losing mana you can kill stuff many times over your own level. At 24 for example, I soloed a 35 with my beast. They'll make farming pretty easy as well.<br />
<br />
Of course, just like shaman, playing a superior race makes all the difference.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bedin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I just had to add this note. Sony changed pet exp quite a while ago. With the exception of charmed pets, the only time the pet (any pet) will take exp is if you or your grp dosn't do 1 pnt of dmg. So in short smack the mob once and you get full exp solo or grped. Sony had to make this change so pet class's could get groups reliably.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Newbie Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well, I started my troll shaman last night. I found a wonderful mob in the guild room. &quot;A rodent&quot; insta-respawn point. I just dinged lvl 4 and have a velium etched stone mace and a crude stein, along with 20pp left over.

Im glad someone said something.  I just started a BST on Stromm so I wouldnt twink him.  20 hours of playing later, he is level 22 and has some really decent equipment/weapons for a non-twink.  This character is so much fun to play I cant even begin to tell ya.  Yes shaman is fun, but im tired of the high end game and I want to beat stuff up!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I can't solo in pop for effective exp at all at 65 with what I'd consider better then average gear and all pop spells. <br />
<br />
My 65 BL guildmate racks in an AA in less then an hour soloing in valor. He can tank anything he wants with his slow with very little downtime and his dps is ungodly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'm a 55 shaman, and I have hunted with a 54 beastlord friend in the past and here's what I found.<br />
<br />
My BST friend seemed to be able to kill things quicker than I could, but I could go for longer than the beastlord could. Meaning she had to stop and med/heal up while I was ready to go in a minute or so after my fight, most times less.<br />
<br />
I also found out, beastlords are great for farming greenies. I've been in Droga lately trying to get stuff to increase my smithing skill, but the goblins just dont seem to die fast enough. Now with a beastlord I'm sure they'd die very quickly due to their nice pets.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I like both! In my opinion, which you choose is a question of preference. At the higher lvls both are very expensive to equip. Waning Lightning Katar cost 27k but Malo and Torpor also cost an arm and a leg so I think thing balance out in the cost department. The one thing I like about Beastlords is that I don't have to spend 15 mins buffing up my pet before going off and soloing. So I normaly solo my BST and group with my shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">bst &gt; *<br />
however you asked the question on a shaman board and you'll get shaman answers.. If you ask on a bst board you'll get bst answers.  <br />

I'd say flip a coin and have as much fun as ya can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Beastlord aren't all that good they suffer from the same complex druids do.<br />
<br />
For example druids have been said to be a lot of things but always second or third best at it.<br />
<br />
Beastlords are second best to shaman &quot;stat buffs&quot; there is no arguement with that.<br />
Beastlords have the third to second best pet in the game compared to the mage and necro pets.<br />
Beastlords have the third best % slow compared to shamans and enchanters.<br />
Beastlords don't have all that wonderous of a mind buff but it does stack for like what, nine more mana =-/<br />
Beastlords aren't as good at DPS compared to mages, rangers or rogues<br />
<br />
As for the soloing issue the only buffs that matter or have been shown to even have an effect on the shaman pet is:  Focus, Replenishment, and Swift like the Wind.<br />
<br />
Beastlords have like, what one less buff for their pet thats a pretty moot point when it comes to the speed of setting up to solo.<br />
<br />
And shamans DO solo better then beastlords.  And have far more form of soloing then a beastlord.<br />
<br />
Beastlords are as simple as this:  They are fun to melee and tank with to those who AREN'T use to it.<br />
<br />
There is always a class that can do a beastlord's function in group better than them.  And no matter what angle, approach or arguement others put up shamans in an exp group slow and stat buff for a better percent than any other class.  Its as simple as that.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
I don't agree beastlords do not solo better than Shamans.<br />
<br />
In the sense of taking damage you must take somethings into account.<br />
<br />
1.  Beastlord class is a leather wearing class... Shamans are a chain wearing class (thou yet both are described to absorb damage as well as a ranger regardless of the beastlords higher defense)<br />
<br />
2.  Shamans and Beastlords can achieve virtually the same amount in AC<br />
<br />
3.  Beastlords might have Block preventing a hit from the mob from time to time but they also recieve riposte damage from the mob because their method of fighting incorperates the NEED for attacking.  (Where as shaman chains JBB or cast dots or epic to damage)  MULTIPLE ripostes from a PoP mob for hits of 300 to 600 damage add up in one fight.<br />
<br />
4.  Shaman can heal themselves Much Much Much more effiecently and sometimes with Canni INDEFINATELY<br />
<br />
5.  Shamans slow better than beastlord even if slow is mitigated by the mob<br />
<br />
6.  Shamans can virtually, if they choose to, take zero damage by root rotting in PoP where as the beastlord does not have this option.  Beastlords don't even get root.  There are a lot of mobs that don't summon in PoP for exp.<br />
<br />
Finally, since a recent patch DoTs don't gain as much aggro and I have seen zero Beastlords &quot;pet Kiting&quot; in PoF.  Which makes me believe pet kiting is no longer an option for Beastlords, as an alternative way of fighting without taking damage.  Especially, since a beastlords pet inheritly over aggros on purpose for the beastlord so that he may step out of the fight at times.  <br />
<br />
The above numbered issues just deal with how a beastlords recieves &quot;DAMAGE&quot; compared to a shaman.<br />
<br />
Notice:<br />
I did not go into how beastlords don't get double attack til 61 and a bit of AA points.  Nor the fact a Beastlords ability to dual wield is also hindered to the point SoE found it necessary to give them an AA ability to also up that.  Beastlord main source of DD damage, their Ice spells have a HORRIBLE refresh rate.<br />
<br />
Again I state, that those who are glorifying the beastlord are the same that are possibly starting off for the first time as a class that does its damage through melee and coupled with seeing that they can also tank to a Degree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>serbaniaotic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">well, i duo a shm/bst combo<br />
<br />
shammy is at 61 doing aa, and bst is 58 and climbing.<br />
<br />
then only thing i'm missing is a good ensnare.  each within their own rights solo well, but together they are a killing machine.<br />
<br />
the way bst pet is design, it can tank add while shm/pet/bst take on main mob while i dot add.  <br />
<br />
cc isn't that necessary, since i will not allow myself to pull 3 mobs.  <br />
<br />
what the bst miss is uber buff, and shm is missing something to keep aggro while we dot<br />
<br />
i pull with slow on bst, then put on a dot to keep aggro, shammy slow, (cripple if mob is hitting hard), bon at 90 pct, jbb will ban wear off, back off the bst and torpor him to save mana, bst use 2 nukes when being torpor. root mob when they turn for death walk<br />
<br />
this might not be the bst duo, but i've yet to find another duo that will drop 2 4arms as fast as this combo.<br />

i dont think i'll be able to solo reds after 34ish, <br />
<br />
<br />
beast are also hybrids, so they suck in between new spells/pets. <br />
<br />
if you want a fast leveler, and like doing dmg, go with mage, <br />
their pets are the best in the game, and they level fast, and do some crazy dps. in the 65 game i would put dps as Rangers, Mages, Rogues,(very close) Monks/beasts. <br />
<br />
if you want something that solo's go shaman, or Necro, they are the very bests at soloing, and NOTHING can regen mana faster than shamans and Necros, my necro is 53, i solo in POD, <br />
<br />
btw, i put about 35k in gear on my beast, and only about 15k in gear on my shaman. my shaman still does better,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Stoane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I have a 55 barb shammy and a 31 vah bst, and the bst got to 31 far quicker than my shammy, almost exclusively by soloing and only a little bit twinked, so if you want fast leveling imho go for the bst.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Hemmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I think this comes down mainly to the role you want to be playing.  As mentioned, BST solo pretty well, but so do shaman.  I don't think gear is such an issue, especially with all the beast useable stuff dropping in LoY zones, seems like half the items there are tailormade to BSTs (either that or i got bad luck).<br />
<br />
Anyways, the way I see it, BSTs are primarily a damage dealing class, with some nice utility buffs and stop-gap abilities they can use when other classes aren't present.  Shaman, on the other hand, thrive on whittling opponents down and crippling their capacity to fight back while enhancing those around us.  I haven't played a high level BST but I think it's probably safe to say that a BST would out damage a shaman but shaman are better at certain things like buffing and slowing which make them very desirable for groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Alyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">The two classes are very different despite beastlords using shaman spell list as a base.  It's like comparing mages and beastlords, there are similarities, but totally different.  You keep asking which is &quot;best&quot; or &quot;fastest&quot; to level ... the answer to that is play the class you enjoy, because you'll stick with it longer and put more time in than if you don't.  Play both and get a feel, then stick with the one you enjoy.  Neither is inherently better or worse than the other over all, but the play styles are quite different.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First, a class is good or bad doesn't only judge by how good it solo. And being able to solo a red mob doesn't mean it's a better soloer. How long will it take for your shaman to kill that red mob at 36? When your beasty is 36 go kill some blue mobs, you'll find in the time your shaman kill that one red mob, your beastlord can kill 2 or 3 blue mob with his pet and yield more exp.<br />
<br />

<br />
Hmm, so what's wizzy? Chop liver? :)<br />
<br />
Compare mage and beastlord is hard, and the debate between which one is better can go on and on. I don't want to get into that. Let's just say both class have their strength and weakness. Yes mage do have more dps at 60s. But beastlord can slow, they can melee, they can crack and buff....<br />
<br />
if you want something that solo's go shaman, or Necro, they are the very bests at soloing, and NOTHING can regen mana faster than shamans and Necros, my necro is 53, i solo in POD,<br />
<br />
Actually, I never understand why people like to solo in a MMORPG. If all you want is killing stuffs by yourself, why not just buy a single player game, you have the whole world to conqure in there, all by yourself.  ;) <br />
<br />
Ok, back to the topic, Necro do solo better than Beastlord IMHO, but just like mage and breastlord, both class have their up and down. For one, Breastlord can solo as well as fit in group pretty well. While Necro hardly ever get group. <br />
<br />
Just want to say Beastlord is a great class and it's very fun to play with. Shaman is another great class, which I played and loved it for 65 levels. Let's stop comparing which class is better than the other and just have some fun. :)</div></div><hr />

If your not PL with a 2box setup there is always the ol Fungus staff that BST can use at 20 something I think... I forget when it works. Link: http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=10895<br />
<br />
There is also the more rare but basically the same Fungus Patch Hide Vest which is a fungi that BST can use but has a required level of 51.  Link: http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=28756 So soloing wise the BST can use the regen on the Fungi but not starting until 20s then not as a wearable item until 51. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I own a fungi staff and yes you can click off the Fungal Regrowth effect once again allowing your character to run at normal speed.  However, the Fungal Regrowth over writes sow as stated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Actually, I never understand why people like to solo in a MMORPG. If all you want is killing stuffs by yourself, why not just buy a single player game, you have the whole world to conqure in there, all by yourself.  ;) <br />

Because of the way SoE has programed the game a good solo person can easily get 2x+ the exp of a group. Theres a lot of people I know that hate to solo, but never take groups because the exp is too slow. I was in a group that was doing about an aa every 2.5 hours or so while listening to a druid charm soloing giants in PoS getting 1 every 45 min. <br />
<br />
I was always a big group person myself and believe that while everyone should be able to solo as an option (which some obviously can't) grouping should ALWAYS be better exp even if its just duo/trio. <br />
<br />
Too bad SoE will never fix this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My BL is leveling WAY faster then my shaman ever did but I think this is due to the new zones.  15 to 27 in Palaudal(sp) in on day was silly.   I did it in one day, solo.<br />
<br />
The one thing I notice is my DPS is greater then when I was a shm 32 (no pet yet).  <br />
<br />
All i can say is this. DPS wise Bst lord wins hands down.  Since I know how to play a Shaman I have had not problems with 'lower level &quot; shaman spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have fun with both but depends on the area you solo its easy to get up quick.  Also in crappy gear you can get level 50 in 5 days played.<br />
