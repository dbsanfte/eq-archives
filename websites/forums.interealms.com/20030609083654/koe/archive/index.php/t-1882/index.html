Being normally an evening player (7-10pm Central) with too much work time not enough play time, this week is out for me, but....<br />
<br />
Starting 7/21 or 7/22 around 5pm Central, I will be on vacation for a week :D   WooHoo!<br />
<br />
If you could use a 42 Chanter or a 40 Ranger, I'd love the chance to get to know more of you..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lantanamoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">hi y'all :). i saw this and i have only been in lguk a couple of times. 1 was to help a guildmate with a cr and the other was actually hunting with a few guildmates. we killed the ee and got a couple of bags and went in just a bit farther but not much. so i'm not that familiar with the area. i have a wweni my 34 warrior who might be a bit young for the zone but if y'all need her then i'd be more than happy to bring her. i also have a 37 chanter named iliumare. either way i'd love to join y'all. most times i'm on that i can stay on for a while and play is about 8pm central. if i know far enough in advance when y'all are going i can see about getting hubby to get the kids to bed and might can make it on about 7.</div></div><hr />
