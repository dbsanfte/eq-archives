<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heyas guys,<br />
<br />
I find myself in the position of trying to get 2 guilds allied with one another.  Both Enigmatic Council, and Deo Videtur are Family type guilds on Terris-Thule.  I have been with both, and since we both have between 10-15 people on nightly (level 55+, most 60+), I thought we could do some Raids to sort of &quot;jell&quot; together.  My question is, can 3-4 groups of 55+ do Vindi?<br />
<br />
We would have a 67 MT Either Warrior, Pally or SK.  Prolly 3 60+ clerics, 3 60+ shaman, and the rest filled out by the usual bag of nuts (rangers, druids, Necro's etc.)  I assume the answer is yes, but I thought that I had better check with the pro's before I followed this Path.  Thanks for the advice, and if anyone has any other suggestions for &quot;jelling&quot; an alliance, please let me know  :D  :D .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have seen Vindi 1.5-grouped (9 people) with all non-EP level people, and this was pre-OoW. I got the BP on my 56 Paladin, heh. They did Statue too, and probably would have done AoW if their 2 chanters didnt have to log. <br />
<br />
I big key is the right DPS mix. Chanters charming Giants, rogues, and a mage is nice too for a big, fat DS and a good melee pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hail,<br />
<br />
Three clerics &amp; an 8k tank plus assorted DPS with those kind of numbers should take down Vindi just fine.  I'd STRONGLY recommend you use a monk (just one is fine) or a Vindi-experienced pull team if your force isn't used to Vindi raids to make things smoother.  I've had to pull Vindi as a shaman (!) and managed it, but I wouldn't recommend it to you.<br />
<br />
Positioning &amp; aggro control are the keys.  Keep your tank in a corner &amp; pin Vindi there (facing your tank &amp; the corner).  If you use DC pets for extra DPS, make sure you refresh their attack buff that has an illusion to reduce confusion.  Assign an ench (even a sub60 one ought to be okay) to mez any trash guard adds that occur.  I wouldn't bother with regular charms honestly.<br />
<br />
Grieg is another good mob for breaking in an alliance to raiding, as is the million hp blob in Cazic Thule.  Both can easily be done with a mixed bag of 3 groups.  Three clerics + a tank &amp; miscellaneous DPS can do ALOT of old content for fun.  Dain, Dozekar, Aary maybe, etc.  WW dragons can be lots of fun (without much danger of a wipe, though people are bound to die) for a night of raiding, and for the sub60 crowd would probably offer upgrades to those in poor equipment (alternatively the drops make pretty good low-level twink gear).  <br />
<br />
PoP events like Mujakr, Hedge, the Spider Queen, Aramin, etc can also be used as ice-breaker raids.  Prototypes in PoI are easily downed with 3 groups of under 65's, and Xanamech might be a nice test as well (that can be daily until it is smooth if your folks have the patience).  BoT towers could be done easily also using certain strategies.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Percent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just last weekend I was in a quick pick-up &quot;raid&quot; on Vindi with less than 2 full groups.  We had a lvl 70 tank with approx 10k hp, myself and another shaman, 2 clerics, 1 druid, 2 monks, 1 ranger and a mage all around mid-60s except tank (I think that was all).  Simple strategy, pulled Vindi + his 2 guards.  Tank took Vindi and I off-tanked the 2 guards (fully slowable and used Blood of Saryrn to ensure aggro).  The 2 clerics kept the warrior alive and the druid helped keep me healed while I got the guards slowed.  Only 2 deaths.  Ranger early on pull and the Warrior when Vindi was at 0% health (1 second too late on the heal).  From your levels and numbers I'd say he would be a target that would be doable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The short answer is yes. A level 67 tank should be able to hold aggro and 3 level 60+ clerics should be able to maintain a CH rotation on the MT (use an additional druid or 2 in your CH cycle if you are in any doubt). Your other main tanks should be the rampage tanks, and any spare druids or shaman should be tasked to heal rampage damage. If you are worried about your clerics going OoM, you can always task necros to twictch mana to them.<br />
<br />
It is important to note that rampage,if I recall correctly, works on the basis of the order in which you enter the aggro list, so that the order in which you engage Vindi is important. I.e. Let MT aggro and build up a bit of aggro, then let your next best 2 tanks aggro as &quot;rampage tanks&quot; then let everyone else come to the party.<br />
<br />
Vindi is best pulled to a corner so the tank backs right into the corner and holds aggro, allowing everyone else to attack from behind. The safest strategy is to have your raid force situated at the bottom of the ramp to the arena, actually, just around the corner past the ramp to the arena. Clear all mobs in the area, clear mobs to Vindi. Stand your MT alone in the corner just to the left as you come down the ramp, with everyone else up the blind alley a ways to avoid aggroing. Have a FD puller bring Vindi and FD. Let tank aggro to pull vindi<br />
<br />
Vindi is a good fun mob, and is a good test of your ability to be organised. It is worth assigning a ranger or 2 to tank/kite any adds or respawns...and shaman should be able to slow any adds and keep the rangers alive</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've seen 5 people gank vindi before, he really isn't that hard with a good tank.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Frek - as I recall, Kael giants can't be mezzed. They root easy enough, though. Charm (regular) also works well enough. If you have a chanter on CC for adds, have them charm add to fight any other add. Root the one their pet is fighting. A 65 chanter won't have a problem with dieing from charm breaks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">me and a mate, bith 3 boxing, have killed vindi several times.  <br />
<br />
Me = 70 shaman, 68 Monk (splitter), 68 Chanter (with Dire Charmed giant)<br />
Mate = 66 Warrior (9K buffed), 68 Cleric, 66 Druid (with Dire Charmed wolf)<br />
<br />
It wasn't even a close fight.  tank got down to 40% life at one point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It is important to note that rampage,if I recall correctly, works on the basis of the order in which you enter the aggro list, so that the order in which you engage Vindi is important. I.e. Let MT aggro and build up a bit of aggro, then let your next best 2 tanks aggro as &quot;rampage tanks&quot; then let everyone else come to the party.<br />
<br />
There's a much easier way to set aggro than this: instead of having MT engage first, have the player you want to be your RT engage first. He only has to do a single hit of any sort to top the aggro list, and THEN have MT pull aggro off him using taunt, etc. That establishs your MT as the main aggro, and the RT as the one that gets rampaged.<br />
<br />
The best way to do it, if you can arrange it, is to just have your RT pull the mob. That sets him automatically. <br />
<br />
And then, of course, you have to keep the RT alive. Otherwise, rampage will go to whomever is next on the aggro list, unless you rez the RT. If you rez him, make sure its outside ramp range, or he'll go right to the top of the rampage list again, and get beatdown before you have a chance to buff him.<br />
<br />
In case that wasn't clear, here's an example: in Time, Tier 5, my guild pulls both CT and Bertox over to Rallos Zek's room to kill them. We use either a paladin or an SK as RT. So, guild assembles in RZ's room, and paladin goes down to the other end, and throws a stun at CT. This aggros CT, and sets the paladin at the top of the aggro list. <br />
<br />
Paladin then runs back to RZ's room, leading CT all the way. As soon as CT rounds the corner, the MT taunts the hell out of him, and backs into the corner, thus cornering the mob and taking over the position at the top of the aggro list, thus bumping the paladin down on aggro, but leaving him at the top of the rampage list. Our shaman are assigned as designated healers on the RT, so we keep him alive, while clerics proceed to heal the MT, and the god dies, and much &quot;phat lewt&quot; is obtained.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.<br />
