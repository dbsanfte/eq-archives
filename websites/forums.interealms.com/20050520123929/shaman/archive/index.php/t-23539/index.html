<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>legionnight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild has just recently reached Quarm. <br />
<br />
My question is this, Quarm is slowable, is he fully slowable?<br />
<br />
<br />
And Mitigation can someone point me in the direction of were to totally learn up on this?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nuggruk RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes he is slowable<br />
<br />
Needs to be redebuffed and reslowed everytime you knock a head off<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">To add to what Nuggruck said..<br />
<br />
Quarm is slowable, with Turgurs/Nihil/Grummus/etc.  And each time you chop one of his 4 heads off, he must be fully re-debuffed and reslowed. Each head pops off at 25%, so at 75%, 50% and 25% he will lose a head and requires reslow/re-malos/etc.<br />
<br />
As well, i *think* that he also loses an ae or 2 each time you lop off a head. Might be wrong, but last time I was around to wax him,I swear I was curing less ae's the closer he got to dying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Quarm is stripped of debuffs when heads are chopped off, but he retains his hatelist, so there's little chance of stealing aggro when reslowing at 75%, 50% and 25% :)<br />
<br />
And yeah, he does lose one AE for every head lost. Yay! I wish we could get a group version of RGC for that annoying Epoch Conviction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Balance works nice on him, if you have decent DPS it shouldnt wear off on its own, you'll lop off a head and it'll get removed for you.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, Blood of nadox is your friend. So are Abolish Poison potions from Kaesora. Regardless, you want to be with DPS, and have clerics and nukers hide around the corner, running out to nuke and running back in.<br />
<br />
We had some problems with quarm due to 1) Lower numbers and 2) Inefficient curing. Your groups should look something like this:<br />
<br />
1) Rogue<br />
2) Rogue<br />
3) Rogue<br />
4) Rogue<br />
5) Shaman<br />
6) Paladin<br />
<br />
then you stick with the rogues. Keep your group together so you can keep em all cured. Make similar groups for monks, rangers, BL, etc and STICK CLOSE to your groups. Keep 1 shaman (if you have one to spare) near casters to cure the  Curse, cause that's the only thing that actually goes through the wall.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, you want 1 sham in the MT group for nadox also. 4 Wars, a bard, and a Shaman.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It tickles me to no end how every time someone asks a simple question, get a simple answer with a little bit of background (i.e. need to redebuff after heads go bye-bye), and you get five or six more people delving into elite strategies complete with group make-ups.<br />
<br />
We get it -- you know everything.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps they were just being nice and sharing their experiences to help Legionnight out?<br />
<br />
I dunno.<br />

What ever happened to actually casting slow on a mob to find out if it was slowable? <br />
<br />
It gets out of hand. People think they're helping, and all they do is spoil the game for others.  Mentioning the redebuff necessity after each head goes is part of learning the fight.  An unslowed Quarm can knock an non-defensive warrior out pretty soon, and the fight lasts more than 3 minutes.<br />
<br />
This place should just be renamed to &quot;The Shaman's Safehouse.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hehe.. you see what happened when the person asked the safehouse and the warrior boards for help on noqufiel??<br />
<br />
Safehouse (http://www.thesafehouse.org/viewtopic.php?t=14525) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ya seriously why do you have to ask stupid questions like this. Its not something thats really hard to find out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'll probably get a couple more neg bumps on this, but most people that post spoilers in response to questions like these are trying to prove they know what's going on.  The typical response when people shout down spoil-givers is:  &quot;C'mon guys it's just [quarm|AHR|AOW|Trakanon|Naggy]!  It's old content!&quot;<br />
<br />
Obviously not for the asker.<br />
<br />
It's something different, for me, when someone asks, &quot;Hey does this guy mitigate slow?&quot; here.  I mean, the Crucible isn't the safehouse.  Questions get answered around here because I (at least) get the sense that most people view this as a semi-amicable gathering of EverQuest shaman, not elite gathering of elite raiders raiding elite content elitely.  It's something else altogether when you break it down to fuggin' group composition for god's sake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>jeyche Deychundei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">that what i love about the cruicble, yu ask a basic question and that gets answered with no<br />
&quot;work it out yerself noob&quot;<br />
<br />
but i DO like it when yu get given background to the mob even if yu didnt ask for it, my friends usually ask me to pose questions for them as they all know that the shamans are the most helpful communities and yu will always get an answer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">People like to contribute, I think it's great.<br />
<br />
If you don't want to be spoiled on the Quarm fight -maybe you shouldn't read threads titled &quot;Quarm?&quot; Chances are, people aren't just going to talk about how cool he looks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>legionnight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Thanks all for the help. As of lately my shaman has become a bot, since in time the only place to slow is P1-3, was just curious as to if Quarm was because a monk mentioned it on our boards. Sadly seeing him probably isn't but another month away.<br />
<br />
No I don't want spoilers or leet strats, I asked a simple question LOL. <br />
<br />
To answer jzak's question, mudflation, Large the Mystic on Luclin explained it so well once :P</div></div><hr />
