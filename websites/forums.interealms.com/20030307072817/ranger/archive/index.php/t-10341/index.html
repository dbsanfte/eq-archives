<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vectors</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After taking almost a year off from EQ, I have come back to find a bunch of new spells.  Must admit I am a bit unclear on all the new ones.<br />
<br />
At 51 this is what I normally buff with if Soloing, Duo'ing:<br />
Wolf Form<br />
Call of Earth<br />
Feet like Cat<br />
Strength of Earth<br />
Spikecoat<br />
Skin Like Steel<br />
Natures Precision<br />
<br />
Then just before pulling:<br />
Call of Sky<br />
Sheild of Brambles<br />
Hawk Eye<br />
<br />
If in a group:<br />
Same as above, except:<br />
Force of Nature<br />
SoW<br />
<br />
I have yet to get Strength of Nature.  Is this an upgrade spell to something?<br />
<br />
So I guess my question is, what do you all buff with at this level, assuming there is no shammy, chanter, druid, etc around?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Velondra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">SoN is most notably an ATK boosting buff. I think its 30-40 atk? I believe it also has some other componants but it's been quite awhile and I dont remember them accurately. It doesnt stack with the Paladin hp buff line (BMB) but is definately a must have for youself and groups. Rogues especially clammor for this one. <br />
<br />
 Unfotunately I cant tell you what I would buff myself with at that level because I never bothered to buff myself with anything more than CoE and SoN. (/sigh) So I couldnt really give you accurately what stacks, etc.  I'm sure someone around The Glade can though!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">SoN is an ATK/HP buff.<br />
<br />
It will overwrite Nature's Precision.<br />
<br />
I see no problems with your buff lineup, though I'd not bother with the eye unless you're bow kiting.</div></div><hr />
