<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I&#8217;m working really hard on my shawl quests.  I had shawl 3 sitting in the bank for ages and decided to just push forward and do it.  During this last week I&#8217;ve gained shawls 4, 5 and 6.  I only need two more items to complete shawl 7, assuming I succeed on the combine.  I have a couple of friends that may be able to help me loot the two remaining items for shawl 7 in Siren&#8217;s Grotto, but I&#8217;ll most likely have to hunt for the Velium Hounds by myself for the 8th shawl.<br />
<br />
I was hoping to get a little advice from those who are knowledgeable about Siren&#8217;s Grotto and Western Wastes, as I&#8217;ve only caught a glance at both the one time I evaced through the zones.  I know where the entrance to SG is, but I&#8217;m assuming at this point that I&#8217;ll have to make the run through SG alone to get to WW.  Then I can bind there and use my spirit stone go get out.  Any advice on surviving a run through SG?  And any advice on the &#8220;dos&#8221; and &#8220;don&#8217;ts&#8221; of hunting hounds in WW?  I&#8217;ve read what I could find on the net but the hunting guides all seem to be written by rangers and druids.  Lacking track, I expect this to be a bit more challenging for me.<br />
<br />
Here&#8217;s a bit of information about me that might help.  I&#8217;m 62nd level.  I have my 61 puppy spell, Canni 5 and Torpor.  I have an EB item and I have good CoV faction.  I don&#8217;t have my epic.  And the only other AA skill I have is +30% bonus to my buff spells.  My gear is so so, leaving me about 30% health when I cast Canni 5 self buffed.  Hopefully this is enough to surviving hunting Velium Hounds long enough to complete my 8th shawl.<br />
<br />
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">SG run is really easy, I was doing it at 55 no problem.<br />
<br />
Zone in from CS, invis if you like (it won't do much good), and move to the edge of the water.<br />
<br />
Jump in, swim off to the left into the tunnel there.<br />
<br />
Keep swimming to the end and face UP and swim... you will swim up the waterfall.  Sometimes you end up way at the ceiling and fall back into the water :-)<br />
<br />
Get out of the water and re-invis if you have a chance (NOW it will do you some good).<br />
<br />
Find the little gold fish statue closest to the waterfall.  There's a tunnel just to the left of it; go in there.  Go as far as you can until you come to a 90 degree right turn.  You will now be heading due East.  Run to the end of that tunnel and take a left, you're now in WW.<br />
<br />
Once in WW - the biggest factor is whether you are KOS to CoV or not.  Check your CoV faction by porting in to Cobalt Scar and conning a Wyvern or Drake.  If you are NOT KOS, then killing the hounds is easy, I could do it pre-60 without difficulty.   Kill mastodons for profit while you're at it (just stay away from Tantor!)<br />
<br />
If you are KOS to CoV, you are in for a rough ride.  There are tons of wandering drakes.  Most do not see invis, but if you are fighting you'll be in trouble.  My suggestion: go kill at the arena or plate cycle in Kael until you are not KOS to CoV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">in ww the only things that are kos are the worms &quot;ice burrowers&quot; and the hounds, providing faction of course, (tantor/stronghorn might bekos don't recall)  down in the valley to tov there is a dragon on ring of scale faction, oh and off to the leftish area fromwhere u zone in there is some dragon slayers they'r elikely to be kos as well, i belive they're on giant faction</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tantor isnt KOS.<br />
<br />
Theres a dragon - Escorpa of the Ring who is on Ring of Scale Faction near ToV also, may have to be aware if your ROS faction is screwed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My CoV faction is good so that’s one less thing to worry about.  Are the hounds hard to find?  Are there a lot of problems with adds?  My plan is to sick puppy on the hounds, slow and dot them.  I’ve read there’s a problem with spawning the hounds, something about having to kill other animals to get the hounds to spawn.  And I also read that the dragons share the same spawn, so there could end up being a zone full of dragons and no mammals.  And since I don’t want to mess up my CoV faction I’d just be out of luck if that happened.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I got the drops from Siren's Grotto solo at 61, so you may be able to skip the friends part.  It's a pretty frustrating zone to fight in, so it's a good thing that the quest item drops are fairly common.<br />
<br />
Once in Western Wastes:<br />
<br />
Find a cliff edge and pull velium hounds to it.  They have an insane aggro range, so &quot;pulling&quot; consists largely of running around until one jumps you.  You can also use Sense Animals, tho you're likely to get a nonhound animal.  Kill it anyway, it will free up a spot for another hound to spawn.<br />
<br />
They run FAST and are quite resistant.  Treat them with respect.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Winney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Finding and killing the hounds are not that bad really assuming you can take the hits which at something like 170s a pop is next to nothing by today's standard. I got all the furs I needed and more a few weeks after the 8th shawl went live (before the level cap of 65 and new spells) solo in about 5 hours total. I used the spell Sense Animals as a poor man's tracking. It is not perfect, but it works great for the job. I was not KoS so I just ran around the zone casting it. If it targeted a hound, great, if it targeted a rhino or mammoth I would run over and kill to open the spawn slot and continue along. Now, where it gets tricky is with the Burrowers (the worms) and the Wyverns. Sense Animals will target the Burrowers, but that would be a risky kill for you right now. Later on, they are not hard at all, but for now you would do better to avoid them. So what happens when you run around and the ONLY things you are getting targeted are the Burrowers? Easy, you kill the roaming (not the ones in the cave) Wyverns. Sense Animals will not target them but they are plentiful and killing them gives no faction hit. They share the spawn slot with animals, this is why you read the stories of there never being any animals around. This means you must kill them to open a spawn slot. Even though they do not give a CoV faction hit, CoV mobs will assist them so you need to pull them to a spot far enough away from a potential add (and don't pull it through a mob either). The beach to the left of the zone in is good. Now plan on tanking them dead, they do summon so do NOT pull with a DoT or some damaging spell. Tank them dead, loot (a few plat) and continue along with your poor man's tracking. The Wyverns do run on low health, so be sure you can either blast them dead at the end, or use poor man's snare (chain root) and tank them until zero health. It will take some getting used to, I was very cautious at first, but after an hour you should have the hang of it and be collecting your furs<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you out, the shawl is great, I still wear it /nod<br />
