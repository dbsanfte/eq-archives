<br />
Not really.  One of the things I really love about WoW is that it's really not a big deal for us to stop playing and go upstairs to cook a real meal.  My least favorite part about EQ was racing around to feed us something quick so we wouldn't miss the raid, or die while I was AFK or some silliness.  It's kind of surprising to be able to maintain a real life while playing a mmorpg.<br />
<br />
Either that or my skill in Moderation has Increased (1)!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So far im really liking it. Its weird playing graphics that are so fantasy. I liked how EQ was kinda real. But the game runs so smooth and is interesting so far, i think i can get over it once i really get into the game. Playing a Tauren shaman right now ;)<br />
<br />
Thinking of trying a few others before the stress test is over, like mage and stuff, i dunno. Got limited time so i think ill not be sleeping a lot this weekend heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Alternatively, if you are too busy playing to do basic houskeeping, it gives the mouse population a chance to explode, providing the cats with a ready source of food on the hoof.  :D</div></div><hr />

Disapprove: Can't you see this was a market ploy. Oh have 'some' people pay for stress test. Servers supposedly go down payed customer get pissed Blizzard extends Beta. This is really low of Blizzard. *sigh the game will never be out. <br />
<br />
<br />
Jezz man, i find out about a possability for myself to get in and try WoW out so we can see if there is hope on the horizion. I read my e-mail of acceptance and before i even click the link and create a account for myself, my first thought is to come post here and share it with you all so we can all partake of the hope that a fun game can help us bury EQ and you neg rep me with that quote.<br />
<br />
Sorry mate, i undestand your frustration, maybe you didnt get in for the beta or the stress test or more to the point it sounds like your mad at FP cause you had to pay 9 bucks for a File planet account and they ran out of keys or whatever, but dont take it out on me please.

For some reason the game world with the different graphics feels more immersive to me. Maybe the fact that they are different is what does it for me.<br />
<br />
*shrugs*<br />

All I can say is that this is the first game I caught myself trying to hide behind a tree with my hunter. :)</div></div><hr />

Actualy i paid for it for alternative reasons. I wanted one for a long time but was too cheap. i got the money now and this was just the deal maker :)</div></div><hr />

Could you describe how that would work?<br />
<br />
Yes and to understand it you have to know a little more about how the combat in WoW works.<br />
<br />
Combat in WoW is fierce, short and brutal. After combat you have to eat (regen HP) or drink (regen mana) and to do so you need a relative &quot;safe&quot; place. So in every &quot;zone&quot; there are spots with little or no roamers where you can not only eat/drink up but also go AFK.<br />
<br />
And remember that any class in WoW can solo. Not every class is able to solo every type of mob just as well but every class can survive on its own.<br />
<br />
PS Litgruv, What class you like the most atm?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">They have trains in WoW?  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well i just got on today and the first thing i did was make a Tauren shaman :D .  He is fun so far. Atleast at low level the shaman seems to me to be how we all used to play our shaman when EQ was still young and in the hands of people with vision. He has average melee skills and has  descent magic attacks and healing and was tough enough to solo very easily. Mind you im not used to WoW so i dont know how easy all the classes solo, but the shaman didnt have a problem.<br />
<br />
Sadly though the servers all went down and have been down for like 3 or 4 hours, so i havent been able to try other classes and even play the shaman to a level where i feel confident that he is going to be a good class from the direction he is heading, but like i said, from what i saw i liked it.<br />
<br />
The thing that strikes me as a suprise more then anything is how quick it loads and how smooth it runs on my existing hardware, i was really expecting a needed hardware upgrade for this game and im pleased to see that its not the case, though ill be doing one anyway ;) Actualy its runs on my laptop pretty well which only has a ati 7000 on it, which isnt exactly garbage, but is far from high end in the moble market.<br />
<br />
Anyway, ive been franticly trying to log into the server all night and im about to give up on getting some more experience on the shaman, but so far im excited. From what i have seen i can only see one mogul in the game for me to overcome and thats the graphics. While they are nice and smooth and well done, its no where near being close to realistic and after playing EQ for so long i kinda and hooked on that. But we will see,  there is hope and thats all i was looking to find in WoW cause im done with EQ.<br />
<br />
Like i said, i have yet to see much, so ill fill you in more as i see more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well Lit,<br />
A shaman in WoW is actually an in demand class. They are well rounded and fun to play. I would even say they are one of the better classes for solo'ing.<br />
<br />
And as far as the graphics go, I actually like the cartonish style. it will not be outdated as fast as a realistic look and well I kinda got used to it  8)<br />
<br />
Oh And Tugela. No trains  AND no buff bots there. Now if you just stay here like the good little SoE fanboy you showed us you be all is well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tarru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">got in the stress test myself and i didnt have to pay a thing i got a free file planet membership back when i was playing mohaa alot and that was all i needed to get in the stress test.<br />
<br />
i myself started a shaman as my first toon their and they are a very fun and rounded class. i have played all the hoard classes and havent found one i dislike yet as of now im hooked on the tauren hunter they are a blast to play. the undead rouge was very fun to but it seems everyone and their brother is playing an undead so was a bit to crouded for me.<br />
<br />
when i first loaded the game i to was a bit worried about the graphics but they grow on you fast and very little lag on my in need of an upgrade machine is a nice change from EQ to. i would have to say the thing i liked the most is the way they have done the trade skills in the game it is a very good system and not the time sink it is in EQ.<br />
<br />
all in all i would say EQ will be but a memory for me once WoW comes out if not before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have a suspicion that level 10 is the turning point.  If you don't like a character at that point, you probably never will, and vice versa if you like it.  I only got my shaman up to 4, unfortunately, so I didn't get to give them a fair shot.<br />
<br />
Actually, I HAVE gotten trained in WoW, but it's a lot harder than other games.  Creatures give up on chasing someone down so much sooner, that you really have to be close to someone in order for them to train you.  But it has happened.  Though my bf and I are usually enough to take a train.  All those years of playing mmorpg's really does count for something.  *grin*<br />
<br />
I swear they make sure to take down the servers for at LEAST an hour every 8 hours or so, and I'm starting to suspect it's because they know some people won't eat or bathe unless they do.  <br />
<br />
I heard there are going to be changes to the tradeskill system.  Not necessarily to make it harder, but I guess the way they've been doing it, everybody was just taking everything to make whatever they needed.  *pfft*  Like that's a problem - who needs an economy!?</div></div><hr />

My cat will tear open his food bag if he has not been fed in what he considers an acceptable time frame :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have played an Orc Shaman to 10, a Tauren Hunter to 10, a Gnome warrior to 10, and an Undead Warlock to 12, I like the Warlock the most so far.  He has first aid, fishing, and enchanting as skills and that seems to be a great combo for that class as they lack healing ability.  Other then the Soushard 140 hp heal that you create that is unique (lore) over all very fun game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>malden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've almost gotten my hunter to 10. There is just something nice about being able to have a mob half dead before it even gets to you. My warlock is up to 7 and I have to agree its a fun class as well. I'll probably be rolling up a shaman tonight or tomorrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Potionpusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I got in on this Sept. 9th...<br />
<br />
...by the time I get it downloaded and installed it'll probably be the 11th (early morning).  Stress test stops on the 12th...<br />
<br />
At least I'll get to see it I guess...unless they're stress testing their patch/download server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'm playing a hunter most of the time, m'dear enjoys his warlock (EQ equivalent is probably mage, whereas mage is closest to an EQ wizard), and the funny thing is those healing stones are the only thing we have for emergency healing (other than the rare healing potion).  And I agree about the half dead thing Malden.  I just feel like a Kunark ranger when 2 things are beating on me.  I've even started screaming RANGER DOWN when I die.  The almost complete lack of a death penalty has made us REALLY adventurous (read: suicidal) in our hunting patterns.  At level 15 we're constantly looking for level 18's to play with.  Such a challenge!  *grin*<br />

Uggok - we dump the cat bag into one of those huge popcorn bins people insist on giving out at xmas, because I refuse to clean up a mountain of cat food.  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually a warlock has 1 other very important heal. A lifetap.<br />
When your nice blue blob is tanking (something he should be able to do for you for the entire duration of the stresstest) just use the lifetap and you never need to use those healthstones/soulstones or potions again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Blue blob tanks great... until I crit with the arcane flashy bow attack for 88 dmg.  Then I'm guaranteed to tank.  I was just making the point that if you're cautious (I'm guessing) you can get by just fine on &quot;just&quot; the summoned heal stones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I couldn't get the stupid thing to download worth a shIIIte.  I gave up on it.  What's this &quot;fileplanet&quot; thing.  That may be why.  It never asked me for any membership.  I have cable, and even with a direct connect from the modem, the best speed I could download at was 34kb/s...on a 2+gig file.  No thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">WoW feels like City of Heroes and Everquest mated. City of Heroes gameplay with Everquest depth. So far I see a lot of the things that bored me about CoH and EQ, but I also see a lot of good things as well. The only thing that would stop me from buying it is if the rumor that they'll be charging $70 for the box is true. <br />
<br />
As for the graphics, I like their style because it's a lot easier to believe it's a fantasy world when you're not bombarded with realism. I think that's a huge plus for the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">http://www.fileplanet.com/download.aspx?f=144890 Fileplanet download for WoW Stress Test Beta.  Used winzip 9.x to unzip.  Winrar will give you corrupt error messages.<br />
<br />
Also, the official download site from WoW is in a torrent type download.  Torrents generally need you to upload (share) the portions you downloaded so far in order to gain faster download speeds.  The faster your upstream connection is, the faster downstream will be.  Of course if your ports were blocked, you would not be able to upload very fast, if at all, limiting your download speeds.  A simple remedy would be to open the port specified by the torrent client being used.  In this case, I think the port # is listed on that popup download box.</div></div><hr />

Yes, you need an invitation to setup a WoW Stress Test Beta account.  Invitations were sent out to a few thousand ppl who signed up for the closed beta many months ago.</div></div><hr />
