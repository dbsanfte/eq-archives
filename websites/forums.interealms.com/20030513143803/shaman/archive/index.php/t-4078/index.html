<br />
Just kinda bored this morning and looking for ideas. Thanks.<br />
<br />
*and no I will not start a monk*</div></div><hr />

<br />
Iksar warriors rule, haven't really seen many around, ever anywhere beyond FoB. I guess they've given up fast.<br />
<br />
Hmm good weapons eh, get ones with minimal delay and maximal damage heehee ;) Perhaps looks for something like lamentation to pair up with shaded dagger/jarsanth trident or similar. That'd be pretty powerfull 2 weapons to carry you fast to 50 and yet should be quite inexpensive on older servers these days.<br />
<br />
I believe warriors follow rule: prim hand minimal delay, offhand best ratio something like that :D Gluck world needs more iksar warriors (and SKs)...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">SK was my second choice, but I dont think I can handle having to med anymore lol.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't make an iksar warrior, chief.  Yeah, the regen is okay, but they have no stamina.  Warriors get TONS of hp for their base stamina.  Seriously, make an ogre with 5 in agi and the rest in stamina.  Seriously, a raid buffed tank at 60 with decent gear has mostly maxxed stats anyway.  It's ALL about the HP.  Go meatshields!<br />
<br />
The sad thing is . . . not only do ogres make better warriors, they also have less exp penalty.  Go figure.<br />
<br />
Chutoi<br />
<br />
P.S.  For cheap, easy to get weapons, go for:<br />
1hs: frostbringer, centi longsword<br />
2hs: strength of grodan (ME), or maybe that 2HS 45/45 axe from CT (name escapes me atm)<br />
1hb: hammers from the beer script in FG<br />
2hb: can't think of anything<br />
piercing: get a couple of bloodpoints from HS<br />
<br />
You can also get the items for a full set of crafted armor in about an hour, and that's decent for him to start with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Iksar Warriors and SK's are sorta screwed in that they can't wear plate. I'd go Ogre Warrior or Troll SK. Plus Krak - in The Hand you will be able to complete Epic and frankly Warrior Epic sucks balls in the Risk v Reward category.</div></div><hr />

sheesh you people probably would have told me not to start an iksar shammy too! :P<br />

I dig lizards, so thats what I will play. I like the rareness. <br />

<br />
I twinked one before moving servers with easy to get stuff, including the Trooper Scale quest bracers and boots. You can do the quests, apart from the BP, rather easily but after looking at stats compared to Ry'Gorr only the boots and bracers were worth the effort. Did them both in a day, was easy. I had a Guard Captains Mallet and Lammy with a Sash of the Dragonborne for haste, it's fun being a blender :) <br />
<br />
If you really want to be rare, make a female one ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Isn't there a damage cap until level 10, 20, and maybe even 30?  If so, a Wurmslayer (great ratio, but slow) isn't a good choice in the lower levels because the damage cap destroys your ratio (25/40 becomes 10/40 or something due to the cap).  Get something fast... something like a jade mace (9/18) or for less money an iksar berserker club (7/18) - also you'll raise your skills faster.<br />
<br />
Once you get through the damage cap levels, by all means grab a Wurmy- underrated DPS machine until the low 50's... then switch back to fast weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I decided to break the Ogre mold as well, and so far I love my little 31 DE Warrior of Rallos Zek (the God, not the server).  He's not uber, but he's a blast.  Stick with the essentials, get him a FBSS, then think about regen, and jboots (the quest really isn't that hard, just time consuming).  The dagger from the Tower of Frozen Shadows that makes bandages is invaluable.  I've also got him loaded down with procing items (Fear (that tooth from the Fay quest)/Darkness [CoM sword which STILL won't proc at my level, bah], Disease (Woe) /Poison (Kisch Der Pavz [which procs like MAD, I love it]) ).  The nice thing about not having a lot of stamina is now they have all this Othmir armor to make up for it.  At lower/mid levels the 2 handed practice sword is handy to get your skill up (since you are still doing some damage), and procs at a decent rate, but my personal favorite is still Earthen Blade/FBSS (though the price on Oggok Cleaver makes it REAL tempting).  Oh, one last thing, WEIGHT REDUCING BAGS.  Little girlie man warriors cannot carry crap!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Generally, its widely accepted to use 2hs early levels until the main hand bonus starts kicking in (27th level, +1/3 levels I believe) and dual wield gets really high.  Of course, maybe this is thrown out the window if you have 2 insane 1hand weapons to start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Arorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Not sure what they go for anymore but sword of skyfire is a really nice twink blade until it procs. Guard captians mallet from chardok gatehouse is a nice 1hb. <br />
And kudos to you for making a character to GASP have fun with and not toss another random_best race_class combo toon into the already insane pile of twinks.<br />
And for 2handers theres always the mithril 2hander from the king in Lguk ,easily soloable by you.Although as Thantu suggested an Earthen Blade / Exe Axe may be better since its a proc haste and would stack with a FBSS or SCHWs if you go to that extent on twinking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Iksar warriors are some of the very best warriors, if not THE best warrior race, at later levels. While they can't wear newbie plate armore, they can wear Velious quest armor and other other high end armor down the road. Add in their natural regen and AC bonus and Iksar warriors own. <br />
<br />
Again like all Iksar, they have the 20% xp penalty to worry about and faction, but if you are willing to deal with these things then Iksar warriors are awesome later on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">From 1-10 your damage cap is 20, so get the fastest 10 damage weapon you can afford.<br />
<br />
From 10-20, your damage cap is 30, so you can move up to 15 damage and not waste anything.<br />
<br />
From 20 to 40 or 45, ditch whatever you have in your primary hand and get a wurmslayer.  Your offhand doesn't matter much when you've got a wurmslayer working it's full ratio at 20.  You could barefist your offhand and do just fine.<br />
<br />
I've been there, and done that, twice...it's the way to go man.  Ditch the wurmy around 45 and start working on real weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">One of the best parts about a warrior alt is all the toys they can haul around for you.  Silken Whip of Ensnaring and Embalmer's Skinning Knife are two of my favorites.  They're dirt cheap, and provide good utility to complement your shaman, once you can proc them of course.  Also, don't worry about the race.  If you're planning to play the warrior to a high level where hps matter, you can get gear to compensate for any racial deficiency.  My Halfling Warrior is doing just fine, despite still being 50 sta short of the cap.  All it means is that I have more to look forward to and more flexability in gear.  (It certainly makes Ring of the Crimson Bull look damn tasty, when most ogres will shrug it off as wasted stats.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I love my iksar warrior 2box although the xp penalty was pretty annoying in the upper 50s. <br />
<br />
With the bazaar now you can find amazing deals on weapons, just look around a little.  A friend of mine got a 10/22 weapon for 50 plat for example.</div></div><hr />

<br />
centi long sword is 14/27, 8str, 8sta and sells for more like 1k.<br />
<br />
how much money you want to spend? :P<br />
off the top of my head... droppables.<br />
<br />
frostbringer, guard captains mallet, blood point, seb croaking dirk, shaded dagger, cresent blades of luclin, exquisite(and other) velium warsword, jade mace, some 1hb from HS that procs guard, lamentation, defiance... are all things I know friends warriors and twinks have/do use. <br />
<br />
If you want to twink with easy no drop, go grab a couple friends and kill the general in echo and get the ornate sword of the general off him.</div></div><hr />

Iksar tanks aren't really disadvantaged by the non plate rule, we can still wear the Velious Quest armours. Its a bit of a dry patch until planar though, the Iksar Crafted armour quests are well worth doing to tide you over until then.<br />

Iksar Warriors are rare, but thats part of the attaction (ooh look, an iksar which isn't a Monk!)<br />

<br />
He tears stuff up :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Heuli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">ogre&gt; all<br />
but you need a good supply of shrink potions and/or a illu item (AoN).<br />
<br />
Try to borrow a warrior for a couple of days and do some pickup groups. I've started a wizzy alt (54) and I love the way he can slow mobs, but it's very boring after you have finished reading the magazines of the last 3 years. Back to the shammy, wizzy has not enough action and power.<br />
<br />
If you are in a raid guild make a shd (or monk *hides*) if you love pulling stuff or make a war if you enjoy keeping aggro and standing in camp most of the time. You can get descent 2h weapons very cheap.<br />
<br />
If you are in a normal guild make a war if you like it.<br />
<br />
If you love bashing the living crap out of things, make a halfling ranger. good damn sexy...and the damage is really, really nice with EQ and AM3. But the road is very long (your only chance is 2boxing or retire your shammy). oh, one last hint...get a cleric with a rez-o-matic. <br />
I will make a special &quot;-HALFLING- ranger down!&quot; down button =).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">ok, first things first.<br />
<br />
get your war a pair of lammys. cheap, great. frostbringers suck till 40 when they start proccing. same with bloodpoints and 50.<br />
<br />
lammys are cheap, and 9/19 is the best you'll get without spending an arm and a leg.<br />
<br />
<br />
secondly, congrats on the iksar. i LOVE my iksar SK, and he is by no means disadvantaged by the lack of plate wearing ability. the sucker has 930 ac unbuffed at lvl 39 for christs sake.<br />
<br />
slap yourself in a good suit of dragon armour and go to town. it also looks a spiffy green color which reflects well on your scales.<br />
<br />
if your lookin for cheaper, cabalis scale armour is smith made, decent ac on it, and cheap. if you can't find a smith, just grab a set of rygorr.<br />
<br />
<br />
my only advice, is to put as many starting points into sta. it's so sad that my iksar just recently broke 100 sta, cuz i broke down and bought him a RBG. iksars need all the sta they can get.<br />
<br />
if your really interested, i'll make a magelo later, to disprove this whole *iksars can't wear plate so they suck compared to ogres* thing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Iksar warrior is probably the hardest race/class combo in the game..but in the end it probably pays off being the rarest of the rare.<br />
<br />
Your best bets, costwise and weaponwise:<br />
<br />
Jarsath Trident<br />
Smoldering brand<br />
sword of skyfire<br />
<br />
You can use those three to 39 relatively easily. Do not get a wurmy, wurmslayers are ass.<br />

Ps. Ogres are not better than iksar, nor any other race when it comes to a warrior. Stun immunity has jack to do with a)getting aggro b)keeping aggro c)mitigating damage. In the end any race can hit the stamina cap. In fact the large races are probably a poor choice- as they require(and often have to hunt for) shrink so much during their career.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I'd agree that it's one of the hardest race/class combos in game.  Iksars = generally hated by all.  Warriors = no spells to hide them from the playa haters.  Plan to spend a lot of time in Kunark, velious, and parts of Luclin tho and you'll be fine.  <br />
<br />
I agree that you can go iksar warrior instead of ogre.  In the end, stats and hps don't matter.  It's all about the connections you make, and being rare helps those connections along . . people might actually remember you!  <br />
Oh . . . make sure your name is semi-short and friendly and easy to remember.  <br />
<br />
With my monk (iksar, shoot me haha) I didn't make the same mistake as with my shaman.  His name is Indeez.   Last name Cent . . . . haha ok it was funny to me :P<br />
He's decked in Land's old fungi, some good monk velious/Luclin monk gear (1068 ac), twin stun sticks, and a 34% haste belt (plus better than silvery belt of contention stats) from Kedge keep.  He rocks, and I have fun playin him when I'm sick of the caster game.  He's 52 now and workin on his runspeed.  I figure that's gonna help the most at this point in his little life.  Runspeed is GOD for a monk.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2hs: Imperial Di'Zok Kitana<br />

1hp: Shaded dagger<br />
<br />
all skills are maxed at level 24 except 1hb, 2hb, and bash (screw a sheild) <br />
<br />
Ok huge freeking question. Are just regular arrows sold someplace? I'm going to spend a friggin ton on arrows in the bazaar! I guess i'll have to do some fletching with him...<br />
<br />
Just a progression of where i'm PLing him as well:<br />
1-10 FoB<br />
11-22 Kurns/I'll Omen. ( pauld. caverns is just toooo friggin packed)<br />
23-24+ i've been in Neth. Lair. Killin trogs/aliens ( and the &quot;Trog King&quot; rotfl how worthless )<br />
<br />
I plan on heading to nurga/droga asap to work on faction for both of us. Figure I can start this when my warrior is around level 30? Any other good area's to PL him you can think of? Will take him to Kedge Keep as soon as he's big enough. taken about 9 hours to get him to 24. <br />
<br />
*btw, carnage can be cast on a level one toon*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">lol ohyeah and /rude to the guy who put the required levels on the CT droppable warrior stuff ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Krakster, I also started a warrior twink.<br />
<br />
I refuse to spend cash on her till I get torpor, so she's wearing royal engraved velium armour (leftovers from my shawl), wielding that nullify sword from Kael that nobody wants (doesn't proc yet for her), a weighty polarm from PoJ (I had six of these at one time on various alts), a pine shaft pike (from Jaggedpine) and a centi warhammer (gift from a friend).<br />
<br />
She's 26 now. Kitty, like me, siamese. I got her to 20 in Paludal. 21, I did in netherbian, but oh my god that sucked. The aliens took ages to kill and gave crap xp for each kill, even with them slowed and me nuking at half health. Trogs weren't much better.  Let me know if netherbian is better at 23-24, cause I thought it sucked horribly. And I don't even have a racial penaltiy.<br />
<br />
So I went to echo and did needlites bogglings. And for 21-25 it was good. I was doing a little less than an hour a level with her. But at 25, I started having a problem... I was running out of spawns. I'd clear the entire needlite room in minutes, then kill the boglings (red and harder). Then I started pulling sporlings. But I was running out of things to kill and that's with me camping the entire fungal side.<br />
<br />
So I'm looking for a new zone to go play in. I'm not sure where... Also I think I'll splurge get that shadel dagger, it was only 350 pp and faster than the pine shaft pike. <br />
<br />
Some ideas:<br />
<br />
HHK - killing guards. They will be db/white/mostly yellow/red. Cons: often camped, harder to have Harvyst follow her and heal/slow since they can't group.<br />
<br />
Pros: FS weaponry is good money.<br />
<br />
Crystal Caverns - killing orcs. Cons: Also sometimes camped. Pros: Velium sells well in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Splitpaw - killing gnolls. Cons: the entrance way has only eight or so spawns, so I may already outkill that area. Pulling further leads to casters who are harder to kill.<br />
<br />
Any advice? I want to stay in dungeons for the dungeon bonus, as I want to get her to 50 as soon as possible (When she can reasonably group with me and get decent xp).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">For low levels (pre20):  Speed is king, since the damage cap.  With newbie zones lik Kurns and PC, you'll be 20 in no time<br />
<br />
For 20-45ish:  Wurmslayer in primairy and good higher damage off hand.  While ratio may be king in off hand, your skill will suck for so long, it's best to have a harder hitting off hand.  Atleast when it lands, it hits for a wallop!<br />
<br />
45+:  Speed is your friend.  Don't go higher than 20 delay for primairy if you can aviod it.  You want to keep applaying your damage bonus as much as you can.  Lammy, Defiance are good for this.  For off hand, I swear by the Frostbringer.  For those with lots of cash, the fleshgrinder is a sweet primairy weapon for both agro and DPS.  Something in the 10/18 ratio range will be your friend at these level for your primairy.<br />
<br />
Two handers, and when to use.  They start to get good in your 30's, when your double attack starts to become more effective.  Good cheapies are abundant in the Bazaar.  I use a Windblade now, over Fleshgrinder/Frostbringer (partially since I had to return the Fleshgrinder b/c it was on loan).  But with a two hander, you want the best ratio hands down.  When it comes down to same ratio, differnt dam/delay, I choose the faster one, to apply the damage bonus more often, and for faster attacks if I Miss.<br />
<br />
best of luck to ya.</div></div><hr />

Harder hitting than the wurmslayer in my off hand? Is there such a weapon? I'm using LSoEE in my offhand atm. (btw the wurmy I bought for 1k, cheep stuff)<br />
<br />
And what is that bout skill? You mean skill in dual wield? So far I've had no trouble keeping my weapon skills up (focus/carnage = 220ish dex at all times)<br />

I build me a little (ogre) warrior to 2-box.  The most annoying thing is that you can't use your 50+ spells till 40+x. <br />
You don't need much in haste items in the beginning, a schw will probably keep you capped anyway till 50 with shm haste.<br />
For weapons, I suggest a pair of lammies to do 1HS, or a jagged blade of mourning/venomous axe of the brood combo. A CBOL paired with a jade mace for piercing/1HB and an ornate runed blade for 2HS to round out the skills.<br />

Absolute crap for warriors, that is a hybrid weapon. What you want is fast weapons. Jarsath trident is good for pierce. Lammy kicks the **** out of centi ls and is cheaper nowadays to boot. Someone already mentioned guard captains mallet(jade mace is also an oldie but goodie). Set yourself up in the 18-20 delay and laugh when you steal aggro from wurmslayer wielders without hitting any of your taunt keys.<br />
<br />
2. **** ogres. You can quote me on that. No race has any real advantage at all over another for warriors. The MT of my main's guild is an iksar warrior. His stamina is 235, unbuffed. His raid buffed hp lands around 8500 right now.  All races can hit 305 sta with decent gear/aa. <br />
<br />
Stunability?  Stalwart endurance costs 6 aa to max - that's unstunnability from any angle, ie superior to the laughable advantage of no frontal stun for ogres if you wish to play that card.<br />

<br />
Hi.  Generalizations are not good.  You show me ANY dual wield combo that you can give a level 20 and outdamage a wurmslayer and anything else offhand.  There isn't one.  25/40 main beats even 12/20 until you get a damage bonus.   The reason people go for speed is because of THE DAMAGE BONUS.  When you don't have one, or your damage bonus is not high enough to positively impact your DPS, then RATIO IS YOUR FRIEND.  You don't need speed to taunt at level 20, damage is fine, and the wurmslayer outdamages anything at level 20.<br />
<br />
Yes, between level 40 and 50, when it's convenient, you should start looking into a faster mainhand weapon, but the fact of the matter is that you're just gimping your own potential by avoiding the wurmslayer before then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Sorry, but Jharassik is very wrong about warriors and how damage is calculated.<br />
<br />
From 20 until level 45 to 50, wurmslayer remains the best value out there and is a tremendous weapon.  <br />
<br />
The level damage bonus, which keys off speed, really doesn't come into play until higher levels when the level damage bonus added to the damage of faster delay weapons beats the damage of higher damage lower delay weapons.<br />
<br />
And taunt works just fine below 50, and doing massive damage is part of taunt.  Wurmslayer is comparable for the damage from nukes at those levels.  <br />

Slap haste and some kind of regen and away you go.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I have a 60 iksar monk and they are very fun to play, but they aren't as powerful in PoP as they used to be.  So, as much as I love my monk, I'm putting him aside for now.<br />
<br />
Started an ogre warrior on Friday(hey, my shaman is an ogre, and was one back when almost nobody chose ogre, so don't gimme no grief); as of Sunday he was level 35.  I just put everything on my monk onto him instead, except a couple monk-specific weapons.  Put every point I could in stamina, and the rest in either agi or dex or a bit of both, I forget, since ogres start with bad agi/dex stats.  He was going to wear my monk's fungi, which would hit his agi/dex even worse, but oh well, not complaining about having a fungi.<br />
<br />
I also bought cobalt guants and a frostbringer for main hand, it's 12/22.  It doesn't proc until 41, a warrior friend told me -- oh well.  Will be nice when it does, and meantime is not bad.  Also got a weighty poleaxe, the 2h slash that drops in POJ, i think it's 29/34 or something, but I have barely used it.  I will catch up on two-handers later.  Also let him borrow my journeyman's stick for offhand.  Iksar beserker club is really nice and dirt cheap, and at level 10 procs a nice spell that adds ATK, offense and defense, tho it drains stamina(no big deal).  Jade mace is also pretty cheap these days, and the same speed, but bigger damage.  My jstick is not too good, but hey, it was free.  I swapped that in with kunzar ku'juch, as I will want him to be able to snare when it starts to proc.  <br />
<br />
Snare makes mobs turn around when at low health instead of either fleeing or continuing to fight.  Sometimes that's when mobs have as much as a full bubble of health left, so in a weird way snare might as well increase your hitpoints or your healing power.  I'd suggest getting a snare weapon of some kind at some point, and the sooner the better.<br />
<br />
I've been powerleveling with my druid so far.  Damage shield is godly to this level and a little beyond.  I buff him with both druid (natureskin) and shaman buffs; at level 1 he had 255 STR and STA and over 1400 hitpoints.  Pretty fun!<br />
<br />
Anyway, druid damage shield has done by far the majority of the damage he has ever done, though his skills in offense are maxed, defense a couple points from max, 1h slash maxed, 1hb almost maxed, dual wield, riposte doing great, etc.  Druid uses /assist key to snare his mobs so that they turn away, making healing more manageable.  At level 35, he can fight four mobs at once easily with druid heals/fungi/damage shield/snare combo working for him, and five or six if I push it.<br />
<br />
This is the first of my own characters I've really powerleveled -- I powerleveled my monk from 57 to 60 just by grouping my shaman with him, but by that time I had already learned a little something here and there. ;)  No expert on monk stuff, but very passable.  He did a lot of grouping.  I'll have to learn a lot of things with my warrior, too, I'm sure, but at least I have a certain amount of experience with melee and pulling.  And the rest I'll be glad to learn, as I have been with my other characters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And you think that tanking and damage are totally seperate issues huh?  Lets think about something for a minute.  What massive aggro weapons are you slapping on a level 20 - 45 warrior, huh bright guy?  Nothing procs at that level to generate sufficient aggro to be worthwhile.  From 20 to 45, the aggro you get will mostly be generated from your DPS.  What puts out the most DPS at those levels?  Oh my god, it could be the wurmslayer.<br />
<br />
Aggro does not always come from procs, a lot of time your aggro depends also on your DPS.  If you're depending on procs for aggro, you could be waiting a long time for one, I know I have.  If you have a solid DPS, you need to worry less about procs.  Wurmslayer provides a massive amount of DPS at a level when there are not good taunting weapons available due to proc levels.  I'm not sure why you can't understand this.<br />
<br />
<br />
What warriors need is a)taunt, through weapon choice and skill/tricks learned through lots of practice b) Hitpoints and ac. DPS is secondary.  <br />
<br />
Taunt and DPS go hand in hand.  They are not as mutually exclusive as you would like to believe.  A rogue with no proccing weapons generates a huge amount of aggro, yes?  What makes you think warriors are any different?  Between levels 20 and 45 or so, the best way to generate aggro is DPS, and nothing outperforms a wurmslayer and an average offhand.  NOTHING.<br />
<br />
But then *** do I know, I've only tanked mobs from crushbone to good old guk to vindi to ntov and beyond. I'm sure YOU know alot more about warriors than someone who's played 130 or so levels as one- Right? <br />

I'm sure I know just a little about the game I play, and by the way, having a high level character really doesn't speak volumes about how much you know about game mechanics.  Any retard can get PL'd or level himself in outdoor zones listening to wives tales in pickup groups and get to level 65.  Your level is not an indicator of your intelligence level.  I know what I speak of from experience.  The wurmslayer blows away anything you can give a noob melee.  It will blow away everything in terms of DPS, and in aggro, because i've been there, and i've done that, and I've tried it all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Jharassik, post that junk over on the Steel Warrior.<br />

They've hashed that issue out a long time ago.  You're the newb, and you're wrong.  You could have 200+ levels playing a warrior, but you clearly didn't pay attention along the way.<br />
<br />
Nothing wrong with the taunt button until 50+, so getting the best weapon for damage and mashing the taunt button is how you &quot;tank&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Do you even understand how the level damage bonus works?<br />
<br />
First everyone wanted the wurmslayer because it was a tremendous weapon.  Then it became fashionable to rip it as crap.  Well, it is crap for 50+ tanks compared to what they can use.  But sub-50 tanks want to be &quot;cool&quot; and mimick how the 50+ game works.  Except things work differently.  Like the wurmslayer.<br />
<br />
If you think the wurmslayer is crap 20 to 45, then that tells me you know jack about warriors and damage and aggro.  <br />
<br />
And of course warriors 20 to 45 want more dps.</div></div><hr />

I want you to compare how much of my gear can be bought or multiquested compared to your 2box alt. I looted every piece of gear on my warrior aside from 2 items. How much of yours is bought/mqed?<br />
<br />
DPS is important, but it is secondary. Weapon choice + skill at the class get you taunt.  At the raiding level you learn this pretty quick when you are holding aggro over classes that do double or more than double your dps. I know that it is a hard concept to grasp if the limit of your experience is pickup groups in pop, but do try. <br />
<br />
Quick weapons and knowing the class will taunt off **** weapons like a wurmslayer every time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I am assuming the two items you didnt loot you mention are the velioum 6ac 66 hp rings... but technically you didnt &quot;loot&quot; the solstice earings and I doubt you did all the tradeskilling for it as well... :)<br />

<br />
Look back at the original poster... he was going to prolly 2box plvl this warrior up to the 40s or 50s before joining the world with it... not the best practice but that was what I was doing with my ranger twink.  Its easy to get advice from guildies and to get the char to raid level to start that learning process.<br />
<br />
Thus the best choice for him would have to be the wurmy.  Plvl is about dmging and the wurmy with fbss or schw and haste at 20-mid 40s will be the most dmging.  I usually swapped my off hand with a jade mace, poison dragonspine (cant remember name something like that decent piercer) to keep my skills up then went to shaded blade just for looks.  The wurmy out performed my lammy and all those other items when placed in the primary in terms of dps... by far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">For 2HS, I like the Mith 2h'er.  Only 40 delay, and haste on top of that, so the skill rises quickly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gee, level 20 to 45 do a lot of raiding.  Even if they did, nobody at those levels does x2 the damage of a 20 to 45 level warrior with a wurmslayer, much less equal to it.  You run into the classic problem of a someone trying to prove his smarts by applying gameplay 50+ to gameplay below 50.  However, it's not the same.  <br />
<br />
No warrior dual-weilding frostbringers and jade maces will hold taunt away from one with a wurmslayer and essentially anything else in the offhand from level 20 to 45.  Once again, taunt works fine below 50.  I twinked my brother with a wurmslayer when he started, and he used to laugh at guys who twinked with weapons great for the 50+ set that cost 10x more, but were less effective - both for taunt and damage.  <br />
<br />
Mith is also a nice 2H sword, and saves on the cost of haste for cheap twinking.  40 delay gets you a little bonus, so it's essentially a 21/32 delay weapon, with a 40 delay weapon 2H weapon bonus.</div></div><hr />

You seem to be missing a huge point, and that is that a level 40 warrior does ZERO raiding.  he doesn't need aggro weapons to hold taunt.  he doesn't need fancy procs to keep mobs off the monks and rangers.  He does it just fine with a good ol fashion ass kicking and that button that says TAUNT on it.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">actually, the wurmslayer should not normally outdamage a good pair of fast weapons - mainly due to the lack of a comparable ofhand weapon.  The offhand will only &quot;fire&quot; in conjunction with the primary.  So the wurmy gives you the delay for the pair.  The next highest damage weapon easily optainable, e.g. green jade axe, has a damage of 17, giving you a total of 42/40, or 1.05 ratios.  This is comparable to the ratio of the CBoL/jade mace pair (which is considerably more expensive), which taunts more due to the higher number of hits.<br />
This all is dependend on so many factors (skill, or lack thereoff, damage caps, stamina loss etc) that I doubt you can generalize this in the &quot;you're a newb&quot; fashion done here.</div></div><hr />

I've been lurking at the steel warrior a while, and this was the first thread I read. It states that the wurmy will outdamage the lammy in the main hand until 40+ but will have lousy agro.

Jharassik: &quot;By the by..stun immunity has zilch to do with holding aggro. I have never, ever, ever lost aggro due to stun. Not once. I have never lost aggro when i stopped attacking for rage either, and that lasts longer than stuns- go figure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Funny, it happened last night during two mobs. Wizzies ended up getting summoned when the warrior last aggro during rage. Obviously, the casters were walking the line aggro-wise.<br />
<br />
But seriously, your logic here is fatally flawed. Are you attempting to say that attacking has nothing to do with holding aggro? It does, and I agree with you 100 percent that # of attacks seems to play a role in holding aggro, thus faster weapons. It's not just DPS. But don't be daft, if during rage you don't lose aggro, it's not magic. It just means you still top the hate list. The same for stuns. I've seen countless times a tank get stunned at the beginning of a fight and lose aggro for a few. If you're not attacking or taunting, YOU'RE NOT BUILDING AGGRO.<br />
<br />
Jharassik: &quot;The stun immunity myth is just as true as charisma being beneficial with resists.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah I agree. That whole attacking to get aggro thing is full of crap, ain't it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Zilansis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">this is something i read long ago on the warrior boards.  it explains how weapons work in eq. very usefull info.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ratio<br />
The ratio is a way to compare weapons with different damage and delays to see which one is the most damaging. I'll use your two weapons as examples: Glowing Iron Pike is 9Dmg, 36Dly (or just 9/36) and the BALS is 10/29. There are two ways to calcute the ratio.<br />
<br />
1) Delay / Damage ( Delay divided by Damage)<br />
2) Damage / Delay<br />
<br />
Most people use method 1 above when calculating the ratio, so that is what we will use. It is very important to know which method is being used, because, when using method 1, lower numbers are better, and when using method 2, higher numbers are better. Let's calculate the ratio of your weapons using method 1.<br />
<br />
GIP: 36/9 = 4.0 ratio<br />
BALS: 29/10 = 2.9 ratio<br />
<br />
Remember, lower numbers are better, so the BALS will do more damage than the GIP. You asked about a Dragoon Dirk.<br />
<br />
Dragoon Dirk: 23/6 = ~3.83 ratio<br />
(note: the ~ symbol means about)<br />
<br />
Thus, the dragoon dirk will do more damage than the GIP, but not as much as the BALS. The DD/BALS combo is better than the GIP/BALS combo.<br />
<br />
So hopefully you understand ratio now. There are many other factors to consider when picking between weapons besides the ratio, and I will talk about them in a moment.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Damage Cap<br />
Everquest implements a damage cap for characters under level 20. From levels 1-9, the highest Damage rating a weapon can have is 10, and from levels 10-19, the highest Damage rating a weapon can have is 14.<br />
<br />
What this means is, if you are level 6, and the weapon you are using has a damage rating higher than 10, it will act like a weapon with 10 Damage. Consider the Wurmslayer, which is 25/40. From levels 1-9, it will act like a 10/40 weapon. From levels 10-19, it will act like a 14/40 weapon. At level 20, the damage cap is removed, and the Wurmslayer will act like the 25/40 weapon it is supposed to be. (Note: above level 20, there may be another damage cap for really high damage weapons, if anyone knows what it is, let me know)<br />
<br />
What you need to understand about the damage cap is that certain weapons will not be at their full potential if you are under level 20.<br />
<br />
<br />
Level Damage Bonus<br />
The Level Damage Bonus, or LDB, is a number that gets added to every successful hit made by your main hand once you reach level 27 (when using a two-handed weapon) or level 28 (when using a one-handed weapon). The formula<br />
for the LDB is:<br />
<br />
1-handed weapons: (Level - 25) / 3 (rounded down<br />
2-handed weapons: (Level - 25) / 2 (rounded down)<br />
<br />
I will focus on using the 1-handed LDB in my examples, since that is where the LDB is most useful. The 1-handed LDB becomes active at level 28:<br />
<br />
(Lvl 28 - Lvl 25) /3 = 3/3 = 1<br />
<br />
At level 28, one point of extra damage will automatically be added to every successful hit with your main hand. At level 31, 2 points of extra damage will be automatically added to every successful main hand hit. The weapon in your offhand (secondary hand) does not get a LDB.<br />
<br />
How does this apply to choosing weapons? Well, at some point, all those LDB points start to add up quickly, especially with low delay weapons. What this means is that low delay weapons, when you are high enough level to get a fairly large LDB, will actually do more damage than high delay weapons that have better ratios. Look at the:<br />
<br />
Jade Mace: 2.0 ratio<br />
Wurmslayer: 1.6 ratio<br />
<br />
Recall from the ratio section that lower numbers are better, so we would think that the Wurmslayer is a better weapon. Certain levels, the Wurmslayer is the better weapon, and for certain levels, the Jade Mace is.<br />
<br />
Levels 1-9<br />
Jade Mace: 18/9 = 2.0 ratio<br />
Wurmslayer: 40/10 = 4.0 ratio<br />
<br />
From levels 1-9, the Jade Mace is a better weapon.<br />
<br />
Levels 10-19<br />
Jade Mace: 18/9 = 2.0 ratio<br />
Wurmslayer: 40/14 = ~2.86 ratio<br />
<br />
From levels 10-19, the Jade Mace is still better, but the Wurmslayer catches up a bit because the damage capped is raised.<br />
<br />
Levels 20-60<br />
Jade Mace: 18/9 = 2.0 ratio<br />
Wurmslayer: 40/25 = 1.6 ratio<br />
<br />
From levels 20-60, the Wurmslayer has the better ratio, and is the better weapon, if there was no LDB. Unfortunately, there is no formula that I know of that considers the LDB when calculating the ratio, but I can tell you the following based upon the experience of many warriors.<br />
<br />
At level 46, the 1-handed LDB is 7 points, and that is about the level when the lower delay weapons start to do more damage than high delay weapons with better ratios. That is because the lower delay weapons get more swings and thus, get the LDB added more often than high delay weapons. You will get ~2.2 swings in with the Jade Mace in the time it takes to swing the Wurmslayer once, meaning that, at level 46, you will get 14.4 points of LDB with the Jade Mace versus 7 points for the Wurmslayer. Thus the Wurmslayer is better than the Jade Mace from level 20 to about level 46 because of its great ratio, and the Jade Mace is better from about level 46-60 because of its low delay and good ratio.<br />
<br />
But, you may say, the Wurmslayer has such a higher damage rating, doesn't that make up for getting less LDB? No, it doesn't, because of the way the EQ combat system works. I'm not going to go into too many details, so you will just have to trust me. Let me just say that with the EQ combat system, you will hit for the minimum a ceratin amount of time, with the minimum being 1 point + the LDB. Since the minimum hit with the Wurmslayer and Jade Mace are the same (8 points at level 46), it's better to hit for the minimum quickly and swing again than hit for the minimum slowly.<br />
<br />
What you need to take away from this section is that once you approach level 50, the delay of your main hand weapon becomes more important than just the ratio alone. By your mid 40's, you definately want to start thinking about getting a low delay weapon for your main hand.<br />
<br />
<br />
Offhand Weapons<br />
Choosing an offhand weapon is fairly easy. Remember that the offhand does not get a LDB, so the ratio is all that really matters. A 9/18 Jade Mace and a 12/24 Crystalline Short Sword (CSS) will do the same amount of damage in your offhand, because they both have 2.0 ratios. (Remember, the Jade Mace will do more damage than the CSS in your main hand because of the LDB though).<br />
<br />
When choosing a weapon for your offhand, try to get the weapon with the best ratio you can.<br />
<br />
<br />
Taunt<br />
As a warrior, you will often be required to hold taunt (that is, keep the monster attacking you). A function of calculating taunt is how often you swing, meaning that lower delay weapons will help you hold taunt better because you are swinging more. Sometimes, you might need to choose low delay weapons over slightly higher delay weapons that have better ratios in order to hold taunt. Let's look at the Lamentaion and CSS. The Lamentation is 9/19 has a ~2.1 ratio versus the 2.0 ratio of the CSS. Let us say that you are deciding which one to use for your offhand - the CSS will do more damage, but the lower delay of the Lamentation will help you hold taunt easier. In a case like this, I would suggest using the CSS in the offhand and watch how well you are holding taunt. If you are consistantly having problems keeping the monster attacking you, it's time to switch to the Lamentation.<br />
<br />
In grouping situations when you are not the main tank, you might want to consider carrying around a 2-handed weapon to use. The higher delay of most 2-handed weapons means that you are less likely to take aggro away from the main tank.<br />
<br />
<br />
Stats and Procs<br />
You also need to consider stat bonuses and procs when choosing weapons. Some people prefer the +6 Str, +6 Sta, and +20 HP that the Lamention gives over the Jade Mace that has no stat bonuses, even though the Jade Mace will do slightly more damage and hold taunt a little better. Some people prefer the 80 point lifetap proc of the 10/21 Bloodpoint with its 2.1 ratio over a weapon with a 2.0 ratio like a Jade Mace or CSS. Procs are a great taunting tool when they go off.<br />
<br />
<br />
Weapon and Offense Skills<br />
There is currently no advantage in using one type of weapon, like One Hand Slash, over another type of weapon, like One Hand Blunt. There is, of course, a distinction between one-handed weapon skills (1HS, 1HB, and Piercing) and two-handed weapon skills (2HS, 2HB). There is also two-handed piercing, but I believe those types of weapons are based off of the same weapon skill as piercing (someone correct me if I am wrong please). As a general rule, you should strive to keep all of your weapon skills maxed, because there are great weapons of all skill types available, and you would hate to have a low skill for a great weapon. Weapon skills are capped at (Level * 5) + 5, so, at level 6, the maximum skill you could have is 35. This formula applies from level 1-39 for weapon skills, which caps them at 200. From level 40-50, once you reach the cap at 200, there are no more skill raises. Levels 51+, the skill caps get increased to 250 for 1HS, 2HS, 1HB, and 2HB, and to 240 for piercing. This increase gets applied as 200 + (Level-50) *5, which just means that the cap is raised 5 points for every level above 50: 205 at 51, 210 at 52, etc.<br />
<br />
Warriors will typically carry practice weapons (even low quality ones) with them to use in appropriate situations to try to keep their weapon skills maxed. The chance for a skill raise increases with every swing you take, so low delay weapons (regardless of ratio) may be desirable to get raises as quickly as possible. Good times to use your practice weapons are when the group is killing quickly and easily, when snared monsters go into &quot;flee&quot; mode, or you can even duel a pet class and attack the pet. When in doubt, ask the group if they mind if you work on your weapon skills.<br />
<br />
Remember, some of the best weapons aren't one-hand or two-hand slashing weapons. Look at the Jade Mace (1HB), the Bloodpoint (Piercing), the Truncheon of Doom (2HB), etc. Do you best to keep all of your weapon skills capped as you progress through the levels.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dual Wield and Double Attack<br />
Dual Wield is the ability to equip two one-handed weapons - one in each hand. Double Attack is the ability to swing twice in one combat round with the same hand. If you are using a 2-handed weapon, you can swing once or twice in any one combat round. If you are dual weilding, you can swing once, twice, three times, or even four times in any one combat round if you successfully dual wield and double attack with both hands. When dual wielding, the offhand will attack independantly based on its delay; there is no correlation between off-hand and main hand swings.<br />
<br />
Assuming weapons of equal caliber, dual-weilding two one-hand weapons will do more damage than using 2-hand weapons. This has been proven from in-game experience by many players, and can also be deduced by looking at the classes; Offense classes, the Rogue, the Monk, the Warrior, and the Ranger, can all dual wield, while the defensive classes, the Paladin and the Shadowknight, cannot.<br />
<br />
You should focus on getting a good pair of one-handed weapons as this will get you the most damage and the best taunting. As mentioned previously, two-handed weapons have their place too, dealing good damage while not attracting too much aggro. The proposed post-50 increase to 2-hand weapon damage should increase the damage output of these weapons, but they still will not outdamage dual wielding.<br />
<br />
<br />
Summary<br />
Choosing weapons can be complex. Learn to calcalute weapon ratios so that you can compare different weapons to each other. Remember that as you approach 50, low delay weapons in your main hand become more and more damaging. After you do that, you need to take into consideration some other factors, such as which hand to use a weapon in, how well can you hold aggro with this weapon, how important and useful are the stats and procs on it, etc. Much of this comes with experience, so, if all possible, try out different combinations yourself and see what you like best.<br />
<br />
<br />
Credits should go to all the EQ players who worked hard to analyze the EQ combat system, and especially to Ruatha. I merely tried to compile all the information I learned from them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">I used to taunt off wurmslayer wielding warriors with an exe axe for chrissakes  <br />
<br />
Exe Axe is 25/50 (subject an occasional proc at level 30) and it's 2H ....  WS is 28/45 - and it's 1H.   Aren't you being inconsistent now?  Previously your whole point, that I can tell, had been that only speed matters and slow weapons suck for level 20 to 45 warriors.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, your anecdote simply demonstrates the Taunt button actually works below level 50, even if you use a weapon half as good as the Wurmslayer.  It will move you to the top of the hate list.  See how it works?  <br />
<br />
Wouldn't it be better to use a weapon that does more damage and STILL taunt?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">I've been lurking at the steel warrior a while, and this was the first thread I read. It states that the wurmy will outdamage the lammy in the main hand until 40+ but will have lousy agro.<br />
<br />
<br />
Indeed- and unlike vaaxx, I don't have to wait for someone on steel warrior to say it, I knew it from experience.  If that makes me a &quot;noob&quot; in his book well, what can I say.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Funny, it happened last night during two mobs. Wizzies ended up getting summoned when the warrior last aggro during rage. Obviously, the casters were walking the line aggro-wise.<br />
<br />
<br />
Funny, I was not tanking for you. What your story proves is that your tank was either slacking off or doesn't quite know how to do his job yet. What it has to do with me relating I never lose aggro on stuns or enrage is somewhere between jack and sheep.<br />
<br />
<br />
Are you attempting to say that attacking has nothing to do with holding aggro?<br />
<br />
<br />
Not at all misconception man. What I am saying is that being stunned for 2 rounds has never made me lose aggro.  You see, a good warrior knows they have 3 taunt keys that are fully functional while stunned. You'd also see(again I gotta point this out, /sigh shortbus), if you actually read the thread, me pointing out that all warriors have access to stalwart endurance. If you're stuck believing frontal stun immunity is such an advantage, any warrior can have complete melee stun immunity with aa.<br />
<br />
-edit-<br />
<br />
Gart, the exe axe reference was to point out wurmslayer taunt is so crappy someone wielding a pos 2hander can gank aggro from people using it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">If you're stuck believing frontal stun immunity is such an advantage, any warrior can have complete melee stun immunity with aa.  <br />
<br />
Stalwart Endurance 3 has a roughly 70% success rate.  Far from &quot;complete melee stun immunity&quot; there, Mr. Shortbus.<br />
<br />
If your position is so weak you have to resort to insults, at least make sure your facts are correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Ponpon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Hmm,<br />
<br />
Its been my experience that just about any caster can pull aggro off MA. <br />
<br />
From my experiences raiding, Aggro management is the GUILDS responsibilty and not really the MAs.  Maybe, your being mislead by your guilds efficiency and understanding of the idea: Heal 1 person not 30 ie the MA concept.  ie, they are GIVING you aggro vs you TAKING aggro.<br />
<br />
The general method of ensuring that the MA can mantain Aggro is:<br />
<br />
1.  15+ secs of Tanking before ALL ATTACK is called.<br />
2.  DD classes hold nukes till 60%.<br />
3.  Rogues /evade often.<br />
4.  Monks /FD oten.<br />
5.  Set up a resolving Debuff/Slow group.  Ie have 1 person tash,  1 person OOS, 1 person Malo, 1 person slow.  This (ideally) prevents 1 person from getting all the hate.<br />
<br />
My understand of what an MA can do to increase TAUNT.<br />
<br />
1. Pull with a ranged weapon (generates small amout of initial aggro)<br />
2. &quot;Taunt weapons&quot; - Fast, procing weapons (best ratio possible)<br />
3. Press /TAUNT button<br />
4. Stand in the mobs face ... ie proximity aggro<br />
5. Taunt tricks, ie Snare gland, AE taunt skill, etc.<br />
<br />
Last thought is that pressing the /DEFENSE button automaticly reduces your DPS.  This makes it even harder to mantain aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">You can debate the little inconsequentials all you want but 70% from all directions = better than front only. <br />
<br />
That's a nice speech ponpon, but it is off. <br />
<br />
Most nukers do not wait till 60%, good ones start right off the bat with smaller and build from there, or zap a manaburn off the bat and then mod/med up to nuke normally. Monks don't fd, rogues do evade but whats new there. <br />
<br />
The reason you have different people oos, malo/slow, and tash is because those spells/songs belong to different classes ;) more than spreading aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Jharassik,<br />
<br />
Tash and slow are both enchanter spells.  If you don't have shaman present, splitting these duties between two enchanters is a very good ideal, especially considering the wicked taunt factor of tash vs. Malo.  You'll probably notice that enchanters don't debuff on the pull like shaman will.    <br />
<br />
Another example was Insidious Decay + Plague of Insects (for high MR, but slowable mobs) prior to the reduction of disease aggro.  Back then, assigning both of these to the same shaman was giving him a suicide mission.<br />
<br />
Granted, one player can cast both if you're not in a big hurry to get the thing slowed.<br />
<br />
I think Ponpon's point is that aggro management is everyone's concern.  Wouldn't you agree?<br />
<br />

<br />
Why not just admit you were wrong and Vaaxx was right?  You essentially already have.  Be upfront about it.<br />
<br />
If speed is so  critical, what makes a slower weapon like the Exe Axe better than a wurmslayer in your eyes?  You officially have no point, in that you aren't being remotely consistent to your own position.<br />
<br />
Unless the wurmslayer sucks simply because it sucks.  Or do you have an actual reason?<br />
<br />
BTW, you obviously didn't actually read the thread because it doesn't really say the wurmslayer aggro below 45 is lousy.  The summation gets a bit sloppy there.  You're still wrong.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Barm - I've never hit a large target without a shaman present. We love our shammies, which is why they are handcuffed to the keyboard when raid time comes around.<br />
<br />
Gart - I don't know why it sucks exactly gart, what I know is that it DOES suck, and SUCK hard. I know that from experience, from things like  being able to taunt off of someone using it with an exe axe. I realize if you don't actually have alot of melee experience you won't really understand what that means. <br />
<br />
Let me put it in shaman terms. Let's imagine we have a level 65 shaman in a raid heavy guild. He is the main slower  if he is at raids. He wears the golden booties. That's the best way I can explain it to you. <br />
<br />
90% of shammies know geb are a poor choice of footwear-shadr00d alert. With wurmslayers it's more like 99% of warriors know they are a poor, poor choice.<br />
<br />
I actually used a wurmslayer- for a day, then I resold it(level 35ish). It gav e zero taunt- I mean ZERO. You can pull better aggro with finesteel shortswords. Which is why it is such a great hybrid weapon. Good damage, no taunt.<br />
<br />
morg - I find it amusing that you think ogres are so superior :) If you're stuck on frontal stun(only mob this remotely matters on is Yeli), more power to you. I'm done arguing with small minded people who think only one race makes a good warrior. Especially when they  base that assumption off of a 99.9% useless skill(when even that .1% can be matched with aa).  <br />
