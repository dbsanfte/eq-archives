I have been in Katta for two levels (never seem to get any exp on raids or in groups, so almost 99% of the exp in those levels is Katta).  The two of you, with yer pets, could just crawl around Katta.  Lots of mobs in the tunnels, so you would not run out.  I was 56 with jbb and epic and duo'd with a 53 mage.  We did more than twice as many spawns as I could do by myself, and the mage was getting bored - nothing lived long enough to need a nuke.  The two of us did the Twilight zone in (6 static, 2 roamers) and the tunnel camp to the right (5 static and one more roamer).  I used Summon Companion to get the dang dog from one end of the walkway to another.<br />
<br />
Not sure about Seru - check the thread on doing the upper level there.  Mobs are apparently tougher than Katta, and drop more coin.  With two of you, even the mobs they warn about (Optio, iirc) are probably doable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do they stack post-patch?<br />
<br />
I have been debating this with a warrior friend who believes they do not stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yes, they have always stacked. They still do post patch. The patch did nothing for shaman except now 2 (or more) shaman can put the same dot (dot with the same name) on a mob, where as before only one of the same dot could hold on a mob at a time, but dots of the same line (diff name) would stick provided a dot with the same name wasnt already on the mob. Here are some examples of how it works now:<br />
<br />
Example 1:<br />
Shaman 1 can cast BoN on a mob<br />
SHaman 2 can also cast BoN on a mob and both stick<br />
Total Dots on mob: 2<br />
<br />
Example 2:<br />
Shaman 1 can cast BoN and Ebolt on a mob and both stick<br />
Total Dots on mob: 2<br />
<br />
Example 3: <br />
Shaman 1 can cast BoN and Ebolt on a mob and both stick<br />
Shaman 2 can also cast BoN and Ebolt on a mob and both stick<br />
Total dots on mob: 4<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In short, all shaman dots stack with each other now, regardless of name and line. The only exception is tring to cast multiples of the same dot on the same mob by one person (before the first one wears off). In this case, the 2nd one overwrites (refreshes) the first one you just cast:<br />
<br />
Example 4:<br />
Shaman 1 casts BoN twice in a row on a mob<br />
Total Dots: 1 - the 2nd one overwrites the first one he cast<br />
<br />
Example 5:<br />
Shaman 1 casts BoN Twice in a row on a mob<br />
Shaman 2 also casts BoN twice in a row on a mob<br />
Total Dots: 2 - the 2nd one overwrites the first one each of them cast, respectively<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe you are mistaken. I am 99% sure the epic dot works just like any other shaman dot. Post-patch, epic dots will stack with each other, just like 2 diff shaman casting BoN on the same mob will result in 2 BoN's being on the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">heres an example of it, <br />
<br />
one shaman casts epic dot,  1200 over time takes one bub of life from goranga hunter in ME.<br />
<br />
2 shamans cast epic dot 1200 each over time, takes 2 bubs of life from goranga hunter..<br />
<br />
only other spells cast on either mob was root, <br />
<br />
no pets used in this test<br />
<br />
:cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Yathandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks.  This gives me some new thoughts for XP groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">does epic break root less then say .. BoN or even Ebolt ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Correct... the inital DD component of BoN and EBolt is what breaks root.  Epic doesn't have the inital DD component to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">since epic doesnt have a dd hit when it lands its never broken root on me, but ebolt and BoN have a nasty little habit of breaking root when they land, that being said.....<br />
<br />
heres my order of casting when i solo<br />
<br />
pull with slow or malosini<br />
2nd cast root<br />
3rd which ever of the two i didnt pull with<br />
sick dogdog on tgt<br />
epic<br />
BoN (with a re root if needed)<br />
Ebolt re root if needed<br />
<br />
canni and replace dots as they wear off<br />
