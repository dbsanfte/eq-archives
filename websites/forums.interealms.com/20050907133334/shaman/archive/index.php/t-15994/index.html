Over the weekend I downloaded the Microsoft update patches.  I now seem to go LD almost everytime I zone.  Sometime I am able to go 1 or 2 zones then I go LD.  This is a big problem when you are getting a rez.  I currently run a P4 1.6 with Windows XP.  I tried removing the update but that did not work.  I just ran a defrag last night so I'm not sure if that will help or not.  I currently use a 56K dial up modem but will soon upgrade to cable.  I called Earthlink this morning to order.  Any help would be great.<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />

I am not sure if I should believe this or not.  Last night I called EQ tech support.  They had me look up the type of modem I use ( Lucent WinModem).  They said this is a software modem and it pushes everything back to the client server.  They said that I probably and something in the Microsoft download that affected the modem and made it not compatable any more.  I'm not sure if I should believe them or not.  Hopefully the Earthlink Cable I have ordered will fix this problem.  If not I will have to completely uninstall and reload unless somebody has a better idea.<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />
