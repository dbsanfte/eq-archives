<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I find myself trying to keep Ferine Avatar up on about 8 melees during a raid.  It lasts 9:45 for me with SCRM and no EE4 item or shawl.  Usually somebody is out of range or I am busy with something else when their turn for rebuff arrives, so 8 is about the max it seems.  I think I am currently the only shammy with FA in my guild, so this means only 8 melees get FA during the raid.  One thing I noticed last night--dont ever hit anybody with FA unless you plan on keeping it up all night, or they will hound you for the rest of the raid, particularly a sub-65 just &quot;discovering&quot; the joys of FA, hehe.<br />
<br />
What priorities do you use in deciding who the lucky 8 melees are that are going to get FA for the raid?  I usually start with the MT, then do 65 rangers, then 65 rogues, then 65 monks, then 65 tanks, then pre-65 folks.  Would it be better to do, say, the 62-65 rangers first?  Or some other set of priorities?<br />
<br />
On this topic, I saw a recent thread on the Paladin board about how folks still feel it is worth swapping weapons with their Primals to get the Avatar proc when no shaman is on FA:<br />
http://pub148.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.showMessage?topicID=2018.topic<br />
Obviously there is still a perception among melees that FA is pretty useful for them during raids for dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>legalil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well, coming from my perspective(63 Ranger EQ/AM3), i would say those classes who's jobs are designated as damage dealers.  So, Rangers and Rogues first, then Monks then whoever else.  <br />
<br />
I don't think the MT really needs FA.  his DPS is reduced because he is being hit.  it's better for the people not being hit.  If you're on a raid, your stats should be maxxed anyways so you're not really after the stat boost, but more the attack boost.  <br />
<br />
I would go with 65 Ranger then 65 Rogue then 65 monks and then work my way down with priority going to non 65 Ranger with EQ/AM3(not much of a difference between a 62 Ranger with EQ/AM3 and a 65 Ranger with it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd say the non-primal/prismatic having Rogues and Rangers first (speaking as a former member of that little club, of course). Swapping weapons is a pain, true, but not having the option to swap is even more so ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Personally I would stick to the DPS classes first Rog,Mnk,Rng. Reason being is that the higher attack rateing on them. Will allow them to turn out more DPS then what a Pal or Sk would with FA. Exception being if you are fighting undead mobs and your Pal has slay undead. Then it is worth hitting them with FA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Speaking of which, FA the BL's pet too, or mage pet, and you'll see them do mad procs.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd say the non-primal/prismatic  <br />
<br />
if your melee's are caped in atk get those first proced avatar goes tward atk cap casted dosent</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Skeeter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When I play my warrior and MT I love FA.  Ogres are immune to frontal stuns, and with strikethrough weapons and/or tactical mastery warriors can attack through ripostes/parries.  FA is great because the plus to attack rating means more hits, and melee damage is still the most reliable aggro builder.  I can tell the difference in keeping aggro when I have FA versus not.  Only time FA is not wanted is when we need to have a lot of resist buffs, then it can be tough to find the buff slot.  And sorry, the MT doesn't have the luxury of swapping in a primal weapon -- need two aggro weapons out at all times...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I use FA when I solo for both myself and my dog. It's a rare day when I ever mem that spell on a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I usually FA the people in my group on raids (melee + clerics).<br />
<br />
Depending on other shaman, if there are more w/out FA coverage than just my group, I usually go for MA/SA, then the high DPS people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I tend to FA on MT, then ROG/MNK/RNG, normally starting with those that I know don't have Primals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Obviously there is still a perception among melees that FA is pretty useful for them during raids for dps.<br />
<br />
It isn't a perception. FA gives melees a dramatic increase in their DPS. Even ones with primal/prismatics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If the mob isnt walled, I'll get the plinking AM3 rangers first, if it is I'll usually do the rogues then monks, FA'd true shot archery dps is nothing short of crazy against reasonable ac targets.<br />
<br />
In raids I'll only ever FA the MT on request, not worth risking blocking a DI or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">In XP groups it is fine to FA the MT, but not in raids. They can not spare the buff slot. MA's need to keep 3 open, SotW, PoS, and Elixer. That leaves them 12 buffs. While I agree FA might help control aggro (more EB procs), usually, with a competent raid force this shouldnt be an issue. <br />
<br />
In XP 1 group situations, though, by all means stick FA on the MT. It will definitely help control aggro. And the extra DPS doesn't suck either, even if its a pure &quot;tank&quot; class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">In my mostly regular crew, I keep the ranger and rogue up with FA, the SK MA doesn't want it as slots are a premium and he's have to give up a proc, aggro or hp buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'd have to agree with Blazz here.  FA takes up a precious buff slot for the MA on a raid, so don't bother casting.  Keep it on the AM3 rangers, rogues, and monks.<br />
<br />
In an XP group, use it as you see best, but I try to reserve it for classes that can shed agro if needed (rogue, monk, SK).  I've seen a BST with FA repeatedly pull agro from a spell taunting knight MA due to the massive amount of damage they can lay out.  Maybe I just haven't been grouped with a BST that has a full grasp of the agro management concept.  *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Several people commented that they target the 65 rangers/rogues/monks first.  I target the same classes, but I have wondered whether the increase in attack might actually mean more to a 64 or 63 who has less attack in the first place.<br />
<br />
Anyone able to comment on whether it helps more  (a) to increase the attack of your &quot;high attack' people, who are already doing good damage, or (2) to increase the attack of your &quot;marginal attack&quot; (for this mob obviously) people, who's damage is being limited by their lower attack.<br />
<br />
We are a small guild, and we usually have a few 60 - 63 rangers around on our raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I do the MA first (if warrior) for the increase to taunt procs (not on raids unless requested).  Then I pretty much go by DPS, since the higher the dps, the more damage 140 atk will add.  Just a pet theory of mine, no parses or anything to back it up.  I have no clue what the dynamics of Attack stat increases and dps really are, but it seems far more noticeable on my monk than on, say a paladin.  We would need a nice graph of dps and attack to figure it out in more detail, as I doubt it is a linear relationship.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Seichan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Personally, FA has three uses. 1) FA rotation for Rangers for fights like Fennin 2) Skilling up melee stats, like H2H, 3) Compenstaing for my ill equiped tank</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Eatbugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">From a Beastlord perspective (using Ferocity) I normally do Rangers and Rogues.  Those classes get a disproportionate increase in DPS from atk buffs - archery and backstabs both seem to be affected to a greater degree by atk than regular melee attacks are.<br />
<br />
While I'd love to tell you to keep FA up on the Beastlords or our pets, it's a waste in terms of raid DPS.  Since our damage output is spread across personal melee, pets and spells, we get a proportionately smaller increase in dps from FA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I sometimes even use FA on myself, since it's a timer for everyone else, and just takes the slot I'd have used for an AGI buff and/or PE anyway.  Also very handy for smithing, I keep it loaded.  Blam... ok, 280 STR.  combine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If the MA wants FA, he/she gets first dibs. After that, the EQ/AM3 rangers and rogues. On raids, most of the monks in my guild are busy pulling so they aren't actually sticking around to do damage for the most part, so I skip them unless we have an overabundance, meaning that there are a few sticking around in the camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I love FA, I like to cast it on people.  <br />
<br />
But trying to keep it on one melle is really difficult for me.  I can't imagine doing it on 8 for the lenght of a raid.  The biggest problem I have is, we dont have enough spell slots and I am constnatly having to swap out spells.  Trying to keep FA up prevents me from using that slot to swap out spells with.  <br />
<br />
Then, i normally just forget to cast it.</div></div><hr />
