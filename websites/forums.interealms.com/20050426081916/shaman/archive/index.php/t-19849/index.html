*deep breath* Here it goes!<br />

****<br />
<br />
The bartender of the Tavern of the Morning Rose was cheerfully whistling as he served a crowded bar drinks and kept a wary eye on the stage for what he liked to call “tomfoolery.” Ever-suspicious since the fateful night he was soundly pranked by the followers of Bristlebane, he watched carefully for nonsense or anything else that might disturb his orderly business. Thus when Verileah made her usual noisy entrance into the tavern, his orders were quick and subtle; hide anything breakable and get the awkward barbarian seated and steady as quickly as possible. Not that the bartender disliked the well-meaning shaman; the young lady had wormed her way into his heart somewhere between the time she broke every dish in the tavern and the time she blew up his best cauldron. But business was business and the bartender was nothing if not careful. Seeing the white-haired shaman seated reasonably safely at a barbarian-sized barstool, he approached her to put her usual mug in her hand, taking in her unusually quiet demeanor and the soft smile on her somewhat more weathered face.<br />
<br />
“Yer usual miss!” he barked in his usual gruff way as he shoved the steaming mug of hot brew into her hands. But as he stepped back to continue his work, he noticed a long white scar that ran from Verileah’s elbow to her wrist. Concerned, he gave her a solid poke in the ribs and grumbled at the injury.<br />
<br />
“A’ right now. What sort of mess have ye gotten yerself into this time? Been dealin’ wit the wrong sort of folk from the look of it!”<br />
<br />
Verileah grunted at the bartender, then picked up her mug and emptied it. Wiping the foam from her upper lip, she flashed the bartender a grin and said “It looks worse than it is old man. And…it has a story. It’s the right sort of scar, you see?”<br />
<br />
“Right sort of scar indeed! Sounds like more of yer usual tomfoolery to me! Probably got that fighting with that feller that insulted yer kind er some such. Pfft, story indeed!”<br />
<br />
Verileah grinned in a knowing sort of way, and leaned in closer to the bartender, who was feigning disinterest as he dried off freshly washed mugs with a towel.<br />
<br />
“Oh, but there is a story old man. And it all started with a gnome,” the barbarian said with a nod of her head.<br />
<br />
“Ha! Well, as they say, you can’t trust a gnome, so you can’t trust stories that involve ‘em neither. That’s what they say you know.”<br />
<br />
“Is that so? Well, that gnome over there seems to be fetching you quite a bit of business tonight. Shall you send him away? Seeing as how he can’t be trusted…”<br />
<br />
Indeed, there seemed to be quite a crowd growing around a grinning bald-headed gnome and his accompanying spectre pet. The gnome was gesturing for silence from the crowd, but they could not contain their gasp of shock when the pet fell over dead, or their roar of laughter when the spectre sprung back to life.<br />
<br />
The bartender dried his mugs all the more vigorously as he muttered to himself.<br />
<br />
“Well now. As you were saying, it all started with a gnome?”<br />
<br />
Verileah managed to hide her smirk behind the once again full mug of brew. “Ah, yes. A gnome. You see, this gnome advised me that some of my fellow shaman had a mystery to solve before it destroyed them all. Always seems to be that sort of mystery happening in these strange lands, wouldn’t you say? At any rate, he mentioned that these shaman would go to any lengths to solve the mystery and free those who had suffered its consequences. In fact, he mentioned that those who aided the shaman would be most well rewarded. So naturally I set out to discover the shaman he spoke of and aide them in their search for the truth. Only, well…”<br />
<br />
The bartender felt fit to stomp his little foot at the sudden pause in the story, but somehow managed to maintain a reasonable amount of disdain for the subject at hand. He did steal a few furtive looks at the barbarian as she once again drained her mug, and he tried to keep from muttering to himself as he refilled it. <br />
<br />
“Well, you see, they were…well, they were Iksars.”<br />
<br />
At this the bartender could no longer contain himself. Opening his mouth with no idea of what was about to come out (though he suspected it would involve some rather severe swearing), he managed to surprise even himself with a roar of deep and sincere laughter. <br />
<br />
“Iksar! Iksar! And you, as barbarian as the night is dark, thinking you could just stroll in and speak with the likes of them! Iksar!” With that, he abandoned his rather worried towel and completely dry mugs, pulled up a barstool, and plunked down next to Verileah. <br />
<br />
“So, tell me. What was the look on their faces when you strolled up to their gates and demanded to speak with the Cabilis Mystics?”<br />
<br />
“I…can’t say I recall the look on their faces. Sorry to say.”<br />
<br />
“Well, what did they say to you then? Surely they said something to you!”<br />
<br />
“I’m…pretty sure they did. I rather recall they had quite a lot to say to me…but I don’t rightly remember the words.”<br />
<br />
“Well then what in the world happened then? You can’t expect me to believe you walked right up to the guards of Cabilis with yer parisol and high heels on and shared a glass of lemonade with them after all!”<br />
<br />
Verileah looked straight into the bartender’s eyes. Behind the somewhat grave expression, the bartender almost detected a twitch as if she were suppressing a smile. <br />
<br />
“They hit me. A lot.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, now miss. See here now, you can’t expect any better from those folk. You know what they say about the Iksar, why they say…”<br />
<br />
Verileah held up her hand for quiet, and much to her surprise the bartender closed his mouth with an audible snap. <br />
<br />
“Yes, old man, they were a rather rough bunch at first. Chased me out of the city more than a few times, and roughed up a dear friend who tried to trick them into thinking I was a long time ally of theirs…but slowly, over time, and with the help of many of my dear friends, I began to win them over. It was mostly thanks to a certain guard who had a passion for gambling and challenged my abilities to slaughter the undead that plagued his lands for a sum if I brought back proof. Little did he know that for the most part I wasn’t killing the wandering skeletons at all! This gnomish friend of mine happens to be an expert in all matters undead and provided me with all the proof I needed to satisfy the gambling guard. In the end they welcomed me with open arms, especially after hearing a funny little story I told them.”<br />
<br />
“Oh? Funny story eh?”<br />
<br />
“Well…it’s actually rather embarrassing and cost me as many friends as I won, but, well, see, Jobober, my little pet, rather took sick one day while I was hunting in the Lake of Ill Omen. Just sort of…went berserk I guess. I was resting in a watch tower at the time, and by the time I got the poor beast under control he had managed to have a rather, er, fatal impact on some of the explorers camping in the tower with me. Now the Iksar thought the whole thing was quite hilarious…the folk of Fironia Vie, though…well, they weren’t quite so amused.”<br />
<br />
“Hmmph. Well, I’ve always been one to say that if yer going to have pets you best be responsible for them. Can’t say I approve, beggin’ yer pardon, but I suppose it can’t be helped now. So what happened when you earned the favor of Cabilis? Did you get to meet the Mystics, and speak of the mystery?”<br />
<br />
“Indeed I did. Naturally at first they were skeptical, but eventually the wise shaman of Cabilis mentioned that three skulls had disappeared from their temple. These skulls were in fact closely guarded relics of, as they said, ‘soon to be ancients’. From their careful words I determined the loss of the skulls was a result of treachery from within. I did not have to wander outside the city to find the outcast Iksars who had robbed the temple of its sacred relics. The wise ones were most pleased when I returned the skulls to them, and were generous in their reward. From there, they mentioned still more skulls that had been lost. These took a bit more searching to retrieve; one had somehow ended up in the belly of a great fish, while the other had been smashed in two. I managed to repair it, and hoped the Cabilis mystics would not notice when I returned the skulls to their care.”<br />
<br />
“Hmmph. Strange folk indeed. I don’t rightly understand what they wanted with some old skulls in the first place. Creepy business, if you ask me, beggin’ yer pardon.”<br />
<br />
Verileah managed to stop herself from rolling her eyes as she downed yet another brew. As she took her time placing her mug just so and wiping her mouth with her sleeve, the bartender grew impatient.<br />
<br />
“Well?”<br />
<br />
“Well? Oh, yes. So the mystics seemed satisfied with my work. Indeed, they were satisfied beyond what I had expected, for one began heralding me as the chosen savior of the lost Iksar skulls. More than a little intimidating to become a chosen savior overnight, let me tell you. But as I had started down this road wanting to see where it would take me, I felt I must continue. When I was then given the task of recovering the skulls of the Caste of Bone Brethren, I complied willingly. Had I known what a task it would be I might have simply left the city and never returned; the undead crusaders who carried the missing skulls were no easy thing to find. But in the end, find them I did, and I returned the sacred skulls to their keepers in Cabilis.”<br />
<br />
“Pfft. Don’t go getting big headed from what yer new friends are fillin’ yer head with. Was pure barbarian mulishness that got you those skulls, none of this ‘chosen savior’ rubbish. Harrumph!”<br />
<br />
“Be that as it may, old man, the temple was pleased by my endeavors. Pleased enough to keep rewarding me here and there when I gave them skulls. And so it continued. The Crusaders of Rok Nolok, it seems, had suffered some wretched curse of the gods, and their skulls too were thought to be lost forever. Tracking those skulls, which had shrunken due to some magical rain and burned with a feverish glow long after their owners had parted from them, was blessedly easier than finding the skulls of the Bone Brethren at least. These skulls I gave to a sad and lonely Iksar who seemed more deeply pained than I could understand at the horrors the Rok Nolok had suffered before their death. It was a great relief to him to have the skulls returned so he could go about honoring them and putting their souls to rest.”<br />
<br />
“It was then that he said something…strange, to my ears at least. He told me of more skulls that must be retrieved, the skulls of Di Nozok, which I was of course glad to do if only to offer some small light into this mournful Iksar’s world. He then told me to return the skulls to a Mystic of the Temple…he said…how did it go…he said “I shall wait within Zand.” This is what first led me to believe there was more to the retrieval of these skulls than there appeared to be. It was clear to me now that there were greater and more mysterious forces at work then those of a simple shaman and a handful of old mystics.”<br />
<br />
“Unable to contain my curiosity in light of this new information, I retrieved the skulls as quickly as I could. It took a bit of bribery and manipulation on my part, but in the end the skulls were brought back to where they belonged.”<br />
<br />
The bartender, seeing that Verileah would go no further until her mug was once again full, began to fill it with a frown. He motioned to give the drink to the barbarian, but hesitated and kept the mug, getting out a freshly washed one and filling that as well. He set both on the bar and crinkled his great forehead into an impossible number of little folds and crevices.<br />
<br />
“Now see here miss. This is quite a tale you be telling me here, and I’ve believed it, every word, up to a point. But what yer talkin’ about here, this bit about ‘mysterious forces at work’ and folks talkin’ but not really bein’ them talkin’…well, these Iksar, they’re a tricky bunch, and I just don’t want to see a nice girl like you bein’ taken in by a bunch of…”<br />
<br />
Verileah’s face darkened at his words and she cut him off with nearly a snarl. “Hear me out old man. If you doubt at the end I will think no less of you, save to think you are nothing more than what your precious “they” say. Now I don’t know about being a chosen savior, and I’m willing to put a dose of doubt into the stories and legends these people have told me, but I tell you this: there are things I have seen with my own eyes, heard with my own ears, that cannot be denied. So if you are willing to write the tales of the Iksar off as trickery perhaps you had best say the same of my own tales and be done with it.”<br />
<br />
“Now now, miss, I meant no offense, truly I did not. I see that in spite of your light hearted telling you have been much affected by this quest. Forgive me, and continue your tale.”<br />
<br />
At this, Verileah seemed to remember herself, and the dark look vanished from her face as quickly as it had appeared. “Old man, I am the one who must ask for forgiveness. I understand this tale borders on outrageous at times. I must simply ask for your trust, and in as great of quantity as I ask for your patience in the telling of this tale. Perhaps more. I should not have taken that for granted, and I am at the mercy of your judgment.”<br />
<br />
The bartender chuckled and smiled warmly at the shaman. “And I, I am at the mercy of this tale! Do finish it. I do not promise to believe the way you believe, but I will listen and I will trust you are not spinning deceit, whether your own or that of the Iksar.”<br />
<br />
With that, Verileah and the bartender both downed their drinks together and shared a mutual smile.<br />
<br />
“Ah, now where was I? Ah yes, I returned the skulls to Zand, who I must admit seemed the same as always to me. But when Zand told me to visit Hierophant Dexl, my suspicions returned. I did indeed speak with Dexl (an Iksar almost as cranky as you, old man). He ignored me most rudely until I mentioned who had sent me. I don’t know what impulse brought me to make this claim, but on the other hand I do not think it was a lie after all. I told him Di Nozok sent me.”<br />
<br />
“I could never have expected what happened next. Dexl’s eyes rolled back in his head, and when they again met mine I knew I was not looking at Dexl at all. A voice came from his mouth, but it was not his own voice. Rather, it seemed to be three voices, voices of females with soft, almost musical tones, but heavy and terrible at the same time. They told me they were the Sisters of the Scale, and they had been expecting me. They implored me to find their lost skulls and return them.”<br />
<br />
“The moment the Sisters finished speaking, I could tell they were gone, but I called to them anyway, hoping they would return. I asked them ‘who are you, who are the Sisters of the Scale?’ But alas, I was too late, and got only the half answers of Dexl, who advised me that the Sisters were a legendary trio of mystics, and that he had already sent out a channeler to retrieve their missing skulls. He told me that this channeler was a gifted alchemist who would be able to protect himself from harm with his potions, but that I might as well try to check up and see how he’s faring. I admit I was alarmed when I heard Dexl’s words, though I cannot say in hindsight if it was a simple fear of once again going into the unknown, or a more genuine foreboding. I can only say that I felt in my heart the channeler Dexl spoke of was in grave danger. When I heard of the discovery of a potion that would allow one’s mind to be blocked from intrusion my sense of dread grew, and it became clear to me where the channeler had gone, and what his fate may have been. I managed to create what I hoped was the correct potion, although the recipe was an unfamiliar one. But still, I balked at going into the black Crypt of Dalnir and possibly meeting the same fate as the channeler. So with me I took a gifted bard, to keep our minds clear and our bodies swift and strong against the enemy. I took a fierce beastlord who knew no fear, who could rip through the enemy with his savage claws. And finally I took a brave necromancer, an expert in all matters undead and one well versed in the dark crypt we would soon find ourselves in. Together the four of us unleashed a fury unlike any ever seen in that evil lair. The demented beings of that place fell against us like waves, but again and again we pushed them back until at last, when we were at the brink of exhaustion (and some of us long over the brink), we found the channeler. He had indeed been overpowered in the crypt, and his mind was a twisted and pitiful thing to behold. With the potion I gave him he was able to respond to me enough to understand that I was there to find the skulls of the Sisters of the Scale, but after giving me the one he had apparently managed to recover, he ranted some nonsense about going where pines have been smashed and reaching great heights, and fled from me.”<br />
<br />
“At this point I must admit I was at a loss. I had managed to retrieve one skull of the sisters, but surely there should be three. Where had the other two gone? It was then that I remembered the channeler’s words. Strange though they were, perhaps there was more to them than the insane ranting of a broken Iksar. I took a trip to Burning Woods to search for clues, for that whole land appears smashed and broken to the eyes. There I found a tower, one that I recognized as belonging to the Sarnaks. Suddenly it all became clear; the Sarnaks in the Crypt, the Sarnaks here…clearly the channeler had discovered some connection between the skulls and the Sarnaks, though why those perversions would take an interest in Iksar skulls I failed to understand. I went boldly to the top of the tower and demanded the skulls of the Sisters from the Sarnak watching with beady eyes from the platform. He did not insult me by lying. Rather, he chose to make the most out of his situation, apparently believing I had already discovered the truth. He told me he would trade. A skull for a skull, he said, and would not have it any other way. He claimed that long ago, he was a slave to an Iksar. He wished me to find this Iksar, and kill him, expressing his wishes to mount the skull to his wall.”<br />
<br />
“I did find the Iksar he spoke of. I am not certain, but I believe the nasty Sarnak knew exactly what had happened to him; it seemed the once prominent Iksar’s fate had turned on him, and now it was he that was enslaved. He was…pitiful to behold. I confess…I had not the heart to kill him, though he was no friend to me. Fortunately the fearless beastlord had accompanied me to find the Iksar, and had the good sense to understand what must be done. It was some small comfort to me that the beastlord thought it a kindness to end the Iksar’s misery. I took his skull, and journeyed to Burning Woods once more.”<br />
<br />
At this, Verileah paused and shakily took a sip from her drink. What the bartender first took for simple weariness he soon realized was in fact barely containable rage.<br />
<br />
“And do you know,” the shaman said, slamming her mug on the counter, “do you know what that bastard Sarnak did when I gave him the skull? He tossed it out the window to smash among the cobblestones like rubbish! And then he said in his nasty reedy voice, ‘Oh, so sad you see, but I’ve already given the skull to another. Perhaps you’d like to meet him? Say hello, why don’t you, he’s right behind you.’ And then he laughed as I spun around to meet the wicked Sarnak who held a sacred skull in his hand, and he laughed at my face as I saw that he was not a Sarnak at all! The one the bastard had gifted with the skull was an Iksar, and one I knew well, one I had seen walk freely among the people of Cabilis! I was consumed with fury and disgust at the sight of him, and we battled fiercely in that tower high in the sky. The Sarnak laughed and laughed, and healed his friend Iksar, but I bested him anyway, and took the skull from his dying clutches.”<br />
<br />
The bartender quickly took Verileah’s mug from her grasp before she could take another torturously slow sip and leaned forward, lowering his voice to a whisper and ducking his head. “So…who was it? Who was the traitor Iksar?”<br />
<br />
Verileah hesitated at this. Her eyes flicked around the room before leaning in so she was nearly nose to nose with the bartender, and her whispers had an almost desperate quality to them. “I…you must understand. I never spoke of this to the Cabilis Mystics. Not the skull of the Iksar Slave, not the traitor…none of it. I am, in the end, not of their kind, and I knew they would never forgive me for the murder of their own. I knew they would not believe me if I told them of the traitor that walked among them. But I will tell you, because I know I must trust you if I expect you to trust me. It was…” At this, Verileah lowered her voice so it could barely be heard by the bartender, much less anyone else within earshot. The bartender’s eyes widened in surprise and horror at the name she whispered and his face flushed to an angry purple shade.<br />
<br />
“Why…but! Of all the dirty, filthy…”<br />
<br />
“Keep your voice down!” Verileah hissed.<br />
<br />
“You mean to tell me that Clerk Doval is a traitor to his own kind? And you did nothing to stop this? It makes my blood boil, it does, and here you sit…”<br />
<br />
“I will tell you only once more to Keep. Your. Voice. Down. I have given you my reasons and will say no more on this dark subject.”<br />
<br />
“Whole damn tale is dark! All death and darkness and betrayal! Why did you come here Verileah, why did you tell me this awful tale?”<br />
<br />
“I am sorry. It started off light enough, and ends well enough, but I can see it is too much for you. I will stop. Here, I will buy you a drink. We can talk of lighter things ‘til sunup, and I will have you forgetting this bad business before long. What do you say?”<br />
<br />
“I say what’s done is done. Just finish the damn story and be quick about it, you know I wouldn’t let you stop even if you wanted to; I’d badger and bother until the whole thing was out in the open. Just…get on with it.”<br />
<br />
“Alright then. Are you sure?” With a warning glare from the bartender, Verileah continued. “I was weary in body and mind when I returned to Cabilis with two of the three skulls, when what should I hear but a rumor of a greedy Iksar putting the last skull up for sale! Eagerly I sought out this Iksar, who told me the skull had been sold. My heart fell and I nearly lost hope, but the Iksar took pity on me and promised to tell me who bought the skull if I would do him a small favor, a bit of research for his craft. That was easily enough completed, and I gladly returned to the Iksar to trade information. Unfortunately, the buyer, a hulking bully named, predictably, Bruiser, had beaten me there, and had already managed to upset the fortune-seeking Iksar. The poor thing had actually soiled himself with fright! I knew what had to be done, and I put that Bruiser right back in his place, six feet under thank you very much. And so the last skull was found.”<br />
<br />
“I returned to Dexl with the skulls and once again heard the voices of the Ancients through him, telling me I had done well. I admit…I felt some guilt at this. If they had known what I had to do in order to get these skulls…well, no use thinking about it now. They thanked me, and rewarded me.”<br />
<br />
“And so I was once again lost. I wandered the city of Cabilis, not knowing quite what to do with myself, the heavy burden of guilt that I carried, and the sense that this was not the end of the tale at all. I stayed there for some time, until in my wanderings I came across an oracle named Granix who spoke of restless dreams and visions. When pressed, he spoke of a city where the dead do not rest as they should and wished for a way to bring them to peace. Finally I was ready to continue in my search for the lost skulls of Cabilis, and knew what I had to do. I also knew I could not do it alone. Once again I consulted my brilliant necromancer friend, who was kind enough to accompany me to the abandoned city of the Iksar, Charasis. Together we opened door after door in the dungeon, which turned out to be quite populated by all forms of beasts both living and dead, and at long last found our way to the southern most wing of the dungeon where the restless dead walked. This was quite an exhausting task in and of itself, but when we were joined by the mighty beastlord we once again found our strength. We battled our way through the dungeon and discovered skull after Iksar skull to return to Granix for investigation. The clever necromancer even braved the dreaded eastern most wing to retrieve the powerful key that would open any door in Charasis, for we knew we would be returning to that accursed place.<br />
<br />
“I returned to Cabilis with the skulls for Granix to investigate, but after looking at one he knew it was beyond him to resolve the pain he saw in the skulls I carried. He sent me to another Oracle, one well versed in the ways of freeing spirits from their undead bondage. His name was Oracle Quiln, and it seemed he too was expecting me, a sensation I will never quite get used to. I gave him the same skull I had previously shown Granix, and Quiln was pleased. He performed a ritual, a sacred rite to recover the spirit locked in the skull and release it at last. I will not speak of it, for it is holy to them and I would not defile their beliefs for your curiosity, old man. I will only say that for one moment I was able to completely believe, without doubt, that these greater forces I do not claim to understand were both real and powerfully relevant.<br />
<br />
“And then I rather got the living daylights scared out of me. Apparently Oracle Quiln, in his own way, was telling me that the skull would reanimate, attach itself to its former skeleton, and come to attack me. Perhaps I just don’t speak Iksar well. A darn lucky thing my mighty beastlord partner was watching from behind a rock and was able to assist me in vanquishing the arisen Iksar and putting it to rest at last. When we were through there was naught but fragments left, and I thought surely the quest was at last completed. However, when I showed Quiln the fragments, he seemed to feel the spirit was not at rest at all, that it was in fact rebelling, driven mad by some evil he did not know. He advised me to speak with Granix again, who spoke of removing the spirits by force and gave me a mighty weapon to complete the task.<br />
<br />
“Is that…” the bartender said, gesturing to an oddly shaped cudgel leaning against the barbarian’s barstool.<br />
<br />
“No. Getting to that.”<br />
<br />
“And what about…” the bartender pointed once again to the scar on Verileah’s forearm.<br />
<br />
“We’re almost there, I promise.”<br />
<br />
“Ah, right then. Carry on.”<br />
<br />
“Indeed. Granix then spoke more of the visions and voices, voices of the ancients, which clouded his mind and gave him no peace. Amongst these confused mutterings I gleaned that Kaesora was some sort of focal point and decided to visit this dungeon. Once again, my ever faithful friends accompanied me...”<br />
<br />
“Way I heard it you fell into a pit full of spiders and had to be dragged out,” the bartender muttered.<br />
<br />
“As I was saying, my dear and loyal friends assisted me in this venture to delve into the dark and mysterious…oh shut up old man.”<br />
<br />
“Sorry, sorry. Go on.”<br />
<br />
“Right. Eventually we found the one we sought, a twisted necromancer hidden deep in the dungeon, and vanquished him.”<br />
<br />
“After you fell on your as…”<br />
<br />
“Shut. Up. On the necromancer Xalgoz I discovered a necklace of shrunken Iksar skulls, which I thought might be significant. Upon exiting the dungeon, I came across the strangest Iksar I have ever met. He spoke entirely in gestures, indicating I should give him the necklace I had found. This he put into a bag after giving me a most unnerving stare. Then he gestured for me to put my hand out. Something about him, some strange commanding aura, forced me to comply without hesitation. I simply knew I must obey him. That knowledge did nothing to soften the sudden pain I felt as he sliced my arm open, allowing my blood to flow into the bag with the skulls. But before I could so much as cry out (or worse, cut him right back), it was over, and suddenly he was speaking. He told me I now shared the mark of the Rile, that our fates were intertwined. The Rile, he said, was the son of the greatest and most terrible emperor the Iksar have ever known, and the skulls on the necklace were those of traitors of Rile’s relics. The strange Iksar continued, saying, much to my astonishment, that the emperor had risen and must be defeated.<br />
<br />
“Though my heart was filled with fear at these terrible and twisted stories, I knew that I was now ready to finish this task. The Iksar Oracle was much less odd now…I would guess he seemed nearly normal because he chose to communicate with me after marking me, but some say that the mark changed me much more than it changed him. At any rate, he was clear in explaining what had to be done. He would need a true relic of Rile, and the soul of Rile’s father. Finally, he would need a vessel to siphon the emperor’s soul.<br />
<br />
“These things I brought before the Oracle, after slaughtering many of the Emperor’s servants and a…projection, an image, of the Emperor himself. There was just enough of the Emperor’s soul animating this illusion to complete the task. The Oracle was well pleased. Finally the tortured souls of Charasis could be put to rest. However, force was still needed to tear these spirits from the dark rituals that tied them to this world. <br />
<br />
“And so once again my dear friends walked with me to the city of Charasis. Not one but two manipulators of the undead forces came to my aide; one the clever gnome I spoke of earlier, the other an adventurous and daring dark elf. The mighty and fearless beastlord offered his savage claws to the cause. A stout and steadfast ogre volunteered his sword to the slaying of these pitiful apparitions. Finally, a high elf priestess gifted us with her powers over life and death itself in order to keep our gathering on the side of light. With this fellowship I knew we could not fail in our task.<br />
<br />
“We entered the city. Waves upon waves of warped beings rushed our path and crashed against the broad chest of the ogre as we destroyed them. Quickly we tore through the tunnels, slaughtering everything that dared cross our path (and more besides as a certain necromancer took much joy in the killing of these pitiful creatures). At last I stood face to face with an Iksar apparition. I showed him the Iksar relics I had received from the mysterious Oracle and suddenly felt a great force fly through me and into the Iksar. The very walls seemed to tremble with power…an Emperor’s power. Guards appeared from out of thin air, and it was then that I cried out to my fellow adventurers ‘Fall back! Verily, the Emperor has come! Fall back!’<br />
<br />
“The Emperor, no more than a swirling and malformed mass of bones, took no interest in me. Rather, he had come for his son, the one he had managed to imprison all these long years in Charasis. The one I had awoken when I showed him the Iksar relics. They battled there for what seemed like an age before the Emperor finally defeated the Rile once more. And then he saw us.<br />
<br />
“Before we knew it, the Emperor and his guards were upon us! Fiercely we fought the undead spirits, and quickly we succeeded. Every one of the fellowship showed their might in a show of defiance against these wicked undead. But after the Emperor and his guards were no more than a high pile of bones on the floor, we saw yet another apparition. I approached him cautiously, not knowing if he meant us harm, for I saw that there stood the spirit of Rile. But he beckoned me closer and urgently whispered the last thing I must do. I obeyed, and though I often fail to understand Iksar and their ways, I do believe he smiled before his body and spirit vanished without a trace. He was free at last.<br />
<br />
“I turned back to my friends with a somewhat heavy heart. You see, the Rile’s final instruction was to use my reward from the Iksar to unite his body and soul so they may be freed. It was, naturally, destroyed, and I would miss the reward I had worked so hard to earn. But as I stepped toward my party I noticed their uncertain expressions, as if they did not recognize me. At first I believed they were simply recovering from a long and well fought battle, but then I felt for the first time an unfamiliar weight in my hand. I looked down, and I saw…well, here, see for yourself.”<br />
<br />
Verileah gestured to the cudgel that rested on her barstool, then picked it up with one hand to show the bartender. At first he saw only a sort of a sphere with great metal spikes encircling it, all mounted onto an ornate handle, but as Verileah turned the cudgel he saw that it was not some crafted sphere at all. It was a grotesque skull that seemed to stare right through him, and he nearly jumped at the sight of it. However, he quickly remembered his manners and even managed a small if somewhat sickly smile for the barbarian.<br />
<br />
“Well that’s…that’s real nice miss. Real fitting. Suits you, it does. Yes, very nice…thing...you have…”<br />
<br />
The bartender’s eyes had drifted down to around his shoes as he spoke, but he risked a quick glance at the shaman to see if he had managed to fool her. He came face to face with a broad smirk, and he and Verileah shared a hearty laugh as they guzzled the last of their brews.<br />
<br />
“Right then Miss. Quite a tale you’ve told me tonight, quite a tale. But I can’t be sitting on my old duff all day and night you know; why, I have work to do in the kitchens!”<br />
<br />
“Work? Well why didn’t you say so? I can certainly help with that! Where shall I start?”<br />
<br />
The bartender looked most uncomfortable at Verileah’s offer. Memories of destroyed party platters and boiled over stews flashed through his mind as he forced a wide grin and spoke through partially clenched teeth.<br />
<br />
“Now miss, you don’t need to be doing none of that. You just sit here and enjoy yer brew, I may be old but I’ve managed long enough without you, see?”<br />
<br />
Verileah looked so crestfallen at this that the bartender almost felt guilty enough to allow his precious kitchen to be disrupted once again by the barbarian. Almost. Still, feeling he ought to say something to cheer her up, he suddenly remembered a rumor he had picked up from a band of travelers.<br />
<br />
“Now if you want to go helping folk with their kitchen business, I hear tell that some of them Coldain dwarven folk are looking for trades folk to help around the home front. Maybe not a glamorous adventure, but it’d be good honest work for you, which you seem to be wantin’ as of late.”<br />
<br />
Verileah brightened at this, and the newly found sparkle in her eyes was almost enough to wipe the bartender’s guilt away. He wandered back to the kitchens, muttering a nearly silent prayer that the dwarves forgive him.</div></div><hr />
