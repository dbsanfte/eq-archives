<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>timcooper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just got ahbs/renderer combo and people have said something with crit heals have been nerfed, i was gonna work on these AA shortly wondering if anyone has any info ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Archyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No idea from personal experience, but I know that at one time (as of the last time I visited the Sk web page) that lifetap procs and healing gift type abilites granted a chance to fire healing adept crit heals, now that being said I have seen the SK Leech Touch fire with a spell casting fury 3 and unholy touch 3, doing an insane amount of HT, somewhere in the near 5k dmg range and healing himself for that much as well.....talk about an impressive site, but like EQ/AM3 reauires insane amounts of AA...<br />
I have also seen a few paladins I know using the black acriyla halbred get their healing gift AA to fire on a weapon proc; this was as of 4 months ago (last time I was grouped with a paladin using that particular combo) so it may have changed now.<br />
I also would be interested, I have considered going this route on my AA at some point and would like to know if its still working.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vladimirr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nerfed how?<br />
<br />
I still get crit heals, from regular-heal spells, from Lay Hands, and from my weapon's proc.  This as of last night.  Fun stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dartaniun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">not to be a hijacker or anything, i just have to say that i love your sig Vlad, i played final fantasy so much on my old nintendo that it was insane how many times i beat it with different groups :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Roophus Gunthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I always wanted to try out using a lifetap procing weapon with healing gift and casting fury.  I only have 1 casting fury and 1 healing gift, so I dont have much use for it right now.  I wanted to finish working on am3/eq before I went back to get the small things like that.</div></div><hr />
