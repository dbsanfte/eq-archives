<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>demolition</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hello, new shaman here, been playing a monk almost all myeq life and saw the huge role that a shamen plays.  im lev 24 now, and getting ready for canni, woot.  i have a fungi from my monk and pretty much melee'd to 24.  so, the question is, do i wear the fungi to help offset canni, or switch out for wis/hp gear?<br />
<br />
as one new to all this, i asume that my melee days in grouping are pretty much over, but how successful can a shaman solo?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">fungi till 50ish, then get HP/ac gear once your wis is stabilzed about 200, valorium rings of gallantry at 46 will help, and keep up the melee to max those skills, when things go bad root, back up heal med/canni up rinse and repeat</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, keep the fungi for a while yet. When I solo'd I would often melee until almost lvl 50 (non planes). Just make sure you get your AC and HPs up. When mobs at this lvl are slowed if root breaks or dog can't hold aggro it's not a big deal. Just let them beat on you while they're dotted and doggy bites their butt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm...I disagree with Nuzum.<br />
<br />
Fungi for as long as you can wear it and get away with it, but HP/AC everwhere else.  Wis does NOT need to be 200to be effective.  Untill I hit 60+ my wis generally floated around 150 to 170 depending on the mix of gear I had at the time and I never hurt for mana.  Actually, in my late 30's I was aiming for 200+ wis, but I died so much that I had to change.  Go for HP/AC...wis will follow with better gear.  I knew an ogre shaman back just after Luclin that had 130 wis at  57 and was one of the best, most effective shaman I've known.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd wear the fungi at least until you got Stoicism at 44.  If you decide to keep wearing, re-examine at 60 with Torpor.<br />
<br />
When you get Quiescence at 65, it'll be out the door.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well I sorta agree and disagree with you both. :p Your wis should be whatever your usual group dictates. If you usually solo or play in groups with healers, then ignore the wis stat and let it rise as you get better gear - go hp/ac all the way. If you are often the primary healer, the extra wis will come in handy as long as you don't go wearing jasper rings or plat ruby veils etc (ie don't sacrifice everything else for a few wis). Experience will tell you whether you need a bigger mana pool or can focus on your hp gear, although the golden rule is hp&gt;all with canni (if you have time to regen the mana in-between using it, then it doesn't matter how big your mana pool is).<br />
<br />
The Fungi will do you until the late 50s if you solo with melee. I can't remember how long I melee'd until, but I do know that when I only had an hour or so to play I would mess around in BW in my early 50s and a Fungi then would have made a LOT of difference.<br />
<br />
As for the rest, you can solo as well as anyone else tbh. And melee in a group isn't out of the question either if you're not healing and the mob is debuffed. Horses for courses, you can do a pretty good job of most things as a shaman, the important thing is to do what you enjoy, that's what keeps the class fun.</div></div><hr />
