<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Christabel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know there was a great thread about this in the old forum. But I couldn't turn anything up with a search. So I'm just curious what classes people think are the least gear dependent at this stage of the game (top 3 maybe). It's been a while since I played. So I don't really know how things shake out anymore.<br />
<br />
And the sort of encounters Im talking about, for a context to the question, would be one (1) group of players attempting to do things that were very difficult for them (since that's where any class would need to flex their entire arsenal of abilities). So if one group wanted to kill the chardok queen for instance, which classes would hinder the effort least by having ghetto gear?<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Banuddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, it used to be monks, but now I'd probably say:<br />
<br />
1. Necromancers<br />
2. Magicians<br />
3. Clerics<br />
<br />
All 3 can do just fine with low end gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">why not a shaman? i mean if we are regening and cannibilzing so long has keep a fair amount of HP does not matter how much we have, just so long as not tanking.  and in a raid/semi raid enviornment i try my best not to pull agro even though it would be quite fun.<br />
<br />
just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mystreez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would prolly have to insert druids above clerics in the list there.  Most casters can get away with ghetto gear because they are more mana dependent.  However some casters have aggro issues that sort of necessitates some AC/HP/Def like enchanters, shaman, and clerics.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think druids would be number one, since the only way they'll catch agro is by making a serious blunder.<br />
<br />
Second, I would say Magician. Pet takes all the hits and the mage would need to chain nuke to catch agro.<br />
<br />
For third, I would say Beastlord. They aren't exactly a major melee class, since their pet does all the work and they can easily get away with mediocre gear.<br />
<br />
I would have to disagree with putting Necros in this list, because in high level situations, it is very easy for a Necro to catch agro. Theft of Vitae is great spell that can get a Necro killed or save a group. VI did the right thing by making Necros group friendly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I put magician's at the top of the list.<br />
<br />
To be effective, a magician needs exactly one thing : Malachite. (and Epic Mages don't even need that). <br />
<br />
Mages can supply themselves with Focus Items, Resist Gear, Food, Water, Bags, Weapons....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Monk or Rogue.<br />
<br />
Monk epic.<br />
Rogue epic + another poker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">good question.  classes with all their spells and no gear....hmm....i would have to say that in raid or grouping situation straight melee classes are out...(i am assuming NO gear).  i would have to say mages number 1, but in a lot of raid situations pets are a no no... maybe druids number 2 (what do they really do in raid situations anyway..)...number 3 a good necro or a good shaman.<br />
1. mage (if pets are allowed)<br />
2. druid (who needs'em for anything but CoS)<br />
3. necro/shaman (with full spells of course)<br />
<br />
classes having just crappy gear...well that could be a toss up in my opinion.  anything but an MA/SA/TA?<br />
<br />
then again 12 wizards with no gear mana burning gore would hinder no one lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
manaburn damage is determined by the size of your mana pool.  If you're naked, you have a very small mana pool.  I'm pretty sure 12 naked wizards could do it, but it would be a lot harder to find 12 MB wizards than the normal 4 :)<br />
<br />
anyways, the answer is mage.<br />
<br />
/pet kill<br />
/sit on<br />
/cheer jabober<br />
<br />
Druids need a fairly large mana pool to quad kite and also to help deal with emergencies in groups.<br />
<br />
a naked shaman that isnt being hit is still very effective.  I've had to do a few CR fights naked and the only real difference is that turgur's takes 1/5 of the mana bar!  and you have to make sure you don't sit down too soon or it really hurts :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">shaman naked sucks. get any resists will run out of mana assuming you have enough to even finish a fight to start with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">1. Necro<br />
2. Mage<br />
<br />
A necro can get 1-60 naked (hell, I pretty much got 1-50 naked in 23 days right after release)... after level 34 a pet is no longer neccessary.<br />
<br />
Mages can get away with almost as much as necros. Plus, a naked 60 mage can be far more effective than a naked 60 necro on any high end raid - mod rods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">As a Druid I have to agree to an extent that we are least Armor Dependant, but gear is important as far as WIS and Mana is concerned. About the only time I get hit is if I’m slow to get out of sit mode or over agored in a raid, which is easily remedied by simply moving. <br />
<br />
My current HP’s full buffed and with gear is 2047.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Bards are not highly equipment dependant.  I can solo my 50 bard with a store-bought drum and nothing else if I have to.  Trust me.  I stripped him of almost all his good stuff so I could afford to buy Malo. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Banthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i would disagree with you in choosing mages in the high end game. effective mod rod production needs HPs. so i guess i'd go with rogue. rage-bringer + 1 other will get you to 100dps pretty easily.<br />
<br />
banth</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Shaman are up there if you have Torpor... (and to lesser degree malo)<br />
<br />
Otherwise, shaman need decent gear.<br />
<br />
Wizards/Druids dont need a lot of HP/AC gear for quadding or for Root/Rot or Root/Nuke since they can snare they can avoid hits.  They need Mana though.  <br />
<br />
Clerics dont need a lot of gear either if they are 2 Box, or healing good equiped melee.  a High End Melee wont need CH all that often.<br />
<br />
Magician, duh, <br />
<br />
BST &amp; Necros as well.  Though not quite as much for Magician.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Torpor is only useful solo if you're getting pounded on. If you're naked, you're not going to get pounded on very long. Not to mention that, I don't know for you, as far as I am concerned more than 2 third of my mana and half my HP is coming from my gear.<br />
<br />
Half decently equiped shamans are good. Naked shamans shamans are good... at running really fast.<br />
<br />
I would say Necro first and Mage second. And only because a naked necro has an mana regen edge over a naked mage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Aurron Shadowstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Bard.<br />
A bard could solo to 60 with nothing but newbie gear and a store bought drum. Would take a while but it could be done. Unless the bard messes up they should never get hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Shaman are more gear dependant than most caster classes.  I get pounded on a regular basis, mostly due to my playstyle.  I could in theory solo by kiting to 60, but in reality it would take so much longer because with my starting mana pool I'd be OOM far more often, especially if anything went wrong.  Where most classes look for gear with 2 or 3 different primary attributes, I look for at least 7 different attributes (regen, AC, HP, STAM, WIS, mana, resists), not including clickies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Mages need 901 hp(pure minimal, so he can use his own rods) to produce mod rods fast, a naked 60 mage should have ~1000 hps. Add raid buffs, he can produce mod rods easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Clerics are gear dependant. <br />
<br />
Need HP/AC to survive the &quot;Cleric Taunt&quot; from CH's or group heals.  Need FT / focus items to keep enough mana either in exp groups or in a CH chain.<br />
<br />
Heck I see it on raids already.  I put 4 clerics in a CH chain, two are 60 with AA's and good gear, one is 58 ok gear and one is a bot with crap gear / no AAs.  The first two are at 50% mana while the last two are OOM.  Not to mention injuries from modding or AE damage.<br />
<br />
Though my only two 50+ chars are cleric and warrior.  And I twinked my shaman and wizy duo so badly I cant imagine life without gear. ;)<br />
<br />
Perhaps Mage as they can summon 90% of what they would need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">really depends on what you call gear dependent.<br />
<br />
Do you mean who can solo from 1-60 with the crappiest gear?  Or who can play their class most efficiently at level 60 with the crappiest gear?  What defines crappy gear... I certainly wouldn't include epics in the crappy gear list.<br />
<br />
talking about playing and raiding at level 60 and efficiency - <br />
Shaman with Canni5 are heavily gear dependent.  Necros with lifeburn are heavily gear dependent.  Bards are gear dependent with their epic.   <br />
<br />
talking who can solo to 60 in the worst gear -<br />
mages, wizards, bards, necro, druids, shaman...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Torpor is a game changer.<br />
<br />
Died other day was bound in ME.  Started memming spells.  Decided to mess around.  Went and soloed a Gorgana with NO gear whatso ever.   Slow, Root, Rot.  Cann, Torpor was full mana and full hps and the mob didnt take that long to kill.<br />
<br />
And if mob had resisted slow, hell that was what SOW is for.  Kite and Cast.  (at least while nakid hehehe It be a cold day before I resorted to kite slowing a gorgana))<br />
<br />
Put it this way... How many classes do you think could have pulled the same off?<br />
<br />
Druid for sure.  Necro/Mage depending on &quot;nakid&quot;, Wizard I dont know.... Enchanters with butloads of AA.<br />
<br />
Druid with Root, Snare, and WD.  Medding while Dots work.<br />
Snare to run and reroot.   But I doubt hed be full mana like I was at the end of the fight.<br />
<br />
Necro if he had a bone chip easily via fear kiting.  Necro root/rotting likely as well.<br />
<br />
Mage if he had a pet, sure.  Without... nope.<br />
<br />
Enchanter with Dire.  <br />
<br />
Wizard not sure.  Dont play a wiz, dont know if thier mana pool and efficiency would be enough to chew out a gorgana nakid.<br />
<br />
Anyway, to bring me back to the point, a Shaman with Torpor is often &gt; than a Shaman with Better Eq but no torpor.  To me that means Shamans are less gear dependant than most.  (Or more spell dependant))</div></div><hr />

But that's not the question, hence the &quot;other nonsense&quot;... ;)<br />

Given this context, mage, bard, necro, and probably monk would top my list.<br />

Corlathist: a bard could have pulled it off, no problem whatsoever. :)  Get the backup drum out of the bank (optional) and get kiting... you're full life and full mana at the end. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>greatmilenko_00</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I am going to vote for beastlords, there pet is just too good, combied that with some minor shaman spells, and duelwield.... they are a soloing machine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Zaspacer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I would have to say bards or shamans.<br />
<br />
Bards generally have LOUSY melee.<br />
However, they CAN solo from mid to high levels with a cheap drum.<br />
They can also benefit a group with no more than a cheap drum and cheap lute.<br />
For melee just give em a Journeyman's Walking Stick to help out.<br />
This is also probably why Bard's generally are one of the last to get (non bard only) loot priority on raids.<br />
<br />
Shamans are also easy to play without much equipment.<br />
An Inny Troll can solo to very high levels with just Fungi + JBB + Horse + Fungi Covered Great Staff + Regent Symbol of Innoruuk + Malo + Torpor.<br />
hehehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Snacko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Shaman.<br />
<br />
And it only increases as you level and gain spells / aa skills.<br />
<br />
At lvl 60 with canni5 and torpor, you're still amazingly effective in buffing / debuffing / slowing, even if you were butt naked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Sebasiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">im gonna have to say magician on this one a naked mage exept for int is just as good as a awesome quiped mage for they summon everything they need and get very nice shields and hp spells</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Here's another vote for Magician, assuming they at least get Malachite. The pet basically represents all their stats aside from Intelligence and, assuming their base Intelligence isn't awful they are fine naked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Top of the list is definitely necromancer, summon a pet and you're in business.  Not sure about any other class - maybe magicians cause they can summon - but almost every other class's performance is greatly enhanced with gear. Not just a little bit enhanced mind you, a lot.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I am playing a mage as my primary right now because of this fact alone (since I do not have the time I once did).</div></div><hr />
