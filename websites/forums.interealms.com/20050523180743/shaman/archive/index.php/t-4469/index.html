<br />
Ok now im a 35th lvl shaman atm and i have aquired a lot of money 50kpp and i wondered what kind of gear i should get to twink him out with.  I currently have 152 wisdom and was wondering if i should concentrate on that or my resists or ac or whatever is the best way to go.  Any suggestions would be helpful cuz im not sure just what i should do with this cash. <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Go do some research, if your really that pathetic.</div></div><hr />

please do not judge this board based on the reply of the last poster...this board is a great place to share info on just about everything under the sun for us shaman. I think what Rokkeb was so eloquently trying to say, is that its most likely in your best interest to dig up some old posts and study up on our class.....trust me...your going to love it.<br />
<br />
<br />
...and as a side note...Ive always wondered what motivates someone to waste the time and energy to post a negative or condescending reply...especially to a legitimate question</div></div><hr />

Your most important stats are Regeneration and Mana-free damage. Think about it, the more mana you have, the more time it takes you to med it back... you are looking for a way to get your mana back faster- and that's what regen is all about. <br />
<br />
Here are my recommendations: <br />
<br />
1. Get a regen tunic.  If a fungi tunic is available for 50k or less, get it.  It will, more than anything else, make a difference in your shamanly power... and it has the additional benefit of not depreciating in value over time, and being great for twinks.  If 50k won't get you a fungi tunic (it generally won't on Karana), get an iksar regen BP instead. 5 hp/tick = 3000 hp/hour = 1500 mana/hour (if you're a cannibalizing fiend.) <br />
<br />
2. If you spend plan on spending a lot of time outdoors, get a horse. Get the cheapest horse, and turn ALL of your Luclin models OFF. Turning the models off allows you to cast SoW on yourself without it being overwritten by the horse speed effect (and you don't have to look at a horse-head all the time.) While on a horse, if you are standing still and not auto-attacking, you are medding. Even while standing. Even while casting. Even while JBB'ing.  The ability to med while standing/casting is huge. <br />
<br />
3. Look for a reasonably priced fungi staff. They definitely have limitations (they snare you, the effect needs to be reapplied every 5 minutes, and it doesn't stack with regen spells) - but it's mana-free Regrowth... 9000 hp/hour = 4500 mana/hour. Stacks with the iksar regen BP or fungi tunic, too.  The utility of this drops a little when you can cast Regrowth yourself (at level 52) but between 35 and 52 it's just nuts.<br />
<br />
4. If you see a JBB for sale (for a reasonable price), grab it!  They don't come up that often, and 45 will be here before you know it.<br />
<br />
You don't list a profile so I'm not sure what you've already got.  I wouldn't worry so much about Wisdom (152 is fine) - if your unbuffed AC is below 800, I'd try to increase it a bit.<br />
<br />
Frankly, other spots aren't nearly as important gear-wise.  Fungi/Iksar tunic, Horse, Fungi staff, JBB - those are the &quot;game altering&quot; ones.  Also, the &quot;big four&quot; above tend to hold their value a lot better than more conventional items, which depreciate pretty quickly with each new expansion.<br />
<br />
For other slots...<br />
<br />
Get the cheap Jaundiced Bone pieces where available (helm, gloves, arms, boots- each a few hundred pp and great AC.) <br />
<br />
Get some 6 AC/65 HP rings- a steal for the money.  If you see a cheap Shadel Bandit ring (2k'ish) pick it up.<br />
<br />
Get a Black Alloy Medallion - stats are pretty good, it's cheap (couple hundred PP) and it will make every spell you cast under level 45 cost 10% less mana. That's a good thing.  If you see a Crystalline Torque for cheap (4k or less) pick it up- Mana Preservation III is probably the best of the focus effects.<br />
<br />
Get an Arctic Wyvern Mask - nice balance of AC and WIS with the mask for a few hundred pp.  If you use your pet a lot, get the enshrouded veil (500-800 pp) - it has nice stats and the focus effect of &quot;Summoning efficiency III&quot; - makes your pet cost 25% less mana to summon.<br />
<br />
Get a Clay Guardian Shield (Ac 25, +50 HP) - a few hundred pp, and it will last you a long time.  Your next upgrade is a Sarnak Battle Shield, but until resists come into play, you don't need it... and the longer you wait to buy it, the cheaper it will be.<br />
<br />
For remaining spots, grab totemic or ry'gorr. <br />
<br />
I'd also have a nice ratio weapon- but I wouldn't spend a ton of money on it.  You'll soon find your melee damage starts to become pitiful (you're just getting to those levels) but you can extend the fun a few levels by making sure you have something efficient to bash with.  Tons of good options out there- grab one with a nice ratio that's a bargain.  Just last night I picked up a Di'Zok Sceptre of Authority (&quot;Respect my authorita !!!!&quot;), 10 dmg / 20 dly, +5 wis, +25 mana, and... oh yeah... 10 AC.  :)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vusum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the suggestions all!  I knew i would get flamed a bit for asking what to do with my pp but hey its part of the bargain for some good advice.  On luclin a fungi is in and around 40k so its not too bad maybe ill check into that.  Also i was thinking about getting some acrylia studded stuff.  Nice stats on most of it and i very much need the ac on it.  Im going shopping on wednesday so ill let you know if i got any good deals.  <br />
<br />
Thanks later all,<br />
