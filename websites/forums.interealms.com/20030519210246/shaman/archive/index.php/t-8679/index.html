<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>EVOLNOSMIRC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Where would be a good spot for a 52 shaman and a 49 ranger...doesn't necessarily need to be great xp for me, just need it to be good xp for him so he can catch up :) I was thinking CoM or burning woods.<br />

Oghmat<br />

E'ci Server</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ThatDumbGuy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you aren't grouping with him, well hell maybe even if you are, I would suggest the rockhopper caves in DSP. Make a few k in pelts while yer at it. I went from 49 to 52 there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The other night my 47 druid friend and I (53 shaman) went to live tower in lower guk.  The mobs here are so easy it will blow your mind.  With us grouped he made nearly a whole level in 3.5 hours, I got about 10% exp in level 53.  We worked our way down to the king room but could not take it with the tactician being up, had to evac when I agroed the whole darn room plus the tactician.  <br />
<br />
I sugguest you pull all the mobs with slow, and then let him beat them down....using dog dog and *ahem* project alpha you two will not have any problems down there.  Even with 3 mobs on us at one time we never had to worry about a thing.  Try it out, its fun!</div></div><hr />
