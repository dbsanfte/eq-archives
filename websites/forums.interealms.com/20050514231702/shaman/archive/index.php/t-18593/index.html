<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lorianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I never post here, but I read it voraciously.  I do not know most of you, but this has become a &quot;virtual kommunity&quot; for me.<br />
<br />
In essence, I thought I would take the time to say &quot;Thank You&quot; for all the information over the years.  Whenever I had &quot;blonde Barbarian moments&quot;, I knew I could come here to get assistance.<br />
<br />
I have laughed at some, cried with others, been outraged, delighted and excited by the posts.  I sincerely hope this site continues in the same vein as the past - it is such a source of pleasure for me.<br />
<br />
May each of you enjoy a happy holiday season !<br />
<br />
With warmest regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I concur.  Thanks to all the posters and information presented here.  <br />
<br />
Thanks to our mods for making sure that we continue to play nice.<br />
<br />
Thanks to Sunmoon for providing us a place to do this.<br />
<br />
And Lorianna, with a sig like that, you NEED to post more.  Sigs here have been very tame since Glorianna changed heres :(  (maybe I should start PMing her till she changes it back)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Judlace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, I think it's appropriate for my first post here to be one of thanks to all of you who have guided me through my early stages of Shamanhood.<br />
<br />
I have learned much, which has made my adventures more fun, safe and profitable.<br />
<br />
Thanks also go to the Mods and to Sunmoon.<br />
<br />
Happy Holidays to all.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm extremely hard headed but I've still managed to learn a lot from the great folks that visit this excellent resource.<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone and happy holidays!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vittra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've never posted here before either.<br />
But i read this board a lot regarding soloing tips.<br />
Happy Holidays ALL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sunbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, THANK YOU!!!  I have learned so much from all the posts here over the past 2 years.  <br />
<br />
Happy Holidays from Team Wanderaimless on Tarew Marr!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My new signature is tame, eh?<br />

<br />
Lorianna (nice name btw) your signature is gorgeous and very sexy, but too tall for the Crucible. Our sig guidelines are 100 pixels high and approximately 250 pixels wide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yep ... I stop in at least once a day ... most times several times a day. It's become habit to check my guild's forum and immediately come here to see if anything new's been posted. I love the General and Equipment sections especially ... very helpful info to have. On the whole, there are a LOT of friendly shaman gathered here, and it's great knowing if I have a question ... yes, there are still questions, even at the age of 65 winters ... the answer is nothing more than a quick search or post away. <br />
<br />
I raise a mug of Halas' finest to the Crucible ... may the Light of Justice shine on you all, and may the Hammers judge you fairly on the Last Day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Merry Christmas!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">ditto, im glad i could help others and others can help me.  I certainly hope when WoW comes this place is able to adjust to it so we can all stay together forever !!  /sniff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>zensation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Best. Forum. Ever. <br />
<br />
One of the reasons that i love playing a shaman so much is the fact that this glorious resuorce is here. I have stopped playing alts because their class pages and communities were subpar at best.<br />
<br />
Thank you everyone and have a great holiday season!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Edarb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Aye.  I read this site almost daily.  I thank all of you for the great information.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Seeler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Have to agree with all above. I do not post often at all but visit often and have to say tips and advice I have read here has saved myself or others on many occasions. Great sight....great people and more than a few interesting topics. Merry Chrismas to all and a safe Holiday.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll second that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I concurr, this is the best message board on the internet. I find that, if I'm not in game, I'm very likely here. The moderators are much more active in policing the boards and it really shows.<br />
I really owe most of my knowledge of the class to things I've found here.<br />
Thank you all, and Merry Christmas.</div></div><hr />
