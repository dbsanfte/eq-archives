<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I took a few months off from EQ and have just gotten back into it again. I'm looking to beef my 55 Iksar Shaman up and I could use some advice.<br />
<br />
I'm loving the bazaar so far, but I'm just about out of cash (5k or so left).<br />
<br />
In the last two weeks I've swapped: <br />
<br />
Necklace of Superiority (15k) for Spiderfur Collar (200pp)<br />
FBSS/Flayed Turmoilskin for Silvery Belt of Contention (9kpp)<br />
Scaled Mystic Helm for Sebilite Scale Cap (200pp)<br />
Scaled Mystic Cloak for Chetari Bonecrafted Shield (2kpp)<br />
Scaled Mystic Bracer for Coldain Military Wristguard (quested)<br />
Scaled Mystic Bracer for Barbed Rubicite Bracer (500pp!)<br />
Scaled Mystic Leggings for Kromrif Military Leggings (quested)<br />
Chokidai Hide Spaulders for Obulus Death Shroud (8kpp)<br />
<br />
The next two things I'm thinking I need to replace are:<br />
Forest Loop for POTC earring (expensive...)<br />
Ry'Gorr Chain Gloves for Crystal Chitin Gloves (AC20)?<br />
Black Fur Boots for xxx Dragonhorn Boots?<br />
<br />
Any better replacements for those slots?<br />
<br />
Please look at my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=328988 &quot;&gt;profile&lt;/a&gt; and let me know if you can see any other easy, cheap upgrades that I can make bearing in mind that I'm down to around 5k and I'm unguilded and only solo (so my camping options are limited).<br />
<br />
I'm also considering getting a Tae Ew Hammer of Aggression - they're down to around 2k. It's taking me way too long to raise 2hb with the GFG (so that's for sale).<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any advice!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">check my profile for some ideas. You are pretty low on HP items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You might want to consider an Ivandyr's Hoop (cheaper upgrade than the PoTC.)<br />
<br />
Dragon boots are nice- and they can be very cheap- keep your eyes open.<br />
<br />
As for 2hb, another option is the poison wind censer (20/28, -30 vs poison, AoE poison proc) - very fast for a two hander... and getting reasonably priced.<br />
<br />
You might also want to hit Maiden's Eye- shrouded medallion and stone idol would each be nice upgrades for you... and they drop fairly frequently.<br />
<br />
P.S.  Barbed rubi bracer for 500 pp - nice find !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah - I'm pretty sure the guy screwed up and meant to sell the barbed rubicite bracer for 5000pp, because all his other prices were high. The Poison Wind Censer scares me because of the proc, and the TEHoA just seems like a super-Face Grinder with the 17/20 ratio and the STR+10 and WIS+10.  It's really cheap because only priests can use it, and you *know* a druid wouldn't touch it.<br />
<br />
I *do* search for Ivandyr's hoops everytime I go the bazaar, but haven't seen a single one for sale yet.<br />
<br />
Krakster - I had been wondering if getting the barbed ringmail would be better than the Iksar bp - would you recommend that pre-torpor, though? I can certainly clear a couple k in plat making that switch, too. Most of the other stuff you have seems to be out of my reach for now, though. <br />
<br />
Thanks for the tips!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nah, stay with the regen bp, its just too effective not to use. I would get at least one earring with HP for sure, black sapphire. That sorta thing is a snap to find in the bazaar. The seahorsey cloak I bought for 4k, but you can probably get for less, or camp it with a few friends. Also keep your eye open for a bladestopper, its oldschool naggy loot that will sometimes come up at a great price. Same AC as SBS but better hp. Bag the SBS for raids.<br />
<br />
Definatly get some friends and exp in ME until you get a stone idol, or divine inspiration from the chieftain. <br />
<br />
Took me a long time to find someone selling Ivandyr hoop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oh, and get a set of crystal spider eyes, more ac, hp, 1 less wis. Or one of those masks from UP, the name escapes me now. Lots of shaman wearing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think Krak is refering to ...<br />
<br />
Death Mask of the Elysians ( 1.2 WT, 12 AC, +35 MANA, +35 HP, +2 INT, +5 CHA, +2 WIS, +6 SV DISEASE, +6 SV POISON)</div></div><hr />
