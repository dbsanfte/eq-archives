<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Willowwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It started off really rocky but from those I know who have been they have said this is normal.  Once again another plane I haven't visited I got to go see.  We had 3 wipeouts but after the last one it went smooth.  Most every class there got armor and equipment.  I was the bandit since I was the only Bard on the raid.  Our last encounter was the Maestro himself.  He dropped a few things one being a six note blade.  All this was very unexpected of me but a very nice added bonus to any fun day.  I look forward to another KoE raid....maybe not as long as today's was though :).   I'm posting stats for the equippage I received today. <br />
