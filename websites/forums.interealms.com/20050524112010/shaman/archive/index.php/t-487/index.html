<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had a 35 rogue...quit for 8 months..ok, thats the short story. <br />
<br />
I am going to be a casual player. I want to have fun when Im on, not constantly worry about cash, and solo..... <br />
<br />
So necro, druid, or sham...right? <br />
<br />
No necro...I dont want to see dead people  <br />
<br />
Druid...hmmm...strong argument...solo well, can port, make good cash soloing and TPing. <br />
<br />
BUT...I dont want to be some wuss Wood Elf, and they look to be the best for Druids. <br />
<br />
So, shammy? Can you all address my requirements up top and let me know how they compare? <br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shalara De'Tan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shaman will not be the *easiest* class on the list.   Quite probably the most versatile and fun of the three, but not the easiest if you are set on soloing all the time.<br />
<br />
While a shaman *can* solo from 1 - 60, there are lulls in the life of a shaman where soloing can be quite painful.  You hit one that lasts several levels just before you get Dog Dog at level 34, and there is another rough spot before 49.  (And I won't even mention 52-59, which was pure unmitigated hell for me, grouped or solo -- although that was before the balancing was done and we got new healing spells.  Oops, i mentioned it!  ;))  In fact, if you look at the shaman spell list, the last three levels before a new poison dot upgrade are usually pretty rough on a soloing shaman.<br />
<br />
If you are set on ONLY soloing, no matter what, and will get frustrated when it gets rougher, then druid is probably your best bet. (Dang, its VERY hard to encourage another drood out there ;))  If you decide to go with druid, take a look at the halflings and see if thier appearance appeals.  They have good stats, and they actually have a racial bonus -- they need 5% less XP than the base human to level.<br />
<br />
Also, worrying about cash seems to be the biggest hobby of the shaman ;)  Nearly everyone wants to get a JBB by level 45 and a Fungi Tunic as soon as they can swing it.  That's 40-70k worth of items, depending on your server economy.  And shaman have no easy way to make money.  Alchemy is a joke for making cash, unless you want to spend HOURS raising skill, crafting SoW potions, and then /auctioning them constantly.  You could make 100pp in 2 minutes of porting around a desparate person.  It'll take you a lot more time than that to make 100pp with alchemy.<br />
<br />
I don't mean to make it sound like Shaman suck.  On the contrary, Shaman are awesome!  I've played Shalara since release, and I enjoy logging in and being a shaman as much today as ever.  I just don't think that shaman really meet the requirements that you set in your post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And I so hate wood elves.....might have to be a midget Drood then :(<br />
<br />
Why cant Barbs be droods huh!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It depends on other factors as well.<br />
<br />
All three classes have their strong points.  However, if you want to stand toe to toe with mobs then shaman is your only real choice.  But dont be mislead into thinking your melee damage will ever be anything more than incidental after the late teens.<br />
<br />
Of those three there is another factor to consider.  Ease of play.  I think Shaman are the most powerful and versatile of the three (else why would i play one ;)).  In the long run they can go places and do things that Druids and Necros can't do.  However... To do this you need to learn to play a class that can change dramatically every few levels.   <br />
<br />
Necros are probably the easiest (faction issues aside).  They can go 60 levels with darkness, fear, dots and pet.   They can do alot more of course but this will always be their dominant strategy and it primarily works outdoors.  Any situation where you get several mobs at once results in a feigned or actual dead necro if they are solo.   This rules out alot of indoor camps, though some undead things are easily doable.   In a group, necros can actually be very useful, though they are often underappreciated and sometimes spurned. On raids you will pump mana.<br />
<br />
Druids travel the best of the three.  They also take abuse like a wet paper towel.  If Necros spend their careers with things running away from them, then the opposite is true of druids.  You will always be running from something (hopefully snared and maybe rooted).  Starting in your mid levels you can quadkite which is a very easy way to gain exp.  but you wont be doing this inside.  You will get groups alot easier than a necro.  You can evac, backup heal  and do some buffing.  If you get agro you will also die quickly.  So qucikly in some cases peopel may think you were the victim of a bug.  On raids you have soem buffing.  Then will do chloroblasts until oom or nuke if you don't get resisted too much.<br />
<br />
Shaman start their life as a tank.  You can melee alot further than any other pure casters.  With slows you can (and need to) tank exp mobs all the way to 60.  As a soloer you have a bit more variety.  You can kite, root-rot, melee and dot, tank for pet.  Depending on your spell level your strategy may vary.  You have excellent mana regen so are rarely oom (unless also out of hp).  Groups love you.  Soem raids cant be done easily without you, though you may not stack well with too many other shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">After long consideration, I believe I will be a shammy..and I really don;t know why.  lol<br />
<br />
2 big things for me, and 2 reasons I quit, were travel and money.<br />
<br />
As a rogue, I was always broke, and travel sucked.  Don't get me wrong, if I HADNT given away 10k pp worth of items, Id log back on and play him.<br />
<br />
I just don't feel like picking up a 35 rogue and getting ALL that back..especially since I know he is nekked.<br />
<br />
So, I will try a COMPLETELY new experience.  Hopefully, it won't be too bad.  Again, like any MMORPG, Ill have a few classes to keep life interesting.<br />
<br />
But I think I have decided to make a Sham my main.  <br />
<br />
Wait!! I know why I'm not a Druid!  I hate elves!<br />
<br />
lol...anyway, thanks all, and now to decide on my new home :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">words of advice: be patient until you hit level 34, thats when we really hit our power curve.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't play a druid...too many of the damn tree huggers running around already ) <br />
<br />
We're all obviously biased towards shamans here, but I'll throw out another idea for a fun class to play for you : bard. Bards are a blast to play as an occasional player; I've had a lot of fun with mine just as a break from the day to day XP grind with my shaman. As a bard you're able to do pretty much anything, and you mentioned that you hated travel - bards go faster than anyone, anywhere ) They're also relatively inexpensive to twink out, so you don't need to worry about spending thousands and thousands of plat.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I love my shaman, but if I had to pick any other class to play I think it would be a bard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BryeLLe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If travel and money were the 2 reasons you quit, IMHO, playing a shaman is not going to solve that. Necros seem to solve one, druids seem closer to solving both. Maybe. But then again, I've only played the game since October, and my barbie sham is my first and only, so what do I know? :)<br />
<br />
Travel and money are the two problems that really drive me bonkers. My only choices seem to be putting up with the Luclin portals and KS'ing HGs in Rathe. :) I have very little plat, find it extremely difficult to upgrade items, and end up doing a lot of running. I think if I were in a good guild that did a lot of raiding, then it'd be a different story. But then that requires me to play a lot more than I already have the time to do. I'm considering taking an extended break from my beloved shaman for almost those very reasons. <br />
<br />
I think my real problem is I have to stop reading these boards and looking at everyone else's nice items and just learn to enjoy the game for what it is, and not ItemQuest. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">At high lvls shamans have no problems with cash if ya really need it...we can solo camp Emeror Chottal (mind numbingly boring, but he can drop lots of 10k+ spells), or camp the 4 rooms in crypt (dont let mobs run out of the rooms and invis past guardians), or solo lots of other stuff for cash, I spent about 5 days in WW just soloing yeld and other stuff and getting in on the occasional gorge dragon talise raid and ended up with a 7 6 talise (thanks Derisinal and the guild Obsidian Guard), a reinforced dragonhorn bracer 12 ac 5 cha 9wis which is good to stick in JBB slot while in groups, 2 great dragon heads which i turned in for 2 barbed dragonscale boots that are 4k each, 1 greater dragon head which I turned in for a 5k frostbringer, and thats not all...I got around 5 more pieces of dragon armor but I dont wanna take the time to think about what all I got and type it. (sorry about all the run on sentences and comma splices and other stuff like that...I just woke up and I ramble alot after I wake up :p )</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tuxman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My suggestion if you want to create a solo class is a Necro, IMHO I think there is a big misconception to who the best solo class is everyone said for the longest time it was a druid, some shammys said obviously a shamen in terms of soloing a grouping. I agree in terms of a versitle character shamen is the best for me. In terms of just creating a solo class Necros are by far the best solo class in the game. I mean really the class is made to solo and not to much else. I played a Necro to 60 just because I wanted to solo and not have to worry about ever grouping. Necros have a built in clarity, can get there health back while fighting, and have the best dots in the game, Plus that pet that is one hell of a quad hitting Dot. But solo life isnt for everyone. Believe me you will get sick of soloing and wish you could group more at times I know I did thats why I created a Shamen, and have had more fun with him than my necro. So carefully evaluate what exactly you want to do in game. As far as druid I stopped playing mine at 59 and it took me 3 times longer to go from 50 to 59 as a druid than it did my shamen. Shamens are just so loved in a group enviroment and can solo well. Druids well thats just a back up heal and sow guy in a group thats about it kinda boreing to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">So necro, druid, or sham...right? <br />
<br />
/em points above<br />
<br />
Listen to the guy with the 60 necro/59 druid/at least 59 shaman</div></div><hr />
