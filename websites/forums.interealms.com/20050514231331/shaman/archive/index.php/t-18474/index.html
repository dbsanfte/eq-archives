<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>decessusvenenum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a couple questions here:<br />
<br />
I have recently been reading about rangers (i have a level 20 one myself) and am hearing that they are HORRID at soloing indoors.  While this is disheartening, I am not sure but perhaps the shaman is the class for me.  I like soloing in dungeons (droga, nurga, veksar, etc.) and groups are great when I can get em.  A defined role on raids is nice, but being constantly asked to do something gets VERY tiring (i.e. chanter).  So, I am wondering if the shammy would be a better fit for me than a ranger based on what I asked.<br />
<br />
All opinions are welcomed ^^ thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>decessusvenenum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That's all well and good, but maybe you could add a little insight into that.  Indoor soloing isn't the only thing I like, and rangers as a class seem to appeal to me; I'm just wondering if shammies do the things i said BETTER than rangers do =P<br />
<br />
BTW track is great but so is cannibalize =\</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want the snare component, go with a troll of Innoruuk and complete the Symbol quests. The 3rd Symbol has a right-click Clinging Darkness that is extremely valuable even at 59 when soloing indoors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you find being asked for enchanter buffs to be tiring, by all means STAY AWAY from a shaman.  Not only do most of our buffs do NOTHING, but they last almost no time at all and everyone seems to think they are great.<br />
<br />
The only reason a shaman would be better than a ranger at soloing indoors is slow, but a determined ranger can solo anything he can root (indoors or outdoors) or snare (outdoors) that doesn't summon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>decessusvenenum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thank you Ruatonim, that was my question ^^ gonna stick with rangers, let you patient, determined players be the real shammies around here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Unei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">being constantly asked to do something gets VERY tiring (i.e. chanter). <br />
<br />
You will become very tired playing a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>enarcheos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">High Level soloing: A Ranger's dps is very powerful at higher levels in archery, especially with True Shot. This is their weakness soloing indoors since they have to kite to maintain archery in a small limited area. Shamans can work indoors well since they slow a mob to 25% attack speed, heal themselves efficiently, and tank while their DOTs are beating a mob down. <br />
<br />
High level groups: Rangers are VERY good pullers in groups and can use all the archery they want as long as there is a Main Tank keeping agro. Shamans are VERY good at making the group stronger and the mobs weaker.<br />
<br />
High level RAIDS: You WILL be bugged 100% of the time by raid members asking for buffs. Alot of the requests will be outrageous and will come from people mere seconds before everyone starts to engage a raid mob. Rangers will not get nearly as many requests. Rangers will have the raid role of dps. Shamans will have the role of spending half their mana disappointed that none of their slows landed and will eventually switch out to nukes and dots if they aren't already dead from agro.<br />
<br />
Level 20: At this level, Shamans are almost as good at healing as Clerics, Rangers are almost as good at tanking as Warriors. Melee will remain a part of the life of a Ranger, but Shamans will branch off into being better casters at this point. Pretty much all classes at level 20 though will be &quot;HORRID&quot; indoors. Level 20 is NOT an accurate view of what these two classes will eventually become when invested.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>enarcheos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Don't forget root/shoot for rangers, don't need a ton of space for that =P<br />
<br />
I think shoot breaks root just like nuke and normal melee though. Can anyone confirm this? If so, then it's back to kiting in a confined area. Easier at lower levels, harder at the higher ones. This is mostly due to higher level mobs chain summoning at about 97% health. The Shaman can tank (Or let pet tank on low 50s) ALOT of these summoning mobs when they are slowed, making soloing indoors easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">SHooting arrows at a rooted mob isn't very likely to break root (i've played around on my friends 65 ranger enough to know this).  The downside to a rooted/moving mob is you lose the double damage of your shots.<br />
<br />
One possibility for a ranger is to use swarmcaller or earthcaller to slow a mob and then position the target mob so there is a mob directly behind it.  You then are technically shooting the mob behind it, but you are hitting the mob in front of you (and therefore get your double damage but are tanking the mob).<br />
<br />
The downside here is rangers aren't very efficient at healing themselves so if you're tanking you are probably going to have downtime (depending on your gear and where you are soloing).  Shaman, on the other hand, are very good with healing and can slow a mob more efficiently without relying on a proc.<br />
<br />
Shaman will be more efficient with soloing, but either class can do it.  Rangers can also fear kite up to the mid 50s.  My opinion is soloing past 55 with a ranger isn't very practical (although its doable).</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesn't. ... unless you have a bow with a proc, those will break root fairly often. Best indoor soloer is a necro, hands down, our main weaknesses are lack of snare for runners (not that important ime) and lack of tools to break a spawn compared to a class with FD or lull. We're not bad indoor soloers but I wouldn't consider us one of the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>enarcheos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah, if the question is: Who solos best indoors out of all classes? I would go with a Necromancer. Of course Necromancers solo extremely well ANYWHERE. But between Shamans and Rangers indoors, high level goes to Shamans in my opinion. Low level is about equal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think shoot breaks root just like nuke and normal melee though.<br />
<br />
Neither normal melee nor archery breaks root.  Root has a chance to break each tick plus any time a DD or stun hits the target (this includes DD/Stun procs).</div></div><hr />

Play the ranger, cause honest to god I dont know that I can stand another person that wants call themselves a car wash impliment (I HATE being called a Shammy/Shammie). For that matter play a Wizzie and rejoice that your what people do when they excuse themselves to the bathroom.<br />
In all seriousness, if you want to be good at indoor solo power, necro hands down; shaman get nice tricks and some great ways to get out of trouble, but necros get Feign Death and a self succor as well as gate....and if all heck breaks loose, they can summon their corpse and rez it themselves....pretty phat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I do think shamans are very good indoor soloers . Necros are better tho .<br />
<br />
Id have to disagree. Necros need room to be more effective then us. Indoors there is not always room for. If a necro isnt kiting in PoTactics for example, i think i would be the more effective soloer, but i might be wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Rangers can't solo for ****. Basically they fear the mob and then shoot it down/melee it OR they snare it and kite it and shoot it.. IMO if you like dungeons+rangers, find a friend healer and you're golden. BUT if you want to solo dungeons necro's are THE way to go.. being able to snare to avoid runners is THE most important thing (trains suck). Also being able to FD is amazing and of course you can always summon/rez yourself when you die deeeep inside =b.</div></div><hr />
