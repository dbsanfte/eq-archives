<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Death By Spork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Where should i hunt at needing some major plat , and w/ the new c3 way of me not having it mana goes quicker i am sorta twinked but not too much any ideas ?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ooogly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would just level up. You are one level away from getting dogdog and that will help you more then anything. Spending time farming plats at these levels is a waste of time because at higher levels it's soooo much easier. If your just needing to make a few plats for your spells go farm spider silks, pelts and bone chips and sell them in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Death By Spork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">:cool: alright thanks , i will do that  havent been playing eq last few days , been playing loads of cs but i will get to 34 today , alright i will do that thanks  :p  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Newbie Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The only problem is getting guards to kill. HHK is usually overcamped on torv, but good luck because it is great plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ademaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have been givin a little tip on making some platinum, it should come semi-fast at your level but here it is.... If I were you, I would get your doggie as it would help you get the platinum faster. BUT, go to Paldual and solo everything and kill everyone. They drop like 2 platinum or 3 platinum a kill sometimes, and al that bronze armor you sell can earn you even more platinum. Thats what I plan to do once i get my dog friend at lvl 34.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Felstaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah, that's *just* what PC needs, a high level farming it. I can't see any immature /ooc traffic coming from that.<br />
<br />
Bad idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ademaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, with all the PLing going on their lately, you can easily siguise yourself to amke it look like your Pling someone. Heck you even can PL someone and jsut take the loot, and all the money from there.</div></div><hr />

I agree. Had the same idea to do it myself, but the thought of every wanker in the zone (one of the most popular and crowded in the game) screaming at me via every available chat channel... &lt;shudder&gt;</div></div><hr />
