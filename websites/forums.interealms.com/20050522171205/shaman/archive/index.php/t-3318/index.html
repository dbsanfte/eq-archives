It was posted on the Monkly-Business boards and we have alot of monks checking it out.  Just thought I might get the Brother Shamans into the search for info.  The quests nets a <br />

Here is the post for what info the monk community has found so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">heard about this a couple days ago...risk vs reward doesn't stack up.  I doubt it exists.  <br />
<br />
But please prove me wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bamana DeMoro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The spell effect doesn't seem to be valid, my guess would be it's a hoax.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I checked that thread out.  The poster (Releehw) is an honest person in my experience, a former (&amp; hopefully future) tradeskill customer of mine.  He of course was just making the inquiry, not saying it was IG definitely.<br />
<br />
Everlore seems to spawn most of the hoaxes, so it comes as no surprise another red herring has appeared there.<br />
<br />
Midnight Fury is a well respected &quot;uber&quot; guild on E. Marr.  Laoke (a MF member) would post something if someone in his guild actually had bought this I'm sure.<br />
<br />
Multi-quest chaining scams are a dime a dozen.  My opinion is that this is just a new twist on an old one.  I'd love to be proved wrong, but I'm not going to spend any time hunting this snipe. ;)<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">On the one hand, from what I read, the guy selling the MQ was accepting payment after the hand in - which is a good sign, as it's a stupid scam if it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
On the other hand...  Definately agree with Snapdragn - too good for the minimal effort.  The regen effect on the ring is just too much to believe.</div></div><hr />
