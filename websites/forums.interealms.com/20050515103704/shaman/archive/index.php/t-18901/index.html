Unless pious might has a proc rate similar to a cleric hammer, I think Holy Order might actually put out more damage, although a 1 hour dot has the potential to be cataclysmic if used in the wrong place.<br />

As with the enchanter nuke, I hold this as evidence that GoD spells are not finished yet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The first thing I want to point out is that about half these spells are Target Type: Unknown(34).  For reference, here is another spell with Target Type: Unknown(34) that is already live: Reebo's Greater Cleansing (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4287&amp;source=Test).  This is the spell that we use to disarm cursed boxes in LDoN.  If you try to cast it on something besides an appropriate box, you get something to the effect of &quot;This spell only works on the cursed.&quot;  This makes me believe that all of the target type: Unknown(34) spells will be the only spells that work on entire species of mobs.  From here on out, I'm going to call these mobs &quot;cursed&quot; because I am frankly very sick of typing Target Type: Unknown(34) :)<br />
<br />
Here are some trends I noticed:<br />
<br />
1) Most classes got an upgraded nuke that does exactly 10% more damage.  Necros, and Shamans are the only nuking class (not counting paladins or bards as nukers) that do not get a new nuke.  Enchanters get a new nuke, but it actually does less damage than their old nuke.  I expect this to be fixed and go live at 1210 damage.<br />
<br />
2) The three primary dotting classes (Shaman, Druid, and Necro) all get dots which do dismal damage compared to what they would normally use.  The new druid and shaman dots do about half the damage of their corresponing precedent spell, and the necro dot only does a third.  However, the druid and necro dots are set to type Unknown34 targets, whereas the shaman dot is set to normal targets.  I expect this is an oversight and will go live as an Unknown34.<br />
<br />
3) Possibly the most important thing I have noticed: Enchanters do not get a type Unknown34 slow.  We get a 70%, and beastlords get a 55%.  This means that if the expansion is full of cursed mobs, enchanters will no longer be viable slowers, and shaman slow is once again significantly ahead of beastlord slow.<br />
<br />
Even if cursed mobs are only found in certain raid content, this is still a good thing.  It gives us something that we can do and enchanters cannot, and we do it significantly better than beastlords.  Like being the only class that gets a disease slow, this is a great thing and a great boost to shaman desireability (unless of course I am completely wrong on what Unknown(34) means).<br />
<br />
Another thing I would like to point out is that no one except bards (reflect song) is getting anything special.  Everyone is just getting minor upgrades to the same crap they have had for years.  Before you rant and rave about how shamans are being nerfed by not getting anything new or different, take a good look at what everyone else is getting.  Like GoD AA's, GoD spells look pretty lackluster all around:-\  I hope a lot more spells go live than just 2 per class, and we get a lot more AA abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Uhamok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Seems theres going to be some new classification of mob...<br />
<br />
Target Type: Unknown(34)<br />
{Edit: Hehe I wrote this befor the 2nd post was made about the &quot;cursed&quot; mobs. Sounds like a good name to me.}<br />
<br />
Is in some spell for each class, so most likely these spells will only be good/of use in the new GoD zones(at least thats where I'd asume these new mob types will be found).<br />
<br />
Kinda makes me wonder if this new type of mob is going to be super resistant to normal spells or what? Since it seems we get a slow specifically for them. Wonder how boring that would be...<br />
<br />
Mob gets to camp via puller<br />
Slow mob<br />
Twiddle Thumbs<br />
<br />
Same goes for other classes, as they'd only have a limited sellection of spells that would effect them.<br />
<br />
Just the thoughts of a bored shaman at 3 AM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Good to see that you are so optimistic. I personally feel that we get shafted in this expansion even more, in the form of ignorance. After all, SOE thinks, that shamans have been quite happy with all the crappy changes over the time in all expansions they have released, so why not to shaft them totally now, they wont make a squeek anyway.<br />
<br />
A slow which will work ONLY on percentage of mobs in the whole game? A DoT which does less damage then my dogdog when it sneezes and again, works only on percentage of the mobs in the whole game? Not to mention that the mobs, which will be introduced in that new expansion, will probably be quite tough ones, according to lore and such? What a waste, especially when most of other classes, if not all, get upgrades which work everywhere, on every mob.<br />
<br />
Seeing how SOE has acted in the past, I don't exactly think right now that they will now suddenly go out of their way and actually upgrade shamans, or something of shamans spells or abilities. Shamans have been &quot;lost&quot; to SOE since Kunark came out, we're so &quot;balanced&quot; that we have been forgotten and in all of our &quot;balance&quot;, we're gotten to almost inferior status. Heals suck (we're not primary healers, but so aint druids), nukes suck, buffs are useless (nowadays gear makes our buffs pointless), slow differs so little that there's no real need to use shamans in everyday gaming for it, since other classes, while slowing tad less, offer much more to the group when it comes to utility (common thing to see the &quot;/ooc Group looking for a slower!&quot; and when contact them, the answer is that they really were looking for enchanter, or at least BST). Great, we're still at least useful on raids. Just like warriors in the past were, because of /disc Defensive. Even with basic utility spells we've been forgotten, i.e. take SoW - time has moved on, more land has been added, more travelling required - is it bloody hard to upgrade shaman SoW to be faster as well, considering that from all of the classes who get it, we're FIRST? Is it so bloody hard to give us a little upgrade to the basic spell called Improved Invisibility, considering that all other classes who can cast Invisibility have it? Is it so bloody hard to give to us also pet focus like it's in LDoN and make our pet at least a BIT better? Yes, we're not main pet class, but we are pet class nevertheless, why else would we get &quot;upgraded&quot; (can hardly call them that, though) pets up to the level 61? If we'd be no pet class, lvl 34 pet would have been our first and LAST pet, like the druids silly bear is. Face it, we have no utility to offer to other people. There are never too many enchanters on the raid. There are never too many tanks on the raid, or rogues, wizards, whatever. But already 3 shamans per raid - that's too much. Takes nowadays only 2 shamans in general to buff whole big raid and do all of the shaman work needed on the raid. Right, we're so &quot;balanced&quot; and so useful, that any more shamans then that per raid is a waste of group slots.<br />
<br />
I've probably been in EQ for too long anyway (since beta 2). Been shaman all this time, have tried other classes, but I never really could play them for more then 1 day, they just weren't for me, like shaman was. I've seen how shamans went from status &quot;Wow, shaman is with us, we're really powerful now!&quot; to &quot;ah, well, we actually want BST or enchanter, not a shaman..&quot;. But, of course, we're so &quot;balanced&quot; after all, so it's OK for us to be forgotten or ignored or give us such a crap as SOE has been giving to us lately. After all, as per SOE, &quot;you still can Canni and you still can Slow (barely) better then other classes, so you're all good and balanced&quot;.<br />
<br />
So, uh, yeah, I am happy to see that there are still such optimists like some here, who believe that SOE will actually do or give something useful to shamans. Nice, good, good luck to you. I personally doubt that this will happen, though. Every expansion after Kunark has proved this. If this one will be different, I would be bloody amazed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Reports state that TA works fine on mobs in GoD.<br />
So that means that A) this new &quot;cursed&quot; type of mob is not live yet or B) we get shafted with our new spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Since traditionally SoE finishes an expansion a year after its release date, I think it is still early to draw any meaningful conclusions one way or another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thank you Jinheim, excellent comparison.  I agree, no one seems to be getting a significant upgrade.  And, if you are correct about the cursed mobs, we will actually make out pretty well.  Larger margin between our slow and the BST, the only endurance buff in the game, higher dps (via aa's) from our pet and dots, and other assorted minor improvements (pet group buffs, etc.)<br />
<br />
Also, as speculated, if these cursed mobs have high MR, than our debuffs will become even more important.  I believe this alone has the potential of really increasing our desirability in a group.  Right now, the ability to Maloxx is not appreciated in most LDoN adventures, not needed.  But if you fill the zone with high MR mobs, then every caster in the group (except chanters) will be screaming for us to debuff MR.  True, many casters already have debuffs built into their spells, however, I still see plenty of bounced spells, especially on boss mobs.  Increase the mobs base MR, which seems to be what is happening in GoD, and the debuff becomes almost essential.  I doubt that the -30 will be sufficient in all cases.<br />
<br />
I really believe that this is a good thing.  In the new zones, against the &quot;cursed&quot; mobs, BST will only be able to reliably land a 55% slow (without someone else debuffing).  Shaman will be able to land a 70% slow. This is a good thing for Shaman.  Oh, and the enchanter gets no new slow, so they will have to Tash first every time in order to get thier slows to land reliably, or will not be able to slow at all if the new mobs are immune to current slows (for this reason I seriously doubt that &quot;old&quot; spells will not work at all against the new mobs, I can't see even Sony being dumb enough to take away chanters slow ability).<br />
<br />
Overall, this upgrade may not be so bad for the Shaman.  May even help us in several ways.  If only I could get a better dd (+10% to spear would be nice) or could make sure my rain's didn't get resisted most of the time (-30 MR rain spell would be nice, too).<br />
<br />
OK, I'm not as depressed as  I was yesterday.  I'm with you J, let's see how this turns out (as I place my BST back into the alt slot).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Woot new slow.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yep, looks like we will take it happily in the ass again. I am with Banadan. **** you to the rest of you for making the Shaman class become what it is today.<br />
<br />
For the people saying &quot;You wanted a negative MR Slow&quot;. I wanted an innate negative resist adjust for debuffs, because I am a ****ing debuffer first of all. And I asked for a -75 to 100 scaling with level instead of a measly- 30 on a single spell.<br />
And I wanted it to be Shaman ONLY. If Shamans got a 10k nuke, I'd be happy. But if Shamans got a 10 k nuke while others would get 50k+ nukes, I'd be ****ing pissed. That's CLASS balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The first thing I want to point out is that about half these spells are Target Type: Unknown(34). <br />
- I have noticed that all CC type spells are target type 34: slow, mez, stun.  There is the druid debuff and SK nuke too.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, in one expansion or two, hybrids will out nuke us. They already out heal us, and have a superb slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Reports state that TA works fine on mobs in GoD.<br />
So that means that A) this new &quot;cursed&quot; type of mob is not live yet or B) we get shafted with our new spells. <br />
A is the correct answer. The spell is there but the mobs arent implemented yet. Most of the spells only works on the new expansion aka cursed mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">And if most of the mobs that you &quot;need&quot; the slow for mitigate, there was no significant improvement to our new slow over a beastlords.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK, the new spells which are target=&quot;cursed&quot; mob may only work against them, but &quot;old&quot; (pre-GoD) spells have to still work against them also.  There is no way chanters, who do not get a new slow against these cursed mobs, are being stripped of their slow ability.  No way Sony would do this.  So, either there has been an oversight made with the chanter (very possible) or the old spells still work, you will just have to debuff to get them to land.  Which is in fact a good thing for Shaman.<br />
<br />
And, even with slow mitigation, a wider gap in %, even mitigated, is still a good thing.  Sure, that 15-20% gap becomes 7.5-10% if mitigated 50%, however, that is still better than the current situation.  Again, this is a good thing for Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">High MR doesn't mean that the other resists of the mob must be high to. Most mobs have at least one weaker resists the nuker can switch too (MR - CR - FR). But bad thing for shamans: if a mob is almost immun to PR he is almost immun to DR too. /rude SoE<br />
<br />
I wondering what the &quot;cursed&quot; target means. Can be only affected by spells with taget type: unknown (34)? Then every class has exactly one spell they could cast on these mobs... Guess how happy wizards will be when they can land only the 750DD / 8sec stun nuke...<br />
<br />
And about melee balance compared to the nukers: the Wiz 3k nuke: 3015DD base + 45% new nuke fokus (or was the new one 40% only?) + 30% focus from new wiz AA + 15% focus from bard song. 9k critts inc soon! I'm SO happy that I we get critt DoTs to keep track! /boogle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">We got new slow with a mr adjust... great...<br />
<br />
but...<br />
<br />
Who will work ONLY in the expension, only on a part of the mobs, those who are &quot;cursed&quot; and last, but not least, our new spells have the same casting time (at best), cost more mana and are less efficient ???<br />
<br />
And it seems to be the same kind of bs for all classes...<br />
<br />
Introduce a new kind of mobs in an expension, grab old spells, weaken them and flag them to work only on the new specie... TADAAAAAAAA... here are your brand new INVENTIVE and improved spells.<br />
<br />
WTG SoE, WTG...<br />
<br />
In the same time, I'm still waiting for : <br />
<br />
a PBAE Malos/Malosinia<br />
a PBAE Tirgir's Insect<br />
access to spell casting subtetly (nah... our debuff and dots never aggro more than a wizard DD Critic, sure)<br />
a Poison DD EQUAL to the Cold DD<br />
a DD who is in line with the others priests DD<br />
healing power who is in line with Druid healing power (it's a shame that we just heal a little slightly better than an hybrid)<br />
an innate built-in MR adjust<br />
a Rabid Bear AA who is worth it (wait... we got it... err... no... clerics got it).<br />
an hps buffs who is in line with Druid and Cleric's hps buffs<br />
statts who mean else than some numbers with no impact<br />
<br />
I don't want to have clerics healing power, druids snare/ports, necros dots, fear and pet, magicians or wizards DD, 90% pally rez or God know what else...<br />
<br />
I want consideration from SoE for our class but who cares ???<br />
Shamans are overpowered with slow/Canni/Quiescience and our supra uber group CHA buff.<br />
<br />
/em go get his pills... once again  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I don't know if I would bet that the Chanter nuke will get an upgrade to be better than Insanity.  It very well might, but it might not.<br />
<br />
With chanter/cleric nukes you have to remember the long recast times.<br />
This means for a chanter/cleric to chain nuke they have to alternate spells.  This chanter nuke might be designed not to replace insanity<br />
but to be cast between insanity casts.<br />
<br />
Cleric nuke however was upgraded so might well be true.  Heck the cleric nuke is SIGNIFICANT for them.  Because now they have this/condemation so they can chain nuke for 1100-1210 where before<br />
they had much lower chain nuking potential.</div></div><hr />

You're right, it would be nice...but then we would no longer be the red headed step children that we are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">But look on the bright side...  If these work on the same mob types as LDoN chests, we'll be able to slow chests and unlock mobs.  That'll be sweet.  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
At least for the men around who want to 'unlock' Saryrn and such. :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">This means that if the expansion is full of cursed mobs, enchanters will no longer be viable slowers<br />
<br />
This is assuming regular spells don't work.  I don't think that will be the case, therefore the new spells should be more efficient/useful (like dragon bane/giant bane were supposed to be during velious).  So enchanters will still be able to slow mobs, they just won't have a -30 mr check on them.  Realistically, there is no chance they're making an expansion of mobs which can only be slowed by shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Spells were updated on Lucy, today (9th).<br />
<br />
Shaman:<br />
Ancient Order 40% slow, 24 disease counters, 100 mana, -30MR check, Target Type: Single, recast 30 sec, cast time 1.5 sec, duration 7 ticks<br />
<br />
Ancient Balance 55% slow, 24 disease counters, 150 mana, -30MR check, Target Type: Single, recast 30 sec (was 6), cast time of 1.5 sec (was 3.0), duration 7 ticks (48 sec, was 6.5 min) <br />
<br />
Plague of Daluda (SHM/65) - (DD removed), 145 hp per tick, 16 disease counters, 393 (was 360) mana, 2.1 minute duration, disease resist (no modifier), Target Type: Single<br />
<br />
Note that &quot;Target Type:34&quot; was completely dropped - which throws out the idea of cursed mobs, or slowing chests. ;)  I'd imagine there'll be a few more changes, as beta goes on.<br />
<br />
You know, a quick look at the slow spells (Ancient Order should be a Disease based, looking at the cast messages) makes me think of Virulent Paralysis versus our Root spells...  Something that's for a fast, temporary usage, instead of the full monty.  But I really don't see any reason (I'm not in beta) why I'd mem one of these instead of Turgurs or Grummus...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">For the people saying &quot;You wanted a negative MR Slow&quot;. I wanted an innate negative resist adjust for debuffs, because I am a ****ing debuffer first of all. And I asked for a -75 to 100 scaling with level instead of a measly- 30 on a single spell.<br />
<br />
You can't be serious.  A -75 or greater MR adjustment is a bit much, don't you think - especially when we already have an unresistable MR debuff spell.  Why don't you just request a button to click that instantly destroys all mobs in a zone?</div></div><hr />
