<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well i decided that instead of waiting till i can afford the Iskar BP im going to get the Totemic Mail. I mean what the heck , its a quest item and would be just nice to have , not to mention its got a nice lil magical effect and nice AC.<br />
<br />
So last night i go and Get the gem from the Girl in the Barb fishing village and vist the girl in the Lake Rathe to Start the quest. Well after i get the Gem crushed i decided to go find Grizzlenot since he was right next to the rathe mnts . Well after having guilde help me for 45 min and soling with my GF's Druid on  /follow on a second PC tracking . for over 2 hours i did that and didnt see him once in SK. Im all for a challanging quest but i have to be doing something wrong or something.  Any tips ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Grizzleknot is a very rare spawn.  I think it spawns near the centi villiage (cannot confirm), but it roams near splitpaw, which is the only place I've seen it.<br />
<br />
I've owned 2 totemic BPs in my time, both got tracked down by a druid friend with some extreme luck.  When I was lvl 56 I was running to Innothule on my way to a PoF raid and I saw Grizzleknot, I dropped him and still have the bark.  One Bane of Nife cast and it didn't even run full duration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Basically you are just wasting your time.  Grizzlenot is a rare spawn and even if you do eventually find him its very likely a druid will engage him before you can.<br />
<br />
The BP isn't worth the effort.  You can get a Giant Lord's tunic for very little pp: thats 18ac, or Rygorr mail for 500pp (less now? I'm not sure of current price)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You need to be actively killing the many other named PH's that wander in SK as well as the wandering treant spawns.  This part of the Totemic quests used to be covered in depth in these forums, but I doubt any of that info is still around.<br />
<br />
Distorted facts from the absolute pits of my memory:<br />
<br />
1.  Grizz and his PH's follow a path that goes past the cent village to Paw and then up near the aviaks on way to near the hermits walled house.  From there I believe he backtracks on the western wall of the zone and goes past the bridge to NK.<br />
<br />
2.  Spawn time on named is about an hour+<br />
<br />
3.  Dr00d sites and mobhunter prolly know lots more than Naagruz so look around!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Litgruv:  Good luck on your quests.  It never occured to me that someone would spend the pp on the Gem and then get it crushed before getting the spawn items.  <br />
I'd recommend that you hold off on getting the Dufrenite until you have the rest of the items, and definity don't crush, powder or whatever the gem until you're sure that you are ready to turn the items in...the Ogers are in the same zone as the Barbarians who give the quest so no problem in delaying that part of the quest.<br />
<br />
Grizzleknot is a rare spawn, we are talking about days or weeks in between sightings.  I would suggest you start telling your friends/guildies that you are looking for him and have everyone start checking.  Then group a bit in SK and every so often ask about it in OOC.  Even if Grizzleknot is taken down by someone else, you can usually loot the piece you need if you are polite about it.<br />
<br />
I tried for 2 weeks, had given up and was on the moon when a guildie said Grizz was up.  A druid friend of mine ported me over, we ran around SK and we finally found him after about 20 mins.  A necro was already killing him, but was nice enough to let loot me the bark.  Also, you can MQ the bark if needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well with charisma of 95 it was only 150 pp. ITs not No Rent right ?? Lordy Lord i hope not cause it broke me hehe . 150 isnt alot but i been buying all sorts of stuff for me and my alts so i am currently under funded . plus i been trying to level up hardcore to play with my guild . So no real loot like the RM's . Just XP.<br />
<br />
Basicly i want this BP. I didnt know i could wear rygor battlemail so i might just go get that till i can get something uber nice. But there is something about completing this quest that makes it stick. I truly luv my shaman. I tend to think of myself as a bit of a shaman in real life which is why i picked this Class to begin with. I just want to complete it cause its simply a part of the Shaman vibe. Make sense? Its OUR Mail item just for a shaman. it would be nice to deck it out on special occasions . Something i EARNED , which is another reason i luv this character. NO TWINKS  . Im going to try again tonite with all the info in this post.  I cant see myself camping 5 hours a night for 2 weeks. but i cant just let it go. im on a mission now ;)</div></div><hr />

 soooo , got any really good druid sites? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You are looking at a random 24 hour spawn time for old Grizz.  I spent a month in SK looking for him.  Never found him.  <br />
<br />
But then I also spend 60 hrs in Perma hunting for a goblin snowball.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I spent a long time looking for him when the totemic quests first came out and never saw him. Fairly recently I spent a lot of time in SK for Quillmane, killed Quillmane about 4 times with one cloak and still never saw Grizzlenot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">is he triggered you think ?   Naagruz <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 mentioned something about activly killing the other named treants . i wonder if doing that is the only way to trigger his apperance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I spent a month, 6-8 hours a day doing nothing but hunting SK for grizzleknot.<br />
<br />
It nearly made me quit the game in frustration. Killed Quillmane SEVEN times in the process. No cloak (although I did finally get a cloak while I was hunting for pelts for smithing a couple weeks ago...love that thing).<br />
<br />
With extended enhancement II on it, the totemic BP is pretty good up until planar level now...but really it is best to just buy it, or get lucky on the spawn. Camping grizzleknot is a quick trip to a room with padded walls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Peeps used to obsess about the Totemic BP and I spent much time competing with 80+ other peeps in SK for most everything.  I saw Grizz twice and never was fast enough to outkill those nasty druids, so I went on my way and came back 3 expansions later to help a guildy with Quillmane.<br />
<br />
There are wandering treants that mirror the pathing of Grizz along with quite a few named mobs.  Just keep in mind that the original Old World mobs always have some sort of PH that will set the timer going for the next pop.  So pretty much kill anything that stands out and add in a few critters for good measure and eventually you will get your pop.  <br />
<br />
The undead area is a major point of respawn for most common critters in the northern part of the zone and it would not surprise me if it is the only one.  Named mobs prolly have their own unique spawn point.<br />
<br />
Gud luck, and just keep in mind that I picked up my Vindi BP quite a bit before I actually completed the Totemic BP quest :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well, my experience was different - about a year ago, when I was in my 30's, I zoned into SK and Grizzlenot was pathing right by the bridge, so I killed him.  A couple of weeks later, after I'd gotten the BP, I was looking for the centaur guy for the other totemic quests and somebody /ooc'd that he was up, killed him again and got more bark for the bank.  Never had to camp him.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, it took me 8 hours and 6-8 bull elephants to get the damned tooth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It took me 59 levels to finally see him to get my totemic bp.  :)<br />
<br />
I saw him when I was heading to the Arena for the shaman botb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Velarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Imho...<br />
<br />
Grizzle Knot is NOT a random spawn... he will pop eventually once you kill his place holder... the wandering Treant near the Skellie ground just out of bridge from NK, also the other small named mobs in SK are also believed to be PH, but I haven't seen proof of this yet...<br />
<br />
He is fairly easy to kill.<br />
<br />
I myself have done the totemic about 4 times total for my friends, as it is fairly easy to do :)<br />
<br />
For more info PM plz... :)<br />
<br />
Regards and Good Luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well, despite the objections of my friends, I decided to complete the totemic set.  I believe the mail was one of the last 3 pieces I picked up.  The Grizzleknot bark was actually the first piece I picked up for ANY totemic quest.  I had recently joined my current guild and we had a group going in SK.  Our druid checked his track and took off in a strange direction.  He was /g'ing TIG FOLLOW NOW so I did what a good recruit does and followed the druid.  I see this monstrous brown thing and we lay into him.  He didn't last 30 seconds.  The druid looted his stuff and told me to loot the bark.  I didn't know what it was for, so I just did as I was told.  Now, I'm level 51 and still wearing that mail (I don't raid enough or have enough cash to pick up better) and am pretty happy :)<br />
It's worth all the frustration.  Once you get that bark, you have to head to Kedge *shudder* and kill lancers until you get the fin.  Took 8 or 9 of them for me to get it, hopefully you'll get it on #1.  It's tough until your low to mid 40s.  At least, it was for me.  Of course, I was a shadr00d for most of that time, so your mileage may vary :)<br />
Good luck on it, and definetly don't give up!</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;He's rare, so rare in fact, players spend hours searching for him. There are only a few great mysteries left in the world...Do UFO's steal cattle? Who shot JFK? Is the Loch Ness monster real? Does Bilge actually spawn on Xegony? Does he actually spawn on any server? Will my quest for really bad plate armor drive me insane? These questions and more are why we gather here....&quot;<br />
<br />
Grizzleknot is one of the spawns detailed on this site.  :)</div></div><hr />
