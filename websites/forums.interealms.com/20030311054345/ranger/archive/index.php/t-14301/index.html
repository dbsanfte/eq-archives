<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drewno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What're the odds that I could stick my level 12 Cleric in a raid group for grummus in Disease or a raid in Ssra and Powerlevel the **** out of him from raid exp? Does anyone know if it's capped off at any point if the level difference is too high?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Voronwë Nimbrethil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well <br />
<br />
1. i bet you cant zone a lvl 12 player into PoD<br />
2. raid xp sucks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Legenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pretty sure the level range is still max half over, whether it's in group or in raid. So level 43 min (pretty sure it gets rounded down, if not it's 44) to get exp when grouped with a 65. I also highly doubt it'll be much of a powerleveling. Get a pickup group wherever and exp will surely go a lot faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taallyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Think you have to be at least 46th to enter any of the planes besides PoK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vladimirr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Taallyn is correct.  You can't zone out to PoT until 46.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">And no, raiding cannot be used to PL.<br />
I grouped my ranger and my mid-30s shaman in seperate groups in a raid and killed bodyguards. Ranger got xp. Shaman didnt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Haroun Zehra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Also, raid EXP is the suck, as they say.<br />
<br />
Night before last we did a Vindi killing.  We faced many, many giants before Vindi.  There were under 40 people on the raid, and at lvl. 60 w/ 100% AA, I got 1% AA for the entire 45 minute she-bang.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Braslo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">1% to everyone is more fair than 20% to 1 single group.<br />
<br />
As for the PLing thing... I know it doesn't work because of the level seperation, but if it had, what seems like a 'small' percent of XP to a level 60+ is going to be a HUGE amount of XP to a level 12 or 30 toon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought the same thing when PoP came out.  But raid exp. has been SO bad that it's completely worthless.  Verant (I know shockingly) is obviously amazingly paranoid that raid experience would be abused somehow?  <br />
<br />
Anyway, It's more like this:  Better 1 group gets 20% than everybody gets nothing...because that's what you really get, nothing.  I can solo kill one mob and get more experience than raiding for a couple of hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>TC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I also think it fosters people to be lazy on raids and not perform their best.  I see this alot now people who use to try their best on the clearing parts of raids autofollowing and going afk for 20 minutes.  When you use to compete for exp when on raids.  Some nights were always better than others but you always worked your hardest to try to get the exp.<br />
<br />
Just my observation<br />

Im appaled to see people would be stupid enough and exp greedy enough to not take advantage of the /raid system<br />
<br />
As a raid leader, Ive got to say that I love it, makes my job 100 times easier for forming groups, and keeping up on who is in which one. Swapping people between groups works like a charm also, not to mention one doesn't have to worry @ anything being ninja looted with the /add looter, function.<br />
<br />
Farmed Kael last night at the bridge for 2 hours, the total exp we got between 10 people (Necro Bst, Pal,Sk were groupped together bc there was only 1 cleric) and in all I got close to 1 yellow AA, which seems pretty normal considering the exp was split between 2 groups.<br />
<br />
Raid exp isnt bad, you just can't expect to get good results on it when your raid consists of 40 people, because the total exp pool hasn't changed, but now you have to share exp with 6 more groups.<br />
<br />
Finally, Kael is more or less ****ty exp still.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aye, this I would have to agree with totally.  Even though I am not the raid leader, when it starts to get let for some people, I assist in helping getting people moved around and groups filled up.<br />
<br />
Keeping groups full is important to the appearance that there are enough people to continue the raid and to make sure that one group isnt all melee and another isnt all priests, etc.  Add that even being /anon or /role does not hide the classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sharteel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My guess is that raid XP is linked to the number of people in the raid.<br />
<br />
(read this carfull: im not saying devided)<br />
<br />
Basically it would be something in line of:<br />
<br />
10 person raid (100-10=) 90 % XP of a mob devided over 10 people. (10% penalty)<br />
50 person raid (100-50=) 50 % XP of a mob devided over 50 people. (50% penalty)<br />
<br />
So the more people you have in raid the harder you are penalized. What this penalty is exactly peolple need to parse out more.<br />
<br />
This is also in line with the statement in the patch message that came along with this thing going live stating something in these lines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Elwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I love the raid feature. Makes buffing, group managing and all that previously tedious stuff a hella lot easier.<br />
<br />
Don't knock the exp either. While not good, at least it prevents anybody from dropping into negative net gain for the day.</div></div><hr />

Ok, i've changed my mind.  We can't have those monks getting used to leaving a raid with anywhere's near the XP they started with.  They just won't know what to do with themselves if they don't loose at least a bubble on every raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Voronwë Nimbrethil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">i think raid xp is good.<br />
<br />
it also keeps people from being dumb and greedy trying to get KS xp.</div></div><hr />

I cant figure out if your being sarcastic in a good way or in a bad way...?<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Wingelefoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">not sure what yer saying when you say you get no exp from raid exp... im currently lvl 56 and get about 5% increase in my exp evertime my guild does ToV HoT with raid exp...</div></div><hr />
