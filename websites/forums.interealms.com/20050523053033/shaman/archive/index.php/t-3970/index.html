hehe ok ok so I know its not as exciting as insta sow boots, JBB or the epic but I am down to 1 single piece of JB armor I am missing for free buffs. I have all the pieces cept the leggings which are furstatingly never being sold when I am on. I got the gaunts and boots last night to compliment the helm and vambraces I already have. But I am not gonna worry cause I got a few levels till I can clicky buff anyways. Now all I need to figure out is what to replace the Totemic BP with once I hit 45. JB BP is just way to expensive for me and on a Sullon Zek its not exactly an easy camp ;) If I could just come up with 9k for an Iksar Ceremonial BP lol<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just bear in mind that the legs on my server go for around 20k.  The stats on them are damn nice and very hard to beat (only droppable leg's I would take over them are Barbed Rubicite coz of the extra hp).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xalbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the heads up. My totemic legs are suffecient for now. I am hoping the screwy PvP server prices will work in my favor ;) or maybe Ill find someone who is tired of selling em. Thanks to the Bazaar I have got all my JB stuff for under 2k which on SZ I understand the vambraces alone go for around 800-1kpp</div></div><hr />
