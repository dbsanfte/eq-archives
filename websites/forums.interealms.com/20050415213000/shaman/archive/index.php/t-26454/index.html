<br />
Immediately preceding the merger, all characters below level 10 that have not been logged in for over six months will be deleted from each of the merging servers and will not be available after the server merge.  If you have a character on any of the servers being merged that is below level 10 and has not been logged in for more than six months, you will need to log that character in prior to the scheduled merge date for the relevant server.  <br />
<br />
Also, first merger is on the 7th:<br />
<br />
4/7 Brell Serilis merges with Cazic Thule and will be listed as Cazic Thule<br />
<br />
4/11 Morden Rasp merges with Povar and will be listed as Povar. <br />
<br />
4/11 Lanys T'Vyl merges with The Seventh Hammer and will be listed as The Seventh Hammer.<br />
<br />
4/14 Tarew Marr merges with Drinal and will be listed as Drinal.<br />
<br />
4/18 Mithaniel Marr merges with Saryrn and will be listed as Saryrn.<br />
<br />
4/18 Tholuxe Paells merges with The Rathe and will be listed as The Rathe.<br />

Its possible there was a roll-back on your server, I have seen people lose newly created characters before that way, but this seems a bit extreme. <br />
<br />
Question, did you create the character, then log out TOTALLY until the following morning? <br />
<br />
In any event, even events that occur mid-rollback are recorded, so you should get everything back easy enough. Please keep us informed though, so many times we see these posts, and when the problem gets fixed we dont see a &quot;The fixed it&quot; post, and that just further fuels the fire in everyones eyes. Especially today.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Okay, here's the deal.  My wife rolled the cleric at about 6:00 p.m. Saturday.  Played around with her for an hour in the bazaar, etc. etc.  Logged completely out.  Sunday afternoon she logged in and the toon was gone.  She made ANOTHER dark elf cleric, same name before I could stop her.  I told her to log out, and log in with Vork, since he is the original toon on my account. She /petitioned.  They did the &quot; we would like to take information about your computer&quot; bit.  Four hours later there was still no reply, and I had RL issues to deal with, so I logged.  Came back that night, and the NEW cleric was gone too.  Still no word from Customer Support; and my account reads no open tickets as far as the petition goes.</div></div><hr />
