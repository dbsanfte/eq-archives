<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, going to ding 59 soon.  When I group or raid, it tends to be with my guild, plenty of places to go.  We're a &quot;young&quot; guild just starting more serious raiding.  My gear is decent, but no jbb or epic (eventually guild will go to Fear :) ).  Have horsey, about 950 AC, 2100 hitpoints, and good resists.<br />
<br />
So, I'm looking for soloing suggestion for lv. 59, for those times when I need a break from grouping and/or raiding.<br />
<br />
Levels 55-58 solo hours have been spent at:<br />
<br />
1)  Chardok, entrance camp.<br />
2)  Burning Woods.<br />
3)  Katta--Nathyn's gurads, srating to go lt. blue at 58.<br />
4)  OS entrance (tough to solo though)<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did about 40 percent of 59 in Plane of Nightmare grouped, 60 percent at the entrance to chardok solo.  Experience rate not that dissimilar, a blue and some per hour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tanamil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmmm, if you can get a group together that has some good DPS and a nice tank, guards in PoN are nice xp.  I would say maybe 2 blue per hour.  They are level 65, but at 59 after malosini, slowing is pretty easy.  First guard malosini landed first time and slowed landed on first also.  Next few took a few casts but wasn't too bad.  They are SKs so they HT and fear, but they have very few hps for a 65 mob.  Nice xp, didn't get any loot though.  5 minute respawn time on em, only 2.</div></div><hr />

The tsetsian flies (however they are spelled) near the GY in POD are nice solo xps. Park doggy at the large rock south of the fly camp and slow pull them....I would then root em and Bane of Nife, then sick dog dog and throw in another BON. No adds if you stay at the rock otherwise you will get rat adds and they hit hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Arghargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Tsetsians are good.  Two dangers there.  First, is there are wandering rats, and larvas that will agro.  They are often unseen (either behind a hill, or underwater).  The other danger there is when a druid or bard kite goes haywire.  On the other hand, if a good kiter is there, it can actually be safer as they sweap up any potential adds.  <br />
