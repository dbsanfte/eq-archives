<br />
<br />
Abashi: Players can purchase tickets from any Wizard platform.  With this they can travel to the nexus. A spell is cast every 15 minutes to send people who are ready to travel up to the moob.  From the nexus they can adventure on Luclin, or transport back to any Wizard platform on the old world.<br />

Beats a boat any day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grinric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Purchase???<br />
<br />
<br />
you mean I'm gonna have to give some NPC pp to get there??  that sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Interesting... should cut down on many people needing ports: <br />
<br />
1) get a SoW/click Jbooties<br />
2) run to nearest wiz portal<br />
3) go to nexus<br />
4) go to wiz portal closest to your desired destination<br />
<br />
I heard this is just the BIG spires (NK, GF, Toxx, DL)... wonder if it will work for all platforms...<br />
<br />
Could PO the druids/wizzies who hire themselves out as taxis (buh bye 50pp ports?) ... but from a convenience stand point, it favours the non-porting classes...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arborealus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wizard Platform?<br />
<br />
Hrmmm there are no platforms in either Kunark or Velious right?<br />
<br />
I wonder if he means any area with Wiz Spires..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aaeamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah.  Also notice what the Nexus does.  No more shouting for a port.  Any character can go from any one wizzy port to another wizzy port by making the trip to the Nexus.  Not as convienent as everyone just having port spells, but pretty good for non-porters and travel.<br />
<br />
A bit disappointed that druids got no port to the moon spells, but love the ability the nexus gives to non-porters, especially melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes, it will cut into the porting biz, but the people that generally pay for that stuff don't want to wait the time this would take. Also a consideration is just how much is the ticket? Porting will probably drop (or rise) to that level.<br />
<br />
Also, it appears it is just the platforms, so very helpful in the old world, except it won't get you to Fayd and if you really want to go to Kunark's wizard platform (Sky Fire) then you are either very uber, very desperate or both. <br />
<br />
The big bucks I have seen are from Kunark to the main land and also to and from SoV..<br />
<br />
*Edit* It is my understanding it is platforms only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cyrssi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">erm, abash isaid it himself in his statement above:<br />
<br />
From the nexus they can adventure on Luclin, or transport back to any Wizard platform on the old world.<br />
<br />
You can only go back to old world (original EQ continents) platforms from the nexus. No Kunark/Velious, even if they have platforms somewhere.<br />
<br />
Of course, this is abashi talking. there is the chance that he is completely wrong :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Also in how you translate old world. He could just mean the world and not the moon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm sure after there are more wizards have the proper port spells and the MASSES have been to the moon and back that Verrant will remove these NPC's.  Think about what the flood of people where like when Kunark was released, this will be the same way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Knarlz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">At this time there are no players who can port up to the moon. everyone needs to take the wizzard spire shuttles.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what they did about , ress backs or tl to binds.</div></div><hr />
