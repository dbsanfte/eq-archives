<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dartaniun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i'm wondering how many of you have this spell and what the exact effects are? i saw it in the bazaar tonight for 15k which is about 5k less than it's usually sold for on Torv. so i bought it. even if i don't scribe it i can sell it to somebody else.  anyone use this spell a lot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Muvandog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">3/mana tick + enlarge you + magnification<br />
<br />
15k?  buy it.<br />
<br />
Only drops offf Luclin bosses (RC/DS/IV and the like).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>decairn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This spell lasts for what seems to be forever so it's always up on me.  Free mana is a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rezz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bladecoat and Mask of the Stalker last the exact same length of time.<br />
<br />
My first 2 buff slots, 99% of the time, are those 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Viken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">RC never drops spells but the others can drop it. I got mine off the AC Burrower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zolina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you have Clarity 3 or Clarity 4 and you're not casting too much, you might want to click this off to free up a buff slot.  Otherwise, it's as valuable as your other ranger buffs and definitely worth buying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Telon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Have it up all the time, the mana regen is great and I've become so used to the vision shift (it's not really magnification, actually the opposite, everything gets a tiny bit smaller so that your field of view is a little wider) that my screen looks wrong if I don't have it up.  The grow component of the spell doesn't work, which is fine by me.  I spend most of my raid time shrunk anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Althalonas Cazicbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">3k in the bazaar :) can't mem it yet but am looking forward to being able to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Anwar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Is there any place and/or mob that a 65 ranger and a 62 druid hydra can hunt to get this spell?  or does it only drop off of boss mobs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ticat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">yes it only drop off boss ...<br />
like  AL, HP, cursed cycle, ( just what come up in my mind now )<br />
so i dont think u can solo or duo to get this spell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Daesun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It's awesome, I'm a big fan.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Asylumdweller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Dropped off TIV for me yesterday. Looking forward to scribing it - at the very least it's a great solo tool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ruvane Hammerfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Love this spell, seems hella rare and I was delighted to get it as easily as I did.  The extra mana regen is great, larger field of vision is wonderful, and the see invis componant is excellent.<br />
<br />
Seems to go for around 20K, but got lucky and grabbed it for a guildee the other day for 8K.<br />
<br />
Now, if I could just get Frozen Winds! =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Got mine off of Cursed cycle in Ssra the other day. It actually looks like I SHRUNK when i cast it. *shrug* (stuck myself in a corner and F9ed around till i was looking at myself. The name over my head was cut off. I cast it and my name appeared on screen as if i had shrunk)<br />
I did notice the mana increase right away, even tho i have FT5 already.<br />
Raiding: C3, Spiritual Purity, FT5 and MotS = FM all the freekin time. =)</div></div><hr />
