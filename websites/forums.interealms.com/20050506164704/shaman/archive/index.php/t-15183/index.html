<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just curious.<br />
<br />
Last night, I joined an exp group in PoV, WW camp. At first it was 65 shaman, 60 monk, 62 beastlord, 61 cleric, together with a /role warrior and a /role necro. I replaced a 56 enchanter! The warrior was 57, as I found out later, and I'm not sure about the necro, though I'd guess he was around 58 (he didn't have a spectre pet and seemed to have problems snaring things). Experience was about the slowest I've had in PoV in a functional group, but the BL and monk were friends, so I didn't mind too much.<br />
<br />
At any rate, the warrior went LD around 5 times in the time I was there. Even when he was present, he was often not doing anything, or running around in circles because of the lag. One time he ran away from the group due to lag, went LD and agroed a mob and was fighting it. We had to go pull it off him to keep him safe. He did manage to loot the most of anyone though. He was only level 57 and couldn't hold agro worth a damn too. When he was LD, the BL was doing a better tanking job anyway (in terms of holding agro at least, though health went down a lot faster).<br />
<br />
About the time I was leaving, the warrior went LD again, and someone got a replacement for him. I felt sorry for the guy for having a bad ISP, but a good connection is a requirement for the game, imo and he was really a liability to the group anyway.<br />
<br />
But even so, a couple of group members weren't that happy about kicking him out. It was one guy who got a replacement, without really consulting the rest of us. I think the consensus seemed to be, &quot;Replace him if you want, but I'm not going to be the one to tell him&quot;.<br />
<br />
I was thinking, of all my time in EQ, I have rarely seen someone kicked out of a group for any reason, though I haven't been grouped with that many people who've been totally useless. In the past, when someone in the group is lame, I've seen everyone &quot;have to go&quot; and even start up the group again without that person, but it's rare when someone's actually been removed.<br />
<br />
So, have you kicked any out of your group, if so, why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes. Kicked an enchanter out of a group to replace them with a guild enchanter because the kid was a utter d00d moron. Was a quiet druid in the group that was his friend and left because I disbanded him, but replaced her too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">After LD no3 or so i would expect from anyone with common courtesy to log off for himself (at least the core roles as main tank and main healer and slower in tough camps).<br />
<br />
Kicking someone out of groups? Twice.<br />
<br />
First was a annoying as hell very low lvl ranger (i think), using /role to blatantly leech XP from our higher level group.<br />
<br />
Second was some 'nice' fellow player (nameless to protect the guilty) who was on ML-duty and LDed, for some strange reason exactly the second when it was time to split loot. After an hour later that person logs back and barely remembers, that there was some group at all - refusing to discuss the topic. Some weeks later i am getting invited to a nice camp and lo and behold, loot_whore_01 is in group !! Short tell to group leader - oh, we need a shaman here - OK do your thing - /makeleader Sharok - /disband loot_whore_01  :p  :D  :p i love karma.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I know I've kicked people out of groups a couple times, but the only one I can distinctly remember was a cleric in PoV.  The cleric joined the group and immediately started barking orders and &quot;yelling&quot; at everyone for everything they did.  He's telling everyone to get in range because he's buffing and of course someone is OOR.  In this case it was the SK puller who had quite literally JUST gotten po9/symbol and didn't want the group virtue the cleric was casting, but the cleric didn't care he just wanted to go off on this SK for not doing what he told him.  Then he starts ranting about how symbol/9 won't last long and he'll have to spend yet another of his precious peridots on a single target virtue and how it's ppl like him that make all the clerics broke and yadda yadda.  <br />
<br />
I know several officers in this guys guild and I know for a fact that they supply their clerics with plenty of dots at every raid.  I asked the cleric nicely to relax at first but then as he kept spewing on and on I tried a more direct approach of simply tellin him to shut the f..k up and quit whining already or find another group.  So he started bitching at me for something or other and I responded by disbanding him.  This was roughly 2 minutes after he joined the group and we hadn't pulled a single mob yet.<br />
<br />
And that's why I avoid pickup groups as much as possible. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oh ya ive kicked ppl out of groups.  <br />
<br />
Heres a couple things that will get you my size 12 steel-toed boot up your ass:<br />
<br />
-being under lvl60<br />
-going afk without warning<br />
-being a dumbass<br />
-and the &quot;can i put my alt in your group and ill do stuff out of group ****&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Never kicked anyone out, but did the ol &quot;its time to go&quot; bit and reform a while ago. We were in PoN, low to mid 50s all of us, except this retard cleric who was 48 or 49. The group had a nice group of melees, with a war, sk, 2 bl's, clr, and me. One pull, the sk got an add, and right away this cleric shouts ZONE ZONE GET OUT OF HERE. So, I'm like you got to be kidding, I could prob solo one of these sissy trees and with 4 melees and a cleric he calling for zone on 2. So, he comes back, and I politely tell the group not to zone with one little add, with 4 melees and them both slowed there going down no sweat, heck in the past I have even rooted adds and tanked em myself until the rest of the group was finished with the other one. So he starts getting all cocky, like, don't tell me how to play my class...and I know what I can and can't do and what I can and can't heal blah blah blah. Well, at least he knew his limits and knew that he was a complete moron and couldn't play a cleric for **** :). Unfortunately, he was group leader, so I said I had to go, then he said something like he did to, so after he left, I rejoined their group. The funny part was I think 1 or 2 of the other people were in his guild, and went along with it lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The last one I remember was in Valor.  We had 5, and there was a 62 Enchanter LFG at the zonein where we'd all met up, so I invite him.<br />
<br />
Enchanter: Where are we going?<br />
Me: NW corner of the wasteland<br />
Enchanter: Not going there, no way.  It's impossible to get there without someone dying.<br />
(Disband)<br />
<br />
Seriously, now, by 62, if you have invis and a con button, you can make it there in 3 minutes.  I just wasn't up to arguing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've kicked people from groups MANY times.<br />
For reasons like:<br />
1) failing to do their job in a timely manner<br />
2) being a loot whore<br />
3) sucking at their job and refusing to take instruction from Yours Truly<br />
4) training the group repeatedly<br />
5) being a ********<br />
6) failing to own a clue<br />
7) pissing me off<br />
8) forgetting to bring me a present and thank me for having them<br />
9) hitting on my current EQ girlfriend<br />
10) saying something bad about shamans<br />
11) insisting that we invite an enchanter<br />
12) going AFK too much.  <br />
13) not doing everything i say<br />
14) being from a jerky guild<br />
<br />
:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yes, just recently.  Even left my guild over it(was only in it for two days, so no real loss).  There was a 39 druid in Dreadlands that I invited with a paladin.  He was anon but I'd seen him around before and seen his oocs for groups.  It was a pick-up group because the zone was slow so I was forming a group up.  Anyway, all the druid was supposed to do was snare at 2 bubbles.  Very simple task and I don't expect a whole lot more out of a druid in my group(at that level).  One he obviously, couldn't or didn't want to do.  We kept having to deal with spiders taking off like bullet trains out into the zone and aggroing more mobs.  I asked the druid multiple times to snare at two bubbles.  His excuse was that he was OOM and couldn't.  However, I had been watching him and he was using his mana to buff himself and then melee the mob.  So there was a pretty good reason why he was OOM, he wasn't meding(we didn't have a chanter).  I asked him one final time to snare mobs at two bubbles.  The next mob came in and he still didn't snare it and continued to melee the mobs.  I booted him from the group after the mob was dead.<br />
<br />
Well, it turns out, the guy was a guild member who was hiding his tag.  At level 40, a druid should know his role in a group and I have no wish to teach random people how to play anymore.  The game is full of twinks, ebabies and PL'd schmucks to even waste time on it.  If I'd known he was a guild member, I would have been more lenient with him and tried to show him the ropes better.  But next thing I know, I'm lost in tell hell from officers in the guild asking what happened.  None of them seemed to understand my position and were berating me for doing that to a guild member.  The guild leader even had the gall to say that guild members were suppose to teach ALL people how to play in groups, not just other guild members.  I told her that I didn't sign up for Teachers of Norrath and that if that was what they expected of me, the guild wasn't right for me.  After talking for a little while longer(this had already stretched into almost an hour, lost in tell hell while still being the leader and slower for my group in DL, which had obviously suffered because of it), I removed myself from the guild.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hail,<br />
<br />
I give people a few chances to improve after making glaring errors, then I boot them, letting them know why.  Something like this:<br />
<br />
&quot;Cleric01, you have repeatedly let the main tank die on a single slowed mob with no adds nor mitigating circumstances.  Your style of gameplay is not conducive to good exp and is dangerous to the safety of this group.  I am sorry but for the good of the group I am disbanding you.  I will take over the primary healing duties until a replacement healer can be found.   Please take this (insert 200pp gem here) as compensation for your usage of peridots.  You do not need to stay while we get a replacement.  Take care&quot;<br />
<br />
I have another little paragraph for wizards or rangers who can't control their aggro.  Warriors who can't KEEP aggro (I can't fault them if they are taunting &amp; trying) don't get booted - I just alter our tactics to compensate.  Someone who repeatedly breaks mezzes will also eventually feel my boot.<br />
<br />
That said, I rarely join a pure pickup group anymore.  I do normally speak with the other members of the groups in tells before giving someone the boot.<br />
<br />
It hasn't happened often, but it has happened.  Incompetence in strangers is not worth my time.  Friends and guildmates I will spend extra time with training or making allowances.  If it is a guildmate that is the one I'd normally boot, I will usually remove myself from the group instead of removing them.<br />
<br />
Unannounced or extended AFK's from strangers in exp groups will also get disbanded rapidly by me.  When they come back, if they were competent, I let them back in.  <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>sir0die</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I was in dreadlands, ruins #3, we had a routine pick up group, ruins #1 was camped. we were pulling hot and heavy, killing stuff faster than pablo can fry up a chihuhua. Eventually a group came in and camped ruins #2. Our pullers (two of them) started pulling mobs right out from the middle of the group at ruins#2. After an eternity of hostile tells and /ooc's from ruins2 group we warned our pullers to stop KSing, did they listen? hell no. I was also recieving numerous tell from other group members, they were concerned that their guildnames would be tarnished by this blatant KSing. the 2 pullers were guildless and friends with each other.<br />
<br />
After being told if they KS that group one more time, that the rest of the group would not assist them. Well, the other group had a large pull, our guys went to ks them, pulled 4 of the 6 mobs from the other group, ran back to us. I invised all the other group members, we watched the mobs kill these 2 guys then straggle back to their previous fight with ruins2 group. The ruins2 cleric cast a 96% rezz on them, and I disbanded them both. they both left the zone because ruins2 group was laying hard into them in /ooc and no-one else wanted them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Joredor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Got invited to a pickup group in PoD. Not great XP at my level (63 at the time). <br />
<br />
I get there to find that all the other members are below 60. The cleric gates to get a KEI, so I am left with a sub 60 Warrior, Shadowknight, Rogue, and Wizard from memory. So the warrior pulls 2 lightcrawlers I think and screams for a heal, I root one so he immediately goes and stands next to it and fights the other way. I havent been able to slow them as I am too busy healing the warrior and then getting agro and dying, a great start to the group. Come back and the cleric got his KEI, but disbanded the group in getting it. The Warrior got kicked before I got back and we got another SK I think. So we reform and start killing, I am group leader at this stage coz I reformed the group before the cleric got back. The wizard then says he need to go AFK for a while, no sweat off he goes. About 30 minutes later he got booted by me for not having moved in the last half an hour. I sent him a few tells and go response and the rest of group members were getting a bit annoyed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Disbanded few AFK's. If you say you'll be back in a few moments, I'll wait 15min or so. Say couple minutes, I'll wait 30 max. If you expect me to sit there and keep on killing, let me know what's going on. Just be glad I evac'd to zoneline, or ported somewhere safe before dumping ya and heading back.<br />
<br />
If you don't know your roll, expect the boot. I understand getting into a group of people that you've not worked with before, there is an adjustment period. Figuring out how hard you can nuke, and when, and the like. But I swear if I have to spend half the fights running around after the mob, C'ya.<br />
<br />
If you think there's room for improvement, by all means, let's talk about it. I'm always willing to learn something new, or try things a different way. If you start trying to order me around, prepare for Das Boot.<br />
<br />
Being a 3-boxer, stopping to loot, slows me down. I normally ask someone else to handle the looting for me. If it's someone I know, I ask them first. If they are a guild I am familiar with and have friend in (That I know would make this persons life hell) I'll ask them next. If they are people I've never seen before, I still try and give the benefit of the doubt.<br />
<br />
Was camping away happily with Me, Myself and I. Stranger_01 comes along, and asks to group. I say sure. He asks if 2 more of his friends can join. I say sure. After 30min, of the one of his buddies not somuch as moving, I ask what the deal is. &quot;He's afk&quot;. Fine, he's got 15min. &quot;You can't do that&quot; /PUNT, correction, yes I can. &quot;We'll disband unless you invite him back&quot; /PUNT /BOOT Allow me to help ya along. &quot;You need us!&quot;  I'd been camping this area for 2hrs, before they showed up, somehow I managed to get along without them in my way.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Krakur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Once I was in Deep East of BoT with a group of people... the rogue went afk in the middle of a fight without telling anyone... 10 minutes pass and she's not back, we keep pulling anyway. We get a 3 on a pull (No cc except for bard) and wipe (im sure glad the rogue goes afk in the middle of pull path and takes aggro on everything in to camp!) I disband the group and put the rogue on ignore, because I'd rather not group with complete morons.<br />
<br />
Fast forward to a few weeks later.<br />
<br />
<br />
Was a group of us - war/ranger/rogue/bard/cleric/shaman(me, duh) in HoH killing random trash... I kept seeing parts of conversations and couldnt figure out what the hell was going on... then I remembered; HEY THAT'S THAT ****TY ROGUE FROM BOT! Oh well, people can get a second chance I suppose...<br />
<br />
Rogue kept going afk for a few minutes at a time... even when she was there, she wasn't very useful.<br />
<br />
Anywho, she says she needs to go AFK for a bio, fine, 2-3 minutes and she'll be back right? Wrong. Once again, she's afk uninvis in the middle of the pull path, pissing everyone off.<br />
<br />
After 10 minutes and her not being back, and nobody saying anything, I told the group I wasn't interesting in powerleveling anyone today. The warrior (both the war and rogu were apps to the same guild) sent me a tell saying he didn't know she was like this and he's sorry, etc. 10 more minutes pass by (20 total) and still nothing... I again start expressing my displeasure. The ranger then says she also doesn't want to be powerleveling someone. I tell the group she needs to be kicked out, she's not doing a damn thing. 10 More minutes pass and more group members start agreeing with me that she needs to go. So, the warrior kicks her from the group. The ranger has a druid friend OTW to fill the spot as we agreed.<br />
<br />
5 [35 MINUTES TOTAL] minutes later the rogue starts moving around, and acts like she was only gone for a minute. We later find out she went to the bathroom, shaved her legs, got a snack, and cleaned up the house a bit before returning... the WORST part is that the warrior REINVITED her into the group. At this I was absolutely disgusted... she didn't apologize for being gone, or anything. Just asked for haste and acted like everything was cool...<br />
<br />
Now you see the problem - We have a druid otw to replace her, and a full group. The druid shows up and stands next to us. I tell the warrior to kick the rogue and get the druid. Nothing happens. The ranger tells me she's going to leave if the rogue isn't kicked. I reply that I don't blame her one bit. [the only reason I stayed is because I needed to finish off MGB :P] She leaves and gets a port from the druid who also leaves.<br />
<br />
The rogue doesn't even acknowledge she pissed people off, and starts asking the bard to &quot;pull plz&quot;.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later another ranger shows up and we have a full group again. I rebuff everyone but the rogue. She starts asking for buffs, and I don't reply.<br />
<br />
The rogue announces she has to leave for work! she disbands and leaves. THE GROUP REJOICES!<br />
<br />
Great group after that, spent the next 2 hours or so cracking jokes about her, good times.<br />
<br />
So to you, Kaytana [ayonae ro], GFY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Usually don't kick anyone for being a bad player, (and as a 61 Enchanter I pay for their mistakes more than you can imagine), but have been in groups that have kicked folks for being an a55.<br />
<br />
A Shaman has this power too (And you guys seem too nice to use it), but as an Enchanter, if someone is repeatedly f-in up - I'll send a tell to the GL, &quot;Hi, so and so is a fek tard, they are getting me killed. They are breaking mezz, not assisting, etc.&quot; That either fixes the problem or I leave.<br />
<br />
9/10 the GL handles the problem and the player auto-corrects or disbands. <br />
<br />
I used to LOVE Cazic Thule as a 24-31 Enchanter as THE place to learn CC. Not that I'm old school (This was post J-boots and Rubicite), but at least you cut your teeth in a place where you knew that IF you did your job you were going to live.  Had my defining moment as a young Enchanter (The one that determines whether or not you are going to be worth a sheit) in old CT.<br />
<br />
Nowadays? Shoot, it's a race to 60.<br />
<br />
100% agree about the AFK thing. That's doable in DAOC where you can have 7 people still pulling their weight. (DAOC Max group is 8). THe dynamics are waaaay different in EQ for 5 to be doign the work of 6.</div></div><hr />

one that is really funny happened a few days ago. my sk friend is a troll and our cleric was a frog. well, first the frog didn't heal him, so i had to but with two rangers in the group i had my hands more than full. Eventually the sk dies and sends me a tell &quot;*** you were the only one healing me&quot; (not that i was actually healing him i just throw a regen on him and hope for the best *wink*) So a few minutes pass, a ton of spam messages &quot;you have been given permission to drag dwunkins corpse!&quot; pop up on my screen. oh~! he must want me to ask that cleric for a rez! I ask the cleric &quot;hey do you think you could rez the tank any time soon? i'm running out of mana healing the rangers and you don't seem to be doing.... well anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
he responds with &quot;no i won't rez him, don't you know about frogs and trolls? he's my mortal enemy i can't help him!&quot; i was chuckling right about then, sent the sk a few tells and watched him get irate, but enuff was enuff. i tell the cleric &quot;ok enough role playing we're gonna die if you don't rez him&quot; no go. same ****, &quot;don't you know about frogs and trolls!?&quot;<br />
<br />
instead of getting him to rez the troll i convinced him to do his job and heal the rangers. he got a whole lot of aggro and got about eight tribals on him when he hopped through the camp. so he starts screaming &quot;heal me heal me!'<br />
<br />
my only response before he left the group was &quot;oh don't you know about bears and frogs? oh, or did you ever hear the one about the smartass who didn't rez the tank and didn't get any heals from the nice shaman?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">So, have you kicked any out of your group, if so, why?<br />

I kick ppl out of groups for 3 reasons: loot whores perma AFKs slow pullers<br />
<br />
when i grp with ppl i take care that loot is equally distributed, so if some1 keeps looting even the corpse hit the ground he gets 1 warning then he gets kicked, easy as that. i hate greed necks.<br />
Same for AFK ppl. I dont have 8 hours to play each day so i dont wanna waste time because of someones laundry, dog whatever.<br />
Last reason is slow pullers. some ppl pull a mob...fight it and when its dead they sit down, start chatting whatever. i want constant incomming unless some1 needs afk or is lom. <br />
A fast puller can do wonders to your exp. I was grped and had a puller who sat down after each pull for AFK or chatting in tells. My exp moved slow and grp was pissed off. So i kicked him and got a new puller. He chainpulled, leaving camp when mob was at 5 % and brought new one. with that puller my exp went up so damn fast i couldnt believe it.<br />
<br />
So yes i do kick ppl, well i talk to them before i kick em but if they keep beeing lame they get a kick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Yep, the dreaded dreadlands pick up group.<br />
<br />
Joined a tank heavy group after a cleric left in a hurry, then found out why. 2 were pulling at the same time, often with adds. At one point we had 5 mobs and 5 tanks all taking damage (and all getting poisoned). After ONE pull I was OOM even with KEI and mad cannidancing.<br />
<br />
I told them they'd certainly die if they didn't learn to use the /assist key, as I needed a little more breathing room to buff, slow and heal. Let's have one puller, and /assist at 95%.<br />
<br />
Next pull, exactly the same thing. They're all taunting like maniacs, and the ranger starts shooting off arrows at passing mobs to keep the pulls going. I repeated the above, and that one healer wasn't sufficient to heal 5 rapidly dying melees. Repeated that they need to use the assist key.<br />
<br />
2 of them asked where the /assist key was.<br />
<br />
/disband.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Only once have I had to boot someone - primarily because I don't do pickup groups much any more.<br />
<br />
When my wife and I were around level 13-15 in Oasis, we grouped with this d00d necro.  He kept making lurid comments about her chainmail wedgie and stuff, bitched about the pull rate (he didn't have time to med), was an ass about loot (hey, no loot in Oasis anyway bud, chill out).  Finally when he didn't get a buff he wanted because I was OOM he said something like &quot;I should go solo&quot;... and that was my cue to disband him.<br />
<br />
He then spent 15 minutes in /tell trying to get back into the group.  Against my better judgement I invited him back (some others wanted him in there).  He killed for 5 min, went afk for about 10 min, then announced that he had just dinged and memmed new spells while he was sitting there and he was off to solo, and weren't we all suckers for PLing him while he memmed his new spells.  Great guy and one of the reasons I don't group out of guild much any more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I have only once ever kicked someone although I have disbanded and reformed a few times. I usually just group with friends and guildies so its not a problem anyways, but one time we were short a tank so we invite a 62 lfg SK to tank in PoV for us (long before the zone was open).<br />
<br />
Right off the bat theres agro problems like crazy. I ask if he's snaring the mobs for agro and he's like &quot;No, should I?&quot; Someone in the group tries to explain to him about using snare for agro so he does it on one mob then stops again. The entire time I'm saying in guildchat that if he hadn't learned how to do that by 62, he wouldn't now. <br />
<br />
Well he doesn't get the point there, so still have agro bouncing all over the place until someone points out the mobs are getting rooted all the time. Seems he's using the tuna sword that procs root, but has zero clue how proximity agro works. We try to explain that to him, but no go. Then we ask him to switch weapons and he says no way he'll change out his &quot;uber sword&quot;. <br />
<br />
So we try and give him suggestions for about half an hour then tell him he either changes weapons and starts snaring or we find a new tank and he just disbands. After that he spends the next 20 minutes sending tells to group members asking why we didn't like his tanking with his awesome sword. <br />
<br />
Just to make things worse, about three weeks after that I'm in a BoT group with a guildie and his bots and he invites this SK to tank without letting me know who was coming. I start talking to him about how bad he was and by then everyone in the guild had heard about this SK he just didn't remember his name. So I'm like I'll give it twenty minutes then I'm outta here. Well I guess someone got through his head about how the tuna sword works because he was using something else, but he was still not generating any spell based agro and the monk was tanking half the time. Thing that really pissed me off was we got an ornate chain leg drop and he won it with a 400 roll then left the group too. I should just run when I first saw him coming that time lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I haven't booted anyone from a group in a long time but then again it's a long time since I've really done any significant amount of pick up groups either. I have a couple cases where people have gone afk for extended periods and we've dropped them till they got back but nothing significant.<br />
<br />
Going back quite a while back I did have one incident in Karnors castle where the group kicked out a member. We where trying to the basement for VP key parts as I recall. We weren't finding any tanks in Guild to come out so we tried grabbing a random tank who was lfg. Keep in mind that at this point the group is 4 people from my guild and 1 random tank. We are trying to get down into the basement and it isn't going to well. The tank really isn't doing a very good job at anything. We try to give him some sugguestions but he doesn't want to have any of that. Starts blaiming some of the people in the group and insulting them. So the cleric who's the group leader ends up calling him the weakest link and disbanding him from the group. Was rather funny at the time. We then picked up a guild tank who had logged in and camped the basement for several hours with out any problems so I guess he really was the weakest link.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>cahyre kitty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Thinking of a few fairly recent ones...<br />
<br />
I met my current duo partner warrior in a group where two rangers both thought they should pull 3-5 mobs each, again and again and again. My now-friend disbanded and sent us all /tel except those two offering us a new group which we took... the two rangers got a bit miffed.<br />
<br />
Had another group where a necro consistently looted ever mob within 20 seconds of it hitting the floor, while calling the only other person who got any loot a &quot;loot whore&quot; and asking for all the pages, runes, etc. As group leader I gave her 1 warning polite in /tel, 1 warning sternly in /tel, and a third warning sternly in group say, after some mouthing back the next time she ninja'd she found herself without a group.<br />
<br />
Then there was the cleric who bossed everyone around, made sarcastic comments about the tank being sub-60 (he did a great job btw), invited her friends to fill spots without discussion (my group, not hers) and went afk for several long stretches of 5-15 minutes to make phone calls...<br />
<br />
What is with some people??? I take disbanding someone very seriously as I'm an officer of my guild... but there are definitely times when it's needed to preserve your own reputation, your sanity and your toons life.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I have only had to kick someone out of the group once in all my years playing a shaman.  I was in a group in the courtyard in PoD when the servers went down.  When they eventually came back up I logged on to find that i was the only person in my group online.  As the others came back on I invited them in turn.  However we were missing a tank so we put out a ooc looking for one.  I got a tell from a 57 warrior, however he didnt know the way.  No problem, I sent our cleric to show him the way to where we were at.  Not good enough, he wanted someone to invis him.  ( I had managed to get to the camp uninvised and with a full spawn).  I then gated back to invis them both and then returned to the camp.  About halfway there, invis drops for them and a rat aggroes.  Instead of fighting it out the warrior takes off leaving the cleric to die and starts complaining about how shoddy my invis is.  Cleric /q out and doesnt return.  I gate back again to personally escort the warrior.  We make it to the camp and warrior asks how hard the mobs hit for.  When we tell him, he starts panicking and pulls out a shield, yup you heard right, because he thinks he doesnt have the AC to tank the mobs.  <br />
<br />
We manage to find another cleric who, like the warrior, did not know the way there so I had to gate yet again to invis and show him the way.  As I am returning, the warrior starts bitching that he doesnt have any shaman buffs.  That did it for me and i sent a tell to a couple of other group mates that im disbanding this bozo as soon as I get back.  The monk I was with totally agreed with me on my call and started looking for a replacement tank.  <br />
<br />
/ignore whiny warrior<br />
/disband whiny warrior<br />
<br />
As soon as i did that he starts oocing to the zone never to group with 'insert group monk's name' and threatens to petition and report our arses.  Apparently he thought that the monk was the leader of our group and after a few minutes of this childish behavior I sent him a tell stating that it wasnt him that disbanded you, but me.  And of course I also told him why.<br />
<br />
But the story doesnt end there.  A couple of weeks later I got invited into a PoN group.  When I realized that the warrior in the group was the same one I booted out two weeks prior I sent a tell to the group leader stating that I cant stay, and told him about my past experience with the warrior. <br />
<br />
Luckily I havent seen that warrior since.</div></div><hr />

For the longest time, we didn't get virtue, despite requests for it.  Eventually I ask for virt, aego, anything, even heroic bond.  I thought maybe she didn't have virt yet.  So she casts aego on me.  Then casts virtue on the monk (who's my guildmate).  She's speaking in broken, half-sensical English the entire time.  I can't even comprehend what she's saying half the time, and have no idea whether she can understand us.  She's also very late on heals quite frequently, and always OOM.  Hooray for tnarg's.<br />
<br />
I finally get fed up with her, and tell the group leader to make me group leader if he won't kick her.  I get made group leader.  Then I said a really long thing in /groupsay like this:  <br />

(Kronouss was the monk guildmate in my group ;) )<br />

After that, I kicked her.  She hung around for a few minutes, not understanding why she was out of the group and waiting for a reinvite.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is a cleric who was too funny to kick from the group!<br />
http://filebox.vt.edu/users/troisen/eq/petpet1.JPG<br />
One of my guildmates (in the group) got suspicious as to whether or not she was a mangina though!  I cannot fathom why!<br />
http://filebox.vt.edu/users/troisen/eq/petpet2.JPG<br />
She never answered, and she was very quiet after that (didn't leave the group though  :p )<br />

I once kicked a warrior out of a guild I was an officer in because he asked for buffs as we were porting up to hate, after we'd been standing around the platform buffing and such for about a half hour.  It was really a straw that breaks the camel's back thing.  He was a big dumbass who didn't know crap about the game, and never learned anything in the month or two he was in the guild.  He got really mad at me.  He also somehow thought that I wasn't really an officer, and then was telling one of the other officers that I had removed him as a joke and to reinvite him.  Then he threatened me, and kept insulting me for like 2 hours.  It was so funny, I was tempted to remove people more often, just for more laughs.   :D<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I hardly ever do non-guild groups anymore though, so I haven't had to kick anyone in a long time.  I did a pickup group the other day for ****s and giggles though.  We were in tactics, SW pit hall.  Anywho, the monk (who sucks and can't pull one at a time hardly ever from the pit) decides we're gonna fight ogres to get gems for earrings.  He pulls the ones by the pigpen, then back towards overseer room.  I'm bind sighted on him just to see how badly he messes up easy pulls.  I see him look into the overseer room, and feel a tingle of joy.  But he turns and pulls another hall ogre.  Then he goes back....he looks at The Diaku Overseer.  GIVES HIS INC MESSAGE FOR THE OVERSEER!  <br />
<br />
But then he stops, &quot;it's a red con, think we can take it?&quot;  I knew it would rape us...but I wanted a good belly laugh, so I keep my mouth shut.  Someone else says, &quot;Sure, let's give it a try.&quot;  So the monk flings a shuriken at it.  I start laughing.  But he makes it out of the room...and down the hall.  I laugh even harder.  He runs past the group that just moved into the room in front of the pigpen pulling pigs and boarbeasts.  Overseer is still on him.  He gets back to our hall.  I back up to the pit (luckily, there are no mobs near to the hall).  Warrior engages, ranger starts shooting, and monk starts hitting.  The bard, a friend of mine, moved over by me, then for some reason ran back in range.  The warrior, monk and bard get AE ramped and eaten alive, then the overseer runs over to the ranger and stomps him.  Luckily for the cleric (a friend and guildmate of the monk!), he's a very crapass cleric, so he didn't even throw a quick heal before they all died, and he survived sitting in the corner.<br />
<br />
But the fun's not over yet!  The overseer meanders back down the halls to his room.  But what's this!  The pigpen group has pulled an ogre!  I watch the overseer add and kill them all.  I laugh uproarously because a RL friend and his guild comprised that group.  I drag their corpses to the hall and have my dumbass cleric click them in, and then continue to laugh for many many minutes.  I still crack up when I think about it.   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>kittyshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I was kicked out of a group once for going ld 1 time.  It made me mad.  I have a cable modem and go link dead about 1 time per month.  I got replaced before I could even get back into the game.  It was a low 20s alt monk.  I was doing more damage than anyone else in the group and was even soloing mobs when we pulled multiple.  I was boggled by it.  To get even, I started soloing mobs right beside them.  They stole the first few from me, but they had to dump all of their mana to do it.  I got to kill for a while while they just sat there.  My monk is majorly twinked, so he has huge dps.  I would fd when I pulled aggro in the group.  They where doing oocs to the zone telling me to stop ksing, but they deserved it because they replaced me after 1 ld.<br />
Next came their ultimate move.  They moved the group over a little bit, then they had a rogue pull everything he could and they tried to train me.  You can't train a monk!

as for booting, i was in an adv a while back with a friend i met. he's an Ogre Warrior, and he pulls really well imho. but anyway, the Cleric (prolly 3rd highest lvl in grp at the time) was being real bossy and fussing at my bud for chainpulling. i wasn't GL, but my friend was. also i was Ml, so i asked friend to make me leader before i split, adn i'd boot Cleric and not give him his share. after thinking about it, he DID do VERY WELL at keeping everyone alive, so he earned his share. just won't grp with him again  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Rosedesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Well, I haven't kicked many people out of groups, but lately I find my hubby and I disbanding groups that are a collection of stupid people.  We normally either dou or grab a pickup group during the week cuz our play times are random.  The group we ended up in last night had to be a meeting of the stupid people.  To start there is a 51 mage (gl), 48 pally, 50 ench, 51 war (hubby) and me (52 shaman).  There were no clerics lfg, but a 47 druid was running around in the zone lfg.  I said grab him, at least it will be a little help healing.  The mage says no.  Ummm... ok.  Then he says there is a 58 necro coming.  ummm.. ok again, isn't that a little high?  Mage says no.  (ends up being the mages guildmate)  So we go to the captian's room in PoJ.  Pally says he won't pull, so the warrior does and the enchanter is asked to mez the adds.  1st pull goes well, 4 mobs and captian spawns, ench mezes and slows.  Second pull, 4 mobs, enchanter doesn't mez or slow, hmmm should have been a clue.  So I'm rooting, slowing, and healing.  After fight, why no mez?  Ench doesn't answer.  Next pull 5 mobs and captian again.  No mez, pally and warrior asking for haste, none to be found from ench.  Warrior dies, after 2 mobs die, cause I just can't keep up with heals (spell on cast so fast)  no LoH by pally, pally goes down. :(  The nerco and mage pets finish off the last one.  Why no mez? why no DS from mage?  Neither answer.  Hmmm... Ok. Ask pally why no LoH on warrior, he disbands. Ench suddenly has to log.  Hubby's mad cause he died by stupid people so he logs.  I tell the mage and necro, I'm out.  (and this whole time, never a word said from the necro or a spell cast) I gate before I disband.  When I make it to my bind piont I see a message in group from the necro talking to the mage, &quot;**** it's just us now.  Why don't these people know how to work as a group?&quot;  Ummm...  ok sure.  I think that is going to be my last pickup group in PoJ.  2 bad ones in a row.  My &quot;do not group with list&quot; is growing longer by the day.  It's so sad that people do see that they are the ones that don't know how to work in a group.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Bazrok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Original EQ -- We had a consistent group of 4-5 -- Monk, Druid, Druid, War, Ranger -- we'd add a bard or chanter or another melee when we needed.  We were doing bat caves in SolB.  One of the druids was amazing, he'd charm bats, first person I ever saw root parking, tossing heals when needed, dotting and nuking as he saw fit.  We were generally able to pull anything we wanted (we used to sit in Window room and pull everything up to the SolA zone, and as much as we could in the other direction).  It was kind of unwritten law that the uber druid was the only one that could call for an evac or to run -- so it worked for us.<br />
<br />
At any rate -- we picked up a bard in the bat room, and after I pulled kinda nasty, druid evacs us (some of us run to zone) and after we are all in LS, he says, &quot;meet at druid rings to rebuff/regroup and go&quot;.  Bard runs into the batcave and asks why we aren't there.  We get back in and he asks her, &quot;hey, if we evac or split, we rebuff and move back in together, we've done this alot - it works.&quot;  Next bad pull by yours truly -- we evac, rebuff/regroup and bard is already in the batcave, wanting to know why we aren't there.  Almost instantly group chat looks like this...<br />
<br />
Monk - Bye Bard<br />
Druid - Byebye bard..<br />
War - See ya bard<br />
Ranger -- Whoops...<br />
Druid -- I thought we discussed this (bard has been kicked from the group)<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
Another time, in SolB -- there was a cleric I used to group with, he still wore some bronze in the Mid 40s -- but one of the best damn clerics of the day -- tried to group with him when i could.  Put together a group with a horrid cleric.  We are getting spotty buffing, spotty healing, and we have like 5 avoidable deaths in 45 minutes and people are getting bitter.  I see the good cleric log on and /t &quot;rare hall, please?&quot;  He says he is coming, and I tell the group sorry cleric #1, our LD cleric finally returned and he is getting his spot back, we will keep you on the list if we get an opening and kick her before the group can say anything.  Some people protest and I just ask them to give this cleric 10 minutes before they leave in protest.  They were all sold after 5 minutes of being buffed and healed. <br />
--------------<br />
In KC group of 3 monks, enchanter, druid -- we wanted to do LR -- /ooc any cleric LFG?  Only one was a 59 cleric (we were all 52-55) but we decide it's better than nothing.  Ok, let's go to LR.  59 cleric says, NO, we aren't going past the moat.  Um, dood, moat sucks.  Cleric says (to the best of my recollection) &quot;I am higher level than all of you and I have 174 days played, I know better than you.  We cannot go past the moat.&quot; /disband cleric.  /ooc cleric/shaman/druid needed for LR.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Honestly, I mean no offense to the clerics and enchanters who have posted to this thread,  but I have enjoyed kicking clerics and enchanters out of my groups the most of any other class.<br />
<br />
There is just something satisfying about a person who is so full of himself and his importance to a group being booted out so hard s/he makes a skidmark, and then having the group do admirably without them.  &quot;Essential classes&quot; my furry butt.<br />
<br />
This isn't to say I've only kicked clerics or enchanters - They also suffer the most from OTHER players who do a horrible job.  Enchanters especially, since mez is such a powerful tool for a group.  <br />
<br />
And lootwhores span across all classes, and get the firm furry boot with gusto when identified.<br />
<br />
Lets see....<br />
<br />
Gnomes.  They're short, they're ugly.  Basically, theres no redeeming qualities to them at all.  They are too tough to make a good jerky out of.  <br />
<br />
And on a more serious note, i have to think HARD about joining a group with anyone who has a retarded name.  &quot;Nohealsforyou&quot; for example, I swear i remember seeing clerics with that name.  That just bodes well from the beginning.<br />

I have never had a situation where a cleric used roleplay as an excuse not to heal someone.  Okay, i'm on fironia vie, the roleplaying server.  but if you aren't willing to heal ANYONE, then dont group with someone of that race.  Dont join the group and not heal them.  I love how that was handled - three cheers. :)<br />
<br />
I'm not &quot;big&quot; on dwarves, either, but at least they are generally serious and work well.  Halflings, too, are consistant.  Goofy, but always goofy.  I just have to re-state that you can't trust gnomes.  I keep a pair of gnome-skin sleeves (i think that is the exact name of them, too) that I show around whenever there is a gnome being too nosy.  &quot;Hey, maybe someone you knew, yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
I dont now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Gert Groinwounder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Had to boot a wizard one time from a group I had in Seb.  All he wanted to do was melee because he had this nifty new 2 hander and informed us that he didn't &quot;like to snare&quot; and we could just &quot;lump it if we didn't like it&quot;.  After we died the 2nd time to runners (he didn't &quot;like&quot; keeping evac memmed either...) it was ByeBye wizzy...<br />
<br />
Was in a LDoN adventure the other day with a Paladin that wouldn't heal, kept stealing agro from the MT warrior then running around, and kept rooting the adds on the casters in a lame attempt to do CC.  After getting me and our wizard killed twice, I asked him to stop rooting the adds and let me CC (which I had been TRYING to do all along...).  His response, &quot;I have to.  If I didn't root them I'd have to tank them...&quot;<br />

Huh???<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Pjrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Yes, and it was a shaman to boot.  I was playing my paladin and had a great group in HHK fighting the gobbies in the basement until our cleric left.  There was a shaman who was LFG and we decided to replace the cleric with the shammy.  I asked the shammy if he didnt mind taking over the role of main healer and was told np.  We're in the WR and the gobbies begin to re-pop so we go ahead and start fighting them.  As the MT in the group, I was fighting and stunning and kept noticing the shaman was grabbing agro from me with his DD spell.  We kill the gobbie and explain to the shaman that if hes going to nuke, wait until I can get agro.<br />
<br />
With that out of the way, we begin fighting another and Im having a hard time keeping agro from a pretty uber ranger who was kicking out some major DPS.  I keep expecting to see that shammy casting heal but all I see are DoTs and nukes from him.  I end up wiping my measly pally mana on quick heals for that ranger and again, tell the shammy that hes main healer and needs to watch the party's health.  &quot;Sure no problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Next fight, we fight again and midway thru the fite I see a nuke and dot again from that shammy.  Ranger gets agro, Im OOM and cant stun to get agro or heal and dies.  I look behind me and see that shaman poking at the mob instead of sitting on his ass medding for heals.  Somehow, we manage to kill that one but have another pop right on top of us.  Shammy pops up and dots it and then begins to melee it.  We try to fite it but have no hps and have to zone.  Shammy dies and in tells (yes Im pissed off) I asked him why he wasnt healing and the reply I get:<br />
<br />
&quot;Im out of mana&quot;<br />
<br />
No sh*t Sherlock....yer wasting it on nukes.<br />
<br />
He was booted out of the group immediately and then wonders why he was removed.</div></div><hr />

Ohhhh ... yes. The Boot. Booted an idiot once who didn't have enough respect for my puppy. It takes just a moment to sit down, mem the puppy spellset, pull the puppy, and buff him. I had just finished buffing the group and informed them I was gonna pull the puppy up. Got an &quot;ok cool&quot; from 4 group members. The fifth said &quot;that's dumb. haste plz.&quot; I informed him I'd haste him as soon as the puppy was up and ready and I had the mana for a pull. He responded with &quot;d00d, haste plz.&quot; I ignored it, as I am not in the habit of repeating myself. Pulled the puppy, buffed him a bit, gave him some toys to play with and a treat for being so good, and pulled one of my combat spellsets up. As the spellset was halfway through being memmed, he appears around the corner with two mobs chasing him. No problem. Get up, peel one off him with Turgur's, set the puppy on it, slow the one he's on ... I no more got to my feet then he said &quot;d00d are you hasting or what&quot; ... I shrugged, and figured he could stand there and get beaten by an unslowed mob for a couple more seconds. Hasted him, slowed the mob, and turned around to help puppy out. He finished his mob and disappeared. Puppy's mob was down to 15 or 20%, it wasn't far, and all of a sudden &quot;RUN RUN d00ds RUUUN&quot; appears on my screen. The cleric and beastlord in my guild snickered and turned around to see what he was bringing. (The beastlord and I have a standing rule ... 6 mobs or less, bring it on.) No fewer than 15 mobs came around the corner following this guy (I took a screenshot and counted later). Obviously, we wiped. This happened twice more, in nearly exactly the same manner. Maybe I'm too patient ... the third time I went to pull the puppy up, he informed me puppy was useless and &quot;why you wasting blue bar to have him here. just haste me plz and keep me buffed.&quot; ... um ... /boot monk_01.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I've never kicked anyone from a group, but there's been more than a few times where I've been so disgusted I sat down, mem'ed gate, dropped the group, cast gate, and camped out without a word.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I've never personally kicked anyone from a group but I've been in an LDoN group that was in progress that booted someone and I supported the action.  We had this SK that wasn't the designated puller and kept moving into positions to cause pulls, looted even though we'd designated a ML, and rolled on an item for an alt even though everyone else wanted NBG for a drop that was a potential CAWU for people in the group.  The guy was also annoying and obnoxious.  Things were really chaotic - then the GL booted him and things immediately started going perfectly smooth.  The only thing positive I can say about the guy that got booted is that he only saw the conflict as a difference in grouping/playing styles and he zoned out without starting a flame war in chat, which all things considered was decent of him.</div></div><hr />

Hasteing and whiny melees is probably why most of us use buff timers.</div></div><hr />

I drag their corpses to the hall and have my dumbass cleric click them in, and then continue to laugh for many many minutes.  I still crack up when I think about it.   :D<br />

Was that me?  I can't remember if I remember that or just remember hearing about it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">one boot so far.  I am a level 35 shammy at the time in a DSP group.  Level 28 shammy shouts out for a group.  We have an extra slot and all, but we already have a cleric, and my mana (with occasional nukes and dots on top of a full buff regimine, slows and hastes) has yet to fall beneath 70...  Yeah I'm twinked.  This, and at level 28 he doesn't have his upgraded dot spell, his slows are too weak to take main slow duty and he doesn't have haste yet.  So we pass.<br />
<br />
Then shammy shows up at our camp and proceeds to spam &quot;invite me&quot; about every 10 seconds.  Not &quot;you guys have room&quot;, not &quot;would you like a 28 shammy&quot; just &quot;invite me&quot;.  Our cleric is a general all around sweetheart, and hates confrentations, so she decided to invite the shammy... can't hurt right?<br />
<br />
first pull, ranja grabs 4.  No problem.  I have been root parking pulls of 6 and more with this group just fine.  Oh, and look, the younger shammy wants to root park too... awsome.  <br />
Wait... uh... you sure it's a good idea to park that mob back at camp?  I mean our cleric is sitting there...<br />
<br />
no problem, clerics already standing (cause getting beat shot her to her feet real fast), she's just gotta move a bit.<br />
root breaks, mob runs for shammy, shammy runs by wizard and roots.<br />
<br />
/tell dumb_ass_shamman_01 hey, try rooting away from camp man.<br />
<br />
no response.<br />
<br />
next pull, only got two... perfect pull.  Shammy starts nuking... chain nuking... after pulling agro.<br />
<br />
/tell retarded_dumb_ass_shamman_01 hey man, try to watch your agro a bit.  maybe save some mana for the next mob.<br />
<br />
no response.<br />
<br />
Two more pulls later with wonder shaman chain nuking all the way through (and cleric getting rather perterb at the need to continually heal the stupid bugger) and all the sudden shammy sits.<br />
<br />
ahhh, he's getting it, he's just gonna drop a dot or two...<br />
wait, 2 pulls gone and shammy hasn't gotten up.<br />
<br />
/tell stupid_retarded_dumb_ass_shamman_01 hey bro, you afk?<br />
<br />
I finally got a reply on this one!  he says: nope, just medding.<br />
<br />
I look at his hp bar, blink<br />
/tell idiodic_stupid_retarded_dumb_ass_shamman_01 well why don't you canni a bit?<br />
<br />
canni?<br />
yeah, cannibalism?  the spell that converts hps to mana?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Tetrass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">It depends what character I happen to be playing, but I've booted people from groups with every toon I have.  <br />
<br />
I'll admit outright though that I'm a lot bigger bastard about things when I play my necro.  I also tend to be a little more cutthroat about things when I'm on my cleric (and starting to get that way now as a shaman.  Basically, solo ability and group desireability temper my judgement.  When I'm on my ranger I rarely do anything other than just leave a group when I don't like someone.<br />
<br />
I've also done the &quot;I'm leaving&quot; and then send the other group members a /tell a few times, but most of the time I'm actually very straightforward.  When it boils down to one person being the problem, I tell them straight up in /gsay to either get their act together or I will ask them to leave.  If that doesn't happen I tell them I am going to boot them now and why.<br />
<br />
Oddly enough, most of the time they just leave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Graknuk Brudder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">My wife plays with me almost all the time and she is almost always group leader sadly.  I say sadly because she is a softy, and hates confrontations.  So when we end up with a idiot in the group I tell her the 3 rule applies.  3 rule is easy: 3 problems with Idiot-01 and he gets booted.  She doesn't like doing it but she has learned better that then gettin killed by Idiot-01.  I inform Idiot-01 that he is doing something wrong and ask him to correct it.  Thats a chance he gets 3 if he fails 3 Times he gets booted and told why and what he did wrong which times.  Now adays I tend tu be group leader and I play harder with the 1 chance rule. Ya got 1 chance tu fix what ever ya doing wrong then BOOT if not fixed.  Maybe a bit harsh but when playing i don't want the aggrivation, if i did i would just go to work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I will boot anyone without hesitation if they a) piss me off or b) don't do their job.<br />
<br />
Those however are not the only reasons I boot people. I also boot ridiculously stupid people like people who beg for groups in PoValor when they are below level 59. ATTENTION NEWBS: THE LEVEL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LEVEL 58 AND LEVEL 62-63 MOBS GIVES YOU A MASSIVE EXP PENALTY. YOU NOT ONLY SLOW DOWN YOUR GROUP BUT EARN EXP AT A ****TY RATE.<br />
