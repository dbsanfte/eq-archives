<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Rathjar Maruuka is no longer my own. I canceled my account last night and I am expecting one of my friends or guildmates to take up billing. EQ was a great game for me, but after my first break, my breaks from the game are becomming more and more common and I no longer want to play for more then 1 weekend a month. This does not justify the cash I pay out :-). I'm moving on to try my hand at World Building for NWN and maybe even playing some shadowbane. I'm very burned out on MMRPG's and I want to do something with a good story that I can get sucked into. More importantly, a game I can take a break from and come back to not be left in the dust (aka flags).<br />
<br />
Anyways I'm not here to complain. Nothing in the game has made me quit. Its just boring for me now. But hey, I got 4 years out of the damn thing. So if you see Rathjar in game, just know he's not me. I might read the forums still and post answers for questions I know, but its not me in game :-)<br />
<br />
Good Luck Everyone,<br />
