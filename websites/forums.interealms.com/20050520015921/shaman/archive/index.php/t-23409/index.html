<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Alright, this is a pretty stupid idea that just popped into my head the other night, but what if instead of having pre-set mobs either mitigate a certain amount or just be immune to slow altogether, what if it were just completely random? In other words, every mob in the game would have a chance to mitigate/be immune.  Of course the lower level mobs would have a much smaller chance, but then the % chance could get higher as the mob's level and difficulty do.  Might add a little extra spice to the game.  I dunno, just a thought.  *Readies for the flames*</div></div><hr />

Theres already enough mitigation.  I dont need to get mitigated when Im on an easy Nro adventure.</div></div><hr />
