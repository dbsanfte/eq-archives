Woot! ~Hehe finally can give bloodstained tunic away :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I hope you have better luck gettin RE legs than i had.<br />
During  Kunark, it took me 50 PoH raids before a whatever name (Spite?) golem dropped those for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nowadays PoH is so not worth going to except for epic pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bah, best plane in the game still. I love that place. <br />
<br />
Christ, you can get gravfluxed into harmtouch instadeath, tell me that isn't cool!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tenien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">3 hate raids, 3 pairs of RE legs, nada else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Got my RE legs at 59.  Within the next two weeks I got Thurg and then SS.  It was like a pants bonanza.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nah, PoH still has value.  Hate bottom floor drops are outclassed and need an upgrade, but the zone is still good for learning raid skills.  Most of the basic raid ideas used for bigger and better things today came out of early PoH/PoF explorations.<br />
<br />
After months in Hate and one meeeelion Spite Golems later, I am still missing bits of RE :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I love doing 1 group PoH runs.  The break in is loads of fun, but take a good group.  :)<br />
<br />
Pretty darn good exp!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Went to hate 20 times before Veilous, got Legs and 1 Bracer.<br />
<br />
Went to Velious, got full Wolf Caller's, and other nice items.<br />
<br />
Went to hate to kill Innoruuk once with guild, got the BP, boots, gloves, and helmet... on a single raid.<br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ugh, rune etched...I've had all but the bp and legs for ages.  I've finally gotten better things for those two slots (artificer's) so you can bet they'll be dropping next time I'm in Hate. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Braxton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hate is still good for farming blue diamonds =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Been to hate 3 times only have boots.  Seen the bp drop though... dropped on the same run as the boots and after the boots so imagine my discontent when it went to the next shaman cause I already got something hehe :)  Also seen a bracer and arms drop... that is for all 3 trips.  (we cleared 1st floor and most of 2nd on our trips)<br />
<br />
But I think it is a fun zone... definately my favorite of the old world planes and i like it better than growth too...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">PoH is my favorite plane.  It has built in anti-moron code :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">yeah I like Hate.<br />
<br />
we take one group or 8 people or whoever is on and go up and farm them BDs and make some money from all the nice cash drops.  And kill more forsaken revenants.  I think our poor enchanter has spent 200 hours in Hate and hasn't got his epic yet.  But he did get the Engineers Ring from Ninny, so it is some consolation.<br />
<br />
Hate=fun.<br />
Fear=suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Borkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">huh..   2 PoH raids = Full set of Armor for me...<br />
<br />
Don't see what your guy's problem is  =P<br />
<br />
<br />
Should have chosen a tail  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Raghnar Spiritweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I got RE legs the day i got lvl46, my first raid with my shaman.<br />
Also got  the boots, gloves and a bracer that day.<br />
<br />
I used to hate PoH because i was always there with my wizard but going there as shaman changed that for me :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I went to PoH twice.  Once we walked in and killed inny.  Once with a different guild we were screwing around and RE BP dropped.  I put it on to take a picture and has been buried in my bank ever since.<br />
<br />
Personally, I like PoF, only b/c I get to take deathtouches.<br />
