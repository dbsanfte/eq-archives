<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cragas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone :)<br />
<br />
My name is Cragas and I'm an alco....wait wrong speech.  As you can see in my sig, it took me awhile to find the true fun and excitement and power of the shaman class  :p <br />
<br />
I started the game in February 2000 as a magician (53 now).  I've played most of the other classes to varying success, and finally seemed to find what I want in my shaman Cragas.  Originally he was just my goof off soloer while waiting for my regular crew to log on.  Now I find Cragas to be the one getting play time everyday.  <br />
<br />
So now, my regular crew of warrior, cleric, enchanter, necro (all 61) has become shaman, shadowknight, ranger, druid (all 51).  And it's a blast  :D <br />
<br />
Been reading the site for a few months now, doing the lurker thing.  Finally decided to register and post a hello.  Over those few months, I have found some great info from these forums.  I have also found out who the trolls are, who the shaman haters are, the pessimists, and those who genuinely love being shaman :) I like to think of myself as the last, but give me some time, I am sure I can become as jaded and pissed off as the rest of ya ;)<br />
<br />
Just wanting to say hey I guess :)<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: and of course I forgot to ask the question I wanted to /sigh nice way to start things off LOL<br />
<br />
My question is...at what level would it be best to work on some AA?  I have grabbed regen 1 while waiting for my groupmates to catch me at 51, but 52 and Regrowth looks mighty tasty.  But...another 2 points of regen real soon looks nice too.  The two tanks in my regular crew would like to get run 1 and 2 soon so they don't get mobbed when we dungeon it up, so it would be a good time for me to work on my AA too.  I think I will get regen 2 then level to 52, then maybe work on regen 3 (as my 53 spells don't look all that appetizing to me).</div></div><hr />

Just seems to be the way that everyone else does it:)</div></div><hr />
