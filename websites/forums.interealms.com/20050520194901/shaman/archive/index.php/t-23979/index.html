<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I didn't post this in quests because it's kind of a rant.<br />
<br />
Does anyone else find it ridiculous that they put an epic drop on a duo/soloable MoB with a 3-day respawn? I understand that SSN fits into the story well, but this kind of bottleneck is unnecessary. <br />
<br />
Could they perhaps make a spawnable, tougher version of him that drops only the Shaman epic quest item? Or at least change his timer to 24 hours +/- 6 hours? I know of 7 other Shaman on Mith Marr currently stuck on this step, all competing with one another--and others--for a 3 day spawn on a MoB that requires little more than a tank and Shaman.<br />
<br />
I've been /feedbacking this every day. (Well, /bug anyway ... no options under Feedback tool for quest design problems.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Apparently its a 6 hour spawn since last patch...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Are you sure? I spent 5 hours there the other night PLing a friend and no SSN pop. Another Shaman spent 6 hours there from server up and nothing, either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beawolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, I've been spending a ton of time in the zone because someone said he had respawned on their server.  I have yet to catch him up with over 8 hour logged in the zone at least 5 of those in 1 stretch.  I'm thinking the server(s) that got a couple spawns of him maybe crashed between kills, even if they only dropped for a second.  The other night he got killed on my server, and then at one point I got dropped to char select as well as everyone else and there was a roll back, he was up when i checked him after that.  I'm guessing something similar happened on these other servers or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, after the patch Saturday, everyone should check on him after the servers are back up, and maybe check and see if they've adjusted his respawn to relieve this bottleneck.<br />

I got my ring tonight, so I'm glad I'm not stuck in that bottleneck anymore.  :cool:</div></div><hr />

Spiritseeker Nadox's corpse says 'I shall rise again, do not doubt!' 80 min later he respawned when an untargettable NPC, Prophet Grulgask, came ambling up the hallway to his altar and performed a brief ritual.<br />
<br />
So I don't understand why it's taking longer for you guys, whether it's random or just buggy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was me on serverwide saw him respawn, 12 hours not 6, after he had died... however, since he died the second time he aint been up again. I parked my druid there to try and get some more precise info on his spawn. Since druid is parked there and just sittin there, and ain't been kicked from zone, it wasn't a server/zone reset the first time. Maybe a fluke though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">SHaman epic 1.0 was relatively easy because the mobs required were only down if someone killed them.  But what about mages and wizards, whose epic mobs (VS, phinny, the pony in SK) were generally 3 or 4 day spawns (or just rare as hell)?  /shrug.  It doesnt seem unfair to me.  Just one of those things.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Does not spawn on server up. <br />
<br />
That is false to an extent I think. I camped in Nadox before this last patch and the minute the servers came up I logged in to see him standing there. Killed him and finished up my epic that night. So I'm guessing he is random on server up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It's random on server up.<br />
It took about 5+ hours for him to pop after the 2nd last patch.<br />
There was another shaman there camping him when I logged in my bard about 1 - 2 hours after the patch to check the camp.<br />
He left some time later, and when I logged in, he was there standing for me.<br />
Tank + shaman = easy kill<br />
No idea on the respawn time though :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Numagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">-553, -535 is the loc of his room. It has six mobs in it and a big burning pot. I have been there for 36 hours after he was last killed. I have heard rumours that he spawns between 10hours and 3 days but all of my camping is leading me to believe it is 3 days. This mob really sucks because it basically cockblocks other shamen from getting their epics.</div></div><hr />

/shrug.  Everyone has differing levels of 'timesink-tolerance'.  Have you bothered to try the old VP key ?  or the VT key?  or any of a thousand different faction-related quests... Those are much worse.<br />
<br />
And I think the epic is pretty nice, if odd looking.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Xtraez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Info on Nadox. Saturday morning there was a patch at 3AM PST, or 6AM EST &lt;- (my time zone), anyway the patch said all servers will be coming down for 3 hours. I got on EQ saturday morning at 10AM EST and there was some people in the zone. One was a druid so I sent a tell and asked was Spiritseeker Nadox up, she said no. I logged then and went out to get some stuff done. I got back on EQ around 12PM EST and no one was in the zone. I invised to altar room and kept it clear for about a hour. As I was waiting on repops to happen I noticed this roamer coming from the right side of the archway as your facing the spawn point of Spiritseeker Nadox. <br />
<br />
The whole time I was there no roamers what so ever had come into the room. I tried to target the roamer, who was a troll looking model but could not target at all. Next thing I know the troll got almost to the spot were Spiritseeker Nadox spawns and turned into Spiritseeker Nadox right before my eyes. I called for some guildies to come help and he went down at 1PM EST on Saturday on the Torv server. Also I did not do this step in order as the quest is laid out. Only step I did in order was the mob in UP. So from what I can tell he spawned 4 hours from the servers coming back up, well at least he did for me. /waves to Shakibulito.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Wow.  Have we seriously gotten this soft?<br />
<br />
<br />
Does no one remember way back to the Kunark era?  When the, now called, Epic 1.0 quests were put in, THOSE were serious time sinks.  Some still are to this day.<br />
<br />
For example, back in the day, clerics had to camp Ragefire down in SolB.  I have a RL friend who sat and waited online for over 48 hours waiting for the spawn.  The spawn was on some crazy 5 days +/- a random amount of 1-72 hours spawn cycle.  And you did have to sit there waiting for the spawn....because there were other people who would sit there if you didn't... and you'd simply never get it.  Hell, most of the time multiple people would be sitting there trying to outlast each other.<br />
<br />
Enchanters have no less than 5 mobs for thier 1.0 quest on similar time tables.  My first character was an enchanter, and I can tell you that it was maddening...  waiting for 5 days +/- 1-72 hours and then having someone else's raid force still beat you there.<br />
<br />
I had a friend who was a ranger.  He counted over 30 trips to old Plane of Hate and still had no Emerald of Corruption.<br />
<br />
People used to work on epics for 6 months to a year to get the whole thing complete.  And now some are complaining that 1.5 might take you (gasp) multiple days???  It was less than two weeks to complete even when people didn't have a nice little checklist to go thru and not even read quest text.<br />
<br />
Even with 1.5, shaman have one of the easiest quests.  I've been helping some guildies with steps.  Wizards have 2-3 mobs which all require raids forces.  Enchanters have at least two.  Shaman can do 95% of the quest solo or with a single group of elemental+ people.<br />
<br />
Some people won't be happy until it's &quot;(Ding) Welcome to level 70.  You have recieved your epic weapon.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Shakibulito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Bah so u killed it saturday? though was friday lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Snapdragon - yes, I know what pains in the butt those quests are.  I am working on the VT quest (for some reason, the guild leader wants to go there) and am almost finished with the VP quest (I finally gave up on the AJ spawn, a friends is going to MQ it for me &lt;sigh&gt;).  For the VP quest, I've camped AJ for over 200 hours and still not gotten a kill, been KS'ed around 5 times and have just missed him like around 10 times.<br />
<br />
I do have my epic 1.0, I spent probably a year working on it (was in a small guild at the time).  And I have helped many a cleric with their epic (I think I helped around 10 clerics get theirs before I even started mine and probably another 10 after that).<br />
<br />
And FYI, yes, I've been playing since 1999, I know timesinks.<br />
<br />
The results are less dramatic than any other players epic this time around (like ours was a gamebreaker in it's hayday, but at least it wasn't the duck stick, but of course, we have the cat stick now).  The clicky doesn't stack with our new OoW HoT (I've been told, I don't have that one yet) or our new OoW focus line.  The focus effect is stupid.  Druids would be better off with that effect than us.  How many shamans do you know that die out there due to HEALING agro?  I know I've never done that and I heal a lot.  Maybe if it was reduce detrimental hate, I would understand it more.<br />
<br />
For comparision:<br />
Cleric Epic 1.5 - Harmony of Soul (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=9955) - focus effect is healing agro reduction, appropriate for this class.  I have real issues with the click on this item and the overall stats.  This item is gamebreaker (SORRY, NO CLASS HATE HERE, I LIKE CLERICS AND DO NOT WANT TO REPLACE THEM) in essence (notice the 360 second reuse as opposed to ALL other epics being 600 seconds?).  The divine arbitration from this effect is nice, but reuse is overpowered compared to the other classes.  And most of all, there is no excuse why no one elses epic can be a secondary or range item if theirs is.  There is no argument for this.<br />
Paladin Epic 1.5 - Redemption (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=64031) - focus effect is increased healing, didn't know they were broke in healing.<br />
Wizard Epic 1.5 - Staff of Prismatic Power (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=12665) - focus effect is spell agro reduction (single target), appropriate for this class.<br />
Shadowknight Epic 1.5 - Innoruuk's Voice (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=50003) - focus effect is increased lifetap, appropriate for this class.<br />
Magician Epic 1.5 - Staff of Elemental Essence (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=19092) - focus effect is spell damage agro reduction (single target spells), appropriate for this class.<br />
Necromancer Epic 1.5 - Soulwhisper (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=62581) - focus effect is spell damage agro reduction (single target spells), this reduces all single damage spell agro, maybe even a bit too much for this class (NO CLASS HATE HERE, JUST OPINION COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE EPICS AND SPELL LINEUP).<br />
Warrior Epic 1.5 - Champion's Sword of Eternal Power (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=60321) - focus effect is discipline (not sure which, think it's the taunt line) reuse timer reduction, appropriate for this class.<br />
Enchanter Epic 1.5 - Oculus of Persuasion (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=52952) - focus effect is mesmerize agro reduction, appropriate for this class.<br />
Berserker Epic 1.5 - Raging Taelosian Alloy Axe (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=18398) - focus effect is Cleaving Anger discipline reuse timer reduction, appropriate for this class.<br />
Monk Epic 1.5 - Fistwraps of Celestial Discipline (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=61025) - focus effect is Innerflame discipline reuse timer reduction, appropriate for this class.<br />
Bard Epic 1.5 - Prismatic Dragon Blade (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=18398) - focus effect is increase accuracy and increased damage over time critical chance, not overpowering that I can see and bard solo'ing experience has been nerfed many times over, seems appropriate for this class.<br />
Beastlord Epic 1.5 - Savage Lord's Totem (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=52911) - focus effect is increase cold damage, not a huge increase in beastlord damage, and is rather underpowered compared to the rest (minus shaman) focuses.<br />
<br />
Notice a difference between all the other epics and ours, healing agro has very very very very very (get the point) rarely killed a shaman.  Why is our focus effect not damage over time hate reduction (ie Bards and Necromancers) or slow agro reduction?  Answer that one.<br />
<br />
With a huge time between spawns on that mob and my raiding schedule, I do not feel the epic is really worth it at the moment, time or effectwise.  I would like it and think it's pretty dang good, if the spell stacking was just resolved.  Just another example of a lazy SoE spell designer.<br />
<br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
I do not mean to slight anyone here that has or is doing their epic 1.5/2.0.  The items has great stats and is a memorable accomplishment.  Congratulations to all.  My hat is off to you for working this.  But, like I said, maybe when this wouldn't be such a timesink for me (biggest thing being the shear numbers of people trying to get it), I would do it.</div></div><hr />

Just wanted to comment on this...this is something that is bugging me.<br />

1:  Decrease Spell/Bash Hate by 4% <br />
2:  Limit: Max Level(70) <br />
3:  Limit: Effect(Hitpoints allowed) <br />
4:  Limit: Target(Single allowed) <br />
<br />
And Whisper of Tvish (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6260):<br />
<br />
Slot Description <br />

3:  Limit: Effect(Hitpoints allowed) <br />
4:  Limit: Target(Single allowed) <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Nowhere do I see the indication that the Shaman epic is limited to HEALING spells.  Whisper of Tvish is the Magician Epic focus, for comparison.  Necro focus and Wizard focus are identical as well.</div></div><hr />

Not calling you out, there have been many people who have posted the same thing (&quot;only works on healing spells&quot;)...you were just the first person to post the other focus effects so I could compare them.  I looked and couldn't tell a difference, so I asked. :)<br />

<br />
Makes me wonder, could he possibly have a patch independant spawn timer, but spawns on server up, and this doesn't change his timer?<br />

In essence he would keep his 3 day cycle, but there would be a free spawn of him just after servers come back up, i don't know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">This Nadox spawn needs to be reworked.  I'm glad some other shamans have had luck in getting the ring, but after I've spent hours and hours waiting for a spawn, it's getting old.  Shamans aren't gonna tell you anything when they killed it last (unless it was a fellow guild shaman).  The competition is too strenuous with this particular spawn.<br />
<br />
Three days is complete bs.  After helping with numerous other class epic steps, so far, all of them are either random drop from killing x-amount of mobs, turn-in/spawn mob, hourly or daily spawned mobs.<br />
<br />
I can't spend 24 hours a day sitting on my ass waiting for Nadox to spawn and hope I can get someone to come immediately once it does before some other group comes.  It needs to changed to spawn at least a couple times a day, or have it triggered by killing random mobs.<br />
<br />
To someone who mentioned the old VP keys were worse to get... it was easy for me.  It is nothing compared to this bs bottleneck Nadox is.  At its current rate, I'll never see myself finishing my epic.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Alright, get this:<br />
<br />
I camped my shaman in Nadox so I could check on the spawn, and when I did, there was usually a line of shamans, so I'd camp.<br />
<br />
Well tonight I log in, and in the background I load up my monk's window so I can bring him to Nadox.  I'm sitting there waiting and notice an afk 70 rogue sitting in Nadox's room, and he's been like that for hours.  So I think &quot;well that's not technicalyl camping, sitting a rogue afk for days on end&quot; so I had plans to just camp the spot and clear the mobs for a few hours.<br />
<br />
Prophet Grulgaskn goes walking right past my safe little corner where I was chillin.<br />
<br />
!!!!<br />
<br />
So I IMMEDIATELY call my guild in to help me, when I see the AFK rogue stir...  I /&quot;ooc Spiritseeker Nadox is claimed for shaman epic&quot;<br />
<br />
All of a sudden, a level 70 shaman appears outta nowhere, and she and the rogue start clearing the room.  I'm pretty mad by now because I saw the damn Prophet walking by before he even spawned Nadox, and I have claimed it.  but knowing I had people still on the way, the dude just moves on without me, and I know I can't do a thing about it.<br />
<br />
So I'm cussing and grumblin but not interfering at all, since they had the forces before I did.<br />
<br />
They engage Nadox and in the meanwhile me and my monk are just sitting there, buffed watching the fight.  At 45%, the shaman and rogue die (they were time-geared.... and the shaman had a TA)<br />
<br />
!!!!<br />
<br />
So I immediately jump in, summon my pets, use my monk's discs -- I'm just goin full force on Nadox hoping to get it.<br />
<br />
An add agro'd at 30% and made things a little difficult, but not too bad.<br />
<br />
Then at 10% Nadox got in a really good round and knocked my monk nearly dead... so I immediately FD and Nadox makes a bee-line for my shaman, but not before I landed a crit heal nearly CH'ing my monk.<br />
<br />
Nadox smokes out my shaman at 10%, and it's just my monk and Nadox... monk is at 50% health and Nadox at 10%...<br />
<br />
Got him down to ZERO percent and went through a string of misses...  then he finishes my monk (Nadox had no visible health), and meanwhile the shaman who showed up before me had reappeared, apparently bound close by, and was just in time to land a nuke to finish off Nadox and get the loot.<br />
<br />
 :mad:  :mad:  :mad:  :mad: <br />
<br />
I was seething.<br />
<br />
********************************<br />
Nadox spawned today mid-day (not sure of the time) but a guild somehow let him despawn...  so it spawned today.  It spawned again at 8:00 PM EST.  So I hardly think it's a 3-day spawn...  the rogue had told me afterwards &quot;I've been here for 3 days and it hasn't spawned in 72-hours&quot; but that's a lie...  he may have been there a few days, but Nadox DID spawn multiple times during this time, from talking to other shamans.  The rogue simply missed them previously because he was perma-afk/invis'd.    :mad: <br />
<br />
From what I've read, people are insisting it's a very long spawn, but I think none of it is true... I truely think it's a random spawn that can be an hour or a week.  There have been people say that they got him an hour after he last went down, and others have &quot;waited&quot; for &quot;72 hours.&quot;  Well I've &quot;waited&quot; 72 hours too, but I've logged off multiple times, slept for 24 of them, and worked for 24 more...  so take it for what it's worth.<br />
<br />
Btw, when Nadox spawned, not a single mob was taken down.  It was a full spawn in his room.  There were a few other lower-level groups in the zone xp'ing, but nothing I could tell that would trigger a spawn.<br />
<br />
He just upped and spawned randomly.</div></div><hr />

No, I'm saying I think, based off my experience and what I've read on the forums, that there is no rhyme or reason to the spawn, and it's completely random.  Contrary to what a lot of people have been saying.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">afaik, Nadox isn't being hunted by anyone else (ie he doesn't drop uber loot, and he isn't needed for any other quest).<br />
<br />
So we are only competeing against ourselves.  Theoretically, that means eventually (a few months maybe?) it won't be contested anymore.<br />
<br />
But I remember the ragefire rotations, and that was only used for 1 quest as well.  Bleh.  I don't know how I feel.  (For the record, I'm still on part one of the epic (sharks) ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I sent a feedback regarding the spawn rate.  I've spent hours for almost a week now, and still haven't seen this spawn.  That's unacceptable.  Like I've said before, while I've helped so many other epic steps for other classes NONE are like what we're facing.  ALL are turn-in/spawn or set spawn rate which are mostly an hour or two.  <br />
<br />
I find no challenge in sitting around for hours and checking his room numerous times each day only to see it empty.  Make Nadox harder for all I care requiring more people.  That at least is a challenge.  I just want it to be able to be spawned frequent like other class epic steps.</div></div><hr />

Some folks may get the spawn before 72 hours, but yesterday afternoon 3 different shaman confirmed a 70+ hour camp. I did post about this issue on the Guild Summit forums, asking if the long camp was intentional or a bugged spawn. If it's intentional, I want to know now so I can quit messing around with this quest.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Fawlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Killed Nadox yesterday at around 8pm CST on Morden Rasp... at 11:30pm CST he was up again. <br />
After I keeled him there were 23 in zone xping, 2 groups of which were clearing in and around his room, including the nautilis area and stuff in between. I only had my tracker in zone and was exp'ing in WoS when I saw him pop on track. I wasn't paying much attention since I had already gotten the ring. Did however send a tell to a shaman that was forced to watch me kill Nadox before and she went and got her ring.<br />
Looks to me like some kind of PH since he hadn't been up on MR for 3 days prior. So the 3 day thing is still right. I had been there watching on the previous kill 3 days earlier, so knew when he would be up again. Got there just in time too.<br />
I am thinking some kind of PH, maybe a random one with certain precursors like Mino Hero, but with a 3 day reset time if no one kills ph, but it's all just a guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Two mintues after I sent my feedback, he spawned... So I got the ring now, but still stand by my feedback.  Nobody should have to face such randomness.</div></div><hr />

Poguk,<br />
<br />
I am the “other Shaman” that you so eloquently decided to flame about on this forum.  In my defense I am providing a rebuttal to your previous posts about this particular SSN spawn.<br />
<br />
Facts:<br />
<br />
1)	I had been watching SSN spawn for better part of 3 days<br />
2)	The “70 Rogue” was in fact level 66<br />
3)	While I was at work I left the rogue there so that she was logged on when I got home to observe immediately if SSN was up or not<br />
<br />
When I got home from work I discovered 2 shaman waiting for SSN, one of which was Poguk.  I proceeded to play me shaman as my twink rogue observed the room.  Ever now and then I would peer over to see if SSN had spawned.  About an hour or so later both you and the other shaman vacated the area.  At that point I am thinking great I have the camp back.  About 20 minutes before SSN spawned you were back at the zone in.  If you had been watching my rogue you would have noticed her moving around.  I did this on purpose so you could see that in fact I was watching the spawn and wasn’t afk.<br />
<br />
I had previously bound my shaman at the zone in (outside of Nadox) so I could immediately respond to SSN Spawn.  I was watching the rogue when I saw the Prophet walking up the hall.  At this point I gated my shaman during a mid raid battle.  I entered the Nadox to see your OOC “Calling SSN”.  I responded with “um no”. After I zoned the train I had collected (I hate shaman invis) I told you “OK if you can pull him now he’s yours if not /shrug”.  I proceeded to clear.  About this time your monk arrived.  I pulled SSN.  Rogue died at about 40% and I gated the Shaman.  I came back in zone to find you killing SSN.  This is not an issue.  I was not in the least bit miffed that you jumped on him.  If I remembered correctly I even told you “If I fail he’s yours” to which you returned “your in Time gear your not going to lose”.  Well I can say I was pretty surprised at his DPS and it took me off guard.  When I zoned I decided 2 things:  1) I wasn’t going to help.  2) I wasn’t going to interfere.  If you had won I would have offered to rez your shaman so you could loot the ring.  You however unfortunately died at 0% on SSN.  I returned to dot once and kill SSN.  I feel for your disgust, but I do think I was completely in my rights.  Additionally, I don’t believe you could have taken him from 100% when you failed from 40% pre-slowed.  <br />
<br />
I hope my previous actions account for something.  If you remember, my group is the one that killed “your” spawned sharks in CS and told you to loot the item there knowing we had an hour wait to do our sharks.<br />
<br />
I am not a Kser and get pissed at people that do.  If you had not left then cam back I would have respected the camp and offered assistance.<br />
<br />
I hope that Sony decide to change SSN spawn rate spending all day Sat Sunday going to bed at Midnight, waking up at 3am and again at 6am and then coming home for my luch break just to check on a spawn is ridiculous.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Wanadcea, <br />
<br />
I never called you a KSer.  You did what anyone else woulda done and I did what I did, but we didn't break the rules.  I never said you didn't break the rules.  I realized you had the force there first and I did not interfere until you died, which is perfectly okay, you even said I could jump in if you died.  I was just frustrated by the whole thing, and wouldn't you be too if you were in my shoes?  I was the first person to see Nadox (the Prophet walking by), I called it, and I got him to 0%, and lost it.  All of it was perfectly legal, but doesn't mean I can't bitch about.  ;)<br />
<br />
So just to clear it up, I never called you anything, I was merely recounting a frustrating experience of mine in which I was da loser.  So I messed up the level of your rogue, hardly has an effect on the story.<br />
<br />
That said, you probly didn't read the part that I wrote about Nadox spawning yesterday while you were afk... the one you killed last night was the 2nd spawn of Nadox in 8 hours, so therefore, on Xegony, Nadox was NOT a 72-hour spawn.. it was more like 8 hours.<br />
<br />
At the point you said &quot;um, no&quot;, my guild was already en route for a few mins.  I guarantee I saw the Prophet first because of where you were standing.  I saw him walk by, immediately called in my guild, and waited... that's when I saw you stir then your shaman showed up and so to be safe I called it.  But y0ou got the forces there before me, so I conceded, albeit grudgingly, and who would blame me.<br />
<br />
I thanked you for helping me on the CS fight when it happened, and now you can say I've &quot;helped you&quot; get an even tougher piece, since I took down Nadox 45% for you.<br />
<br />
I never said you were a bad person, and honestly why you had to post here with your name I don't know... I knew your name and never mentioned it.<br />
<br />
You are correct, I could *not* have taken down Nadox by myself, that's why I had people incoming, and was in fact waiting on them when you arrived... had I not told them to turn back (becuse I was so sure you'd get it), it wouldn't have been an issue.<br />
<br />
It's just a frustrating experience for me, and that's it.  It's nothing personal to you... just one example of what this spawn is doing to make shaman turn on themselves.  :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
     I had wondered that myself since the first time I went to check SSN I took a group with me and he wasn't up. <br />
     We were roaming around and got to the event area, we didnt know what we were getting ourselves into but it wasn't any trouble. 3 waves of somewhere around 15-20 mobs each popped during the event, and a named at the end. <br />
     SSN popped within 12 hours of the event, I dunno if it was related because I didn't stay in zone, or how long SSN might have been up but when I checked 12 hours later he was. I missed that spawn, and it was 3 days after before I saw him again /shrug</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">is our correspondant doing anything about this issue?<br />
the prob with that quote is, that we don't have a correspondant atm  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">I think internet (and playground) law is that Kanelan is now our new correspondent (sorta like &quot;he who smell't it dealt it&quot;).<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;not it!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Welp, I got Nadox last night.  I logged in at 4:45 and looked down and there was Nadox's corpse.  A shaman was standing proudly over his corpse, and I gratzed him, then groaned... knowing I wouldn't get him for awhile.<br />
<br />
Decided to just camp it anyway, and 4 hours later, Nadox popped.<br />
<br />
Evidently the servers came down in the morning, and the previous shaman camped from server up 'til he spawned.<br />
<br />
So again... wasn't a 72-hour spawn...  I'm very relieved to have this piece though. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>kanelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">well, considering the line at nadox atm (including the monk who is camping it for guildmates) grows from 2-5 at any time on Quellious, I can only imagine it getting worse and worse.<br />
<br />
Last night in the crucible channel, someone noted that there were 12 in line on a server, yikes!<br />
<br />
Ps- i'd gladly be a correspondant, but where's my red phone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">I killed the trigger for that ring event right after you logged into the dead SSN Poguk.  Gonna have to play with that encounter a bit more. :)<br />
<br />
Grats on your Nadox bit btw!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">That ring event in the temple area has always been there...  I've never been able to complete it because it eventually spawned a whole lotta mobs that was too much for me to handle... but who knows maybe it does have a link to Nadox spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">is our correspondant doing anything about this issue?<br />
<br />
I have access to the Guild Summit forums which are read by SOE employees (they post). I posted the issue yesterday, so far they haven't responded but I will keep you up to date. I also reminded them that our 67 pet is still kerflunkey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>redribbit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">Good Luck Gloriana....<br />
<br />
I would also like an actual Loc of Nadox. I may be in the incorrect spot, just want to be sure. <br />
<br />
Since peeps have to hang around there so long I figure a (loc) would be great :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>kanelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">dunno about the loc, but it's in the &quot;altar room&quot; if you have the maps downloaded....<br />
<br />
<br />
he spawns on/near the fire</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>redribbit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">Thanks Kan<br />
I kind of figured he was there but... you never know LOL. <br />
<br />
Hopefully we will get some form of resolve for this :)  quite frustrating IMO. SOE expects us to figure out their programers minds with this stuff. If I wanted to read a mind I would work on my wife's first! :D</div></div><hr />

Enchanter site calls it a 12 hour spawn...  I'd like to believe this, buuuut</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Sorry, even 12 hours is not acceptable!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">I figured out the strat for SSN.  Just get 100 or so of your closest friends and have them zone in to Nadox.  Spam spells, etc, until zone crashes.  When it comes back up kill SSN, rinse, repeat for all the shammies.  Takes some time but a lot easier than camping 70 or 80 hours.  :-)</div></div><hr />

It should be noted that Tugela totally called it on Post 24 (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showpost.php?postid=294879&amp;postcount=24)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>kanelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">well, i know i'm to that phase of the quest and i zoned in and waited... and waited... and waited...  nothing.<br />
<br />
i've done everything but the swarmfiend, is the swarmfiend considered before or after this?  Via the quest text, it's after I think, but maybe maybe....  also, i know a lvl 70 shm came in and we were there for 2 hours and nothing...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">Can you confirm that you've done everything? All dialogue, all hand ins? Did you wait over 2 hours (possibility it was triggered before you zoned in).<br />
<br />
My guildmate Vany is also camping this, I know she's farther along than me (did the sky turn in) and she's been there for days. I can't log in to confirm that she has turned in the blessed thingies in Freeport or talked to the spirit that sends you to Nadox.<br />
<br />
I'm still crossing my fingers it's not bugged!</div></div><hr />
