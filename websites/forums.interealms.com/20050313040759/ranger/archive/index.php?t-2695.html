<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galaron</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me start out by saying that EQ is an amazing game.  I have encountered some really great people while playing this game and have enjoyed playing it over the past 3 years, as a 'casual' player.  I created my character, Galaron, a ranger on the Quellious server, and have played only that character.  I have been able tolerate some of the general problems with EQ (as perceived by me):<br />
·	Little to no story line and a lack of purpose.  This is compounded by a poor quest system.<br />
·	Dungeon/area design that eliminates usage (and creates crowding in other areas).<br />
·	The occasional technical difficulty.<br />
·	The trade skills.  LOL, spending hours on end doing the same thing over and over.  Wouldn’t be an issue if some of the things I desired in the game didn’t require trade skills.<br />
<br />
and the inherent problems in an MMORG:<br />
·	Great deal of 'down time'.<br />
·	Competition for limited resources (camping, competition for mobs, etc.).  Especially in an environment where the population ages with no in-game mortality (top heavy).<br />
·	Encounters with people of poor character.<br />
<br />
These things, I have been able to deal with.  I'm afraid I cannot tolerate the post 50 game though.  Here is what I am noticing.  There appears to be little for a solo ranger to do, that interests me.  The things that do interest me require a group or groups.  I have been spending ridiculous amounts of time looking for groups.  In the past, finding a group was not nearly this difficult.  And even if I failed to find a group, I could move on to do some sort of interesting solo activity.  The necessity to participate in raids to visit places and acquire items of interest is particularly distasteful.  The time requirements are well beyond my ability to commit to as a casual player.<br />
<br />
Just wondering if others feel the same as I do in this regard.  It will be very interesting to see what comes of NWN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neetero</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quite true.  You should most likely to join a guild to help reduce time LFG.  Sometimes a partner is all that is needed to adventure further...you don't always need a full group.<br />
<br />
Game is top heavy?  No doubt about it, however Verant is attempting to address this by revamping zones and adding new ones.  However, the higher level zones need to have appropriate drop tables for the experience.  The new Cazic Thule is a perfect example of poor drop tables...took two groups of 50s to camp zone in and no drops possible.  After a while we just left and never went back.  You do Hole, Chardok, ME or Seb entrance, at least you might get something.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llegolas</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a guildless ranger trying to find pickup groups, I found the game pretty lame between the levels of 51 and 54.  Nearly quit because of it.  After I hit 55 though, things really started to pick up.  Much easier to find groups in some of my favorite zones, and if I turn LFG on for a few minutes there's a pretty good chance I'll get a tell for a raid or pickup group in Chardok, which is always nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yzen Danek</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess my question to you would be: what have you done about it? An analogy: I like to play tennis. To have a good game of tennis, I really need someone to play with, as hitting against the backboard gets old pretty quickly. If I were to head down to the public courts everyday just hoping there would be someone there to play with, I think I'd get pretty discouraged with how rarely I found a game. Instead, I call up friends and set up a game beforehand.<br />
<br />
If your play time is limited, you need to make it count. Guilds are certainly great for that, but if your time is really limited, you might have a tough time getting set up with a good guild. In any case, you really need to seek out like-minded individuals on your server, and arrange to hook up with them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have done fine finding a game at the tennis court for the past 3 years.  However, the parks department changes the rules for people who have improved their game to a certain level.  I don't expect I will be adapting to those new rules, so I will probably hang up my racquet and find a new sport.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spjamir</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree it was tough between 51-54. But once you hit 55 or so it seems to get better.. I think I lived in KArnors from 51-54 becuase it was the only place to get in a pick up group easily.. Now it seems Velks is the same way for me..  Although I would rather hunt in HS then any of them..</div></div><hr />

***? CT is great xp, great loot and easy to get too. Its a poster child for high level zones. I got a Tox Axe in a single group in 2 hours. My friend's group ws at the sewers and got 2 pairs of FT3 boots. Sweet earring drop there, fleshgrinders, etc. All the loot is tradable too. <br />
<br />
Umm on second thought, CT sucks, don't go there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeneran Orcreaver</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just depends on what you want out of it.  True enough, the low 50s are almost like starting all over again.  There are lots of places to solo if you are after exp(seafuries, rockhoppers, EW animals, EJ animals, anything in DL) plus I never had too much trouble getting groups in KC at that lvl, and I would think Solb could be an option.  I've always spent time LFG in EQ, even when guilded and with regular hunting partners, just arent always available.  Two things that got me through it, one is DO NOT think its your class that keeps you from groups(more than likely its the number of people in the zone or even number of rangers) and two, getting Lvl 55(spells, disc, atk, title, etc. just an awesome level).  Good luck and stick with it.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neetero</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kilcano - my guess is your group was 60s or close to it and uber gear.  A regular mid 50s group in regular gear has problems getting past the entrance, much less anywhere close to where the decent drops are.  Unlike Seb, Chardok, ME, Hole, etc......<br />
<br />
Poor design.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loga</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 11:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is alot you can solo post 50 with the right gear.<br />
<br />
I've been playing my wizard some lately and he seems to be at the level where no one really wants them.  I spend alot of time lfg.  I don't find soloing to be practical at this level but I don't find it impossible either.<br />
<br />
I've made all my chars legitimately and levelled them properly--meaning I gave them some initial gear but I levelled them in the traditional manner from level 1.  I had 3 at 50 before the first expansion.  My cleric was created 2nd to last just before my beastlord.<br />
<br />
I find it really hard to find groups with my caster classes.  I can see why.  There's really not enough mana to produce long term results and I feel like an anchor to the group.  Doesn't mean I don't contribute but I do not contribute like my other classes do.  Unfortuantely wizards just don't have the mana regen necessary to keep up.  Even in groups the only way it is possible is to have clarity and that isn't always possible.<br />
<br />
I'm only saying this to show you that I recognize what it means to have to search and waste time finding groups.  I could use my cleric's influence and only group when my cleric gets us the group but I almost never do  that.<br />
<br />
So, I understand your problems and agree with them.</div></div><hr />

There are so many MMORPG's coming out, I can't help but wonder which (if any) will be the EQ killer for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Strongboww's corpse</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">at 55 I have just gotten in a grove in Velks. I log on, roll up to US and /tell the group leader there for the list.<br />
Then I stroll over to UD, do the same thing there and then back to zoneline, camp in one of my alts and send US/UD a tell with alt info - enjoy messing around until a slot opens and then i'm right back there. Normally takes between 30 minutes to my record wait of 8 hours to get into either, but then again i'm slowing down a bit at 55. I tend to work for 3-5 blues per night.<br />
<br />
If my time is short I just do a camp check and get on every list in zone vs. doing the /ooc level 55 ranger LFG thing.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm just lucky in that I rarely have an issue with LFG very much anymore.<br />
<br />
Guild/Alliance exp groups are good too. We normally always have 2-3 of them almost every night with level ranges from 51-60.</div></div><hr />

Poor design. <br />
<br />
You're confusing 'poor design' with 'too high for me.'<br />
<br />
You start with the assumption that CT was revamped to give all the mid 50s players relief from Seb, Chardok, ME, the Hole, etc, while it's much more likely that CT was revamped to give all the level 60 players single-grouping options outside of those places. Folks who are level 60 have largely already spent a lot of time in those places, and are overpowered for them now, such that crowding in someplace like Seb becomes even more of an issue, when one 60s group with good gear and lots of axp can keep an entire wing clear by themselves.<br />
<br />
Place a list here of zones that provide the same challenge and proportional rewards for a single group of 60s that Sebilis, Chardok, and Karnors did for a group of 51's at the discovery of Kunark.<br />
<br />
Zones in Everquest:<br />
Cazic Thule<br />
<br />
There is 1 zone matching those filters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirul</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm, I just dinged 49, and was thinking that the game would start changing for me.  A lot of what is said sounds discouraging.  Currently I am guildless and would probably be considered a &quot;casual&quot; player.<br />
<br />
There is nothing like logging on and the first thing you read on your screen is: /ooc 48 Ranger LFG<br />
                           /ooc 46 Ranger LFG<br />
                           /ooc 46 Twinked Ranger LFG PST<br />
                         /shout 47 Ranger LFG<br />
<br />
Either there is a glut of Rangers out there, or getting pick-up groups is difficult.  Again, I thought that post-50 was going to be better.  I guess I had better look for a guild just to group, but even that is not a guarantee for a group.<br />
<br />
*sigh*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Epiphany EQ</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 09:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well it is a massive-multiplayer game.  It's designed around the 6-man group.  They were kind enough to build in a few &quot;soloing&quot; classes, but ranger isn't really one of them.  I don't think the answer lies in making more to do for a solo player.  Perhaps the answer really lies in making it much easier to LFG.  If you could find a group every night within 5 minutes (like you do if you are a cleric), this wouldn't be such a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yzen Danek</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 10:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem, Epiphany, is that no such feature can exist. In order to be able to quickly put together groups, you need 1) a favorable balance in the number of classes represented online to fill required roles and 2) fast transportation between zones so that you can get people where they are needed. The second might be technically possible, but is undesirable if there is to be any sense of majesty or size to the world of Norrath. The first will never be possible. Even without people requiring the perfect group, there just aren't a balanced number of healers, melee, crowd control and nukers on at any given moment. No matter what the system is, the remainder will be lfg.<br />
<br />
What's really ironic is that even people who are hard up for groups are reluctant to join a sub-optimal or unconventional group; they'd rather sit lfg at the zone than group 3 rangers, 2 mages and a necro.<br />
<br />
Regarding rangers not being a very good solo class, I'd have to utterly disagree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">austforbeer</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 10:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really feel your pain man.  I'm a casual player myself.  I get to play maybe every other night for a few hours if that, and there's nothing more discouraging then spending those few hours lfg.<br />
<br />
I also work evenings when most guilds are doing their main stuff so I miss out on that as well.<br />
<br />
However, I am hoping that what I hear here will turn out to be true post 54, because it really is a pain for me now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lanandrin</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 06:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It took my group of 55 to 56 level members everything we had to camp the stupid zone in.  Ranger, monk, warrior, Chanter, cleric and shaman.  We just didnt' do enough damage to go any further and live.  We got wiped while trying to go to some of the other camps.  I've nevber been back.  I would like to go though but its just not worth the effort.</div></div><hr />
