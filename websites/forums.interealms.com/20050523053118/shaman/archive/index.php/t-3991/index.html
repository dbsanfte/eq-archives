<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Banana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After several levels  ( 29 to 56 ) I have finally completed the epic! It really does feel epic now. <br />
<br />
           Last Night I logged on, my guild was all bored and asked if I wanted to do Rak, I had done Neh earlier and figured it would be a few days before we headed to CoM again. So we hauled butt to CoM picked up a few clerics and mages that weren't in the guild. <br />
<br />
           We finally get to the bridge, warrior starts pulling the reavers, we get 1 and after it died ghiosk spawns. They go back start clearing a little more because the building had already started repoping. Warrior says oh well and pulls all 3. Now im sort of worried because I wanted to be able to position the Rak one so that it would be pushed into the wall not the water. Anyway, at this point the warrior ( 60 ) is tanking one, the monk (59) is tanking one, and the rogue (54) is tanking one. One dies, phantom spawns. Next is killed, phantom spawns. Ok now we know witch one is Rak's, I have them put him being pushed into the corner and after 9 repops we have Lord Rak'Ashiir.<br />
<br />
            We buff up, load the pets with every type of buff imaginable. Everyone sits on the steps, just in LOS to heal. Hand in works correctly, I back up get hit with quite a few nukes. Infact the AE didn't go off for about a minute or so. The mages just /pet atk Rak and they go at it. Well something went wrong because out of the 3 pets, 1 is left standing and I'm getting worried that it will drop as quickly as the others. So my buddy Behemoth (the warrior) runs in and starts tanking Rak, he is equiped with primals / ntov and warlords so I wasn't really worried. Anyways after about a five minute battle, I run and loot the scales. Everyone is getting ready / medding. They tell me to run outside and get epic and come back so click my sow boots and all of a sudden the server comes down. Not announced just drops all of us. Now right as I was going LD im looking for a Kuud saved. I see one right after I looted the scales. <br />
<br />
            Quellious is down for about thirty minutes. I log back on and check all my bags, it's there. I run to spirit sentinel, hand in scales to sentinel, and now I am epicifed. /bow<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The little &quot;(your name) has been saved&quot; msg is not really valid.<br />
<br />
VI stated a long time ago that is mearly cosmetic and does not mean that your character was actually saved. It goes off like every 15 min or something like that. The servers can't handle saving 70,000 characters every 15 min on que.<br />
<br />
I am glad it worked out and it was still in your packs. To make absolutly sure that you get a save you have to camp out and come back or zone. Always do that if you get something you want to make absolutly sure stays saved with your char :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">gratz on epic <br />
<br />
as for the fire pets dieing <br />
<br />
i think with the new pet changes the lvl 56 fire pet (tank version -non wizzy) is no longer 100 % fire proof  ... seems odd to me .. but it just something a mage friend of mine has been bitching about</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There was a post on the mage boards, although I have not verified this...<br />
<br />
Apparently they said that the Water pets are the ones that are fire immune now, not the fire pets.<br />
<br />
VI also changed the Earth pets to be MR immune.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Congrats Kuud!<br />
<br />
Now I just have to ask why are you a banana? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Banana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Its the jb armor my friend =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Batuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Kuud,<br />
<br />
I first met you in EC a long time ago.  I should have suspected something way back then.  However, I was in one of those mentor moods and we got to know each other.  Heck, I think I even gave you a Howling Harpoon that day.  We talked almost everyday and I gave you suggestions on how to play a shaman and where to level.  You were innocent then.<br />
<br />
Fast foward to now and you have one of the worst reputations on the server.  You have scammed people and somehow you have the unique ability to spam inspect every person as soon as they zone into the Bazaar.  At one point or another, every person in my guild has said &quot;*** is up with this Kuud guy?&quot;  You have strung along a necro guildmate with an imagined copy of group DMF.  You have also done with same thing with a copy of Torpor that you supposively had for sale for 75k.<br />
<br />
You want a congratulations for epic?  The only thing you are is an epic jerk.  Now I understand why you post here.  You don't have a reputation here (yet).  I hope other shaman don't resort to your tactics and screw over fellow shaman to get an epic.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BubbaQuell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Kuud lied and cheated others to get &quot;his&quot; epic weapon.<br />
<br />
The only thing epic about him is that he is an epic loser.<br />
<br />
He is a pariah on Quellious.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">...just to add to what Targar said, you can also force a save by trading....a copper to any pc/npc will force a save if you need it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bodabag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Cool.  Thanks for the info Evel.  Didn't know that.  Time to start making some mobs richer while inny does it's yo-yo bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Kuud I must say you have absolutely no class whatsoever. Reading about how you screwed over many many raids with your low handed tactics and simply moving in invis and taking other people's chance at epic mobs I am completely disgusted. <br />
<br />
Oh and nice try trying to stick up for yourself by making up alts on a message board that post in your favor. Yeah right that's your 'brother' and your 'friend'  ... whatever you are scum and I hope the folks on your server have you blacklisted for life.  <br />
<br />
If you think I'm going to congratulate you, you are looking the wrong place. You should go make your own message board and congratulate yourself there - I'm sure you'll get more favorable responses from yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Banana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks for replying Kuud, although you arent me. But good try. Yes my guild is Deluxe so your 1 for 5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Okay, throttle back, fake Kuud.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">So you finally got your epic.  Normally I would congratulate a shaman from Quellious for doing that but you don't deserve it.  This isn't a flame board so I will be nice and leave it at that.<br />
