<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, dogdog's DPS has been found to be around 35-40 DPS with standard alpha/focus/haste setup.  Not only has it been agreed upon on this board, but I've also parsed it out to be about the same.<br />
<br />
Having recently gotten the SC3 AA, I've been trying to figure out how much DPS &quot;Poguk's pet&quot; does.  Just by eye-balling it, I'm guessing they are around 40-50 DPS as a unit.  I haven't parsed it, and I should have... anyone have any definitive parses?  They do spam more than dogdog does.<br />
<br />
Then we have our spells.  Most shamans claim AoE rains are our best route for DPS, and they are very good for us.  While I agree that rains are a top option for us, I also contend that under the right circumstances... our DoTs also are very competitive.<br />
<br />
A pally in my guild who is excellent at keeping agro is a great person for me to use my DoTs with.  I trio'd with him and his 65 cleric in CoD last night and we were lacking DPS, so I decided to show him what I could do DPS-wise.<br />
<br />
So after he pulls and I Malo/Slow... I unleash the dogs of war (SC3 and send dogdog in).  Then I DoT'd the fizzuck out of it.  BoS, BoN, and EBolt.  The DoTs come up to about 700+/tick if you include the initial DD component.  Well, do the math --- a tick = 6 secs and so 700/6 = 116 DPS.  Not bad!<br />
<br />
So 116 DPS from DoTs....  and let's say 35 DPS from dogdog and 40 DPS from SC3 dogs....  and I feel like I'm being conservative here.... that adds up to 190 DPS.<br />
<br />
The pally kept agro, which was no small feat 'cause that mob acted like he wanted to come over and pummel me the whole time hehe.<br />
<br />
Having fought in CoD a lot, I know the lay of the land and just about how long it takes to take a standard mob down with a full group.  With just the Pally tanking (and it wasn't an undead mob, so no SU3 for the pally) and just me doing the bulk of damage... the mob dropped almost as fast as if a whole group was pummeling it.  Not quite as fast... but it's health was dropping in chunks.  Pally said &quot;Impressive...&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course... this was what I called &quot;shaman burst damage&quot; to him, 'cause I can't do that for very long.  First, SC3 has a 12 min refresh.  Second, those DoTs suck yer mana fast, at least they do for me.  Third...  it *will* piss the mob off, even with a very good agro tank.<br />
<br />
It's something I can only  do when I'm soloing or if I have a very good tank that I can rely on to keep agro.. which is a rarity on Xegony.<br />
<br />
Anyway, this was the first time I was able to do this really.... it was neat showing that shamans can do some heavy damage... if only for a minute or so.  It by no means indicates that we are a DPS class, hehe.  I don't feel like I could sustain that damage for long, nor reliably find a tank that keeps agro well enough to negate the hate-fest I'm casting on the mob.  Plus, the pally spent a lot of his mana keeping agro.  This just wouldn't work over any sort of long-haul xp grind, and I really wouldn't wanna do it on a big raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Actually, the rain combo works out to 3,570 dmg every 17 sec, or 210 dps. So with dog and dogpack you can pack in around 280 - 290 dps on a not very poison resistant mob.  On long fights you might get that to 300 by stuffing a disease dot underneath (since they are more efficient casttime/damage wise), so then you loose the dps of your dogpack after a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, but the problem with the rain calculation is that it's usually resisted 1 or 2 waves out of three....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">With scf3 you get a lot of criticals so, evens it about out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have to aggree with Poguk, even on a debuffed mob.<br />
<br />
As far as SC3 goes, I thought you could treat each one as an unbuffed, unhasted, unalpha'd dog for dps purposes, thus approx 15dps/dog for the duration depending on the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I suppose that is correct, Popu....  so does that come out to 75 DPS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vorkreider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's been tested over at Graffe.com by the wizards that the rain spells have a 22% resist rate reguardless of resist debuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Also you're not using Bane which is 70 dps alone and no BA mod.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Slow/ Cripple / Bane &amp; cast Rains nuke once<br />
<br />
IMHO. If you do this on every mob your job is done. Bane should run out which is perfect. If you have very few Melee then Add a second rains inplace of cripple.<br />
<br />
my 2¢</div></div><hr />
