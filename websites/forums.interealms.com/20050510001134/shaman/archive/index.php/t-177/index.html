<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Saw on EQCasters that they dropped the cast time of pets to 1 sec. Anyone know if this applied to wolfie?<br />
<br />
The current Test Server changes to pets are mostly regarding casting time. I wanted to see what the impact would be if pets were all fast casting, pretty much guaranteeing that a character could summon his pet almost anytime. There are concerns about things like chain-casting pets and the effect it could have on soloability for instance. The changes on Test should allow us to see the worst case.<br />

Currently, i rarely use my dog because of the really bad pathing. Not sure whether that is likely to ever be fixed. A 1 sec cast time won't really help there, although it would be a nice change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">applies for all classes except beastlord.  even your friendly druid can zerg Booboo for your next dragon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ryko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hehe,  1sec cast time would be wicked.  I remember with my level 1 enchanter his pet cast was about that.  I was always able to get multiple pets per fight if I got in over my head. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ShadoWynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Under normal circumstances, I'd say this sounds like something that didn't seem likely to go live, but with the recent surprising changes VI's made to the game, anything's possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Obviously a godsend for mages, whose pets really should be modified to zone with them. Not so big for other pet classes, but anything that makes it not take so damn long to get set up for battle is good.<br />
<br />
Of course I'll have to change the delay in my &quot;Eoin gives birth to a baby druid&quot; macro. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Oogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Even the cleric pet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't get your hopes up... The rule has always been that, when they say pet and that's actuallly an improvement, they mean magicians and necro pets.<br />
<br />
We're pet casters only when it's a nerf coming around the corner or they run out of ideas when defining our class AAs. In every other case, we don't have pets, we have 'companions'<br />
<br />
Not that I wouldn't mind eating my words, for once... that 18 seconds cast / recast on the level 55 pet is just a pointless irritation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Dis would be a gud change....  hope it goes live.<br />
<br />
Day is also looking at making da pets hit better on da 50+ mobs and dat be gud also.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I haven't used my pet in months, and it has nothing to do with cast time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I just want to be able to SEE my pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I also suspect that they increased the recycle time to make up for it, like they did with the cleric Smite line.  i.e. instead of a N-second cast time plus a M-second recycle they changed it to a 1-second cast and an (N+M-1)-second recycle.  Not gonna lend itself to the zerg attack too well.</div></div><hr />
