<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sournan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if anybody had some tips for the ZI for PoH. I can bring a 65 Wizzy for extra DPS and I also have 5k HP buffed.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My wife's cleric can tank the zone in for poh and she doesn't have much more than 4k hp buffed :-)<br />
<br />
Slow the mobs, dot em and then when about 70% down, have the wizzie nuke! :-)<br />
<br />
Spites are MR so use disease slow and have wizzie use  non-magic based nukes or possibly lures.<br />
<br />
Drakes are belly casters (ie. have to be in melee range to land a spell).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dsalcedo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I trio my way around POH quite often.  The zone in stuff is very simple.  Just get em slowed and tank away.  Dogdog and the wizzy will chew through stuff rather quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Percent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Best map of revamp hate I've come across is at http://crysagen.chedrock.com/seofon/Hate_b.gif <br />
I can't find the hosting site link anymore, just the link to the picture itself, so I can't properly give credit to the site itself.  I know it also had a great write-up and summary of the Marsinger Gem quests and what mobs drop what and all that good stuff.  So if anyone knows the actual site, please post or let me know so I can give proper credit to this great map and site for PoHate info.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kiisekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I believe the site you're thinking of Percent is www.guildseofon.com and to find the Hate stuff from there just click on references and scroll down to questing in the new Hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Percent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I believe the site you're thinking of Percent is www.guildseofon.com and to find the Hate stuff from there just click on references and scroll down to questing in the new Hate.<br />
<br />
That's the one and thanks Kiisekai. I felt bad about linking the map but not having the proper website to give.  Glad the proper credit can be given now.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sournan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">thanks all for the info, I will be heading there soon.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>FreyrSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Keep in mind, if you're doing the Marsinger quest, that the tier 1 signet drop is rediculously rare.</div></div><hr />

This link is all you will need for it  :) <br />
<br />

But to share my personal experience I only tried to solo the Gem of Faith, as a friend told me the 2nd signet had a 1/500 chance of dropping, Which true or not, After the Minor Priest Signet, I was bummed.  Though I will say it only took me about 2 hours to get my entire Gem of Faith  :rolleyes: .  Overall I didnt even want to try the next level one, as I was killed twice by those damn Spite Golems (Not the Zone In ones, the harder ones that are a little deeper in but are still tier 1)  I camped the Named &quot;A cleric of hate&quot; it was very easy to hold solo with ONLY my own buffs, I'm sure though you could hold another mini along with him though.  If anyone has info on if the entire Marsinger's Glittering Gem is completely soloable I would appreciate :).</div></div><hr />
