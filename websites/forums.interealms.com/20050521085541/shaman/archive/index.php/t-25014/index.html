<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wanted to kick off a thread here - I noticed that our AA guide in the medicine cabinet pretty much stops end of PoP AA's and I was wondering if those shaman with 100's of AA's could post which AA's they think are useful and worth getting (in which order) for GoD and OoW.<br />
<br />
I won't contribute because I'm just starting to look at these (reason for post) and still have about 30-40 aa's needed to get what I consider the essentials from PoP :)<br />
<br />
Apart from buying Mnemonic Retention for the extra spell slot at 3aa of course :)<br />
<br />
Obviously its going to be subjective but there should be a reasonable consensus on what are the &quot;best&quot; AA's to get first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Omens of War<br />
<br />
Absolute musts imo:<br />
Mnemonic Retention - Extra Spell Gem, no brainer for the amount of spells we have to cast.<br />
Call of the Wild - Life saver for both groups and raids.<br />
Spiritual Channeling - You just can't believe how powerful this is until you have it, its as good as Canni V.  For raiders its just Godly in certain cases.  Being able to chain cast Yoppa's Mending for 5 minutes straight is just unbelieveable.<br />
Ancestral Aid - Instant click, stackable group (mgb'able) HoT.  Can't beat it.  Get at minimum level 1.<br />
Reflexive Mastery - Avoiding damage, no brainer.<br />
<br />
Definate Purchases:<br />
Healing Adept Mastery - Stronger Heals, definately need.<br />
Healing Gift Mastery - Stronger Heals, definately need.<br />
Resplendent Cure - Great for raiders that see stronger AE's, so-so for non-raiders.<br />
<br />
Unknown:<br />
Healing Boon - Unknown the benefit on this, but I got level 1 to have the ability to crit heals. <br />
<br />
Rest just depend on your play style and how much AA you manage to get.<br />
<br />
Gates of Discord:<br />
<br />
Spell Casting Subtlety - Lower agro is better.  I can easily stack more DoTs on a raid mob now without grabbing agro mid fight like I used to.  Anyone that says they won't get it because &quot;they want to be able to grab agro in a group&quot; doesn't know much about agro control imo.  I can snap agro off any cleric/caster even with SCS3.<br />
<br />
Critical Affliction - So so on this, increases DoT agro but also does a good bit of damage more.  One of the later ones I plan on getting, not as good as OoW AA imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GheffGutterbrains</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Omens AA Ability<br />
<br />
Omens reminds me of PoP AAs.. So many, so many directions to head.. That realisticly it depends on your play style...  There are a few great ones that VASTLY improve game enjoyment (think Shm rez when you're in MPG)<br />
<br />
Here's my selection of MUST HAVE:<br />
Call of the Wild (rez)<br />
Spiritual Channeling (post rez fast buffage)<br />
Ancestral Aid (group HoT for those dots)<br />
<br />
The rest are dependent upon play style; ie Healing shaman vs Offtank shaman - Don't get me wrong, you want them all.. just a matter of whats first...<br />
<br />
Chaotic Potential - dependent upon gear; if you cant bust cap dont bother yet<br />
Discordant Defiance - dependent upon gear; if you cant bust cap dont bother yet<br />
<br />
Mystical Attuning (shrug, rarely have an issue holding 10-12 buffs and 3 slots for detriminals/HoTs.. but I do have MA2 to make sure I have that room)<br />
Mnemonic Retention - Personal play style dictates this one - I dont have or need yet<br />
<br />
Healthy Aura<br />
Reflexive Mastery<br />
Defensive Instincts<br />
Expansive Mind<br />
Healing Adept Mastery<br />
Healing Gift Mastery<br />
Healing Boon<br />
Resplendent Cure<br />
<br />
Then there is a section of AAs that I don't care for (mostly cuz I'm not a TS shaman).  I'll end up getting them (well most) as they are convient when I do need em ..<br />
<br />
Eternal Breath<br />
[tradeskill] Mastery<br />
Salvage<br />
Origin<br />
Delay Death<br />
Boon of the Ancients<br />
Destructive Fury<br />
Advanced Pet Discipline<br />
Improved Critical Affliction<br />
Persistant Minion<br />
<br />
God AA Ability<br />
<br />
Spell Casting Subtlety - Utmost important<br />
<br />
Swift Journey - Nice to have<br />
Convalescence - Nice to have<br />
Persistant Casting - Nice to Have<br />
<br />
Quickened Curing - Great to have; especially with GoD/Omens mobs constantly annoying me with debuffs and dots<br />
<br />
Call of the Ancients - Nice to have - Time and time again, I'll hit this for that extra regen <br />
<br />
The rest of GoD AAs are toys and situational based on shaman play style; Crit dots/Nuke crits</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i'm suprised no one has said delay death.<br />
<br />
delay death is a great AA if you enjoy living.<br />
<br />
don't make it your first AA to max but fit in there some where. this AA rocks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">not knocking delay death but i don't have it yet...have you actually seen this come in handy in zones like RS where mobs are quading for 1200+ (dare i say it, but when i die it is usally from a massive overkill of mob melee)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">that's exactly where i saw it work first. after seeing it work on the tank i decided to get it and at lvl 3 in RCoD it saved me. that and the cleric heal which wouldn't have landed had i not had delay death.<br />
<br />
haven't been back to RS since having DD 5 though. willing to try it out though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bartmeista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Can you explain exactly how it works please?  I have a good idea, but haven't seen it in action as of yet.  Might have to buy it if it's truly worth it like you say it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grokii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm planning on getting it so I can canni down below 0 during group downtime and freak out my group.<br />
<br />
/g Oh crap, add.<br />
<br />
/canni5 while low hps<br />
<br />
/purple fun death without the death<br />
<br />
Better to do with guild groups or good friends instead of pickup groups.  Probably not something you want to do in pickup groups unless you like getting black listed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Delay Death is a great AA for a tank. <br />
<br />
Without Delay Death a character dies at HP -11 iirc. From 0 to -10 he's unconscious(might be wrong on the numbers).<br />
<br />
Delay Death adds 50 HPs for each rank of it that you can drop below the -10. <br />
So in theory you wil still be alive at -260, in practice, however, you will still be unconscious as soon as you drop to 0 or below. When you are unconscious, you can't do anything, which for a Shaman is rather crippling. <br />
A tank's job, however, is to tank and being unconscious doesn't affect this ability. That's why it's great for a tank and not so great for a Shaman.<br />
On raids Dealy Death can come in handy, however, if you have people who actually assist heal on your raids, you might stay alive thanks to outside heals when you'd already be dead thanks to the 250 HP buffer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">as i said before, it's great if you enjoy living.<br />
<br />
to add, it only really helps if you get heals. if you have a cleric only capable of healing the MT then delay death does nothing.<br />
<br />
it's a 'get out of jail free' card that never goes away IF your other healers in the group/raid cast heals on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">it's a 'get out of jail free' card that never goes away IF your other healers in the group/raid cast heals on you.<br />
<br />
That sentence is bull****. You are 250 HPs harder to kill, that's it(and it's useless for cases when you are the only healer or you don't have anyone to heal you quickly enough for the mob to finish you).<br />
<br />
I am not sure how that is anything like a &quot;get out of jail free&quot; card as you're putting it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">because instead of waiting for a rez, you are still alive doing what shammies do.<br />
<br />
IF your other healers in the group/raid cast heals on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">because instead of waiting for a rez, you are still alive doing what shammies do.<br />
<br />
Applying that logic every HP upgrade you get is a &quot;get out of jail free&quot; card. I see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">you missed my point. forget it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I actually didn't miss any point. It just isn't a &quot;get out of jail free&quot; card, but anyone who had any questions about the AA was misled by your statement, I am sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">i don't see how. when delay death kicks in and you get healed you live. it's not that complicated. without delay death you would have died. thus the 'get out of jail free' card.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Death delay is the same effect as having another 250 hps. You seem to think that being unconscious is like feigning and you'll loose aggro. In reality it isn't. Your still low health and so always going to have aggro. Death delay is just another 250hps before something kills you while you can't do anything  at all. Nothing more nothing less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">a heal will not help you with 0 HPs. cause you're dead. but with 0 HPs while having delay death a heal will save you. i guess it's more the heal that saves you. but without delay death that heal does nothing. the cleric is healing your corpse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Actually, you're not dead until -12hps or so. At 0 HPs you can still get healed and lived.<br />
<br />
Anything I fight isn't going to show me mercy because I'm under 0 hitpoints. In fact, I'll get low hitpoint aggro and die, even if I'm at 750hps and they hit me for 999, I'll be at -249hps . . . alive due to the AA, but with aggro still because of low hitpoints.<br />
<br />
There are other, more useful AAs, that won't just make me feel all special because I have a buffer. And that's all it is, a buffer, not a Get Out Of Jail Free card. A GOoJF Card is something we can use to drop aggro, not further gain it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>crollub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">so when you are unconcious mobs still kill you?<br />
<br />
I thought they wandered off and found something better to do/kill<br />
<br />
For example.<br />
<br />
1) You have 60hp/tick regen and are soloing. Mob knocks you unconcious on -240hp thinks you are dead so wanders away. 5 ticks later you get up and wander off completely free of aggro.<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
2) You are unconcious at -240 hp so the mob slaps you around some more to make sure its done the job. Being unconcious has no effect on aggro so the mob keeps tearing away at you and next hit you are proper dead<br />
<br />
So which is it 1 or 2 ???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>papiraul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">It's called &quot;unconscious&quot;, not FD  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>crollub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">oh well if it was 1 i would prob want the delay death AA<br />
<br />
seeing as its prob 2, I prob find something better to spend my xp on<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Being a fan of extra abilities instead of improvements to existing ones this would be my list:<br />
<br />
1. Mnemonic Retention - Because the only thing that is better then extra abilities is your choice of an extra ability.<br />
<br />
2. Call of the Wild - This will save you about 984358349 hours of CR eventually.<br />
<br />
3. Spirit Channeling - Because I love being able to keep up my group contribution while regaining mana. Because I love chaincasting heals for ages. Because I love scaring clerics with channeling -&gt; MGB Focus -&gt; canna 5.<br />
<br />
4. Ancestrail Aid 1 - Any group heal is good, any instant cast no mana group heal is better.<br />
<br />
5. Spell Casting Subtlety - Look, a GoD AA skill on the list too!<br />
<br />
6. Mystical Attuning - Raiders only pretty much, but very nice for them.<br />
<br />
In no particular order:<br />
 - Reflexive Mastery<br />
 - Defensive Instincts<br />
 - Healing Adept Mastery<br />
 - Healing Gift Mastery<br />
 - Healing Boon<br />
 - Resplendent Cure<br />
 ... because becoming better at good things can't be all bad.<br />
<br />
As to the delay death debate it looks like a terrible AA to me. +250 HPs only if I get a heal in the right 0.5 seconds before the next swing hits me? Even if I am going to put my own survival before everything else there are a lot of things that are just plain better at achieving that. off the top of my head:<br />
 - extra HP AAs<br />
 - avoidance AAs<br />
 - mitigation AAs<br />
 - healing AAs<br />
 - buff extension AAs<br />
 - spellcasting subtlety<br />
<br />
In all likelihood the various resist AAs will also help you surviving better then delay death.</div></div><hr />

That's sig-worthy.  :)<br />
