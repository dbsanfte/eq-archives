<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Some of you might not know this, but there is a bug with the new UI that causes items to disappear if they are in a bag in the top right inventory slot or the bottom left inventory slot. This appears to happen after a rez. But may also cause problems on logging. Be careful what you put is those bags. <br />
<br />
This came from the general forum at www.monkly-business.com.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>korinna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I almost lost two bp cause of that. I logged in after the new Ui was up and lost my jbone bp and my spirit caller bp. I petitioned the response I got was they were extremley busy and would have to keep petitioning. So my entire guild did, got a senior Gm and my bp 10 min later ;)</div></div><hr />
