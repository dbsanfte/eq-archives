<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ooker_Berkowitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just hit 53 yesterday, and have been grouping in the Planes alot.  The best exp I have gotten was in the Plane of Innovation, I was getting 1% every two kills.  I also just now bought a JBB (WOOT!!!!) and was wanting to start soloing again.  If anybody has any suggestions on where to go, they would be very welcomed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The nobles and bards on the second floor of HHK is the best.  Sadly it's almost perma camped by shaman, necros, and beastlords on my server.  I get about a yellow in 2 hours and around 400pp if I slaughter the guards too (and who wouldn't want to?)<br />
<br />
I also found the giant fort in Burning Woods is decent experiance as is the Hornets nest (tho the hornets have some lower levels that will be green and lt blue).  The giant fort is often camped but the hornets aren't.  Of course random creatures in BW wouldn't be bad either.<br />
<br />
After that I'd like to know some other places as well to solo.  I'd really like to get to 54 soon, only about a yellow and a half away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vusum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I spent about 7 and a half hours here at 52 and went thru 4 yell very easily.  The first group i was in was an all pet group and despite some bad pulls by the drood hehe we still managed to keep killing ww's endlessly.  When that broke up i logged for a bit then went back in and found a sk cleric bard me and 2 rogue group.  Some of the mobs where very resistant others i could stick turgors on the first shot.  I'd slow wait for 80 health on mob then dot as neccesary and start clicking away with my jbb.  Every kill netted between 1 percent and 2 percent with a full group.  How can you beat that?  Cant wait to go back in and see what the exp is like at 53 now.  The sk was saying he was getting between 3 blue and 2 and half blue to my yell bub and he is 56.  Now one more thing if you are on the luclin server this place sucks for exp dont come here its not safe and loot sucks!!  Did i mention blue diamond drops and midnight stones drop here?  About 2 or 3 diamonds an hour with a constant pulling group make 2k in a day from what i got.  Enjoy fellow shammies.<br />

I'm also lvl 53 and had the same question.  I want to get out this stink level so I checked a few places out.  I went to the giant fort in BW, exp was very slow for me but I don't have a JBB and that could be the problem.  <br />
<br />
I went to HHK last night but the nobles were camped by a necro and a bard was cleaning out all the guards.  However I was able to camp the two bards and the named noble that spawns in the room for a little.  The exp was good but slow because the bards are on way too long a timer.  After about 45 mins or so the necro let me know she was heading out and I took over the camp.  Great exp in my opinion.  Granted a good group in the planes will be much better exp but the nobles were so easy it was almost pathetic.  I pulled with slow, clicked my spear and as they started get close send in doggie with haste and regrowth.  I then sat down and cannidanced/medded once dog had aggro.<br />
<br />
I think there is a Magelo link to my stuff in this sig, can't remember though.  I don't have anything too crazy and my wis is on the lower side compared to some.  I definitely could have used a KEI and I probably could have taken the bards as well.  Something to note is the Isabella chick from bard room(the fast spawn) wanders and will walk right into the noble room.  The nobles will help her if she's being attacked, but she will not help the nobles.  At least she didn't for me.<br />
<br />
I may stick here a bit at 54 and see how my AA exp goes.<br />

But now I hit 54 for a couple of days, and I'm looking for another zone to solo.<br />
I tried The Grey yesterday, but single pull is not easy from the Mons Letalis side of the zone.<br />
HHK overcamped....<br />
I'm a bit lost for now...</div></div><hr />
