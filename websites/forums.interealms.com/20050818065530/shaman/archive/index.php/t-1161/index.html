<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since I have not had any luck trying to find a sham to buy, I figured I would twink one and lvl it myself to duo with my 56 monk.  What gear would you suggest?  The hardest time I have with him seems to be getting to lvl 24...how do you suggest lvling him? solo possible? or do i need to do the slow and melee thing?  just lookin for answers, not flames please, thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, since you have a 56 monk, why not use him to FD power level? It's very very nice. Just pull a mob, knock it down to about 10% life, feign and let shaman finish it. It works better with 2 people, but you should do fine. The best way I've found is to root the mob BEFORE you have feigned, then nuke it - make sure to root. This has worked very well for me.<br />
<br />
As far as twinking goes, you didn't say how much plat you had. I like being an HP shaman, so I just threw a bunch of rygorr on sans BP and use an Iksar BP. AC6 65hp rings, rmb, spider fur cloak/collar/belt, orc fang earrings, cyrstal spider eyes and whatever else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kalrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, it depends how much plat you have to twink with.  The best things you can get for your shaman are a Fungi Tunic and a JBB.  Then go AC/HP gear and then Wis/Mana gear.  JBB won't help too much until 45, but you did say twink.  Fungi regen is always nice, and especially so after you get Canibalize.  The most important thing is to get XP as fast as possible to get him up to the level of your monk, right?  So go someplace that you can solo and group.  I usually get XP faster in a group, if it is pulling well.  If not, you can always just drop the group and go solo and not waste any time if you are killing in a place that has both options for you.  Good luck!  And welcome to being a shaman :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please explain this statement, so I can flame properly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">AvalachW: Here (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1119)  is your explanation</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">AvalachW...if you really want to flame me go ahead, take whatever kind of license you want with what i said, the good flamers don't really give a damn what anyone meant and consequently they're the funny ones...so just go ahead and blast me, i don't care, for everyone else, thanks for the advice...i've got enough money to twink with :)  i *could* buy him another fungi (my monk has one) but i don't think i will</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I dunno, Shenlon, the fungi tunic was the single most powerful piece if equipment I ever wore.  How often can you tell if a mask or bracer is actually DOING anything?  When I first started wearing my fungi at level 57 it added NOTICEABLY to my abilities.<br />
<br />
Since you have a monk, I'll use haste as an analogy.  When your monk first equipped a haste item, could you tell a difference?  With my shaman, the increased regen lfrom the fungi led directly to increased mana and increased power and versatility.  The change was immediate and amazing.<br />
<br />
If you have cash, a fungi would be an incredible item for your shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">lol Glor, don't take me wrong...if i am going to play the sham until i get him high enough lvl to group with me and get xp then the fungi will be on him, it's just after that point, when it will be on my monk most of the time that i was debating</div></div><hr />

That's great, AFTER like the mid-20's.  Why you ask?  Simply because a 56 monk will destroy anything that a low 20's and under character will use for exp in under 3 seconds.  You either level him the hard way, or borrow a druid and DS PL him.  DS PL is a great thing too since you work on his defense, and remember, defense=free AC.  After the mid-20's you can do the FD/PL technique to get him to 51 in like a few weeks.</div></div><hr />

LOL, he ain't lying.  I tried FD pl'n with my monk and well, stuff below 20 has a way of dying faster than you can hit attack and turn it off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'll only add that you should make sure you are maxing-out your shaman's skills as you PL him. Common sense, yes but sometimes it is overlooked. A level 50 shaman with an alteration skill of 20 isn't going to be very effctive :)<br />
<br />
As others have mentioned: AC/HP are king. I've followed this formula since level one and it has served me well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think i'm gonna take him to Paludal and lvl him solo there 5-24.  After that it's a (relatively) short road to 35 when i can start grouping my monk and him together</div></div><hr />
