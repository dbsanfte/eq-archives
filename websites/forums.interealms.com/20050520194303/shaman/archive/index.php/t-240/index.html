<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Coram_Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have seen many questions on the shaman boards regarding dueling over the years.  Having played a shaman on Vallon Zek since 1999, I wish to provide some thoughts on dueling along with an example of practical application.  I hope some of my fellow shaman find the information useful.  I don't really think this post has enough information to be called a typical &quot;guide&quot; however I'm not sure what else to call it, so a guide it is!<br />
<br />
This guide is especially meant for the low to mid 50s Shaman; however, there is some information here that applies to everyone.  My goal in writing this is to help my brothers and sisters think about how to use the tools available to a Shaman to win.  I strongly believe in learning by doing and learning by example.  The majority of your time reading the guide will therefore be spent looking at a log and associated comments.<br />
<br />
Almost every dueling situation is different in some way.  It is important to understand general PvP concepts, then implement tactics according to your situation.  There is no magic formula to winning a duel that works every time.  This guide does not review general PvP principals, as most of these principals are well known.  I.e., when fighting an enchanter you want to optimize your Magic Resistance.  If this is the kind of information you're looking for, this isn't your guide.<br />
<br />
If you want to win, know your enemy.  In every fight, be aware of your opponent's strengths and weaknesses.  Defend against the strengths.  Exploit the weaknesses.  Be ready to change and optimize your tactics as you learn about your opponent during the duel.  Remember you can change gear mid-duel.  You may even have the opportunity to change spells mid-duel.<br />
<br />
As a shaman many, many different and effective tactics are available to you.  If you make the effort to think about the situation at hand and plan out the fight, you will perform when it comes time to execute!<br />
<br />
Do not discount any reasonable tactic out of hand.  For example, many folks believe a Shaman tanking a tank is silly; however, I have in the past tanked Paladins who rooted my pet.  In this case, the pally has to tank me and my pet simultaneously because I am standing next to my pet.  Note I would not use this tactic against a paladin wielding, say, a Nature's Defender.  Such is an example of tactical adjustment based on the situation.<br />
<br />
You will not win every duel.  Be humble and learn from superior opponents.  Many times I have been defeated and returned armed with new knowledge to win the next battle.<br />
<br />
Keep a few bags of select gear on you at all times, so you can choose to optimize your AC, various resists, and/or WIS given the situation at hand.<br />
<br />
Below is a Shaman vs Necro log.  Commentary is provided along the way.<br />
<br />
Situation: 54 Shaman vs. 55 Necro outside Sebilis.  Both parties self buffed plus crack.<br />
<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:47:46 2001] Mcwillnow says, 'crombie'<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:47:53 2001] Famini begins to cast a spell.<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:47:55 2001] Mcwillnow says, 'shout down from 3 we fight when you say 3 2 1 GO'<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:47:56 2001] Famini's image shimmers.<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:47:57 2001] Mcwillnow says, 'ok ?'<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:48:04 2001] You told Mcwillnow, 'gl man'<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:48:10 2001] Crombie says, 'rdy?'<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:48:14 2001] You say, 'aye'<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:48:18 2001] Crombie says, '3'<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:48:20 2001] Crombie says, '2'<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:48:22 2001] Mcwillnow tells you, 'GL ?'<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:48:22 2001] Crombie says, '1'<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:48:25 2001] spectral keeper begins to cast a spell.<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:48:33 2001] You told Mcwillnow, 'good luck'<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:48:34 2001] Redlance says, 'ROFL'<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:48:36 2001] Mcwillnow tells you, 'thanks'<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:48:41 2001] Mcwillnow tells you, 'you too'<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:48:51 2001] Redlance watches as the tumble weed rolls by.<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:49:07 2001] You told crombie, 'shout go'<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:49:15 2001] Crombie shouts, '3'<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:49:18 2001] Crombie shouts, '1'<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:49:20 2001] Crombie shouts, 'GO'<br />
<br />
In this fight, my plan was to first take out the Necro's pet.  Pets can be a significant distraction if you let them live.  That said, sometimes it is better manage the pet and go after the caster.  It all depends on your paticular situation.<br />
<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:49:21 2001] You begin casting Spirit Sight.<br />
<br />
Spirit sight is a nice fast casting, low mana buff.  This goes on the enemy pet before turgur's.  Its purpose here is to protect Turgur's from being dispelled by the necro.  It may or may not work due to the sometime randomness of dispel.  The idea is, when the necro dispells his pet, he will remove root and spirit sight only (assuming an unbuffed pet).  Note you cannot use buffs offensively in this way on sullon zek.<br />
<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:49:21 2001] Mcwillnow begins to cast a spell.<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:49:23 2001] Vobanab looks very afraid.<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:49:25 2001] Redlance says, 'DUNNNA NA NA NA! NAAA NAA NAAAAAA'<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:49:26 2001] You begin casting Turgur's Insects.<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:49:27 2001] Gebn hits YOU for 25 points of damage.<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:49:27 2001] Gebn hits YOU for 35 points of damage.<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:49:27 2001] Mcwillnow begins to cast a spell.<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:49:29 2001] Your spell is interrupted.<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:49:29 2001] Gebn hits YOU for 35 points of damage.<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:49:30 2001] You begin casting Root.<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:49:31 2001] Gebn hits YOU for 20 points of damage.<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:49:31 2001] Your body begins to splurt.<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:49:32 2001] You regain your concentration and continue your casting.<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:49:32 2001] Gebn adheres to the ground.<br />
<br />
Necro splurts me.  My buffs are properly ordered (see screen shot), with some free slots up front just after SoW.  Splurt ends up in the second buff slot and is easily dispelled.  Clicked Epic boots to replace SoW in the top slot. This mechanism continues throughout the battle whenever splurt, ignite, or whatnot is landed.<br />
<br />
In many cases, buff ordering is VERY important.  I lost a previous duel with this same opponent  because I didn't bother to order my buffs.  If you want to win, don't be lazy.  One of the costs of having so many options  available to you is high maintenance.  Use your tools, Shaman.  Put the stuff you need the most ALL the way in the back.<br />
<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:49:33 2001] Gebn hits YOU for 22 points of damage.<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:49:37 2001] Mcwillnow begins to cast a spell.<br />

[Sun Mar 04 01:49:44 2001] You feel your life force drain away.<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:49:44 2001] Mcwillnow staggers.<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:49:44 2001] Mcwillnow beams a smile at Coram.<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:49:44 2001] Mcwillnow says, 'Ahhh, I feel much better now...'<br />
[Sun Mar 04 01:49:45 2001] You begin casting Turgur's Insects.<br />

Check the screenshot.  Note remaining health, mana, and buff order.  Remember every move you make, both in preparation and in combat, can have a significant impact on the battle.  Consider - this same opponent defeated me in prior combat.  And in this case I won with full health remaining at the end.  What was the difference?  Buff order.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Excelent Guide! And grats on killing the necro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">so how do you kill a level 60 ranger with a primal bow who has archery mastery 3 + trueshot up? ;)  i tried many, many times...each time i got wasted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sorthaz MT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A real master wouldn't share his secrets=)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sepisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Maybe you can get part of your body in the wall. Seems to keep rangers from hitting mobs with a bow all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you fight in an open area then the bow wil waste you fast. Try to take control of the situation. If you control where the fight takes place, you will have a huge advantage. I never dueld a ranger with primal bow and archery aa skills, but choosing your battle grounds and using the terrain can make the difference between beeing wasted or laying down the smack ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>tinysun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">got an idea here mojo.how about get yourself close enough to him so he can't use bow but not too close that he can melee you?with pet bite him?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Bows are wonky when using altitude differences.  On a level open ground I imagine you'll get wasted consistantly.  Use lev/hilly terrain to get above/below your adversary.  The ranger should get the message that they are too far above/below their intended target and can't shoot at them.  Problem is if lev gets dispelled you take fall damage.  Unfortunately this could rapidly degrade into a quake style duel where people move around alot for positioning and protracts the duration of the fight.  Use corners, crested hills, and put mobs between you and the archer.  Mobs will take hits and either aggro on the archer or if they die they take that one arrow out of the equation.  No reason why Cujo can't be chasing after Mr. ranger while you play tag with his bow (cujo will likely be snared at this point).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>tinysun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">yea,using terrain as your advantage is a skill,and will likely make you win...<br />
<br />
i'd 100 % agree if we're talking about red server pking.<br />
<br />
but i think dueling not about to win or not.finding a way to defeat the ranger would be way more satisflying.i know the world of Norrath doesn't quite obey the physics laws on earth,but that still don't make sense that arrows can't fly up/downwards,or can't hit if you touch a wall.<br />
<br />
again,i'll say,if his arrows are what you fear most,why keep punching the edge of your oppoent's sword?avoid his strength and defeat him with tatic,not exploit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">That was great : )  Thanks for posting that...now to go duel the necro in my guild...<br />
<br />
Cayen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kuthu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">60 Ranger with Primal and maxed AA bow skills = Hard as hell to beat. For the most part using the terrain is bout the only way to avoid the bow shots... then again if they are that calibure of ranger they prolly have full resist gear on so i will be hard to land any spells to begin with even with debuffs in. If you try to stay anyway from the ranger the bow is gonna murder ya... if you come in to melee his swords are really gonna murder ya.<br />
<br />
Basically the ranger is gonna eat ya :(</div></div><hr />
