<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sithliss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just wondering if the quest for canni 2 is MQ-able.  Nothin big.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zukasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's probably MQ-able (not sure), but only two of the pieces you turn in are no-drop, the other two can be traded. The end result (spell scroll) is also tradable. Check if you even need to MQ it first :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes you can mq it, as long as neither person is KOS to the quest lady (i've seen a lot of people who are - don't know what faction she's on).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sithliss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok, so the scroll isn't no drop?  Cause I was told by several people that it was when I tried to buy it on the market channel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No, the scroll isn't no-drop.  You can quest it and sell it if you like, or buy it from someone.  I quest it occasionally and give it to younger shaman if a couple of the components fall into my hands.<br />
<br />
And yes, the quest is MQ'able.  I had the bones (which are NO DROP) and MQ'd them with a younger shaman at one point.<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sithliss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok thanks alot for the info.  Now to make my guild do the quest for me.  lol</div></div><hr />
