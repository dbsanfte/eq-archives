<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I dont know if SOE claims the Leopard and Panther bug regarding SK's was fixed last patch but in case anyone believe it was, it wasnt.  Mobs still gating if you cast SoP/SoL on SK's.  Feratha gated on us tonight x2. :(  both Panther and Leopard were cast on SK's.  FYI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yeah we've known that sony hasn't fixed it yet. The patch only fixed stacking issues with berserker epic or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wudoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hm... hunted with an SK last night (3/7/05) and had no trouble with any mobs gating.  Was in the 'Scions' mission from the Dark Reign camp... perhaps this is only true of certain mobs ?  I was using Leopard.  Curious if this is a bug in how it stacks with certain SK self-buffs and the person I was hunting with wasn't using it.../shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's a Panther bug, not Leopard</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kriyn Nutzforcatnip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, it's not with leopard.  I was with a SK in NC last night and had no problems with it.</div></div><hr />
