<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This whole reputation point thing is just another excuse for the whiners and malcontents to send you negative, and otherwise useless posts.. I imagine that there are more then quite a few folks out there that think they know absolutely everything about the game.  Personally when folks put out a post with ideas that are fresh and new, they are contributing to the over all out look of the class..  Then come the cowards, the snivelers who wallow in theyre own ,overblown, image of self importance.<br />
Everyone knows that every class has issues and you dont have to be a rocket scientist to understand them.. Grizzler made a point that the druids actually got a spell they really wanted, so whats to say that if we ask, if we throw out new ideas that they may be taken into conscideration and actually implemented.  Sometimes it takes a fresh new perspective to get something accomplished..But sadly, there will allways be those who honestly believe they are above the rest and who are trapped in there own little &quot;Im better then you&quot; world who will come along and add nothing but negativity..It doesnt just apply to the reputation point thing but to the posts in general.. Dont slam those who come up with new ideas, come up with your own and try to be constructive..</div></div><hr />

I think it is a harmless system.  If you see someone with a ton of rep bubbles, generally you can assume that they aren't a clueless twit.  When you see someone in the red, you can generally assume that they are.  The vast majority of people have one green bubble (even some of our best posters) and could go either way.  For the most part this has held pretty true over the years I've been reading the crucible.  If you don't like it, just ignore it - it harms you in no way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I was banned from Eqrankings not for foul language or attacking anybody on the messageboards.  I was banned from eqrankings because each person that posted a message that eqrankings was messed up I told them you need to give proof to the moderator that the page was not working properly.  The moderator wanted proof the page was not working so I posted what each person needs to do and what to complain about as proof.  After the pages started working a little better I posted a message it works now.  Must have pissed him off or he still believe its working properly (its not) because now I no longer have access.  No email address to voice concerns listed either.  Absolute power corrupts absolute I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I must be nuts, but I think the system is OK.  If nothing else it adds something unique to these boards.  The way I see it, and I may be wrong, is that those people who either lack patience, manners or sense seem to get negative hits.  I hope this encourages posters to be more civil.  While I will agree that giving a negative bump for disagreeing with someone is kinda lame, giving a negative hit for someone when they mouth off or lash out is likely a good thing.  I find it amusing that so many of the people that point out how they dislike the system (not those specifically in this thread, others like Gagner67 and Tugela have posted on rep hits in other threads) also claim they don't care if they take neg rep hits ... well ... if they didn't care, they wouldn't point it out.  Personally, I haven't issued a negative rep hit in a long time and the last time I did was because the poster was rude.</div></div><hr />

Seems like negative bumps from folks with no reputation has more power than positive rep bumps from folks with no repuation.<br />

It is not possible for one to give multiple reputation to a single individual over a few days. Also, someone with grey rep themselves can't bump anyone up or down. <br />
<br />
How many Rep-bumps can i give in a day?<br />
<br />
You can give 4 rep bumps over a 24 hour period. Administrators have no limit. You can also only give reputation to a person you have already given reputation to, after giving rep-bumps to another 15 people.</div></div><hr />

I won't comment for or against those bumps, but I will say this ... your rep shows green to me and says you are on a distinguished road even (better than unknown quality).  /shrug  Looks like the system works if others agreed.  While rep bumping based on if you agree or not is foolish, I hope it helps to keep the boards more civil.</div></div><hr />

Glori has this always been the case.  I am pretty certain that I have had rep points taken by folks who had a gray rep.  I went from 122 rep points to 116 and the only rep bumps listed were gray.</div></div><hr />

What I think is hilarious kinda is that some of my best or most informative posts don't get any recognition good or bad, but something as simple as a small ranger corpse joke (when it's obvious that I have a ranger alt) gave me two negative bumps.  <br />
<br />
And it doesn't really take into account how many bumps you get from people that don't have enough rep.  Submitted something a while ago from a talk with a dev and got about 20 overall bumps, but only 2 of them counted, the rest were gray from people without enough rep /shrug</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually Belinda, Kindergarten is where you spend your day, this is your out of kindergarten hobby.<br />
<br />
People get too excited about reputation. A reputation bump is for a specific post, and gives the reader the opportunity to show approval for that specific post, which is why you can click on the link in the cp section and see the actual post that you are getting feedback on.<br />
<br />
I have been slammed on some feedback, and if I didn't like to harangue people like Chutoi and Blazz just to &quot;keep them real&quot; I would have a whole bunch more. :)<br />
<br />
I take every bump as a gift, yes, even for the rep bump of &quot;you are a retard. Go and....&quot; well you can fill the rest in.<br />
<br />
But back to Belinda.... Sorry to point out that each one of the registered users is in a position to judge the posts on this board, and clearly has done so to yours. Don't cry about it, because getting upset about it is lame, wouldn't you say?</div></div><hr />

Grey marks means the person who gave you the bump didn't have enough rep to bump you one or the other, if I stated that correctly.  If you had actually received negative hits from someone who could give a negative hit, it would have been red, not grey.</div></div><hr />

Me: I tend to occasionally earn +rep hits on the forums relating to EQ, but I tend to get -rep hits on The Grey.

This was a joking post made in response to Ug's post making fun of how much we whine as a class.<br />
<br />
Heh, We get bash  :D  or maybe its slam I forget, but large races get this if they have a shield if I am not mistaken.  I know this was sarcasm but man know your class before posting sarcastic things about abilities that we alread....oh what the hell nm  :p  /jk<br />
<br />
I can't believe I got a negative rep bump for this joking response what kind of anal person thought that this post deserved a negative bump.  Then they went on to explain to me in comments what skill we get.  Well thank you but you didn't see the irony in the post.  Let me explain to you, who ever you were that gave the bump down.<br />
<br />
Heh, We get bash  :D  or maybe its slam I forget<br />

<br />
Can't you see I am poking fun?  You know &quot;haha&quot;, like why would I tell someone to know their class if I didn't remember which skill we got? I didn't really need you to tell me what the skill was and what it could be raised to vs the other skill.  Oh and incase you have issues reading:<br />
<br />
oh what the hell nm  :p  /jk<br />
<br />
<br />
The comments were:<br />
we get slam ( it doesn't need a shield ) and the skill in it is only 50. Not to say that we miss a lot when we use it, instead of Bash that will increase like a skill up to 200</div></div><hr />

If you have moxy, the rep bumps you give are red if you disapprove, green if you approve.  Weight of your bump varies depending on how much moxy you got.<br />

If you ain't got the mojo, it's grey, regardless of whether you like the post or not.</div></div><hr />

Some EQEMU servers have every mob and every zone. The mobs are just tuned down and the gear is completely insane. Insane as in hitting for thousands while dual wielding 1hs weapons.<br />
<br />
Went on one server and explored all of PoTime, looked pretty cool.<br />
<br />
Went to VT as well, but there weren't any mobs up, so I didn't get to experience the full-on LiveEQ effect.<br />
<br />
Still fun, though.</div></div><hr />

Winter's Roar seems to be one where the GMs actually create GOOD content, according to a friend of mine. The top guild has some sort of DKP system, so there must be at least a few worthwhile mobs/events. It's completely legit, except the items are custom, and so are the mobs. They've tuned down gear quite a bit, I believe. You level just like likeEQ,  spells and AAs are like liveEQ, etc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">yep.. winter's roar is pretty good if you can actually get to the higher levels, i would love to have a high level character on that server.. but i just cant devote as much time as i used to devote to EQLive.. so ill forever be a level 16 on it :p<br />
<br />
i actually like raidaddict's myself though.. as the name implies its focused on raiding, but right now its closed because theyre adding a HUGE amount of content and also wiping all accounts :( but it should be good when its done<br />
<br />
and garf.. its good to bury the hatchet :) i dont mind a flamewar.. but i didnt exactly ask for it with my first post lol<br />
<br />
EDIT: forgot to mention that you're right.. winter's roar does have their items tuned down quite a bit, most raid-level equip has kunark stats and luclin damage/delay.. with a bit of custom focus effects thrown in, things like damage increment 1-5+ i think they work at all levels.. but DI5 would have much more damage increase than DI1.. another example is casting increment 1, which i got in warrens off the king.. it decreases my gate cast time by 0.1 seconds lol.. but im sure casting increment 5 would be quite quick</div></div><hr />
