<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wisey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I would like to have some info on this DD AA.<br />
<br />
Anyone knows what is the % of nuke crit if I have max Fury of Magic AA?<br />
<br />
I have gotten level 1 and realised it's 6 AA for level 2 and probably 9 AA for level 3.<br />
<br />
If it has the same crit rate as our healing gift AA, I don't mind.<br />
<br />
I have other important AA skills already.<br />
<br />
Would appreciate feedback especially from those who have max Fury of Magic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe it is around 13%, but it is very streaky.  Basically, imagine how often you crit with SCF3.  Now, imagine that every time you crit, you'll usually crit again in the next 1-3 nukes.  That's about how good FOM3 is.  I wouldn't put it high on my priority list, but I looked at your magelo and my advice is to just go for it.  You've got everything else worth having.<br />
<br />
Edit:  I compared wizard AA to shaman AA, and going by the information I found here: http://www.graffe.com/AA/ , in addition to my own observations, I adjusted it down from 15% to 13%.  That is still, though, just a guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>enarcheos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't think anyone outside of the programming team at EQ know for sure, but the currently accepted figures on the Caster Forums is <br />
<br />
Level 1: 8-9%<br />
Level 2: 10-11%<br />
Level 3: 13-14%</div></div><hr />
