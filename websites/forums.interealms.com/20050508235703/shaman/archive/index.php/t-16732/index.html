<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yohimba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For those who don't know EQFaces.com was a cool site where you could post a profile as well as a RL pic and an avatar pic. Neat way to ge to know the real folks behind the PCs. Thousands of folks were listed there. Myself, hubby and some among them. I had even begun doing some business creating portraits combining RL pic with avatars.<br />
<br />
For about a week now the site seems to have gone kablooey. Anyone know what happened? :(<br />
