<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok nothing is ever going to fix slow now there will be no &quot;overslows&quot; etc for shaman and mitigation will not be removed.<br />
<br />
So all this has got me to thinking.<br />
If Rytan were to post on these boards tomorrow (god forbid) that Shaman will get all their top 10 needs and our spells manna costs reduced if they agree to having Canni removed or reduced and replacing it with a not so high return passive manna regen spell.<br />
<br />
I ask this because Sonys problem with us seems to stem from the fact they think our slow is too overpowering as is our manna regen.<br />
We know all the arguments against canni being overpowering(not passive etc).<br />
<br />
This is only a bit of thinking ive been doing and just got me to wondering what we would give up for reduced manna cost,better heals and nukes etc.<br />
<br />
I would personally only accept a reduced canni if we got a passive manna buff to replace the half we lost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No nerf of any sort &quot;fixes&quot; anything..besides after 4 years of standing up mana regen and constant clicking, I would have no clue as to what to do with my fingers.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Takashi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This thread needs to be locked. I doubt any shaman will make any concessions with any of the Cannibalization abilities or spells. If they did, I'm certain Sony will be seeing a decrease in their profits. Sorry, but it's not an idea that I will give into. As for your comment with &quot;overslows,&quot; Balance of the Nihil makes shaman the best slower. It is rarely resisted, does not need malos to be cast in most cases of its use during group situations, and with shaman's abilities to heal, we are still a very useful class.</div></div><hr />

That is perhaps the understatement of the day Glori :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually Canii line of spells suck if you really look at it. Our new upgrades do MORE hps for MORE mana, but have a recast time of all hell. What this means is basically we get a passive mana regen, except we actaully have to click.<br />
<br />
You don't get the canni up flavor unless you load canni 4. So in essence we're moving towards passive mana regen with an added hassle that we can't cast spells during regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">what kind of insanity is this!!  NO no no.. If we give in to this, and it did become a reality, the next on the chopping block would probably be Necros..and to that I say HELL NO!.. My shaman is still very appealing to play, but we open this can of rancid worms, necros would undoubtedly be next.. No thankyou sir!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think I know what the author is getting at.<br />
<br />
So much of Shaman ability is based around CAN, NOT Slow.  Which is why you hear the clueless continually bray: &quot;Shaman have unlimited Mana,&quot; etc.<br />
<br />
The problem is that unlimited mana makes limited difference when: a) Fights are over in 30 seconds, b) Spells take forever to cast, and c) the re-cast is interminable.<br />
<br />
It is at best a wash if every spell and ability is based around Cann.  That's like adding ANOTHER penalty to Ogres above and beyond the racial one simply because they get frontal stun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">they can't balance us with what we have.<br />
<br />
anyone that thinks they could balance us after taking abilities away, needs to be hit with a bat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If they are going to do it this way, might as well just remove all sham mana, made all sham spells cost 0 mana, and just balanced us bast on cast time =P</div></div><hr />

Don't forget duration and lots of aggro :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It will be one of my top 10 reasons to quit playing this game if they nerf canni.<br />
<br />
It is our unique spell and the long cast time right now can use some improvement.<br />
<br />
It is same as remove SLOW from shaman and give us something in return, it will NEVER work.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Slow and cani are the two reasons why they are afraid to give us anything else.<br />
As much as I like cani, it is a two edged sword. Without cani they could reduce many of our spells by 10-20% while offering a passive mana regen, to &quot;even it out&quot;. Hopefully speed up some of our spell casting times. It would be a truly tough decision for me, I have grown accustem to canni, and would hate to see it nerfed. While playing any of my other characters I constantly accidently cast the spell that is in the canni slot out of habbit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't know how many times I've done that when playing my alts!  On my cleric I think that was my cheal hotkey, luckily it takes 10 seconds so it's easy to interrupt,  :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok this thread comes from talking with the wife who plays a beastlord.<br />
She said something along the lines of<br />
 &quot;well they buggered your slow compared to other classes without improving any aspect of shaman perhaps next canni will be nerfed and you will get something out of that&quot;.<br />
Just kind of made me wonder what SoE will do next and what it would take for Shaman to get better heals,dps etc.<br />
As we know all our deficencies more than make up for Canni.SoE dont seem to realise this neither do most people who play the game and im seriously wondering what SoE are going to come up with next for us.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Mmm, I see where Wulf is coming from, and it's a valid concept, but I have to agree with Wing. If we request NECESSARY upgrades (not left-field keeping-up-with-Joneses crap, but REAL SOLID upgrades) ... but must &quot;trade something in&quot; in order to have them ... doesn't seem like much of an upgrade, suddenly, does it?<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I am against somehow 'trading' anything for the top 10 list (will we ever see ONE single thing on it done by the way? It's like 2 months now, sheesh).<br />
<br />
The top 10 list is in most points a list about actual class issues. It's more a list of fixes than anything - no need to give up anything for a reasonable fix request. God knows, we will see little of it implemented anyway  :( .<br />
<br />
Having said that, there is a point about rebalancing mana costs against our canni ability.<br />
<br />
Throwing out some completely theoretical numbers:<br />
Let's say some average shaman (incl. canni V) is canniing for FT50, that is 500 mana per minute. Just to have a number. On the other hand mana costs (or mana effectivity for healing or dps) are calculated so, that shaman needs 300 mana more per minute to do his job.<br />
<br />
So what is the point about canniing this 300 mana and then paying higher mana costs to begin with? Keeping us busy for zero advantage doesn't make a lot of sense imo.<br />
<br />
A second point: the whole dependance between canni and our mana consumption is also decreasing our effectivity in short term fights. Sure we can canni back the spent mana relatively quick after the fight, but when sh.. hits the fan and everyone is chain casting to keep group/raid alive, our mana costs skyrocket. To state the obvious: Canni has zero use for us, when there is no time to canni ...<br />
<br />
When i would have any confidence, SOE could do such changes (reduce canni AND mana costs) in a fair and professional manner, i would hesitantly agree with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">they would never give us better heals, nukes and mana costs just for taking away canni.. they would ONLY reduce mana costs. heals and nukes are balanced around the notion that slow is all that and a bag of chips, NOT canni</div></div><hr />

Totally agree with you and i am in no way requestion this from Sony more the fact that as Sony keep unimproving (is that a word) us with every expansion I can see a canni type nerf coming.<br />
They still seem to think that with slow and canni shamans should be punished with higher manna cost,less dps etc.Theyve reduced the need for Shaman slow so whats next on the list for them if they STILL think we're overpowered.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Blaorfi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Take away my canni....I take away your balls.<br />
<br />
Nough said imo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Ok nothing is ever going to fix slow now there will be no &quot;overslows&quot; etc for shaman and mitigation will not be removed.<br />

<br />
This is only a bit of thinking ive been doing and just got me to wondering what we would give up for reduced manna cost,better heals and nukes etc.<br />
<br />
I would personally only accept a reduced canni if we got a passive manna buff to replace the half we lost.<br />
<br />
The only possibility would be if we got a passive mana regen spell that was really close to the return that canni4 gives.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, this is trading a class defining requirement that would affect every single Shaman in the game to fix a handful of problems that a handful of Shaman experience.  *NOTE* said handful of Shaman have serious problems, I just wouldn't stand for the &quot;fix&quot;, aka canni nerf, to their problems being at a monumental cost of every other Shaman.<br />
<br />
Also, keep in mind that canni is not a normal kind of spell - as in it's use is directly player style related.  Some Shaman use it a lot, others very little, others depending on the situation.  It's not something that you can quantify really, like a passive mana regen would be, since the nature of canni causes dramatic fluctuations in our net mana regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Canni isnt worth as much as it used to be in this new age of 30 second fights.  Much like, well, a lot of our abilities, which were all about efficiency in very long fights.<br />
<br />
I'd probably cash in my canni button for real burst heals or real burst dps, since that's all that matters in EQ anymore, except for warrior disciplines.<br />
<br />
Never happen though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If Burst Healing and Burst DPS are all that is important, wouldn't everyone choose to be a druid since they get to be second best at both (as far as Heals and Nukes go )?</div></div><hr />
