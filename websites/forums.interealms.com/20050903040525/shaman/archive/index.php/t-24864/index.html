<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The &quot;Mini Diablo&quot; and &quot;Zergling&quot; pets are ok for Warlocks or Horde race characters, but I absolutely REFUSE to have a PANDA running around with my macho NE Hunter!<br />
<br />
Needless to say, I'm kind of disappointed with the lack of choices. Hopefully they'll add more in the future.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm partial to my Hyena, Stripe, for my Orc Hunter - we both smell bad together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Vla these pets will be for show. Don't think they will give non pet classes pets that do any substantial damage.<br />
It's somethign to follow you so you can tell the rest of the world that your d--k is bigger than thiers cause u got the CE. I know i am gettign it too :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeh, I know they are &quot;non combative&quot; pets, per the way it's worded in the CE description.<br />
<br />
Even so...I hope they add other options that are more appropriate based on your class. Additionally, I don't really like how they've blurred the lines between Diablo (mini), Starcraft (zergling), and WoW (panda).<br />
<br />
I would've been happy simply getting one of the 40s pets for free. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There have been pets like this, like Valgoth said &quot;non-combative&quot; pets, for some time.  Things like Parrots, Snakes, Cockroaches, and the oh so cool Mecha-Squirrel.<br />
<br />
I'm not so keen on the other two but the Zergling is pretty cool looking imo, and actually almost &quot;cute.&quot;</div></div><hr />
