<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was requested by a friend to make 50 shrink potions for him.<br />
<br />
I am a level 49 shaman with 101 alchemy skill.<br />
<br />
Usually this task would take about 5 failures.<br />
<br />
Not a single failure, I was stuned.<br />
<br />
Did they finally fix it.<br />
<br />
Or was I just lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I just made 15 shrink singles with no failures at skill 103, which surprised me. I don't remember the normal fail rate as I haven't done it in a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">congrats on the lack of failures!<br />
<br />
I was hoping you were going to talk about lower herb prices.  that is the 'fix' that alchemy needs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There's nothing 'broken' with the failure rate. All tradeskills have a minimum 5% failure rate, that's how it's meant to be. You just got lucky.<br />
<br />
Which is always nice :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I had a run of 137 SOW potions without a failure... I was stunned.<br />
<br />
Of course, out of the next 23 I made, I had like 7 failures... LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Made 60 Sow potions last night. No failures. I usually get 1 or 2 (and I'm stuck with 8 single shots in my bearskin bag, hogging up space).<br />
<br />
Interesting...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have not failed a gate potion in over 40 attempts.  That's scary.  I'm due for a run of 10 failures...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ragathor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My personal record for Gate potions in a row was broken the other night.  I had previously made 112 Gate pots in a row.  Then I fail 2 times in a row and currently back up to 20 on a new streak.  I never make gate pots with less than max wis and int buffs I can get.  Wierd thing is I fail 7 out of 50 sow pots the same night.  <br />
<br />
Gotta love the new bazaar mode make potions transfer to bazaar mule/load mule/go afk/sell all day while at work and see 5k in the bank to make more.  With the success rates IM having on gate pots I am actually making plat doing this.<br />
<br />
Best of luck to all. :)</div></div><hr />
