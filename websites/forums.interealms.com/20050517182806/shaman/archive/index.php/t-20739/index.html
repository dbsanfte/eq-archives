<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi folks, been a long time since I've posted here, I kept lurking even after I had retired my shaman.<br />
<br />
Finally did it, gave away all my EQ accounts (3 of them) and hit the cancle billing buttons.  Shaman had gotten up to level 62 with a handfull of AA, Wizzy was 65 with a hundred AA and the game just wasn't fun for me.  Done VT, made it to the EPs and was starting to knock on Time's door but it just wasn't fun anymore.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, what got me to posting here, I was reading the Fanfair thread and saw people talking about City of Heroes (www.coh.com)<br />
<br />
I've been beta testing CoH since December and I have to say, the dev feedback is the best I've ever seen.  I've had email conversations with some of the devs and had a response &quot;Well, I think you're wrong but you make some good points, I'll make the change for a few days and decide then&quot;.  I'm even happy to say that change is still around :)<br />
<br />
There are archtypes (ATs) within CoH but to compare them to eq classes is way off.  &quot;Tankers&quot; are the big meaty guys, but that doesn't mean they're all the same.  Fire Tankers, for example, can't take a hit very well (other than their large number of hit points) but are by far the most offensive of the tanker ATs.  Invulnerability Tankers are much more like Warriors in EQ, they mitigate damage from most attack types and coupled with their massive HPs take the beatings.  Ice tankers take fewer hits with a higher advoidance but have a lower mitigation.  And all this is just the tanker Primary powers, the secondary powers also vary them a lot further.<br />
<br />
I know, several people are reading this and thinking &quot;So you just described a warrior, a ranger and possibly another class&quot;.  The game is different, you can't compare the two.  CoH encourages mass combat, it's nothing for my regular group to go charging into a room full of 20+ thugs and wipe the floors.  You can single pull (and a few times it's required) but for the most part the game is about mass combat.  The game is slanted in the player's favor, you're superheroes after all, you're supposed to smash up a whole warehouse full of drug dealers!<br />
<br />
It's possible to build full time healers like a cleric, but once people learn more about their characters and everyone's abilities it's not needed anymore.   Once people get out of the early/mid levels and learn what they're capable of, there is no &quot;perfect&quot; group.  You don't *need* a controller to handle things, all classes have some crowd control abilities, the specialists in CC almost make it boring (but the game throws so many curve balls that it keeps people on their toes.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I want to thank the Crucible for the many years of enjoyment I had here.  When I was playing my shaman full time I valued the information I received from here and tried to share my (comparatively) limited knowledge to other players.  It's kind of odd, coming back here and seeing names that I still remember.   I wish you all the best in life, I hope you're still enjoying EQ, because it does have some fun spots still, but if you're not, there's other things out there to do.<br />
<br />
And, with that, I think I'm going to go enjoy the spring air and go for a bike ride.<br />
<br />
Namaste,<br />
