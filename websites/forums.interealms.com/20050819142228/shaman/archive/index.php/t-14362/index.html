<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No. Its not hard to farm pp, there are many techniques, all of which are posted all over the web.</div></div><hr />

If you want to kill hill giants or HHK guards for the rest of your life, then by all means roll a necro.  Once you are 65 though there are about 300 better ways to make money than what people have mentioned here.<br />

Necros might very well be the best at farming greens for cash, but thats a terrible way to make money, really.</div></div><hr />

Mind Enlightening us?  Was this soloing?  Outside elementals?  I know a mage who hydras a cleric who can make that money douing BoT winged nameds.  But Shamans aren;t mages.  And Rangers (which my main is) have even less luck soloing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just wondering, how are necros better than other classes at farming greens for cash? I can understand necros better at soloing higher level mobs than most other classes... but greens?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Greens are fearable, greens can't touch the necro pet. Necros have a great deal of trouble fighting high dark blue/white+ mobs, because those things DESTROY their pets, too resistant (or immune) to fear, and dots take a while to work. There are some really superb necros out there who can do it, but in general they just don't have the tools for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">on my necro I don't farm greens for cash drops.<br />
<br />
If I need money I solo Emp/Blood room in sebilis for a few days.  I can make about 80k in 2days off lvl 59-60 spells, breath of harmony's and gems.<br />
<br />
the only 2 things that make it easier to do with a necro than a shaman is snare and lifetap dots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">hmmm, for snare and lifetap, I guess my Regent Symbol of Innoruuk and my Soulstripper will have to do...<br />

Though i would also like to know Jin, im having a tough time getting up the cash for my spells, if i could make a 1/16th of that in a day id be happy heh.  Please share.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>EQScott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yes, Necro can farm greens quicker than anyone, but that's not ALL they do.  To say that shows lack of knowledge of what a necro can do.<br />
<br />
They can't fight straight up like a shaman, but they have many tools at their disposal, not just fear.<br />
<br />
But to answer the question, I wouldn't make ANY character just for farming.  IMO, that's boring as hell.  But you have the right idea in picking a good soloer.<br />
<br />
Oh...  and never farm plat.  Farm &quot;things&quot;.  ;)</div></div><hr />

Cause man , i been camping emp for going on 3 days now and im talking serious camping and i still dont have enough cash for any of my spells i missing. If im lucky i might be able to sell all these spells for 5-10k. Not to mention at this stage of the game i dont exp heavily and making money is alot of fun for me, so if there is someplacor more to the point multiple places that i dont know about, tips would be welcome.<br />
<br />
Yea im a newbie to cash making :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">ha, you know i think i found where you talking about, i dont feel going there alone till i get my 65 DoT, but its definetly quiet and i can see making that much cash in a few hours with luck.<br />

right in front of my face :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Hadd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">yes necros are , but charmers are in general . <br />
duoed with friend necro last 7 days . made over 400K ( necro made his 500k too or so )  . bought all my 65 spells but one . improved equip , furnished bank account , improved all tradeskills to 170+ , and basically had fun . my trader has seen so many items and spells latelly i can't believe it . <br />
<br />
been charm duoing in tactics pit , killed nameds , piglets , got spectrals and horns . <br />
off those 7 days we must have got <br />
<br />
2 bulwart <br />
2 glyphed rune <br />
1 ornate(?) silk bracer pattern  <br />
3 earrings of rage <br />
2 war staffs <br />
40+ war wraith blood <br />
30+ spectrals <br />
20+ gold tipped horns . <br />
<br />
20 Aas . the xp slowed down a little after the grp xp change but it is still very good . <br />
<br />
we did  it with 3 necros all charm enabled , a clr , a shm , and a 6th  a few times after the xp change , kill too fast , not enough mobs even when moving directly in pit ( and yes , we clean stables too ) . <br />
<br />
charm is so overpowered ... seriously , it's sickening . <br />
<br />
Hadd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Boon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I think many of us would be interested in learning how to make 80k pp in a day.  Hell even 5 - 10k in a day.  I am 9% from 65 and I will soon need to farm my ass off to buy my spells, and the best I can do is a couple thousand a night.  If you could post even a hint or two about how to make this kind of money, or where you would suggest fighting, I am sure MANY of us would be greatful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">They aren't making 80kpp farming green mobs.  There are numerous places where you can make that kind of money, if you can solo the mobs that drop items and tradeskill materials worth that kind of money.  Unfortunately, if you have a level 50 character, you really aren't going to be able to take out any of those mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Let me just shed a little bit of light on your point of view.<br />
<br />
After posting here i was like ... wth, what places could they be camping, then i headed to a camp with some friends and i was just looking around going... i think i can solo this. Low and behold i just got back from my lil spot where i was succesfuly able to hold it. <br />
<br />
Im hesitant where you to say more cause its a place that would be easily ruined and i simply need it right now for my spells. A lil greedy, yes i guess so, but not being able to mgb Fo7 is down right embarassing to me atm, so j00 just going to have to wait :p<br />
<br />
definetly is not farming greenies though, the few places i found in the last 2 days are pretty tough and challanging to a 65 shaman with all his important toys. I got a horse, jbb, epic, Quiesence, Malos and all my spells except for BoS ( and the 65 buff spells ) and i was just BARELY able to hold a few of them and got feared into some mobs in one camp which resulted in a speedy death =\<br />
<br />
But like i said, just look around are with your groups, ask yourself if you can solo it and dont be afraid to die a few times working out your methods. Knowledge of what mobs drop and how often and in what zones and of how well the items will sell plays a huge role.<br />
<br />
Halfway to Fo7 atm and climbing .. good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">If you want plat, farming greens is not the best way to go about doing it.  Sure, it's safe, consistent, steady... slow... <br />
<br />
Go fight in dungeons for experience.  I'm not 60+, I've only got a 53 shaman and a 57 ranger, so I go to Karnor's and camp the WL/jail area, which is still good xp for me duoing.  I can clear the jail + WL room + wanderers before respawn with that duo.  A good day will produce a monk epic pipe MQ and a t-staff.  There's 20-25k or so, via the bazaar.  And in that time I could earn a good yellow or 2 of AA or regular xp.<br />
<br />
I also have a 55 wizard that I take to Cobalt Scar and quad with to make cash.  It's not near as &quot;hit-and-miss&quot; as fighting in dungeons and winning phat lewt, but it's consistent.  The wyverns drop velious gems and hides, all of which sell for 50pp... gems 50pp to vendors (with high charisma), and hides 50pp in bazaar.  A 2-3 hour session of quadding (assuming the place isn't flooded with dr00ds) can produce 1-2k pp at the end of the night.  The wyvern hides sell like hotcakes to tradeskillers in the bazaar... I'm not kidding --- within 15 mins of putting up yer wyvern hides for 50pp each, they're sold in bulk to someone.  I can usually get 1 stack of hides in a 2-3 session.  That's 1k.  Mix in another 20 gems or so, and there's another 1k.  Of course, the hard part is raising up a wizard to be 50+ so he can quad in CS... but I don't regret at all the time I spent on my wizard, especially when he's able to fund my cause like that.<br />
<br />
The money starts to flow the higher level you get and the tougher things you are able to take on.  Go to the Hole if yer in yer 50s and fight down in the city... go to KC and grab a good camp... go to Seb and grab a good camp...<br />
<br />
Also, if you have 2 accounts and are able to duo these places, it makes it even better since you are guaranteed to get any loot that drops. ;)  Cash loot, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I've been wanting to try to solo the Adept corner of 4c for a while now, I think it might be possible as long as Adept isnt up when you get there, the first split would suck but if you have good mana \ ft \ hps \ spells you could prolly keep up (maybe get outside buffs and VOQ  :D ).

Level 65 necro pet sucks ass BUT its a greenie killing machine. About the only thing its good foor. It tears through mobs faster than damn near anything. Course, for 60-100k and the fact that its useless anywhere else, its kidna situational.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I hate to break the news but necros aren't limited to killing greens. I know several necros who can solo Black Reavers in CoM.... I'm prety sure there's no other class that can do that.<br />
<br />
These necros can bring in tens of thousands of pp per day in Jade Reavers for Ranger or Druid epics. Jinheim and co. are using a little system called &quot;rare drops&quot; which they then sell for high prices in the bazaar. Thats good, if you're lucky. They're far from consistant... you can go one day making the 80 grand he described above, and the next leaving empty handed.</div></div><hr />

Hit the nail on the head.  Over time I make plenty of money, but some days I do walk away empty handed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The 65 pet is a disappointing, there's no doubt, but you're overstating it's uselessness a bit :D<br />
<br />
Regarding others' comments about necros farming ability, anyone that believes that necros can only farm greens for FS &amp; cash is clueless.  The only time I've ever farmed green mobs is when I'm working on one faction or another.  I've had several 80k (or more) days with my necro, at a variety of locations. I sure as hell didn't do it by farming greenies.  Yes, sometimes I walk away from hours of farming with significantly less, but I can pull some serious cash when I choose to do so.  It has much less to do with what class is involved than it has to do with the knowledge of the player, and the selection of farming spots.<br />
<br />
No, necros don't have an exclusive lock on making crazy amounts of cash, but a good necro is certainly VERY good at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I dont possiblely see how you guys can make 80k in one day! I am a 58 shaman on the cazic thule server and i probally dont even have 80k if i saved all the platinum i ever made with this character, and sold all my stuff. Its crazy! If anyone could tell me a way to make maybe 5k a day at 58 PLEASE TELL ME!!!!<br />
<br />
PS: I prefer rare drop places instead of taking things that drop finesteel or something that sell for little but you get alot. Its much better to get one big thing :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">5k a day at 58 is a cinch. Hell, you can do hill giants for that.</div></div><hr />

But go to bazaar, check out things that are selling for a good price, look them up on where they drop. Then go get them :)</div></div><hr />

Go to the pits and farm the piglet for the shield and also scout around for other named and get some nice selling drops + tradeskill items.  Doing this solo, duo, or two boxed you can probably get some really nice cash.  On TP where I am at, Tactitians Bulwarks are going for around 40k!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">That's more or less what I do.
