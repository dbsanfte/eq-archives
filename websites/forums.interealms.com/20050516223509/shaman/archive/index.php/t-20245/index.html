<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kariza Spiritslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hiya Fellow Shaman<br />
<br />
I have a question, since im a iksar shm, I follow'd the eq.castersrelm.com info on what to use for my extra creation points, should i remake the toon, and put more points into sta or keep it the way it is, 80 sta 115 wis.   Thank for the help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if your at a low lvl and can afford the time to reroll your character<br />
<br />
you should really make a Ogre, frontal stun immunity is so key. I really wish i was a ogre...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm an ogre and I love it.  No frontal stuns is a great ability.  <br />
<br />
However, a lot of people talk down the power of regen.  Regen is a huge help at least until you get torpor, and really doesn't hurt after, either.  I've played a couple of ogres to 65 and one into the 50's, a troll warrior for a while, and an iksar monk that I've kept at 60 for a long time as well as a human monk, and a 54 druid.  Regen was a huge help to the monk in leveling compared to the human, and to the troll vs. the ogre warrior.  Seriously, it was like night and day how fast I leveled with regen toons.  Free health is a really great thing.  It far more than makes up for the extra experience penalty you get when you choose a regen toon.<br />
<br />
Eventually, regen starts to count for less and less -- when you're VERY high up and have VERY good spells and are starting to get some really good gear.  But it never sucks -- my ogre wouldn't be caught dead without his regen spell on, and it makes leveling much easier and faster.  It's the fashion to talk down regen these days, but regen and the mana and hitpoints you can get from it will undoubtedly do many good things for you, even save your life here and there along the way to 65.<br />
<br />
I'm quite happy with my ogre -- I made him when just about nobody made ogres and troll shamans were almost the only things you saw besides barbarians, and even if only in my mind's eye, he still feels unique and uniquely cool to me.  But I also remember how great it was to have regen on the troll warrior and iksar monk I made(who I still have), especially compared to the ogre warrior and human monk I made.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This may be a stupid question, but do you get the abilities from a race when you use a illusion ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This may be a stupid question, but do you get the abilities from a race when you use a illusion ?<br />
<br />
Nope.  Well, for the most part no.  Enchanter illusion troll may give some regen, I've heard, never checked it out though.  But ogre form definitely doesn't give the unstunnabilty thing.  Froglok form doesn't give the extended breath thing.  And bearform takes away the two-handed bash thing that fatties and barbs(?) get.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
I forgot, on-topic, don't sweat the stats.  20 points one way or the other makes no difference.  If you're having fun, and you like your toon, then you're doing it right.  Keep playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Base stats mean pretty much nothing now, with gear being as inflated as it is.  Unless you are under level 10, I wouldn't bother rerolling because you don't like your base stats - it just isn't worth the time.  When I started playing EQ, my friend told me that shamans were a hybrid class and thus used both int and wis, and I applied my points accordingly - it didn't matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Some enchanter racial illusions do grant benefits.<br />
<br />
Troll grants regen.<br />
<br />
any race with special vision grants the race's vision.  On the other hand, if you use illusion human/barb, you lose your night vision if you have it.<br />
<br />
I *think* illusion iksar also grants regen, but I don't know, as my chanter doesn't have that spell.  It's quested, and I've never bothered with the quest at this time, since my chanter's had no need to go to Cabilis yet.<br />
<br />
Illusion Vah Shir grants a meaty dex boost.<br />
<br />
And as many know, a great deal of the &quot;other&quot; illusions chanters cast grant certain benefits, Night's Dark Terror, Tricker's Augmentation, and Boon of the Garou being the most well known.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As Jinheim says, in the long term stats don't matter because you'll max them out eventually. I found sta a lot easier to max out than wisdom (mainly coz I'm a hp junky I guess), so don't think you've really done anything wrong.<br />
<br />
Yes, frontal stun immunity would be great - if I restarted, I'd get an ogre just for that. Troll regen is nice at lower levels but becomes irrelevant higher up - somewhat so after stoicism, more so after torpor, and almost totally after replenishment. Iksar get a nice AC bonus though.<br />
<br />
In summary, unless you are very low level, I'd stick with what you chose as its not a big deal what race or stats you have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Reroll as an Ogre, put points into Sta and Wis equally.  If I were starting again I would go Ogre, that's the only change I would make.  Frontal Stun Immunity is worth the XP penalty - in levelling, there is no XP penalty for AA's</div></div><hr />

Kariza, I asked that same question of the crucible last year.  Take a look at this thread: http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=14406.  Basically the same answers you will see in this thread.... Gear will make up for those poorly placed starting points, but if your still low level, you can always re-roll.  Good luck!</div></div><hr />

My Iksar shaman's starting stats include 90 STA and 95 WIS.  If I could do it over I'd go with 80 STA and 115 WIS.  At level 56 I can self-buff my STA +95 points or something like that, while I can self-buff my WIS by +10 points.<br />
<br />
(edit- now that I think about it, it's even more than +95, if I add in the self-only melee buff.  I was just thinking of IoS and Riotous Health)<br />
<br />
(edit 2- just remembered that the greater bear form spell gives +10 WIS)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Niknak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">As ikky shm, I have gone mainly hp, then ac and wis, and my wis still only hits 250 with KEI.  I'm really glad I put all my starting stats into wis, and being Iksar I'm also the sexiest race on Norrath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">and being Iksar I'm also the sexiest race on Norrath.<br />
<br />
Um, yeah.  You know you play too much EQ when you find Iksar to be sexy.<br />
<br />
I made my BST alt an Ogre for the frontal stun immunity and I love it on him.<br />
<br />
With my shaman style I simply do not tank much and it would be a waste of time for me to be an Ogre.  Even when I solo I very rarely get stunned (probably because I solo critters that are barely dark blue...but anyways...I rarely solo and don't claim to be an uber soloist).  Ogres are also nice for the beefy starting stam - although I'm a barbarian and my stam maxes without any EP gear so I wouldn't say to go Ogre for the stam either.<br />
<br />
IF you plan to solo a lot or tank in the face it might be worth being an ogre.  Otherwise I don't think it's worth the xp or the ugliness hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">chanter illusions grant some strange abilities some times<br />
troll is the only one that grants regen...btw so do illusion pots :)<br />
barb/troll/ogre ALL grant Slam but you will have to make a new hotkey every time.<br />
vision is whatever the new race has.  <br />
<br />
troll illusion pots are my favorite, had a human monk who was a junkie for the things, slam+regen+night vision is great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Humlaor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">the Troll Illusion (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=592&amp;source=Live) , both as casted by enchanters and from potions only grants 1 point/tic of regen.  Not all that impressive imho.<br />
