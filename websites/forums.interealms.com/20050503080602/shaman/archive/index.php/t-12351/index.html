I could give a shiite what gets greyed and what doesn't, so long as it's consistent. But this isn't consistent. <br />

My next comment is. Will there be a paypal fund for your kids, their birthdays, their health insurance....Ect?<br />
<br />
Basicly what I'm saying is, why are you even considering starting a long term relationship with some one when you are insecure about your ability to purchase a sutable ring.<br />
DO NOT TAKE THIS AS A FLAME!<br />
People here seem to have supported you asking for money to buy a ring for the most part. I personaly think it is tacky, when I decide that the time is drawing near (God forbid I find a woman who will put up with my antics) for me to pop the question, you can bet the house that I'll at LEAST have enough of my money set aside to purchase a ring I think suits my lifestyle and her beauty.<br />
<br />
Basicly what I'm saying is, why do you feel the need to buy her a &quot;million dollar man&quot; ring when you may be a &quot;50k&quot; kind of guy in real life (I'm not saying thats what you are, you could be the president of the united states for all anyone here knows.). The point of the ring is not to show it off and be like &quot;oh thats SO big&quot;. Its supposed to be a token of everlasting love.<br />
<br />
My father used a onion ring for my mother, why? Cause thats all he could afford at the time. 3 months later down the road after eating only one meal a day every week, he bought her a real ring, one that proved his love in a not so sticky way.<br />
<br />
My over all thought with this post is, stop being so shallow. Why are you worried about the SMALLEST PART of the wedding? If you are truely worried about the money needed for your future bride. Start another fund for her dress, your tux, the flowers, the cake, the reception hall, the church, the pastor, the plain tickets, the meals, the rooms for people to stay in while it takes place...ECT...<br />
<br />
Or you can try it the family way, like my family has done each and every wedding. The aunts get together and make the wedding cake (their last one was a butterfly cake for my cousin. 4 levels tall, had mechanical butterflys on it that opened and closed their wings), The uncles and the fathers prep the place chosen by the bride for the reception. The cousins / nephews / neices / grandchildren help with babysitting and general upkeep of the entire family body. And the weddings themselves are either done by family members who have gotten wedding licences or close friends of the family that have wedding licences also. All in all I don't think a person in our family that has stayed with the &quot;Family constructed&quot; wedding has paid over 20k and I'm guessing its WAY lower than 20k also. The one time we DID have an out of family run wedding, well lets just say it wasn't worth what they paid for BUT it did get the job done in the long run!<br />
<br />
So, keep what I said in mind the next time you want to &quot;beg&quot; for funds. Its not how much money you spent that matters, its how much of your heart you gave to her.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This isn't an appropriate comment.  If your best friend came up to you and sayd &quot;Guess what Dude, I just proposed to Jenny!&quot; and you respond with, &quot;CONGRATS Man!  I'm really happy for you!  Do you think she'll screw around behind your back?  I hope you have lots of happy children and hopefully, none of them will get abducted and sexually abused.&quot;<br />
<br />
Either you are going to congratulate the man and let him deal with his own life, or just keep quiet.  The points you bring up are either board politics showing through or speculation on matters not appropriate to a congratulations thread.  It's Sunmoon's life and he should be thinking these things on his own, not having other people air potentially dirty laundry for him.  Please learn the difference between a congratulations thread and an advice wanted thread.</div></div><hr />

Solkain: What the heck is your problem??  The man share some happy info about a RL situation, and you degrade it.  Before you ask/rant, I am a happily married man with 3 kids.  You weren't saying anything that was untrue, about money and expenses.  The idea of having family help with the food for the wedding (and other such ideas) are good ones, but the way you put it was very inappropriate.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Solkain Braveheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Okay I was trying to be semi-indifferent, but i see how you all are. Sniffiling whining cry babies, you thought in the 1st place that you owe him money in real life because he hosted this message board. If he wanted money for it he should add pop up banners and adds. I'm certain people like EBworld wouldn't mind him adding a pop up from them, they might even pay him a bit of money.<br />
<br />
But No, all you saps that are proally no older than 11-17 all think that you owe him something. Wake up, he was BEGGING for money because his sorry behind is too shallow to realise there is more to a ring then the money involved in buying it. I doubt ANY of you older readers begged for your engagement ring, and when you did buy it with whatever money you had at the time. The pride gained from purchasing and then in turn giving away that ring you worked so hard to gain was great. now think, how much pride would you have in a ring you BEGGED for to get? You all are stuck in the material things again and not the actual emotion behind buying the ring.<br />
<br />
If he was to ask for a fund to keep the message boards alive I'd be fine with that. But he asked you to buy his ring for him in essence, so does that mean he wants you all to marry his girlfriend now?<br />

<br />
I'll address this driven one more time.. and the only reason I'm responding Solkain is because you are at least mature in the way you came across, unlike our good friend Soupy.<br />
<br />
1. I had enough to buy a very nice ring, a platinum ring with a .71 TCW diamond on it. With the extra money I received from ASKING, not BEGGING people to see if they could help, I was able to add a baguette on each side of the main diamond for added effect.<br />
<br />
2. It's not a matter of how big of a ring I could get, as I stated before, she'd be more than happy with a plain 14K gold ring on her finger. But do you still have a 19&quot; black and white TV? Do you drive a Yugo to work each day? Do you get your girlfriend (assuming you have one) one rose and a card each birthday or celebration because that's all it takes? No, and you'd be lying if you said anything else. We all want nicer things in this world and that isn't necessarily a bad thing.<br />
<br />
3. She knows I solicited help for the ring. I had no problem with telling her that and I'm sure she'll have no problem attesting to that. She also knows what I've done for this site and that leads to number 4.<br />
<br />
4. I've worked on this site and my others for almsot 4 years now. FOUR YEARS of doing it for absolutely no money, lots of damn work and thousands of hours (and a few headaches to boot.) All of this time (actually, I tried using UGO banners for a few months a couple of years ago) it has been entirely advertising-free and has continually been one of the premier EQ communities out there, if not the best. <br />
<br />
5. I've had 4 donation drives to cover costs of hosting, which up until this host have been almost 4 thousand dollars a year ($1950 every six months.) 4 times, I've come out, asked if people could donate to cover costs and each time I've been successful raising the money. At that time, I shut down the drive and all is well.<br />
<br />
6. The average age of this board is 26 years old, that's a fact. Well, according to the birthdays everyone has put in.<br />
<br />
7. The average donation has been about $15 and each drive, I get pretty much the same 200 people that send one in. Last drive, only 10% of those donations came from Shaman that I could tell.<br />
<br />
Now that you know all of that, will you still condemn me? I could have commercialized the hell out of this place like CastersRealm, Allakhazam's and the like had I wanted to make money. Did I? No. Am I contemplating closing these boards because of not wanting to deal with the issues of collecting money every 6 months, disrespectful users that take pot shots at me and disgruntled rejects with nothing better to do than waste my time? Yes.<br />
<br />
If I were in it for the money, I would have been gone a VERY long time ago.. why? Because I make NO MONEY from doing this. So, I ask for a little something back and I've had about 10, maybe 15 out of over 22,000 registered users and 50,000+ visitors each month, complain or try to make me out like a bad guy. Unfortunately, the vocal few of you really put a bad taste in my mouth.<br />
<br />
When I went to bed last night, I told my fiancee exactly what Soupy had posted and how absolutely crappy it made me feel. Well Soupy, you had your moment of making me feel bad for about 5 minutes until she talked to me. Then, I realized what a small, puny man you must be and what a wonderful woman and life I had ahead of me and I shrugged it all off. She told me how amazing it was I've stuck by this place for so long, what an awesome man I have been to deal with all of the trials and tribulations of doing so and how she loved me more than anything in the world.<br />
<br />
With that, think what you want, but I'm happy, she's happy and I won't let this issue bother me anymore. I'm sorry you may not agree, but I am not a bad person and I'll never doubt my decisions again.<br />
<br />
I'll post later tonight what a perfect proposal it was and the song I wrote for her for those interested. Ok, I feel much better now, thanks :)</div></div><hr />

while this is seemingly a public forum, remember that it is not - this is sunmoon's property.  his house, his rules.  america is a democracy true, but this is private property, and he has the right to do whatever he wants.  we are permitted to post here, it is not our RIGHT to post on this message board whatever we want.  IF this message board was public property then you could have an argument, but the basis of your argument is flawed - this is NOT a free speech issue.  Think of a message board in front of a church or some other establishment - that message board is the property of said entity, and they set the rules for what goes up there.<br />
<br />
as for him asking for a couple bucks, it is my opinion that he is certainly entitled to do this.  sunmoon is a professional who has been upkeeping this entire site as a courtesy to all of us.  is it so wrong that we be allowed to show our appreciation?  if you don't want to, the answer is simple - don't.  it should be painfully obvious for anyone who is a regular to interealms that sunmoon is not a money grubbing person who is looking to pad his pockets.  to say anything even close to that is to expose your own ignorance of the character of the man who has run this site for for FREE for oh, two and a half years.  <br />

I'm not saying anything about the money, just about banning someone for speaking out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">the money part wasn't directed at you Suddail, that was for others.<br />
<br />
as for banning others for speaking out, well, theres a good way to do things and a bad.  how often has someone been banned in the past couple years for their posts?  soupy just has gone way overboard lately.  way, way overboard, enough to raise the hackles on the back of my neck several times before.  that's ok to a point, people should be able to say what they want to say.  its HOW you say it that makes the man.  quite frankly, im sure if someone kept getting in your face you'd wanna punch him too...i know I would.  being fair though i can see your side, and i won't condemn you for your opinion.  i just disagree that it was a bad thing, it's been a long time coming - and i encourage you and everyone else to think about how you deliver your own opinions in this forum, to avoid nasty situations that could arise.  sometimes its just better to agree to disagree and leave it at that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Well, here is how the night progressed. Warning, mushy stuff ahead for you manly men ;)<br />
<br />
I've told her for awhile that I would write a song for her. On our first date, I strummed out a song for her and sang and she was mesmerized.<br />
<br />
So, I told her I'd like to go down to the beach at sunset to play her the song I wrote. As I left for the beach, it turns out a huge accident had occured, shutting down the main thoroughfare to the beach and I was visibly upset. She said we could go to another place, but I insisted it be at this one spot (you'll see why in a moment.) Well, as luck and destiny would have it, we made it to the beach (after a big detour,) with the sun seemingly inches from the ocean. We found a great spot between two dunes and out of earshot and I sat down to play.<br />
<br />
I have a problem when I sing and play.. my eyes water, yet it's not crying. This time it was crying and it started after the first verse. She was crying as I sang the song and when I got to the end, she just sort of stood there with mouth agape, as if wondering what I just said. <br />
<br />
Here is the song I wrote for guitar.. no snickers please :)<br />
<br />
E<br />
There was a time<br />
A<br />
When I looked upon the sea<br />
E<br />
And I'd sit and wonder<br />
A<br />
Will it always be just me.<br />
<br />
E<br />
Every day I sought<br />
A<br />
An answer to my prayers<br />
E<br />
Yet I never thought<br />
A<br />
I'd see you standing there.<br />
<br />
<br />
(Chorus)<br />
G		D	<br />
You came into my world<br />
Am		      C<br />
And showed me how to love<br />
G		D<br />
Now every step I take<br />
Am		      C<br />
I'm surrounded by your love<br />
<br />
E<br />
Now I find<br />
A<br />
That whenever I look and see<br />
E<br />
A path to choose in my life<br />
A<br />
I want you there with me<br />
<br />
(Chorus)<br />
<br />
E<br />
Now I look ahead<br />
A<br />
To see our destiny<br />
E<br />
And all that can be said<br />
A		E<br />
Is will you marry me...<br />
<br />
<br />
As she just sits there with the sun setting perfectly and the light flawless, I reach into my pocket and pull out the ring. I asked her if she would marry me out of song this time and it took her 15 seconds to finally be able to speak. I was trembling so bad from the excitement but managed to get it on her finger.<br />
<br />
We held each other for a few minutes crying our eyes out, just basking in how wonderful the moment was. I pulled her up, almost forgetting my guitar and told her, &quot;Well, there's 15 of our friends across the street with 5 bottles of Moet.&quot; She stares at me incredulously and we head to the perfect little place across the street where we all spent the next 3 hours reminiscing and having a great time. I managed to play my song a few times in the middle of the place and tears flowed aplenty.<br />
<br />
It was simply amazing to me how it all turned out. It may sound simple, but I couldn't believe how complicated it all was getting the ring, gathering all my friends, writing the song, getting to the place, trying to ensure the integrity of it all... still, it was an awesome experience.<br />
<br />
And here, my friends, is the ring you helped me get and she now proudly wears. Hehe, she even just said, &quot;Thank you EQ!! :)&quot;<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://interealms.com/thering.jpg&quot;&gt;<br />
<br />
I can't thank everyone enough who has been here for these past few years. I've learned so much from the people here and hope I've helped a few along the way as well. Also, thank you to those people who donated to help make this day a bit sweeter... I really and truly appreciate it.<br />

Mojokyn just did what every bad moderator on the internet does. He sees an opinion that doesn't sit well with him, and he erases it. My opinion was not against any of your posted rules, it was not a flame. Yet it was critical of Sunmoon, and it was deleted. Sure, it is well within his &quot;rights&quot; as a moderator, but do you really want mods removing every opinion that differs from their own?<br />
<br />
This is what I wrote:<br />
<br />
I do not visit this message board often, but am I to understand that Sunmoon posted a solicitation for funds on this message board to help him buy an engagement ring?<br />
<br />
If this is true, I am speechless. Have you no shame?<br />
<br />
As I'm sure you are aware, there are many different EQ-related boards out there, all of which have mods/owners who deal with the exact same issues that this board does. Not one to my knowledge has ever asked for money from its members for personal reasons (and I frequent a good amount of them). Well, until now. I find it degrading, and regardless of how he phrased his request, he did what is clearly contrary to the mores of the message board community - ask to be paid for what he does here above and beyond expenses. In my book, that's begging. <br />
<br />
Having said that, I realize that this is a free country, and people are free to send him as much money as they like. I'm just flabbergasted that someone had the audacity to ask.</div></div><hr />

I have spent alot of time reading message boards(tho rarely posting), and this is one of the best.  It pleases me no end that the person who made this board happen has had something so good happen to him.<br />

Why does it bother you what the members of this board do? It's not as if you are being asked to put your hand in your pocket. I can't believe the number of people who have decided to leave their own boards just to come here and complain about what is happening on ours. You even had the afterthought to add this line and then still post!<br />

<br />
Then another friend of mine was going to propose to his girl. He had the living room all set up, lights turned down low, soft music playing, went into a little speech about how they first met, was about to bring the ring out...when all the sudden their dogs went ape****, knocked everything over and attacked the cats.<br />
<br />
Grats to ya Sunmoon. My recommendation: stick with your guitar playing, your good friends and your wonderful soon-to-be wife and tell all these anal obsessive whiny geeks here to go to suck your paypal cock and take this board down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not quarelling with his &quot;powers&quot; to ban people or to do what he wants on this board. He can change every other word on every post to &quot;nazi&quot; or he can delete every post that does not offer the proper homage to himself. He can ban every user whose name starts with the letter &quot;T&quot;, or he can shut down the site until he gets enough Paypal donations to take a weekend trip because you all are stressing him out. He can do what he wants.<br />
<br />
But is it right? <br />
<br />
Every other EQ message board out there has owners/mods who are unpaid volunteers. If they no longer find the work fulfilling, they step down, and someone else takes over. They do the work because they like the game, and want to give back, not because somewhere down the road they are going to get a fat payday. <br />
<br />
Look, this is just one man's opinion. Feel free to disregard it as you see fit. And hey, if you are so strongly supportive of his right to solicit you for money, maybe you'll get many more chances in the future to pay him. [Wedding expenses, honeymoon, house down payment, car repairs, etc]<br />
<br />
As for the proposal story, it was sweetly done. I wish you success in your marriage.</div></div><hr />
