<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For my own personal interest I've been trying to work out what has the greatest effect on my total &quot;pool.&quot; Hp? Or Wis?<br />
<br />
Started small at 24... just want someone else to look at it and tell me if I'm doing something totally stupid (and I don't doubt it).<br />
<br />
Math for conversions based on level 24.<br />
<br />
HP-&gt;Wis - Cannibalize<br />
50hp = 20m = 5wis -&gt; 10hp = 1wis<br />
<br />
Wis-&gt;Hp - Healing<br />
15wis = 60m = 90hp -&gt; 6hp = 1wis<br />
<br />
So does this mean that at level 24;<br />
14hp &gt; 7hp + 1wis &gt; 2wis<br />
<br />
?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Winsome Dove</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You forgot one little thing HP can be used any many other ways then your mana.  Reason the Shaman class would want more HP's is because you can also can be used effectively while soloing, and turn it into mana.  If you wanted more mana obviously +wis and +mana items would be better for you if you want to go all out on mana.<br />
<br />
But shamans like tank, take hits, survive AE's, and other things while soloing and hp also affects it as does mana so it works for both thing, but usually with +HP items comes a good amount of AC on the item which also affects our tanking ability making it better, and valuing the HP and AC affects it all.<br />
<br />
You will be a more efficent shaman keeping up hp ac and your mana pool(a little).<br />
<br />
So I think your a little confused on why shamans would value the HP on items more then the Wis, obviously +wis and +mana again would best on your mana pool, the math just dosn't balance out because HP and Mana are 2 totally differnt things .<br />
<br />
But yes your Math looks right but you can't compare the 2.<br />
<br />
:)<br />
Edited a statement...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If the math is right then...If you wanted more mana obviously +wis and +mana items would be better for you if you want to go all out on manaIs false.<br />
<br />
At lower levels, like 24, you will get a greater amount of mana (even if it takes a little while to convert it) from 14hp than you will from an item that provides 2wis.<br />
<br />
So at these sorts of levels an item like a 6/65 ring would inactuality provide almost 11wis.<br />
<br />
I view my mana pool as '| MANA | HP |' and my HP's as '| HP | MANA |' because I can effectively swap one to the other and back again. Maybe not as efficiently as a necro, but probably much quicker.<br />
<br />
Obviously there's a lot of other things to Being a Shaman 101, but for this much I'm just working the &quot;pool&quot; (dr00d-wise).<br />
<br />
Just as an example, say the above is true. What would be better?<br />
<br />
10AC, 4wis?<br />
or<br />
10AC, 20hp?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Winsome Dove</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yea, but 6ac/65hp ring is like 500 pp for x amonut of mana and a 2 wis ring which is like 4pp is only x amount of mana depending on your twinking is what mana you'll get if you are not saying you are though. At lower levels you have to think of the item value per lvl or so say ? I can't put it into words like a lvl 24 wouldn't go back between 6ac/65hp and 2wis it would be equivalent is the best I can explain it.<br />
<br />
With the 500pp you could get Y ring that has +50mana and +2wis which would result in more mana.<br />
<br />
At any level really 10ac 20hp ring would be better then 10ac 4wis.<br />
<br />
Edited Typo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Buuut... at level 24;<br />
20hp converts to 2wis.<br />
4wis converts to 24hp.<br />
<br />
So... 4wis &gt; 20hp (mathematically)<br />
<br />
The gap only gets smaller from then on, to the point where at level 58 (final cannibalize)<br />
<br />
HP-&gt;Wis - Cannibalize III or IV<br />
74hp = 39m = 3.5wis -&gt;<br />
148hp = 81m = 7wis -&gt; 21hp = 1wis<br />
<br />
Wis-&gt;Hp - Superior Healing<br />
21wis = 250m = 525hp -&gt; 25hp = 1wis<br />
<br />
Under those circomstances;<br />
10AC, 20hp == 10AC, 1wis<br />
10AC, 4wis == 10AC, 100hp<br />
(provided wis &lt; 200)<br />
<br />
I'd work it out with Chloroblast but I'm not sure if the heal penalty applies to that. Little help...?<br />
<br />
This is assuming you don't have Canni5 yet, because then you NEED the HPs to be able to use it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Winsome Dove</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well yes but you can't compare the two and have it effect your mana pool by it because they are 2 compeletly differnt things like comparing Spells vs Equipment (or that one topic about how melees get upgrade or something.)<br />
<br />
yes and mathematically speaking on those rings you are correct.<br />
<br />
I'm not very good at math but wis and +mana will add to your mana pool then hps.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Beeg:  <br />
Couple things.  Its been a few years since I've been out of college, but I can't seem to follow your first two 'equations'<br />
<br />
1) according to the mana calc over at Castersrealm, at lvl 24 1 Wis = 5 mana.<br />
<br />
So, Canni 1 is 50hps for 20 mana.<br />
4 Wisdom would get you the same amount of mana.<br />
Therefore 50hps = 4 Wis.  So each Wis = 12.5 hps.<br />
<br />
<br />
Healing at lvl 24 is 60 Mana for 94 HPs.  It takes 12 Wis to generate the Mana for that spell.  <br />
So you could claim that 12 Wis = 94 hps, and each Wis would then be worth 7.8 hps.<br />
<br />
The thing that is causing problems (I think) is that these are one way conversions...you can't claim that they are equivalent...I don't have ANY Cannibilzation spell that will give me 60 mana for 94 HPs.<br />
<br />
So to convert Hps to mana, use the value of 12.5 hps per Wis.<br />
An 6ac 65hp Ring is NOT 11 Wisdom, but more like a 5 Wis Ring.<br />
<br />
To consider how many Hps a Wis Item will allow you to heal use the 7.8 hps per Wis value.<br />
<br />
Hypothetical example:<br />
<br />
I have 100 hps in a pair of earrings.  If I want to Canni that away, I get 40 pts of mana back...If I immediatly turn around and heal myself of the 100 pts of damage, I spend 60 mana points to do it, for a net gain of -20.  Whoo!  neat party trick.  I would be better off with a pair of +1 Wis earrings if I did this.  Those 2 Wis points would allow me to heal about 15 pts of damage, much better than -20.<br />
  (NOTE:  I said *hypothetical*...don't flame me pointing out how silly this is).<br />
<br />
If you examine the numbers, you will see that compared to healing, Canni is very inefficient...and that is part of the problem with the HP/AC over Wis argument.  A casual inspection will show that a +6 Wis ring adds 54 Mana  to my mana pool (at lvl 45) but a 55 Hp ring (the platinum equivalent) is barely enough for 1 cast of canni = 20 Mana.  <br />
<br />
This is why you can't convince the average player that you aren't a raving fool when you mention your Wis is only around 130.  :)<br />
<br />
However, the real key comes into play when you include regen, other players healing you, meditate, etc.  Most casters sit at 100 health with no way to turn it into mana.  No matter how inefficent we are, we still have that option.  So we can be recovering both bars at once.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sabiniz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmmm. I'm working on trying to obtain the 10th coldain ring, spirit wracked cord.<br />
<br />
Got a vindi bp so 100 hp + 15 sta . (15sta)(3persta)= 45 hp <br />
<br />
so 145 hp+130hp+130ish hp on wracked cord... = 405 hp.<br />
<br />
how much wis is 405 hp is what im wondering, im not a math wiz or anything :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It does, but I'm still trying to understand.<br />
<br />
I myself sit at 130wis, but I was sitting around and wondering why I didn't have more. It's not like having more mana would be a bad thing as long as I didn't sacrifice AC.<br />
<br />
I can see an arguement for AC/wis but the AC/Hp just doesn't strike me as making mathematical sense (I'm an engineer... so if it doesn't make sense in maths then it just don't make sense).<br />
<br />
See, like you said, we have the option to convert HP-&gt;mana even if it isn't that efficient. However, ANY additional HP regen works out to be additional mana regen. That's a definate plus. The biggest I can see, and the fact we can be regenning Hp while walking, running, jumping, casting, whatever is an even bigger one. There aren't many other casters that can boast the same (I think?).<br />
<br />
So protecting that regen is number one on the list. That means AC. More AC = less damage = less impact on regen.<br />
<br />
Once it gets past that I start to wonder what's of more use. HP or wis? Which lead me down this long and silly trail in the first place.<br />
<br />
I realise that HP would be more important for surviving sustained AE and avoiding low HP summons... but I'm not anywhere NEAR that sort of stage yet, and when I am I'll likely be a resist junkie because it's like AC vs Spells.<br />
<br />
Until that point (another 10 - 15 levels), max HP doesn't really make a difference. Like everyone says, it's not the pool that matters but the rate of regeneration. With 1500HP I won't be regenning any faster than I would with 1000HP. Sure, I could sit at 500 more hp but it doesn't really do anything other than make it take longer for me to die. Not that that's a bad thing. :) Getting the mana to do that damage to a mob would be a lot easier. VotS is 453 damage for 160m as an example. That 160 mana works out to be 18wis at level 45. The only downside I see to that is 16wis can be a tad hard to find at level 45 without losing a nice chuck of AC from dr00d gear (ick).<br />
<br />
I'm trying to see the point of NOT having 200 wis. I saw posts on the old board where some people said &quot;I love my 200 wis&quot; and others said &quot;It's useless. I have 160 and get on fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Warriors and such need the extra HP to benefit more from CHeals. I don't see any other benefit except more lee-way in soloing (higher binded HP). Personally I've don't get CHealed. Get hit for 200, have to make up 200 hp from regen. During this time I can't canni (below my preferred threshhold), so I'm relying on my pool til my HP and mana catch up and everything is peachy again. Maybe I'm unlucky and don't score freebie heals. <br />
<br />
It's like how I see posts saying &quot;Don't HP buff unless there's a cleric. Just gives you more HP to heal. No more efficient.&quot;<br />
<br />
And sorry for boring everyone with my math. I'm just trying to make it make sense. It didn't at first (see: raving lunatic) so I ran some numbers by figuring it'd become clear then... but that only seemed to blur further, so I gave up and tried to ask the people &quot;in the know.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'll just shut up and keep my AC/Wis to myself. ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Beeg:  Believe it or not, you have (in a rather long and strange post) hit the nail on the head...<br />
<br />
Everyone (and I'm not referring to the Crucible specifically, just EQ message boards in general) likes to talk about how different the 50+ game is.  Everytime you try to make a point and back it up with evidence, people always say &quot;yeah, but the post 50+ is sooo  different, it's not even the same game&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Sub 50th lvl strategies and equipment don't always work for the high end game.  Everyone likes to point that out...but no one ever mentions the reverse:  Post 50th Strategies don't always work for the low end game.  <br />
<br />
Without massive regen, and the spells to convert it to mana, youre gonna spend all your time just casting Canni I... Gobbling up 1200 hps 50 points at a time is going to take *forever*<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally, at lvl 43, My wis is slowy dropping from 178 to around 156, as I increase my AC and HPs.  I don't plan on letting it drop below 150.    I am getting rid of +6 Wis rings for AC rings, but I wouldn't trade an AC / Wis item for AC / HPs.  I only have Canni I so it's painfully slow to convert my 1100 odd hps.<br />
