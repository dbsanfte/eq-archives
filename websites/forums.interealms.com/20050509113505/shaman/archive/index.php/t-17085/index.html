<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rbeccahv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am very new to EQ, been playing 1 month max. I am now level 20 and have managed to make it this far. My question is, can you guys help me make sure I understand my role. I have figured out that people like my SLOW, they like my buffs as well. Is this my main role? I need some basic tips. Anything really, I just want to be the best Shaman I can. So don't be afraid to treat me like a child. <br />
<br />
Thanks guys/gals,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Lets see, what you have to look forward to:<br />
<br />
slowing and buffing are going to be your main duties, so with that in mind learn how to canii dance, there should be a thread on this topic, note you dont get cannibalization until level 24 - but take some time and play with the dance to get a good grasp of mana regen this will make you a very useful group member.<br />
<br />
After the buffs are dished out and the slows are flowing and you have excessive mana usually after the 3rd or 4th kill in a group situation you now have the option to nuke, or dot, or melee or all three.  Just make sure that you keep a good supply of mana on hand.<br />
<br />
Your three options, nuking, its quick and dirty and well not that effective until the higher levels.<br />
<br />
Dots:  those are gravy, don't cost alot of mana for the amount of damage they do and the bonus is that you can canni back the used mana before they wear off.<br />
<br />
Melee:  if combined with the dots and the canni dance will add a slight amount of damage but not that effective especially at higher levels.<br />
<br />
Learn how to control agro - that is how ticked off the mobs are at you, don't slow then cast two dot's cause the mob will stick to you like white on rice and could get you killed.<br />
<br />
And finally as to gear, work your way up to around 200 wisdom then get as many hps and mana gear as you can.<br />
<br />
other than that welcome to the family.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In my experience, a lower level shaman's primary role is healer. You're usually the main healer in a group, if not the only one. You just got Healing at 19, and can fill this role very well. Your buffs and slows are secondary, for now. If you actually by some miracle are grouped with a cleric, then you can do more slowing, buffing, nuking, etc... But, really, the best thing you have for a group right now, by far, is the Healing spell. If you're healing, figure out by experiment if it's more efficient for you to slow a mob, and then heal, or just heal. It'll depend on the mob, and on your tank. Your general goal (besides having fun!) should be to keep the melee classes and pets in your group doing damage (and thus earning exp) as much of the time as possible. <br />
<br />
At 24 you get some great spells - regeneration, cannibalize, envenomed breath, frost strike. You get major bonuses to your grouping AND solo'ing abilities. <br />
<br />
At 29 you get Greater healing, Tagar's Insects (your first slow that makes a major difference in mob damage output), and quickness. You're a really good healer/buffer at this stage. In fact, I think healing and buffing is still your primary role in a group, until L 39, when you get Togor's Insects. That's the first GREAT slow spell, and is also about the time your heal spell really doesn't keep up with monster damage well at all. At that point your primary role becomes debuffing, with healing a secondary (but sometimes you're still the only healer in a group!) role.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Your main role is to be slower. High level mobs must be slowed or their damage output will be too high.<br />
<br />
Secondly you are either main healer och backup healer depending on if you have cleric/druid.<br />
<br />
Also you will be buffing a lot. HP Talismans and later on Harnessing of Spirit and Focus. Also casting speedbuffs to increase damage output from your friends.<br />
<br />
Your key to being a successful shaman is to know how to use Cannibalize correctly. If you keep regen up and cannibalize when you are not on full mana you will be much more efficient.<br />
<br />
Also a shaman is a very efficient soloer with dot spells and root or with pet.<br />
<br />
Focus on getting HP gear and focus on getting WIS/Mana gear secondly. HP is both life and a mana buffer with Cannibalize.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hail and welcome, etc.<br />
<br />
Wrote this up some time ago, still pretty valid imo:<br />
<br />
First, HP&gt;AC&gt;wisdom gear-wise. Don't buy wisdom and be a druid.<br />
Second, there are alot of running jokes here (ie CHA&gt;all, in teh face, TIME slows down)<br />
Third, use search, read stickies.<br />
<br />
Now an old post of mine summing up the early life of a Shammy:<br />
<br />
 Ok here is the conventional wisdom-<br />
<br />
lvl 1 - 24 You're a weak tank that can kinda heal and sorta DoT. Stay in teh face and tank away (not that you really have any choice). Yes, you can root/rot and kite but your a shammy not a druid Play around kiting and root/rot for variety but stay up close and personal to build Defense up. That sounds kinda negative but it's not so bad because all the utility goodies we get makes life easier than a pure tank/non-pet caster at those levels.<br />
<br />
lvl 25-34 Ok you now have regen, can 1 and quickness. Wee! You still tank in teh face, root/rot some and continue to practice some kiting. Learn how to regen/cannabalize to minimize downtime. You can learn how to slow. DoTs improve. You're almost there!<br />
<br />
Lvl 34-45 Dude you're getting a pet! Let's all repeat together TANK IN TEH FACE. Build up your defense, you will need it !! Your lil' buddy will be doggie burgers if he tanks. Set up the pet BEHIND MoB (no parries dodges etc) and let him nibble away. You can also pet kite now- same theory except you run not tank. Don't kite unless your defense is way up (should be 200 at 40) I'm all of lvl 41 and its 196- damn thing won't go up. But I digress.<br />
<br />
Pets are nice as a low-manna DoT and sacrifice if things get too hairy ( sorry bout that dogdog). I sacrifice lots of doggies.<br />
<br />
At 39 you get a slow that is actually worth a damn so use it. That's why the defensive skills are so important, at higher levels MoBs really hate slowers. If resisted they will pound the crap outa ya.<br />
<br />
At 45 you get the JBB. Well, you do if you're rich.<br />
<br />
It will be a while until you need more info.<br />
<br />
I'm a really casual player so I solo 90% of the time. This works so well for me it's kinda boring. I never level up efficiently cause slaughtering the same dark blue MoB x100 &lt; getting my ass handed to me by something I shouldn't try .<br />
<br />

Who still ain't 60 'cause of that stupid 2-box monk I'm working on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I wrote this during lunch and I’m afraid it’s both rambling and long-winded, but I’ll toss it out anyway for whatever its worth.<br />
<br />
<br />
I soloed my way up to the mid thirties.  I’d buff myself, including haste, slow the mob, dot the mob and then beat it to death.  When I got my first pup I’d have him guard the camp and pull mobs to him.  While I tanked the mob my spirit pup would bite its butt.  <br />
<br />
About level 36 I started grouping with a ranger and a cleric.  With those two in the group, and whoever else joined up with us, my main job was to keep everyone buffed and the mobs slowed.  This worked out very well till I hit about 55.  Then I started grouping with a warrior, necromancer and cleric on a regular basis.  Again my job was to keep everyone buffed and to slow down the mobs that were by now putting out a lot of damage.  Thankfully I started getting group buffs, which really helped speed up the buffing process.  I’m also thankful I’ve never had to play main healer.<br />
<br />
I would still like the option to solo, but I feel I’ve about seen the last of my solo and melee days at 61.  I’ve found one spot I can successfully solo.  I can get 1% AA xp per kill, which isn’t bad, but I must admit that LDoN adventures have kind of spoiled me.  Solo xp seems even slower than it used to be.  I can still take a number of hits when meleeing in a group without worrying about it, especially if I can get Torpor off, but I’m so much more effective as a caster I may as well hang up my Witchdoctor’s Cudgel.  <br />
<br />
In my opinion the strength of a shaman lies in a group.  If you really want to solo I’m sure you can manage it, but your skills will really shine in a group.  Your ability to slow down a mob’s attacks and speed up the attacks of your group will make a huge difference in what you all can and cannot fight.  Playing a shaman, or at least playing a shaman well, is an ongoing learning experience.  <br />
<br />
You need to learn to canni dance to make the most of your manna regeneration ability.  In short, your manna increases every six seconds and you gain more when you’re sitting down.  When your medding you want to cast cannibalize during that six second period so you’ll get your natural manna regeneration along with what you get from your canni spell.  So you watch your manna bar.  As soon as your manna increases you stand, cast canni and sit back down.  If you do it right you’ll be sitting when its time for the next manna increase and its as if you never stood up.  You can set up a hot button to make this easier.  And when you save up enough coins for a mount, which you can only use in outdoor zones, you won’t even have to worry about standing up, just press the canni button over and over again.<br />
<br />
You need to learn when to slow and when to DoT so that you get aggro as little as possible.  When I was grouped with a ranger I never had to worry about when to slow.  I could slow a mob as soon as it got within range.  If it came running after me the ranger would snare it and the mob would forget all about me.  Without someone to snare or cast some other spell to really tick off the mob you have to be more careful, especially in places like the plains.  Those creatures hit really hard so you may have to wait until the tank has dropped the mob to 90% health before slowing it.  If you have the manna to spare for DoTs, assuming the mobs live long enough to make casting a DoT worthwhile, don’t do so right after casting slow or you’re very likely to have a mob chewing on various parts of your anatomy.  And when you do have a mob chowing down on you, and it will happen, don’t go running around screaming like a little girl.  If it’s the mob the tank is beating on, give the tank a chance to pull it off you.  They can’t do that if your running up and down the zone.  If you have adds attacking you, root can be your best friend.<br />
<br />
You’ll need to learn, to some extent, how other classes are played.  A good example of this is the necromancer.  I cast Torpor on any non-melee that needs healing during combat.  But you may not need to do that with a necromancer.  They have spells that can suck the life from a mob and heal themselves at the same time.  Though at higher levels a necromancer may be doing so many other things with his or her manna that they may still appreciate being healed.  <br />
<br />
And you’ll need to learn certain tricks to make your job easier.  Since buffing is such a big part of being a shaman, it’s handy to know when to refresh those buffs.  Group buffs are easy since you see them fading from your own character.  But casting something like haste on myself, for example, is a waste of manna since I’ll be sitting on my fuzzy kitty butt.  So what you do is cast haste and other such buffs on your pet first.  When the buff is dropping from your pet its time to cast it on the melees in your group.  With the new pet buff window this will be even easier.  It’s amazing how many time’s I’ve gotten compliments on my timing because of this. *grins*<br />
<br />
Okay, that’s more than enough rambling from me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rbeccahv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">WOW, thanks for the nice replies guys. I really expected to get flamed.<br />
<br />
So, someone explain canni dance? I know what canni is, but whats this dancing.. how's it done...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The dance!<br />
<br />
Every six seconds, you regenerate mana and HP.<br />
<br />
How much hit points you regen depends on your buffs, equipment, race, etc.<br />
<br />
How much mana you regen depends also on buffs and equipment.<br />
<br />
When you sit, you regenerate more health on those &quot;tics&quot; every 6 seconds, and more importantly, your med skill kicks in and you regenerate way more mana.<br />
<br />
Canni dancing is the process of standing and sitting and casting canni in order to both canni and get sitting regen and meditation bonuses.<br />
<br />
So....sit down.  Wait for your health and mana to go up (you can see the little bar move, of your hp number go up), then get up and cast canni.  Sit down again, and you'll get the next meditation tic.  Repeat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly.<br />
<br />
I have set up hotbuttons so i can cast/sit/stand with just a few buttons.<br />
<br />
Sit, wait for 6 second tick to update your HP/Mana. After tick, you quickly stand, cast canni and sit, wait for next tick. Repeat.<br />
<br />
You gain mana from medding while cast cannibalize without loosing the med bonus for sitting.<br />
<br />
Later when you get a horse, you can sit all the time since being on horseback always counts as sitting.<br />
<br />
Also keep your regeneration spell up all the time. To increase your healing and use the surplus for cannibalizing.<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind that sitting will generate aggro, so if you start dancing right after landing a slow, you might get hit on. So be careful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>jablek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">for the canni dancing thing, i made a hot key that goes something like this....<br />
Line 1: /sit off<br />
Line 2: /cast # (whatever slot canni is in)<br />
Line 3: /pause 12<br />
Line 4: /sit on<br />
<br />
yes i am lazy and have it all on one button but its easier for me and works just as good if not better than doing everything manually :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>doqtir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">One thing I didn't see mentioned was 'slow positioning', for lack of a better phrase. While not extremely important (unless grouped with a rogue perhaps) at lower levels, it's something you'll want to practice and ingrain into your routine. <br />
<br />
Basically, slow positioning is just keeping the mob's position relative to the main tank the same while you slow. The MT's primary job (besides holding agro) is to position the mob. In group situations this may mean giving the rogue a back to stab at while in raid encounters he/she may need to back the mob into a corner, push it, etc. Our job is to stay within melee range (no running around) AND stand directly behind the MT until they have regain agro from our slow. As you grow more comfortable with different mobs (in different zones), you'll get a feel for how close you need to be. Ideally you want to be behind the MT and at max melee distance. Mob agro is based on a couple of things, but proximity is the one you can control directly. Again, with some practice you'll be able to step in and slow, take a couple of hits and back slowly away allowing the MT to use his proximity to regain agro.  <br />
<br />
At any rate, that's my 2cp. Probably not very coherent (12 hours of dealing with idiots), but hopefully you get the point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">When I slow, I just stand like right under the mob. It'll turn and swing at me but not go anywhere.<br />
<br />
Doing stuff like this saves raids, where positioning is the most important thing (Reef of Coirnav anyone?)<br />
<br />
Also, remember to keep your defense skill as high as possible. Don't be afraid to let your pet tank in a pinch (root the mob and back up) if things get hairy, but for the most part you should try to tank as much as possible so your dodge and defense abilites stay maxed.<br />
<br />
Something I haven't seen mentioned here is Stoicism. Starting at level 40, live in dulak and group there until you get your Empty Flask (it drops off Drunken Pirates). Check the spells forum for a quest walkthrough. This spell is like a mini torpor, is great for healing back damage you've done to yourself via cannibalize, or non melees (or even melees during downtime).<br />
<br />
And don't be afraid to try new things. I used to hate Main Healing, and had trouble even in Tier 2 planes, but now I can usually keep a tank alive in the elementals (Well, not at Castle 2 in PoFire) without any problems.  Usually works better with a knight tanking so you can slow on incoming though :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Most of the basics have been covered. I just want to emphasize what dogtir wrote. Stay near the MT when casting slow so as to not cause the mob to move away from him/her. Mobs running around, ping-ponging aggro is BAD. Avoid it at all costs. Now, if a caster or cleric gets aggro, it's beneficial to cast &quot;slow/cripple/high aggro spell&quot; so that the mob will lose interest in them and come to you. Or if there are adds, use those spells to get the add's attention so that you can run a ways from the group and root-park the mob so it can't damage anyone. To reiterate my main point, though, do NOT ping-pong aggro. Stay NEAR the MT when slowing. It's a good habit to start early. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
ps. You don't get the spell &quot;cripple&quot; until later levels so insert the level appropriate spell of that line (melee debuff - ac/agi/str debuff) in its place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">On incoming I would suggest a slow and if it doesn't land them malo it...then slow..then do whatever the heck you feel like doing<br />

Please do not panic if you die alot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">As a shaman your role is to fill the spots that need filling in your group.  Heal, slow, crowd control, even extra damage - no other class is as equipped to round out a group and compensate for their weaknesses as you are.  Try new things, learn as much as you can about other classes' abilities, strengths, and weaknesses and you'll get &quot;wow, how did you DO that?!&quot;... all the time.<br />
<br />
In an emergency, the things that you do at the beginning of the encounter will turn the tide.  Often, people won't notice or realize what you've done.  Just try to learn from every dirt nap you take - there's almost always something you can do, as your levels increase and your spellbook rounds out.  Get well acquainted with Lucy http://lucy.fnord.net/  and make sure to know what each spell does as you get it.</div></div><hr />
