<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Glauri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have this AA, and all the other pet AA. I make a pet, buff it, suspend it, then log off EQ. When I return, pet is gone. I thought this was supposed to hold the pet for me until I return?<br />

I tried /petition. Should have found some other way to waste my time :( I wrote a /bug report, but they refuse to refund my AA for an ability that does not work.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions at all?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I dont think the whole suspend minion was intended to work that way.  I was under the impression that it only allowd you to summon, buff and then suspend the pet untill you needed it, unless you did log in which case just like all the other summoned items it goes poof.. I could be mistaken.</div></div><hr />

I don't have this AA yet (but will as soon as I ding 67).  As I understand it, you can suspend, then zone; and you will keep your suspended pet.  Or you can log while you have a pet, and then return later to have the pet waiting for you.  <br />
<br />
But you cannot suspend the pet and then camp.  This will cause the pet to poof. :(<br />

<br />
I logged on for the first time in 3 days yesterday - and after using Suspend Minion Jobaner was waiting for me, complete with buffs from the group I was in. <br />
<br />
The main problem I've found is actually remembering to suspend the wolf before logging - I've lost several sets of proccing weapons that way!  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Persistent minion is supposed to allow you to suspend your pet, camp, come back at another time and be able to unsuspend the same pet again. <br />
This, however, seemes to be bugged. Sometimes it works, others it doesn't. I don't know for sure yet why it doesn't work sometimes, but the last time it actually worked, the pet had no items on it when I suspended it.<br />
Maybe giving pets no rent items makes them poof when the items would theoretically poof(i.e. 30 mins)?<br />
<br />
Regardless of what it is, this should have been on the FF list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes as someone said make sure you suspend it before camping out. I keep having to resuit the pup because i forget. Ive also had times when i come back and dont take the pup out again right away and have zoned and than was nothing there. <br />
<br />
But most of the time when i suspend a pet and bring him back after Ive camped out and suspended him he's been there. Just ironing out my own bugs before i can figure if its bugged or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My guess for the not coming back bug is you suspended then zoned then camped. <br />
<br />
I dont have it yet so can't tell you for sure but that would be my guess. <br />
<br />
Try suspending right before you camp. A good idea would be to make a hot key for camp if you normally do use a hot key and add suspend alt activation into it. <br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I like the presistent minion AA but am dissapointed that suspended pet sometimes/often doest't come back.  I am now certain that is is not me  forgetting to suspend him before logging.  I'm wondering if that happens when pet has no rent items? <br />
<br />
We need to keep track of how often and under what circumstances the pet doesn't return.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Azadark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The only time I have ever lost a suspended pet is if I die. He has always been there when I log in the next day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Glauri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We need to keep track of how often and under what circumstances the pet doesn't return.<br />
<br />
I log with a fully buffed pet with no norent items, and he is gone when I return. I am going to try to do this with and w/o the &quot;pet&quot; icon open: i.e., once or twice with the pet suspended and a huge hole in my UI where he normally is, and a few times with the &quot;no pet&quot; portion of the UI there. Maybe that matters? <br />
<br />
I know that it is not because I have zoned. I make and suspend him in Nexus, then camp. I log in next day, still in Nexus, and he has poofed :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have persistent minion, sometimes I've seen it happen where I unsuspend a pet, die, and it lets me re-unsuspend him again. Not supposed to do that; I think it's a bit buggy.<br />
<br />
But yes you are supposed to be able to camp with a persistent pet, that much always works for me. No rent items that he is weilding do not poof.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You mean with this AA you can camp out and pet is there on return but you cant zone and keep a pet suspended ?<br />
Was thinking of getting this AA but if thats the case i think i wont bother.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have no hard facts Wulf. Just thinking about possible bugs. <br />
<br />
I don't have the aa yet. And I am rather rough on mutt. He doesnt live very long. (Sigh)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The oow Presistent Minion AA does let you zone with pet suspended.  That always seems to work for me.  The second aspect of this AA is that if you camp with the pet suspended, he is there when you log back on.  The second works for me most of the time but occasionally fails.  I think it may fail if the suspended pet is equiped with no-rent item but am not certain at this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">it is usually works fine for me.<br />
when i suspend the pet and  i camp,he is still there when i return back.<br />
<br />
when i died (i summon a pet while waiting to get a res.and buff him).then i suspend him, and when i got the res he is still there.<br />
<br />
few times after being dead,i casted a pet and i tried to suspend him before getting my &quot;res&quot; and i couldn t suspend it because i already had one suspended........................</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">One of our shaman reported an issue with this yesterday. He logged back in and pet was gone. He was quite grouchy about it.</div></div><hr />
