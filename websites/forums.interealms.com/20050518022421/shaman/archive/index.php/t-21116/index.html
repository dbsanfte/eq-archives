<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have tried unsuccessfully to post this on the EQ Live Shaman's Lodge board (I'm not sure they like my signature, which is similar to the one that appears below, but without links). Anyway, I thought I would post it here to get some feedback.  The thread on the developers board has become so long, that I fear the essential issues will be missed.  If anyone can help post this, or an editted version of it on the Shaman's Lodge, please PM me.<br />
<br />
*EDIT: I was able to cut and paste from this forum into the new shaman issues forum on EQ Live*<br />
<br />
The thread in the Developers section of the board on shaman issues has become very long, but I think a short, to-the-point response to Rytan's 3 points on shaman balancing is in order.  I will list his 3 points with a brief response that I hope summarizes much of the discussion on these boards and at the Shaman's Crucible:  <br />
<br />
Rytan: issue #1 -The ability to function as a secondary healer<br />
<br />
Recent changes to shaman healing spells were insufficient.  More work needs to be done here, especially with regard to burst healing.  An increase of Daluda's Mending to 1800hp or more has been suggested.<br />
<br />
This, of course, assumes that shamans are no longer to be considered primary healers at all (at least in Gates).  Is this the intent of the development team?<br />
<br />
Rytan issue #2 -The impact of shorter fights on DoTs spells and Slow<br />
<br />
The problem of slow impact in short fights has been addressed with the proposed change to Balance of Nihil now on the test server.  Most shamans consider this sufficient, but caution that this change by itself cannot solve all the problems experienced by high level shamans.<br />
<br />
DoT's were not created for the short fight, plain and simple.  The real issue is DPS contribution, which is nil for shamans in short fights under any realistic scenario.  Two changes have been suggested by the shaman community: (1) increased effectiveness of DD spells, for example, a new disease based DD that is fast and does around 1200 damage.  (2) a useful melee enhancement.  Shamans have been asking for years that Rabid Bear be made more useful.  This could be done very simply by making it an on-demand skill, rather than one that can be used for 6 min every hour.  A trainable bash skill, like what was given to clerics has also been suggested.<br />
<br />
Rytan issue #3 -The increased number of slow mitigating NPCs in some areas of Gates.<br />
<br />
Slow mitigation, including immunity, are important limitations on what a shaman brings to a fight. The changes to Balance of Nihil will be relatively ineffective if slow mitigation and immunity, especially of boss mobs, is not addressed.  This would also have the favorable effect of allowing knights the ability to tank in many more Gates encounters.<br />
<br />
Rytan's summary -  Personally I feel that shaman are relatively well balanced in most other areas of the game outside of Gates content, which is in agreement with most of the feedback I’ve seen on the shaman boards. Therefore, I expect any change to the shaman class to be specifically aimed and alleviating their concerns in Gates of Discord.<br />
<br />
The sentiment of the shaman community is expressed at the Shaman's Crucible. Please take a moment to review the post entitled &quot;Proposal for Shaman Improvements (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19207) &quot; on the general section of that message board. Many of these concerns apply to Gates, but there has been a general erosion of shaman utitliy that has affected their performance in other high end encounters, including elemental plane encounters, hard LDoN adventures, the Plane of Time, and elsewhere.  Two major issues are not addressed in your 3 points:<br />
<br />
1: Buffing - by the time a shaman gets to the elemental planes, the usefulness of shaman buffs is questionable.  Focus remains the only viable buff, and that solely for the HP it adds.  Ferine Avatar, along with its predecessors, is severely limited by its short duration and long cast time.  Solutions include a group version to Ferine Avatar and other buffs that more directly affect melee performance.<br />
<br />
2.  Mana regeneration - The shaman model of active mana regeneration works for the long, slow fight, but not for short, quick, active content.  Cannibalization helps, but can only infrequently be used.  Chaotic pain would have been a viable solution, but making it an Ancient spell, effectively removing it from 99% of the shaman community, negates the potential it has to solve this problem.<br />
<br />
Thank you for all that you are trying to do to solve shaman issues.  We only ask that you consider the larger scope of the class, both in content other than Gates, and in other areas not identified by your 3 points</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you do post this over on the lodge make sure you tell A_Turtle_Pet that you are demanding ALL the above changes and everything else under the sun right away,  like now!!<br />
<br />
I garauntee he will post like 30 times on something like this even though he has no clue about the high end game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yea, phreak, that is a problem.  Right now I can't post it because it says I don't have permision to use HTML, and lists a bunch of HTML errors.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">that might be cos you responding to rytan post using reply and rytans post has htlm in it, which you cant use.<br />
<br />
try just deleting that or using the reply at the top maybe? cos i had that problem when i reply directly to his post</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">the slow change is one of 4 things id want to see for shamans, so im 25% happy.  The other 3 are:<br />
1- Group Avatar for the love of god.<br />
2- Effective fast heal.  1800 healing base on 3 sec cast time.<br />
3- A melee buff that matters... perhaps replace rabid bear with a 10 min duration 10 min recast aa that grates massive attack + stats /resists and time lvl effects+ that overwrites fero/avatar, but is better than both as they are stacked now.<br />
<br />
Mitigation doesnt need to be changed as slowing shouldnt be the ONLY thing we bring to the table.  Currently our buffs blow *##, so give melee a reason to take us. <br />
Edit: Id like to add theres other things i want, and cool ideas ive had.  But these are just things we NEED to pull our weight.  If these issues arent addressed we're just that person your forced to take along eventually through trials so that rogues can get their avatar (ARGHHH) later on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I honestly hate hate hate this group FA request. For the love of god, why?!<br />
Why do you want a buff that makes no difference at the high end game of PoP(i.e. last expansion) or even sooner?<br />
<br />
Forget attack buffs, please. They don't do anything after 1800 ATK. Ferocity adds 65x5 resists + 150 ATK, so that is actually useful. FA adds stats + 140 ATK, so it's useless.<br />
<br />
Resist adjust for our DoTs and aggro associated with them is what needs to be adressed instead. <br />
DPS and Healing is what we need to get tweaked, because Slow isn't gonna get more crucial that it is atm(read: a minor function in a group setting and non existant in a raid setting).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Attack has been shown as useful up to 2300 by monk parses hasnt it?  Either way you need to convince the melee fa does nothing for them not us :D.  FA hurts my head thats all.  Nothing like getting tells constantly from the monks &quot;FAP FAP FAP FAP FAP&quot;  (ferine avatar please)...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just replace all avatar lines with a 20 minute group only spell so I can just keep it up on one group and forget it. Melees get their placebo and I get to click less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Forget attack buffs, please. They don't do anything after 1800 ATK. Ferocity adds 65x5 resists + 150 ATK, so that is actually useful. FA adds stats + 140 ATK, so it's useless.<br />
<br />
Then how about a modification to FA that makes it useful, MORE useful than Ferocity, like +strikethrough, +avoidace, +riposte, etc etc.<br />
<br />
I want useful melee buffs, since we basically have nothing to offer Casters. No mana regen, no extra mana, nothing. Oh wait, necros still ask for Replenishment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Changing FA is a totally different story and as long as it remained Shaman only, it would be a good addition. It would still not adress the biggest issues with Shaman, but that is just my own opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Rabid bear is a joke anyway unless youre fighting greens,<br />
IMO our dps fix should be based around resist mods, casting times, and dot duration.<br />
<br />
The law of diminishing returns makes every one of our buffs contribute less and less. The only exception I can think of is haste, because the best haste item is still less than 50%. So in the long run, we would be better off getting 60% group haste over group avatar.<br />
Of course both would be nice, but going on past experience, we want to avoid the situation where the devs throw bones at us to shut us up for a few weeks while the real issues remain unchanged.<br />
<br />
I would also like to change the paragraph about the  new Nihil on test to read &quot;Most shaman feel this is a fix to a spell that should have been an genuine upgrade from day 1...&quot;</div></div><hr />

This was not a direct replay to his post.  I cut and pasted his 3 points into a new message on the Shaman's Lodge forums.</div></div><hr />
