<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shamran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hiya Guys<br />
What is our max damage shield at level 65?<br />
Protection of the Wild (34ds)<br />
Bladecoat (6ds)<br />
Shield of Thorns (24ds)<br />
Call of the Rathe (10ds)<br />
(got this information from castersrealm)<br />
<br />
I dont think these spells will stack, because then we will end up with a 74ds which would be a little too uber :p<br />
What i really want to know is, how much is our max damageshield, with our own spells?, and what is the max damage shield we can be buffed with by other players?<br />
<br />
Hope someone can help me, thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shugamayatu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">PoTW = CoR+Sheild of thorns+SoT all rolled up in one.<br />
Add bladecoat and you got it.<br />
<br />
34+6=40</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ladas Sindarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Assuming PoTW works like Warders (all my runes = Cry of Thunder so far)...<br />
<br />
PoTW = 34<br />
Bladecoat = 6<br />
10th Ring = 10<br />
Cloak of Thorns = 4 or Icicle Cloak = 6<br />
Talisman of Vah Kerrath = 8<br />
<br />
62 with Cloak of Thorns<br />
64 with Icicle Cloak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drunia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Self-buffed at 65 with a full spell book its 43 without any outside items.<br />
<br />
PotW - 34<br />
Bladecoat - 6<br />
Force of Nature - 3<br />
<br />
I had a thread on this a while back because I realized that out a high end rangers DS was over 60 damage, which is pretty nice no matter how you look at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yep, got Potw, it stacks just like WP.<br />
Potw - 34<br />
Bladecoat - 6<br />
Force of Nature - 3<br />
and you can stack nature's precision with it for some extra attack too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Telon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">POTW - 34<br />
Bladecoat - 6<br />
Dain ring - 10<br />
Icicle aura - 6<br />
Talisman of Vah'Kerrath - 8<br />
<br />
64 self buffed DS possible, I think is the max.  Not bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grimmace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just to clarify, would 8th ring stack with this lineup:<br />
<br />
WP<br />
Thorncoat<br />
SLN</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ladas Sindarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes Grimmace.  You would toss Nature's Precision in there as well and it would stack with the other 4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grimmace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's been a long time since I cast Nature's precision, but Lucy has it listed as +15 ATK with no DS.  Force of Nature has a 3 pt DS, did you mean that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>zavit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The quest ring from chardok has a 25point ds.<br />
I've heard that it doesn't stack with ranger/druid/mage ds. So I would think the chardok ring would overwrite bladecoat.<br />
So would this be correct?<br />
<br />
PoTW = 34 <br />
Di'zok aura (chardok ring) - 25<br />
10th Ring = 10 <br />
Icicle Cloak = 6 <br />
Talisman of Vah Kerrath = 8 <br />
<br />
That would equal 83. Is that possible?<br />
Or would the chardok ring not stack with PoTW and not just bladecoat?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ladas Sindarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Zavit:<br />
The Chardok ring overwrote my Warders Protection the one time I used a charge to test it.  But since the DS on PoTW is higher than the DS on the Chardok Ring, I am assuming you would get a &quot;does not take hold message&quot; if you have PoTW.  I can test it tonight for you though.<br />
<br />
Grimmace:<br />
No, I meant Nature's Precision.  The Dain ring effects overwrite Force of Nature, as does Avatar, but NP stacks with both of those, including the 10th ring which has the attack bonus.<br />
<br />
I was just giving you another buff that stacks that would give you a touch more attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>zavit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It sucks that the Chardok ring won't stack but it would probably be just way too overpowering if it did. The charges on the chardok ring last 30 minutes and it's easily rechargable if you keep your chardok faction at ally.<br />
You just changed my opinion of the chardok ring from really cool to ok for a warrior, useless for a ranger.<br />
Oh well at least it has some prestige since you not only need to camp some rares but you need to kill an estimated 3500 droga goblins just to get the faction you need. It's a step on the way to spirit wracked cords though so I'll probably end up with one by default. It's just sad that I'll never really use it. I'd rather it not be rechargable than have it not stack with my self buffs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to mention it paves the path for the cords quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thicket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">PotW + Blade Coat + Talisman of Vah Kerrath + buff from Fiery might legs = 54 ds for me</div></div><hr />
