<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Adinaya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've noticed that in almost every thread proposing improvements to the Shaman class, many of the complaints have to do with casting time. Malos and Turgurs are used on almost every mob, if the casting time was lowered significantly, I would be happier with my debuffing abilities. If Velium Strike and Bane had a faster casting time and recast time, I would be happier with my DPS. If I had an AA that would lower my recast time on Canno V, I would be happier with my mana regen. The list goes on. We have high mana cost based on the fact that we have the ability to regain our mana so effectively through Cannibilization, but there is no reason for our casting times to be so long. <br />
<br />
A couple other things I was thinking...<br />
<br />
We have all wanted out-of-group shrink. Maybe we could have a spell that would summon shrink potions for groups. They could be lore and no-rent like mod rods and would be TGB-able and MGB-able. <br />
<br />
How about a levitation spell without the bobbing effect?<br />
<br />
We are overdue for an upgrade to SoW and Invis, why not give us something similar to Bard's travel song and combine Spirit of Scale with Invisibility?</div></div><hr />

Good idea, although people often want to shrink twice, so they woukd need to make sure the potion has 2 charges.<br />
<br />
It has occured to me that Sony are slow obsest with the Shaman.  They  have given us the best slow spell in the game and to go with it, slow everything else.  Slow casting spells, the ability to kill mobs slowly, the ability to gain experience slowly by soloing and they have slowly upgraded our spells.<br />

That's quite a neat idea actually :)</div></div><hr />

Heh I would almost turn a rune in for that one; I get sea sick when I have to Lev :p</div></div><hr />

That is without a doubt the number one pet peeve of mine for EQ.  Besides the seasickness there is the terrible lag it always causes on raids.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Adinaya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would also like to be allowed to use the pet augment from LDoN. Why not give it to all classes with pets? If my pet was upgraded with this augment and our most frequently used spells had their casting time cut down, I would be a much happier with my Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shaman don't have pets, they are companions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The potion idea has to be the best idea for a fix I've heard in a long time. Make it like MMR, 3 charges so people can use after res or whatever. Lore and No Drop.<br />
<br />
Someone please please please bring this up to SoE. Its a simple fix for something thats plagued us forever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'd agree that the casting times and recast times of some of our spells make no sense.  Maybe they make sense at lower levels when you first get *some* spells but by the time you're 65 some of the cast and recast times are simply punishment.  I'd like to see that tweaked or spells added that did the exact same thing as earlier spells with faster cast times and lower recast times - oh, and the spells need to be obtainable by everyone, not just ubers.<br />
<br />
I don't care about out of group shrink...but maybe I've just not been in a situation where I wanted to use it....except at PoK bank when some space cadet is blocking the door to the bank.<br />
<br />
I usually hate to levitate due to the bobbing effect - losing that or having an option to disable it via the options would be dandy.<br />
<br />
I don't really see the need for a SoW upgrade.  Many shaman that post here think run3 is the greatest thing since sliced bread and don't like to cast spells anyways (sarcasm) so that'd be a waste of a new spell.  Honestly though - we have SoW, Shrew, and Scale - what else could you want?  Gating, PoK books, and 3 types of run speed buffs isn't enough?  Improved Invis would be nice but isn't that big a concern of mine.  It's not that hard to become good at dancing with normal invis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ironically, the only thing that we all seem to agree on is that we need 50 different threads on this topic. I am still looking for the right one to put my comments against.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hey, that idea about an item that summons shrink potions is great.<br />
<br />
Make it like the mages mass mod rod. Summon an item with 2 or more charges of shrink on it that is put in everyones cursor that is in range. No Drop, Lore, No Rent.<br />
<br />
The item would work just like a shrink potion, no buff slot, lasts until you die or zone.<br />
<br />
Would solve the MGB shrink problem since you aren't MGBuffing shrink, you are summoning an item with shrink click effect it that everyone gets. If they want to shrink they can click, if they don't want they don't click. Problem solved.<br />
<br />
Can we get this instead of a new disease dot?  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Damn good idea on the potion, I'm surprised I've never heard that one come up before.</div></div><hr />

&quot;after reading through all the excesive ideas of changes and spells for GoD i come to the conclusion that the best thing soe could do in GoD to even off the shaman is give us a detrimental haste aa. figure something along the lines of 5,15,30% and the rest along the lines of quick buff.<br />
<br />
1. this would benefit our nuke dps by signifigantly reducing casting time. and help with dots as well.<br />
<br />
2. this would make debuffing more efficient in fast killing groups. with a good spell haste item this would mean being able to cast malos before turgurs and still have the mob above 90%.<br />
<br />
3. since our debuffs would be cast faster it would mean we could get to healing faster, since the major problem with healing is before the mob is slowed. &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This would be a step in the right direction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Splitzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ok, who do we need to bribe to get Adinaya a lunch meeting with the devs?  A detrimental haste AA similar to our quickbuff ability would solve SO many problems for the class. <br />
<br />
Hope you don't mind, but I posted your idea for the shrink potions over to the sticky thread that Gloriana made.  Something like that has no business NOT going into the game.  We can already make shrink potions, we can already shrink via spell, and we can already summon a few minor items, so it wouldn't introduce anything into the game that we don't already have.  One of the major issues for out of group shrinks is the potential for griefing.  This spell would solve that problem easily by making the actual shrinking part completely voluntary.<br />
<br />
Only thing I'd add is that there can't be the same kind of long recast that mod rods have and that a spell to summon grow potions in the same manner would probably be a good idea to give people a way to reverse the effect (since there wouldn't be a buff icon to click off).<br />
<br />
edit--Ok, so the detrimental haste thing wasn't your idea.  I just noticed the original thread.  We've got WAY too many threads going on this stuff right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
woah woah WOAH there Wildaar..what you do with your dog is your business, but my pet isn't my &quot;companion&quot;.<br />
<br />
Faster casts = good idea..would even help out in pvp where apparently shaman are lacking(not on a red server, will take their word for it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Adinaya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Another random thought...why not combine Ferine Avatar with Swift Like the Wind?  If they kept SLtW's duration and recast time, this would be a nice spell to have. Would it be going too far to make it a group spell as an upgrade to Talisman of Alacrity?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Splitzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Introducing a haste component to FA is potentially a very bad idea (major stacking issues).  An overhaste could work though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have kept quiet on all the shaman improvement threads because some just seemed like asking for too much.<br />
<br />
But this!<br />
<br />
This is the best idea and most realistic. The shrink could look and work simular to a modrod.<br />
<br />
Detrimental Haste AA solves several problems at once.<br />
<br />
Brilliant Ideas!</div></div><hr />

This is soo true, I hate em as well..... on my shaman<br />
but when I play my cleric.......thats a different story<br />

As far as the &quot;Shrinkrods&quot; I can just see the dwarves/gnomes/halflings running away and the ogres/trolls/barbarians running towards.</div></div><hr />

Why do you hate them on your shaman? Its more free, quick, easy mana regen. You probably hate FT too don't ya?</div></div><hr />

I'm with Darkpaw on this, I love mod rods.  Free insta-click canni to hit while Can4 is refreshing.  I always bugged mages for rods, especially if I was on an LDON as only healer/slower/haster (which was entirely too often :p).  I actually had a mage friend who watched for my &quot;undergoes a mystical transvergence&quot; message through my canni spam, counted them, and knew when I needed a fresh rod more often than not.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Qatrixaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I'd be happy just to see my highest level slows hit for full.<br />
<br />
Clerics - best healers, heals hit for full or more with crit and focus.<br />
Wizards - best nukers, nukes hit for full or more with crit and focus.<br />
Shaman - best slowers, slows always hit for partial and no help from crit or focus.<br />
<br />
If shamans are kings of slows then they should allow it to be focus'able and to crit for more slowness.</div></div><hr />
