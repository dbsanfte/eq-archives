<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wampaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Have any of you guys done the more melee style AA's like Combat stability, Natural Durability, Combat Agility? Seem like some extra hp's and damage mitagation would be nice but I wasnt sure how important those were. Im working on MGB atm, and should have it by the weekend. I have cann5 done so I'm researching my future aa goals after MGB. Any info is appriciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did the abilities that I felt would benefit my guild in raids first.<br />
<br />
-canni 5 so i can always have mana.<br />
-MGB so i can buff a raid fast.<br />
-SCRM so that my buffs last thru the entire raid.<br />
-RC so that I can cure my group.<br />
-QB to cast faster.<br />
<br />
Then I picked up a couple fun AAs.<br />
<br />
-SC because a swarm of dogs is fun.<br />
-VP because it can save me from an add.<br />
<br />
Now I am working on the AA to make me tougher.<br />
<br />
I am workign on both CA and ND, because I couldnt decide between them... so I got CA1, ND1, CA2, ND2, and I am almost to ND3 now.  I havent noticed an increase in defense yet, but I definately see more hps.  I expect that if I werent doing most of my exp fighting in tier 3 pop I might see the difference from CA2... as it stands I dont really expect to see the differnence until I hit LR5.  I intend to get CS and ID next, but I felt that getting hit less often would be better than taking less damage per hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have Natural Durability 3, Lightning Reflexes 5, and Innate Defense 5 so can speak from a bit of experience.<br />
<br />
ND3 is great and easily worth 12 AA's. Just think of how much time you'd spend working on a quest for an item with comparable hit points.<br />
<br />
LR5 is good but I wouldn't go for it right away. SCRM, QB, RC1, and VP1 are definitely better. After you've spent the 27 points to reach LR5, though, you'll notice a difference so it's not an ability to completely neglect.<br />
<br />
ID5 is not of much benefit for its cost (27 points, same as LR5) unless perhaps you do a lot of solo tanking. It's something to purchase after you've exhausted most of the good options, but before you're down to Alchemy Mastery and Rabid Bear.</div></div><hr />
