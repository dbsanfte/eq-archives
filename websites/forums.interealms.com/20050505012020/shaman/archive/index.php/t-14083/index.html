<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>throxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This item dropped in the Hole last night and I can't seem to find any info on it. It's lore and no-drop. Wondering if there is a quest this is used in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are a lot of drops like that in the Hole, that have no known usage.</div></div><hr />

As far as I know, the Hole was a bit of a rush job. I love the zone, but there are a whole load of items that look like quest items but have no know use. There are also a few rooms with interesting things inside, but with unopenable doors.<br />
<br />
Interesting to see the news on the EQLive site that a revamp of the zone in under way. I hope they don't change it too much, but finishing all the loose ends would be cool :)<br />
<br />
Some of the pathing needs o be looked at too, although that may have been improved by the new pathing rules, haven't checked recently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Guntar Ghostdancer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The Hole is an interesting zone.  Make a level 1 halfling rogue on the right faction (cant remeber which one it is) and you can explore the whole zone.  Undead and rats dont see through sneak/hide and all the elementals are non KOS even though they con otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Factionis Brell. You're still KoS to the ghosts and, I believe, rats. But you can hide/sneak your way around. VERY beautiful zone. I love it there.</div></div><hr />
