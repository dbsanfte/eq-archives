<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Specious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Recently my home computer got fried by lightning. I did everything I could to try to repair it, but I was told by a local techie that I should just look into getting a new computer. I'm a pretty heavy Everquest player, and I'm really looking foreword to games like World of Warcraft and, especially, Everquest 2 :). My question is really this: how do I purchase a computer now which will be able to support my addiction for the next few years without having to upgrade or change parts/pieces of the machine? I understand that upgrading ram or adding additional hardware/software really isn't that hard, but I just do not really have the time to do so. I just want to get a solid machine that will take me into the next 2-3 years of gaming with no problems. I've been looking at Dell and Gateway so far, and both companies seem somewhat comparable and similar. I like the Gateway 700XL (www.gw2k.com), but for $3499 + the $499 that I would have to pay for a 3 year warranty, it seems slightly more than I would like to spend on a machine even though it has all of the features I would like (Raid, 1gig of ram, 256mb video card, 18&quot; LCD screen). I'm slightly turned off by the fact that I'm buying a top of the line computer from the company and they can't warranty their product without additional fees. I always hear about Alienware and Falcon-Nw, and other such companies... but how long have they been around? What sort of technical support do they have and how reliable is their return/exchange policy should I get the LCD display and notice a bunch of bad pixels or a damaged video card, etc? Really I'm looking for some sound advice, especially if anyone works for any computer company such as Dell or Gateway. Perhaps you could explain why I have to or should plunk down another $500 for a warranty, or just enlighten me as to what I should be paying to suit my needs. I'm looking to spend around $3000 but not too much more. I also would like to purchase the computer within the next week or so. Any help or advice would be appreciated :). Thanks in advance!<br />

They rate computers and add-ons on a regular basis (by add-on, I mean video cards etc.).   From what I have read, Alienwear is good, and they just rated a machine (Marauder Plus) at 93% (excellent) and it only cost 1820.00!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Redspeed-Valoran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dell has a horrible track record with me.   They've screwed up my order 3 times now, and messed up the shipping -- I had to spend about 3 hours on hold with Airborne Express just to figure out what in the hell was the deal.  This all happened within the last 2 weeks, im still waiting for the computer I ordered almost 3 weeks ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In my own opinion buying from a company like Dell or Gateway is a waste of good money.  Sure, they have ok (just OK) computers but they charge you WAY to much for them.<br />

<br />
TOTAL SYSTEM COST SO FAR:  $1568<br />
<br />
And thats just the main components.  In some cases, they are better than is availible of the Gateway you picked out.  In some cases not.  But this system is HALF the price of the one you looked at.<br />
<br />
There is still pleanty of money left over to get a new monitor (hell..spend $1000 and get a 25' sony flatscreen), keyboard, mouse, speaker system, surge protector, etc.<br />
<br />
Ive always gone under the assumption that when you buy a Dell (or a Gateway or a Compaq or other 'name brand PC') that HALF of the price that you actually pay is for the computer itself.  The other half buys you the name on the box.<br />
<br />
My advise?  Don't limit yourself to the name brands.  Hell...for 3500 bucks you could build a really sweet system.  I personally love egghead.com and have recommended it to many friends and relatives.  I helped my parents build a computer there.  They ordered it on a Monday.  It was at their house on Wednesday morning.  It is better than the PC that I build about 19 months ago, and they paid less than half what I did at the time I built mine.  Its ok though...a couple more months and I'll be sporting a new system of my own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>sir0die</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i work in a computer shop also, and i have to agree, don't get a namebrand (gateway, dell, compaq) that's a waste of money, plus you'll get their redtape headaches when trying to get it fixed or upgrade.<br />
<br />
I get people in my shop all the time with a 1 month old (insert namebrand here) that they want fixed, i say, &quot;this is only 1 month old, it's still under warranty, are you sure you don't wan't (insert namebrand here) warranty to fix it for free?&quot;, and they answer, very innoyed, &quot;We've tryed that and that (insert degrading curse words here) company keep telling us (insert generic corporate excuses here)&quot;.<br />
<br />
you mention something about a $500 extended warranty, why that's to pay for the $60 hard drive that crashes 4 years from now. (do you feel like you are about to get ripped off yet?)<br />
<br />
of course not everybody has bad experiences with these companies, but why risk it. the only reason i would recommend you get one of the system is if you are one of those individuals that would defend AOL with their life (HEAVY SARCASM). <br />
<br />
most of those corps, pray on the uniformed users with creditcards. (just like AOL)(EXTREAMLY HEAVY SARCASM).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Here is a comperable system made from prices from www.newegg.com<br />
Here's a second vote of confidence in newegg!<br />
<br />
I've dealt with them on numerous occasions, built several machines with parts bought from them, and even had no issues returning a couple of parts (one defective, another due to just incompatibility).<br />
<br />
I'm about to order parts for two new machines for the wife and I to replace our current gaming systems.<br />
<br />
I've always done the BYoC thing. More bang for the buck that way. The only times I ever purchase a complete machine from a brand name manufacturer is at work for business use. Personally, I'd never use Dell, Gateway, or Compaq for gaming, but that's just me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I totally agree with BYoC (build your own comp), but some peeps are not comfortable doing that, thats why I suggested PC Gamer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mollari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ALienware are nice but check these guys out www.ibuypower.com just as good and 1k cheaper</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah I've ordered from newegg before when building my personal game box. If I was going to buy a preassembled computer I would hand pick all the components that I wanted (using professional suggestions is a good idea to see who's putting out good gear) and have a local shop do the task. Having a custom is &gt; than factory built dells, but then again i'm just a crazy overoverclocker.<br />
<br />
If you arent going the local shop route or building your own then I would suggest DELL if you want support contracts and such (cant speak for falcon or alien). Dell desktops do have a very proven track record, you'll find them in like 90% of the fortune 500s and I would buy one if I was going that route.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The 2 most important things to consider if you're building a system for the future are 1)  Memory, 2) Video Card.  You can almost never have too much memory, and it keeps adding value past the point a processor would.  Video cards are a bit limited since they change so quickly, within a year of buying the top end one, it'll be at half the price and a generation behind if not more.  But try to get as good a quality as you can for the price, and definitely something that supports dx9 so it handles games later on.<br />
<br />
Processor speeds are mostly irrelevant, I don't even think they sell things under 2 ghz anymore, and most anything over that is not getting much use for gaming.  A 1.5 ghz machine with 1 gb of ram will out perform a 3 ghz machine with 256 mb of ram in most standard gaming .  And cost a lot less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">While I haven't bought a brand name computer for myself since the early nineties, I have helped with ordering and system set ups for my family and friends (I'm the local geek).<br />
<br />
Obivously, it's cheaper to build one yourself, or to buy from an e-merchant, but some people are just more comfortable going with a large company, particularly with so many of the smaller tech companies going belly up overnight.<br />
<br />
If you're one of those people, here's my recommendations (I've bought from these companies many times).<br />
<br />
Alienware - excellent. Top notch systems, great tech support and very little junk thrown on your hard drive. If you can afford it, it's well worth it.<br />
<br />
Voodoo - screaming fast game rigs, and a smallish company so they have decent customer service. They should grow stronger and stronger as the company has sound financial backing and high grade systems. If it's a lightening fast game rig you want, this company is currently top of the pile.<br />
<br />
Dell - not as bad as people say. Of the uber companies, the Dell systems are the best. Yes, you're paying more than internet prices, but the systems are solidly built for the price. There will always be a bad luck story with a company this size, but on the whole they provide decent service.<br />
<br />
Gateway - appaling customer service, low end components. Personally, I think their days are numbered.<br />
<br />
HP - never, ever buy one. Their printers and scanners are good, their computers are downright awful. Poorly designed, the absolute cheapest components and a hard rive filled to the brim with spam software. The interior is so badly designed that making any kind of upgrade requires a major remodel of the case, as they cram everything in to get that sleek design that people fall for. Under no circumstance buy one, unless you like those ugly plastic curved towers.<br />
<br />
I can also recommend newegg - I've bought some stuff from there. They seem very reliable (although I've said that before, lol).<br />
<br />
As for the video card, I recommend the ATI at the moment. I have a 9700pro and it's rock solid with very high performance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kaalisti_Painstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Don't go with name-brand pre-built PC's.<br />
1. You're going to get reamed on a deal that includes the monitor, keyboard, speakers, mouse and printer. Please don't do this.<br />
2. They put substandard parts in these pc's.<br />
3. That kind of pc has zero to little future upgradability.<br />
<br />
Go Custom.<br />
If you're not comfortable with building a PC, now is not the time to learn. There's too many incompatible parts out there, and unless you KNOW what you're doing, it's going to be a nightmare.<br />
<br />
There's probably hundreds of people in your local area who build computers as a small side business. Check your local Greensheet/PennySaver (local advertising sheet) for businesses near you.<br />
<br />
As a custom builder, I can guide you to things to look out for:<br />
1. Get an up-front price on labor. I normally charge $400 for a very basic build, increasing with the complexity of the computer. <br />
2. Get receipts for the parts. Get the original boxes for the parts.<br />
3. Give the builder a budget. Have them submit to you what they can build for you within that budget. Make sure they include their labor and an operating system in that.<br />
4. Expect to pay between $1500 and $2500 for a custom built pc. The higher the price, the more state-of-the-art and 'bells and whistles' you're going to get.<br />
<br />
If you'd like to build yourself a nice pc, here's a recipe that was my latest build, if you use this recipe, you won't have incompatabilities:<br />
<br />
Case: DreamerX Black (just get a nice case with at least a 350w powersupply)<br />
MB: MSI Neo - FIS2R<br />
CPU: Pentium 2.8 Gigahertz with 800 MHz Front Side Bus (FSB) (go with a 3.0 gig if you can afford it)<br />
RAM: Corsair TwinX 512meg 800 FSB (Factory Match, do not accept if not in one single case).... remember, one stick per channel on the MB<br />
HDD: Seagate 120gig 7200RPM Serial ATA<br />
CD: DVD Player &amp; a CDRW (don't go with the combo's, they get a lot of returns)<br />
Video: Asylum GeForce4 FX5200 Ultra<br />
A Drive: Generic<br />
OS: WinXP<br />
<br />
All told, it was under 2k with labor. Oh yea, and this pc freaking SCREAMED through the bazaar with full clip plane  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You are better off with a Ti4600 or Ti4800 than an FX, unless you are getting an FX 5900.<br />
<br />
I was kind of surprised to see that FX cards (excluding the 5900) are only faster than Ti4600 when certain features are used, otherwise they are considerably slower. Also note that a 256MB card won't do anything for you right now. 128 will do just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I would never mail-order a computer. Those things are priced twice as high as the same exact system, pre-built at any of hundred local computer shops. I've heard bad things about Gateway, and I dont think I'd ever get one of those. Never heard anything bad about Dell, but their prices are ridiculous.<br />
<br />
That said, I have to disagree about Compaq. I've had 3 of them and all three were excellent machines. I have 2 of them networked right now for EQ. And I paid less than a third of the price range you are quoting, but I live in computer country (Seattle), so maybe that is a factor. I paid about $700-$800 for the first two I bought, though they werent quite top of the line when I got them - they were still decent at the time. The newest one I paid about $1200 and it's a P4 2.53 ghz, 512 RAM, 120 GB drive, GeForce4 video w/64MB RAM (small I know - I plan to swap out a Radeon for this), rewritable CD drive, DVD drive, and WinXP preloaded. I've had this one for about a year or so and never had a problem with it and it runs EQ quite nicely.<br />
<br />
And, yes, I looked into having a system built for me to my specifications, but the Compaq actually cost about $500 less than a top-of-the-line built system would have cost, and I really only downgraded on the video card with the Compaq. That's a pretty easy fix - if I ever get around to doing it. So far hasnt been a big deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Building your own system isn't a bad way to go. I would point out that the parts Thorzion picked out wouldn't work together =(. The MB selected only supports 400/533fsb cpus and the p4 3.2 is 800mhz fsb based.<br />
<br />
I've also found that most major builders aren't bad on the price if you compair equal computers. Sure you can build something cheaper but it's usually because your cutting corners somewhere. The question is really does thier system really match what you want or does it have all sorts of stuff you don't want.<br />
<br />
For the gateway system he picked your looking at 500-600 of that cost for the monitor alone. The duel format dvd burner and regular cdr drive on top of that can easily be another 300-400.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Umm... I hope you're not saying companies like Compaq aren't bad on price when compared to a self built system.  Companies like that operate like fast food restaurants.  They're the ones cutting corners, and absolutely everywhere they can.  They'll give you meat made from old dairy cows with 40% fat, some fries covered in salt and cooked in the grease from aforementioned old dairy cows, and some fountain drink out of a machine that hasn't been cleaned in 4 months to wash it down with.  This order will probably be screwed up by the drug abusing 16 year old dropout they hired to serve you.  Or for the same price, you can go to the supermarket, get a nice steak, go home and grill it yourself, and have a nice meal that tastes a lot better and doesn't require a cardiologist visit.  Look at it from their point of view... (purely as an example, not real numbers) they cut a $100 off their price by giving you a substandard part, and let's say they sell 50,000 computers.  They just made $5,000,000 by cutting a corner 95% of their customers never even knew about.  This ESPECIALLY matters to you guys (EQers and gamers in general) because one of those corners they like to cut is video card.  Most use a crappy waste of electricity that's built into the motherboard.  A far cry from an uber GF FX.<br />
<br />
I've built more computers than I can remember for friends and family, and those that opted to buy one prebuild instead have mostly wound up regretting it.  The parts in prebuilt systems tend to be pretty awful.  They'll especially skimp on motherboards and the such since anybody that knows a lot about them is probably building their own systems anyway.  Compare a good top of the line Abit or Asus motherboard to one of those pieces of crap they stuff in whatever &quot;sleek&quot; box on a Best Buy shelf sometime.  I hear PC Chips is especially awful, as bad as Packard Bell used to be (the fact they're out of business is undeniable proof of a good and merciful deity).  They often work better, and they almost always cause less problems.<br />
<br />
Oh, and before I go off on a technical rant, one piece of advice for anyone... unless you have some special circumstances, always always always go with the &quot;business&quot; versions of windows.  In other words, NT, 2k, XP Pro.  I admit, I'm not sure how well XP Home works, but I know 95, 98, 98SE, and ESPECIALLY ME (Millennium Edition) suck.  ME has even been known to damage network cards.  All of them crash a lot.  I'm using XP Pro now, installed it about 6 months ago.  Before that, I used 2k for about a year and a half.  I can count the number of crashes I've had in the past two years on one hand.  Seriously.  There's a reason those versions of windows cost so much more.  If any other techie can give some input on XP Home, that'd rule.  I've been out of the loop for a while and I'm not real sure how XP Home performs, but I've heard from a few friends that it's a great improvement over previous home OSes.<br />
<br />
Now I guess it's my turn to rag on a company.  I've got a good one (and a long one).  Keep in mind that I may just have amazingly bad luck, and they may be good.  However, I hate AMD.  Emphasis on hate.  I've never had a problem with an Intel processor.  In fact one system I had took some damage and everything in it died except for the Intel CPU, which worked like a charm for another two years before I upgraded it.  AMD, on the other hand, I've had three.  Of those, three were utter crap.  The first was an old-fashioned SECC (Cartridge style) pre-thunderbird Athlon.  I used a big heatsink with artic silver and twin fans to cool.  It overheated.  I switched to a massive heatsink with TRIPLE fans and a new and improved Artic Silver.  Still overheated.  In order to stop it from crashing within a half hour, I had to keep the side of the case off, and have a normal box fan, like the ones you use to cool a room, sitting a few inches from it blowing on high.  The second one I broke.  My fault, rght?  Not really.  See, it was a 1.0GHz PGA thunderbird athlon, and the core was on top of it so it would have direct contact with a fan.  This SOUND like a good idea, but it's retarded.  Because it's protruding from the CPU, and easily broken when installing a fan.  They say not to rock the fan during installation and keep the pressure even to prevent this.  THIS IS AGAINST THE LAWS OF PHYSICS.  THIS IS NOT HUMANLY POSSIBLE.  All the fans install by hooking one side under the CPU, then pushing down on the other side until the clip locks into place.  When you push down on that clip, you're putting more pressure on one end than the other because it's not instantly level with the core.  It's flat out impossible to always have even pressure, and when it's not even you're risking damage to the core.  My core was damage and the processor was dead.  The third was another thunderbird, and it actually worked... for a bit anyway.  I had a $70 or so cooling system on the processor, and was running all type of the line parts, including an Abit motherboard.  I read so much from people saying they've got great overclockability that I figured I'd try it.  Of course I started slow waiting to see when it'd become unstable.  When did it become unstable?  Almost immediately.  I forget the exact number but was around 50MHz or so over standard clock.  It should be able to handle that with a damn stock fan.  I lowered it to 25MHz or so and it was stable, so I left it at that.  After a couple months, it simply died.  I don't know why, I don't care why.  I swore I'd never buy so much as a pack of gum from AMD and I intend to stick by that.  I think there's a reason Intel processors cost more, and it's not greed like the AMD fanboys claim.  As a good example, I'm currently running a dual P3 system at 866MHz per processor.  They're SECC (cartidge), which means they run much hotter since there's no direct contact with any cooling device, and worse yet, they're on the crappy, dinky stock fans Intel gave me with them.  They run at nearly half the temp of a PGA AMD CPU in one of my techie friend's systems.  And it's got a damn nice cooling system.  I have a pretty bad setup for cooling, he's got a great one, yet my Intels run a LOT cooler than his AMD.  I love Intel.</div></div><hr />

We as technicians are not easily able to exchange parts... typically we are forced to get manager approval to rpl anything above a mouse. Usually the manager wont give much grief as managers dont know squat about tech support... the ones that think they do, have us run thru our checklist to make sure we troubleshot it correctly, If I can avoid having to rpl a part... I will.<br />
<br />
Do NOT buy an LCD monitor, at least from Gateway. There is a 5 pixel rule. Nothing will get you more aggrivated then looking at 4 dead pixels. (dead pixels show white usually)<br />
<br />
I own a gateway... it was given to me.... it sits in a box.<br />
<br />
Alienware (falcon too) buys namebrand parts.. the same stuff you'll buy when making your own. <br />
I can only relate to you what I was told, ALIENWARE ROCKS.<br />
<br />
If i was forced to buy a premade computer.. (or won the lottery) I would purchase an alienware.<br />
But alias......<br />
I'm poor. I make my own and buy exclusively from www.newegg.com</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Specious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">After reading the comments and suggestions posted on this thread, I went ahead and compiled a list of parts/components to build my own computer. There are quite a few I'm hesitant about, not being sure they're compatible with each other and not having a full understanding of what the specific features do, but perhaps someone here will know more about the technical aspects of the combination I put together and whether it will work or not. Here's the list from newegg.com :<br />
<br />
Processor:<br />
Intel Pentium 4 3.2GHz 512k 800MHz FSB | socket 478 w/ Hyper Threading Technology - RETAIL : $646.00 <br />
<br />
Mainboard: (I'm not sure what the difference is between the P4C800 DELUXE and the P4C800-E DELUXE... I didn't see any information about the -E on motherboards.org, so perhaps someone here knows the difference or a similar reliable motherboard with the same features? I installed a P4S8X earlier this year in another machine and I haven't had any problems with it though I do feel it lags a bit when running multiple programs, but that could be because I'm running a beta bios or because of some other bottlenecks in my system. Anyway~!)<br />

Storage: (I currently have a 40 gig hard drive on my other machine and I barely used 10 gigs of space on that, but I figure on running the two hard drives in a RAID configuration for performance, and 120GB is under the 137 GB or so limit because I don't believe the Asus motherboard has Ultra Long Block Addressing, but I could be wrong. I'm confused however as to why or what additional power adapter I would need to run these hard drives...)<br />

I appreciate all of the helpful replies I have received so far and I want to thank everyone for actually reading this.

Thanks in advance =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">In my own opinion buying from a company like Dell or Gateway is a waste of good money. Sure, they have ok (just OK) computers but they charge you WAY to much for them.<br />
<br />
Here is a comperable system made from prices from http://www.newegg.com<br />
<br />
Asus motherboard with Hyperthreading Capable of 4 gig RAM<br />
cost: $91<br />
<br />
P4 3.2 gig chip<br />
Cost: $646<br />
<br />
512 MB RAM<br />
cost: $160 (Each chip is $80. You need 2)<br />
<br />
CDRW/DVD<br />
Cost:$49<br />
<br />
Gforce FX 256MB vid card (down the page a little)<br />
Cost:$199<br />
<br />
SB Audigy 2 plat<br />
Cost:$167<br />
<br />
a Case to keep it all in<br />
Cost:$25<br />
<br />
WD 120 GB 7200RPM HD(down the page a bit)<br />
Cost:$96<br />
<br />
XP<br />
Cost:$135<br />
<br />
<br />
TOTAL SYSTEM COST SO FAR: $1568<br />
<br />
And thats just the main components. In some cases, they are better than is availible of the Gateway you picked out. In some cases not. But this system is HALF the price of the one you looked at.<br />
<br />
There is still pleanty of money left over to get a new monitor (hell..spend $1000 and get a 25' sony flatscreen), keyboard, mouse, speaker system, surge protector, etc.<br />
<br />
Ive always gone under the assumption that when you buy a Dell (or a Gateway or a Compaq or other 'name brand PC') that HALF of the price that you actually pay is for the computer itself. The other half buys you the name on the box.<br />
<br />
My advise? Don't limit yourself to the name brands. Hell...for 3500 bucks you could build a really sweet system. I personally love egghead.com and have recommended it to many friends and relatives. I helped my parents build a computer there. They ordered it on a Monday. It was at their house on Wednesday morning. It is better than the PC that I build about 19 months ago, and they paid less than half what I did at the time I built mine. Its ok though...a couple more months and I'll be sporting a new system of my own.<br />
<br />
You just earned yourself some rep points, buddy =p</div></div><hr />

I appreciate all of the helpful replies I have received so far and I want to thank everyone for actually reading this. Perhaps with all the help I have received I can get things straightened out and make a decision by the end of the weekend. Any further insight and/or advice are welcome! Thanks in advance =)<br />

Not a bad system on either one, wish I had that kind of money to spend on a system. It also proves my point pretty well. Up the 2 drives in the custom build sustem to 250gb 8mb cache drives and put the multi format dvd drive in and I'm sure it will come in at over the price of the gateway system. Manufacturer's like dell and gateway and such operate on very thin margins and order parts in large quantities at bulk rates. Yes they may use custom Mb's and cases sometimes that cause some problems but on a system like he's ordering it should be pretty functional.<br />
<br />
Personally I haven't bouight a prebuilt system yet for 2 main reasons. 1) I've always been reusing at least some components from my old computer(s) 2) the prebuilt systems always include some extra junk i don't want.<br />
<br />
I've still recommended building systems or built them my self for some friends when they wanted new computers but that typically because the type of things they want. You don't get a 150-200$ graphics card in a 600-700$ prebuilt system but you sure can build one yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I would point out that the parts Thorzion picked out wouldn't work together =(. The MB selected only supports 400/533fsb cpus and the p4 3.2 is 800mhz fsb based.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gah!  You're right!  I was in a hurry ( was getting close to being late for an appointment) so I snagged the MB that I had used before...but I wasnt using such a fancy chip before.  My appologies.</div></div><hr />

First, the the HELL are you gonna do with 500 GB of storage?  I mean, I like to keep alot of stuff to but thats why God invented removable storage!  I have hundreds of MP3's and wavs saved to my HD and Ive still not filled up my 60 GB.  This just seems like overkill on Gateway's part.<br />
<br />
Second, Im not sure that 250W is enough.  With all the gear thats strapped into that case it just seems to me that you might want a little more power.  Im sure that the system will run with 250W.  But if you start adding drives its gonna affect your power consumption.<br />
<br />
Just a few more thoughts I had about the Gateway system.  The system that you build is looking pretty sweet.  In regards to your desire for XP Id try and find a friend or relative that is still in college, or has access to a university bookstore.  Academic rates on software like that can usually save you some money.  I bought XP at a college bookstore for $85.  Saved me about 50 bucks because Bestbuy wanted $135 for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Cerath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">After reading the comments and suggestions posted on this thread, I went ahead and compiled a list of parts/components to build my own computer. There are quite a few I'm hesitant about, not being sure they're compatible with each other and not having a full understanding of what the specific features do, but perhaps someone here will know more about the technical aspects of the combination I put together and whether it will work or not. Here's the list from newegg.com :<br />

I didn't see any information about the -E on motherboards.org, so perhaps someone here knows the difference or a similar reliable motherboard with the same features? I installed a P4S8X earlier this year in another machine and I haven't had any problems with it though I do feel it lags a bit when running multiple programs, but that could be because I'm running a beta bios or because of some other bottlenecks in my system. Anyway~!)<br />

If I remember correctly, a lot of places will have three different grades of memory and they're not shy about letting you know which ones are better.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well these kind are made of parts we dug out of a junkyard.  They error a lot and they smell like rotting flesh.  *cue dramatic sales voice*  But THESE are made from the finest materials across the world!  They have diamond-studded contacts for improve performance, and never error except when your kids are trying to access alt.sex.pedophiles!  Only $19.99 more!&quot;<br />
<br />
Storage: (I currently have a 40 gig hard drive on my other machine and I barely used 10 gigs of space on that, but I figure on running the two hard drives in a RAID configuration for performance, and 120GB is under the 137 GB or so limit because I don't believe the Asus motherboard has Ultra Long Block Addressing, but I could be wrong. I'm confused however as to why or what additional power adapter I would need to run these hard drives...)<br />

I'm running a 200GB drive on a motherboard that's like two years old.  If you really want bigger drives, you can just get a seperate PCI controller card.  You could probably even downgrade your motherboard since the RAID would be on the controller card and the motherboard doesn't need it to help cover the cost of the controller card.<br />
<br />
Media Drives: (Just looked for black-colored drives to perhaps match the case)<br />

<br />
Graphics &amp; Monitor: (Wasn't really sure which brands to go with here either, but the Samsung was rated high by its buyers and I've heard good things about PNY, though if anyone has any experience with either please let me know.)<br />
<br />
PNY has some real bad brownie points with me.  I got a GeForce 3 from them a while back and the heatsink (memory heatsink, not graphics processor heatsink) fell off it.  Never even touched the damn heatsink and it fell off the card after installation.  So it fell onto my Santa Cruz sound board and fried that, meanwhile the GeForce 3 overheated and died.  Wound up having to replace them both.  First and last PNY product I have or will ever buy.  Got an Asus graphics card to replace it, and it's performed beautifully.  Asus' website is a joke often leading to broken links if you can even find the link you want, their own drivers didn't even work (Nvidia's did though, so no biggie), and their technical support takes a blue moon to reply to you.  Their parts are rock solid and I'll happily buy from them again, but God help you if you need their help with anything.<br />

<br />
Logitech &gt; All.  One word of warning though.  Optical cordless mice require new batteries a lot.  I've been running the same batteries on this keyboard for probably almost a year and I live at the computer.  But a while back I put my Logitech cordless optical mouse in a drawer and got a regular Logitech optical corded mouse.  I had gotten killed in another online RPG several times because my mouse died mid-combat.  If the battery thing isn't a problem for you though, that's the best keyboard/mouse money can buy.<br />

<br />
Case: (Unsure about the case at this time, I didn't really see any fantastic ones that I liked. I have a Cooler Master all aluminum case on my other machine and I like it because of its look and ease of installing/removing pieces of hardware, but I'm not sure I've decided on this one yet.) <br />

Definitely superior to the Gateway one.  Especially in quality.  I guarantee you Gateway's using lower quality parts and theirs will have a much larger chance of some problems down the road.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Wudin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Just to add my 2 cps...<br />

I'm also considering an upgrade. My current PC is a 3.5 year old Alienware. Was top of the line then, now can't even give it away, although it still runs EQ beautifully. Problem is that I can't play any of the new games coming out now, heh.<br />
<br />
I don't have any experience building a computer from scratch, but I can vouch for the Alienware I have. No problems over the past 3.5 years. Am considering getting my next one from them. The current one's lasted this long, I figure I got my money's worth. I'll probably try to get the top of the line again, hoping to use it for at least the next 3 years again. (I know, you hardcore guys are balking the idea of using a computer that old, but until very recently, I could play all the games that were coming out!) <br />
<br />
If you're not comfortable building your own machine, I also throw in support for getting a copy of PCGamer (or run through their website) and seeing how they rate the different vendors. Prices vary widely.</div></div><hr />

You don't need to format anything.  You'll have to reinstall your OS (Windows) because it'll freak out at a different motherboard, but it won't really give a damn what you do with the processor and RAM.  Reason being, it has to run drivers for things like your USB ports on your motherboard, and when those change it gets confused like a little kid who just had their homework switched.  It's expecting 4+4 but it's seeing 3+5, and it doesn't have the slightest idea what the hell to do.  CPU and RAM, on the other hand, are pretty much handled by the system firmware (that first screen at bootup) and it should just automatically detect the new hardware and adjust itself.<br />
<br />
So you'd have two options.  Clean install, or reinstall of Windows.  Basically, reinstalling is like &quot;upgrading&quot; even though it's to the same version, and it'll keep all your programs currently installed.  People often take that route to fix some problems with Windows.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  I always just do a clean install since it saves a possible headache.  Clean installing is pretty much making a second installation of Windows in a different directory and it'll boot from that stock version.  All your old software will still be on your hard drive, but most programs require modifications of Windows' system and boot-up files.  So you'd have to reinstall those.  The ones that don't you can just make another shortcut to yourself rather than reinstalling, though reinstalling is probably a safer bet.  If you're installing Windows 2000 or XP Pro, you can do something called dual booting if you clean install.  This means at every bootup you'll be given the option to boot into the new installation of Windows, or you can boot into your old (and probably error-filled) version if you need to for some reason.<br />
<br />
There's no reason your secondary drive would need anything, especially a reformat.</div></div><hr />

1. WAIT!  If you gonna get a high end system wait 2 months and go Athlon64. Once we get WinXP-64 Intel won't stand a chance.<br />
<br />
2. Asus boards are over rated and over priced.  Too high an rma rate for a high end board.  I would take an ECS before touching Asus or Abit. (and I run 2 ECS boards right now!)<br />
<br />
3. AMD is by far the best value you can get right now. You can get a great performer for $100.  Can't touch Intel for that price.  Someone said they had problems with amd but lemme tell you I am running FIVE amd systems at this very moment and have never had a peep out of any of them. (btw it is possible to mount an amd heatsink w/o rocking it. Place it over the cpu. Clip on one side, then use a tool to clip the other. I do it 100's of times a week.)<br />
4. MSI and Albatron are your best choices for motherboards right now.  <br />

5.  Go for a Raptor 10k drive for your windows drive. Only 36gb but fastest non-15k scsi drive on the market.  If you need storage get a cool running Samsung 5400RPM drive to keep the mp3's and DivX's safe.<br />
<br />
6. Boycott nVidia.  They have developed an attitude of indifference twords their customers.  At the same time ATI is bending over to produce the best hardware they can.  If you are not looking for super-high-end video, consider a Xabre card from SiS. Best performer  under $100.<br />

OK I gotta add my 2cp to this!!  <br />
 :D <br />
<br />
1. WAIT!  If you gonna get a high end system wait 2 months and go Athlon64. Once we get WinXP-64 Intel won't stand a chance.<br />
<br />
Like we haven't heard that before...  Remember the pre-thunderbird days when Intel processors were making Athlons look like bargain basement trash?  The balance of power shifts often enough.  Don't be so melodramatic like AMD is going to put Intel out of business because they're going to have the better CPU in the near future.  Further, you talk about value?  Are you expecting us to believe AMD's new superchip is going to be at a reasonable price in 2 months when it comes out?  Please.  All chips, both Intel and AMD, are extremely expensive at first and then take a massive dive in price in the following months.  Maybe 6 months down the road it'll be a good value and a powerhouse.  But if you're gonna wait 6 months for a better part, you're gonna be putting off getting/building a system forever because there's always something new down the line.<br />
<br />
2. Asus boards are over rated and over priced.  Too high an rma rate for a high end board.  I would take an ECS before touching Asus or Abit. (and I run 2 ECS boards right now!)<br />
<br />
Not to dispute your findings, but also consider Asus boards have built in support for overclocking, it's pretty easy for an idiot that doesn't know what he's doing to fry components by attempting to overclock too much.  I've never seen DOA reports but 90% of the experts I've spoken to swear by Asus or Abit.  And they swear AT PC Chips usually.<br />
<br />
3. AMD is by far the best value you can get right now. You can get a great performer for $100.  Can't touch Intel for that price.  Someone said they had problems with amd but lemme tell you I am running FIVE amd systems at this very moment and have never had a peep out of any of them.<br />
<br />
And I've used a lot more than 5 Asus boards and none has ever given me any problems (crappy drivers aside).  Means nothing.  Small samplings of working components aren't a good judge.  I'm sure we can easily find someone who's had several Packard Bells that never needed repair, and it's generally agreed upon that that was a blight on the world put here by Satan himself.<br />
<br />
(btw it is possible to mount an amd heatsink w/o rocking it. Place it over the cpu. Clip on one side, then use a tool to clip the other. I do it 100's of times a week.)<br />
<br />
*sigh*  No, it's not possible to keep the pressure even.  Listen.  One end is locked down first, leaving the heatsink somewhat levitated over the unlocked end.  There is pressure on the locked side but not the unlocked side.  Only the weight of the heatsink at first, which won't damage anything, but not when you attach the other end.  It doesn't matter what you attach the other end with, your thumb, a tool, tin cans and string, a monkey's ass, it doesn't matter... You're puttng pressure down on the unlocked end to lock it into place, and the heatsink is not immediately level.  It IS putting more pressure on one side than the other.  That's all there is to it.  You may reduce the risk by using a tool rather than a monkey's ass, but the risk will always be there.  I didn't rock mine back and forth, I just pressed down on the clip until it locked into place and the core was dead.  I'm sure what happened to me was not the standard, but it happens often enough that it's a well enough known and documented problem with AMD CPUs.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, I absolutely refuse to believe that you install HUNDREDS of CPUs a WEEK and not ONE has ever had a problem that could've been attributed to at least a slightly damage CPU.  Even without that design flaw you run into duds more often than that (assuming this is over a reasonable period of time).  Stop misrepresenting the facts.<br />
<br />
Edit:  This just hit me, too.  Hundreds a week, huh?  Okay, let's assume you work full time (40 hrs), and you mean the absolute minimum possible number to qualify as &quot;hundreds,&quot; which would be 200.  200 divided by 40 is 5.  60 divided by 5 is 12.  You're telling us that you install a new AMD CPU every 12 minutes?  It takes far longer to build or diagnose and repair a system than that.  There's only a few possibilities here:  You're grossly  exaggerating, or you're just plain lying.  There's also the very outside chance that you work at a factory where the systems are made in mass and you just install a few things while others do the rest.  In which case, you'd never know if the systems worked anyway, or the cause of the failures.  Whichever it is, I reiterate, stop misrepresenting the facts.<br />

And www.pricewatch.com for component shopping.  They have decent standards for stores before allowing them to list, and the prices are fantastic.</div></div><hr />
