It has been hard and I am praying this will actually happen but it seems to be... maybe... hoefully... oh please Tunare let it be so... I am so tired of school... I just want a long summer vacation with my family to recharge the batteries and then we will have to see where the wind takes me... no plans yet for fall... my best guess will be a four year university for my BA but we'll see how I feel after these last two weeks...<br />
<br />
Just two weeks... &quot;goggles in disbelief&quot; I hope they go by fast, fast, fast so that I can get OUT of here and on with my life.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Simas</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hell yeah, congratulations!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaraxel</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'll get there, keep up the good work and faith!<br />
<br />
I've found that having some high sugar snack, like candies, during the exam helps a little, but that's just me.. I like Dextrose from most Chinese grocery stores, nice white powder in the middle.. (no, it's powder sugar, really!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Congratulations. Keep studying hard, but you're on the downward slope.<br />
<br />
It really feels good to get that piece of paper that says you've accomplished something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jorana</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Congrats and well done.  I have my sheepskin on the wall in my office.  I take pride in it and remember all the hard work I put into it.<br />
<br />
Cram nights consisted of Jolt Cola and sugary snacks.  It is a wonder I still have my waistline.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Auriane</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I have my parents send me chocolate from home... Toffifee is a favorite... as for my waistline... well I can always exercize after exams are over and I have time for my horse again. Favorite trick... NOT studying the night before... that night is for relaxing, if you don't know it by then, don't bother... I have never been able to pull an all nighter in my entire life. Personally the night before exams is when I rent movies or hang with friends to keep the edge of hysteria... and other interesting feelings that come with exams. The worst one will be math... with numerical dyslexia I pray for a C in statistics.</div></div><hr />

numerical dyslexia = dysgraphia  Actually, I believe it is called Dyscalcula. My mother has it.<br />
Dyscalcula (http://www.bda-dyslexia.org.uk/press/z04sci.htm)</div></div><hr />

Unless you've graduated from college or University you can never know what its like.<br />
<br />
I can still remeber it and it the best part was knowing that once that final exam was finished I had a job waiting for me and all I could think about was how perfect life was :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mrchiss</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am 37 so I've not been in school for a while but I still have school related dreams where I have been skipping class all semester and think I missed an exam or things of that nature.<br />
<br />
The best part is when you realize it is just a dream and can relax.<br />
<br />
Congratulations!    School is hard!</div></div><hr />
