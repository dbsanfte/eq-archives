<br />
Does anyone have some info on how this quest is completed?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorobei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yea, i finished it yesterday since i was stuck home cause of the snow. For us shaman it ends with an earring that adds +3 to wis, and is a light source, it also might add some HP but i can't remember.<br />
<br />
  Is there any specific part you're stuck on? for the most part if you can't find someplace in the city, ask one of the froggy guides that walks around, or even the city guards will give you directions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Poly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Who do i hail in lorekeepers pit and whats the next step?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gorobei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Check your journal(i love that thing!), whoever sent you to the next person would have said, i believe its the first frog you see when you enter the lorekeeper's pit though.  He'll send you out into the swamp to find a piece of parchment that he lost in the battle to take Grobb. The paper will spawn on the ground somewhere near the guard posts, either to the left near the merchant, or i foundd mine to the right slightly down the zone wall from the two guards on the shore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Poly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ok, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vashanti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What about the &quot;traitor's tongue&quot; that the Lokta fellow in the Assembly asks for? <br />
<br />
I've been all over Innothule and haven't figured out who the NPC they mean would be... :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Near the entrance to Guk is a wandering froggie named &quot;Froglok Traitor&quot;.  Around 5th level mebbe, drops the tongue.</div></div><hr />
