<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Romp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been playing for about 2 years now and doing the class shuffle..starting up a class working to 30s or 40s and then switching to a diff class;&gt; Played all but chanter &amp; Mage and some two or three times over;&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
I want to settle down on one that I have chosen between Druid, Beastlord or Shaman due to my more solo playtime.<br />
<br />
I currently have a level 30 ogre shammy, 30 iksar beast and a 15 woody druid.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am a casual player so grouping is not always easy to do as I play late hours.<br />
<br />
<br />
What would you advise with the following equipment:<br />
<br />
Fungi tunic,Fungal staff, PSC, Keshak Kettar, SoS,Heirophant Cloak, REI, I listed the above among others that I have as those pieces are pretty class impacting.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am leaning to shaman or Beast as the druid would be fun at lowers levels with the high regen spells and items..but for longterm the equipement would not be as important.<br />
<br />
For Shammy or Beast (except for fungi BP too bad), I could probably use the equipement more efficiently.<br />
<br />
Just wanted your thoughts to what would fit my playstyle and use of equipement saved up?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All depends on what you like to do.<br />
<br />
If you don't mind doing damage slowly and taking a while to kill mobs go with the shaman.<br />
<br />
If you want to be able to kill quicker, have a lot more variety of damage, and meelee go BL.<br />
<br />
IF you're lucky enough to find one you could always sell/trade your fungi and some extra gear for a fungus patch vest for the BL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Never played a beastlord before so I cant really say if they would be more enjoyable, but both shaman and bl regardless will be better/more fun than the druid.<br />

I dont think you'll be sorry, youve already passed most of the hard times (20s) and just a little left until the pet at 34.  After trying many of the other classes, I would never choose anything else as the best class in the game.  Here are some positive aspects of being a shaman:<br />
<br />
Shaman are extremely versitle because of their spell lines (super ease of travel).  I think you will enjoy playing one and you will always be able to solo with one regardless of level.  Groups at higher level are extremely easy to find in case you want to group.  And we get lots of fun toys (the fungi alone is worth keeping the shaman and will make you level much faster).  JBB at 45 will help you level even faster up through the low 50s.  Epic is great for helping soloability.</div></div><hr />
