<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just thought it might be worth a shot to see if Sony might consider getting rid of the Emerald requirement for Avatar (the level 60 spell) since they removed the requirement for Peridots from cleric Symbols, Temp, and Aegolism spells.  <br />
<br />
Since the spell probably never sees any use in its current form, this could at least be something for the people who are just getting close to level 60.  I know I would be much more inclined to cast it from time to time (when I can scribe it), if it didn't cost a 16 pp gem to cast every 6 minutes!<br />
<br />
Anyone else think this isn't asking too much?  Anyone have some connections in Sony or mind passing this idea along to the the main EQ board?  I can't get to the official forums from work unfortunately.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There really are 2 main factors in fixing stuff, priority and repair-difficulty. I think a big reason there are so many broken, unfinished quests is that they just dont wish to put resources into fixing them, because it would be hard to fix them, and they arent THAT important in the overall scheme of the game. But something like this could be fixed in a blink, probably, so its not an unreasonable request, IMHO.</div></div><hr />

Avatar does still require an emerald component. This spell can be researched.<br />

Two different spells with the same effect.</div></div><hr />

That was changed after the spell research went in, something about no drop items and all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">PA could be researched, but the resulting spell was still no drop :) <br />

<br />
Since they took the peridot cost from Aegolism, the emerald cost remaining in avatar is particularly stupid.  Both spells are outdated and useless.  The fact that they didn't change both at the same time demonstrates their utter lack of familiarity with the shaman spell line.<br />
<br />
Of course, this results from the same thinking that Foramorm displayed above.  Since each raid requires 5-30 clerics, and exactly zero shaman - the needs of the MANY far outweigh the needs of the few.  Shamans really shouldn't get any attention, according to that 'logic', because we're just so much rarer than clerics.<br />
<br />
(sorry if the sarcasm is a little thick there, I just hate it when the kind of thinking that is destroying us leeches onto our own forums)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yeah, I've just come to accept that I will never acquire an ancient spell, and I would include Primal Avatar in that list.  Heck, I am probably going to have a rough time pulling enough people together to finish my epic, much less get keyed for zones where ancient spells drop.<br />
<br />
I don't care too much for the attitude that everyone that plays is 65 (or higher now), or will be PL'd to 65 in a couple of days.  For casual gamers that can only play 15-20 hours per week, in 3 hour sessions, things before 65 actually do have some meaning.</div></div><hr />

Don't let the population of messageboards fool you, the average player level is what, 52? And far more people are below 65 than are at or above.<br />

Messageboards populated by the mightiest of the mighty are what brought us the &quot;Oops, we thought you were all level 70&quot; mistake in GoD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They solved that too.  http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5403&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
The rune to get that is droppable.  Within a couple months you'll be able to buy the runes to get it.  The runes seem to drop a lot as well.<br />
<br />
Also, you can kill Zlandicar and Klandicar with 1 group (less even) to get items for your ST key.  Sontalak isn't that hard anymore either.  Avatar is actually harder to get than Ferine Avatar and is likely to be more expensive because it is rarer.  If you can get to level 60, then you're two weeks away from 65 if you're grouping in BoT/HoH with decent players.<br />
<br />
I got ahold of Avatar when I was level 62, and I cast it, oh, 3 times because it's not useful even if it didn't require a reagent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Actually, when I got into researching a fair bit with a friend's c3 bot chanter, I found that the components for avatar were incredibly common, considering the level of the spell.

<br />
What sort of group ?<br />
<br />
Wulfbane</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">It's not my problem you can't put together a solid group to take down a named mob.<br />
Sontalak is 1 groupable.<br />
Klandicar is 1 groupable.<br />
Zlandicar is 1 groupable.<br />
I haven't tried, but I'm 100% confident that Tormax is 1 groupable.<br />
Vindy is 1 groupable.<br />
Statue is 1 groupable.<br />
AoW is 3 groupable easily, and probably 2 groupable now.<br />
Multiple mobs in WToV also drop keys, and at least 1 of them is 1 groupable.<br />
There's a componentless avatar out there, which is what you asked for.<br />
If you aren't keyed for a zone that's SEVEN expansions old that's been around for at least 3 YEARS, that's your own damn fault for not trying hard enough to get keyed.<br />
There are multiple 1 groupable mobs that can be killed with any group consisting of:<br />
tank<br />
healer<br />
4 other group members<br />
On top of that, there are alternate versions of the spells besides just the one in Sleepers (ancient spell and 65 spell).<br />
The 65 one is the crappiest of the shaman 65 spells, and is not hard in any way to acquire nowadays with the number of people farming ele planes every day, and with the random rune drops off misc 1 groupable named.<br />
The ancient one is not difficult to acquire either if your guild is doing any raiding in VT, though if you aren't commited enough to get yourself keyed for Sleepers, I can't see you getting keyed for a zone that actually takes a bit of effort to get.<br />
And even if you are skipping getting the ancient spell, it's not much of an issue, seeing as the 65 spell is faster and easier to get, and is tradable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By one groupable, do you mean 1 groupable of 65's with lots of aa's and equivalent gear?  Or do mean level 60's with 0 aa's and equivalent gear, that would actually have a use for the spell?  Also, are the mobs that drop the spell 1 groupable?  Oh, and what zone did clerics/paladins have to get keyed for to get the component taken away from their spells?</div></div><hr />

I assume by your reply that you haven't ever gotten off your ass and even *tried* to kill them to see how tough they are.  Ever thought about trying something with some friends and seeing how tough it is?<br />
<br />
Just for the record, the last time I went to help kill Klandicar, it was when I was equiped in ele plane gear, along with the rest of our group.  We had 2 rangers, me, a paladin tank, a cleric, and some random 6th group member.  The cleric ended the fight with over 50% mana, and I had about 30% due to spam healing everying.  I would say that a group of 65s with about 100aas and a full set of ornate (bazaar quality gear) would beat Klandicar.<br />
<br />
There are 3 alternate versions of the spell already out there that don't have the spell component, one of which is generally cheaper to buy, tradable, and easier to find someone selling it.  Stop whining about this 4 year old non-issue.</div></div><hr />

Wahay nice to know a group of 65s with 100 AA's and a full set of ornate could beat him.<br />
Its a ****ing level 60 spell all the original poster was asking for was to lose the Emerald reagent im sorry you find that such a &quot;non&quot; issue.<br />
There are level 60 Shaman out there you know.The game isnt populated by just lvl 65 Time and GoD equipped Shaman.<br />
Some people spend time levelling not just rushing through the level so  they can eat their way through the higher level content.<br />
Why does it piss you off so much that he should ask for this ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">The upgrade to primal avatar is the reward for being keyed for the zone and raiding it once.  From what I've seen it drops usually at least once on a raid, and a good chance of dropping multiple times in total.<br />
<br />
Back when I got keyed for the zone, you have to have an entire raid of 24ish people to even think about killing Klandicar.  To kill Sontalak, well, he'd wipe raids of 60+ people easily enough.  Plus, even when the key dropped, you had to random it among all the people still needing the key so there was high competition for getting keyed.<br />
<br />
The guy wants the easy way out.  He wants the reward without putting in the effort.  The key droppers are all single groupable with decently well geared level 60s.  They are easy raids with level 60 people, if you have about 12-18 people depending on the target, considering the gear you can buy in the bazaar now.  The mobs that drop the spell itself are also as difficult.  Damn straight I'm going to complain that this noobie wants a free copy of a spell I had to raid key dropping mobs for months to be able to get my copy.  The rewards you get should be based on th effort you put in.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I have primal avatar.<br />
<br />
I have never cast primal avatar after the one and only time when I discovered the approxamatly 45 minute recast time on it.<br />
<br />
however if a pc gnome died every time I cast regular avatar I would spend days chain casting it, after of course I snagged a copy.<br />
<br />
so leave the emerald and add the gnome thing and the avatar will be a nice spell.</div></div><hr />

I bet that the necro's ask for the 'dot to be taken away but in the grand sceme of things, the peridot is about as valuable as the emerald and the need for the component is not really warrented imo.<br />
<br />
All the post was intended on doing was get Avatar added to the list on non issue, non essentail spells that were considered for removal of their comonents.<br />
<br />
YES its a non issue, but its is a somewhat valid point, somewhere in the grand sceme of things.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I get more upset by the stupid short duration / long recast time thing with the Avatar line. Christ on a skateboard, would it break the game to give it a 30 minute duration and a 15 second recast time?<br />
<br />
I know that if you are on the pace, you can keep ferine avatar up on a full group and a couple of pets (thank the tribunal for extended enhancement), but that really isn't the point - it is a pain in the ass, and a pointless pain in the ass too. That we can do it does not mean that we should have to. Given all the other spells that are now in the game and given where the top end tanking classes are now at, avatar is pretty much &quot;froth&quot; anyway, so at least it could be made into &quot;easy to use froth&quot;.<br />
<br />
I would like to see the duration and recast time similar to, say, VotB (which I still use in preference to avatar just because of the recast time).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I agree Weyalan.  When I submitted my feedback I also mentioned the duration and the recast time of that line of spells, and how it was unreasonable and how it made them nearly unusable.  I also mentioned the durations of our other buffs that for some reason are shorter than similar spells for Druids or Clerics.  <br />
<br />
I also submitted feedbacks when I was in the OOW beta about our burst healing and how it could use a boost.  <br />
<br />
I don't want to come across as not caring about the major issues, I just thought this issue was such a simple fix and it fit with the sweeping changes they made when OOW went live.  I felt that it may have been overlooked and someone just needed to point it out.</div></div><hr />
