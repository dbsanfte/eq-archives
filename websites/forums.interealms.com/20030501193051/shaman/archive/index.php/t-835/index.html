There is NO question that alchemy is broken..it's expensive, inaccessable, and for the most part useless.  While it will probably never make anyone rich..there are a few tips to making the trip to 180+ a little less painful.<br />
<br />
My answer? Free samples!  I've found that most people don't even know what potions are and what they do!  Combine this with a good follow-up list and you can really help to reduce your out-of-pocket costs.<br />
<br />
On a long-camping raid with your guild (or another guild?) hand out a few titan potions to the high-level gnomes and watch the fun begin! Soon you'll be getting requests for more..and at ONLY 11pp per dose you can at least sell a few stacks of em before they get bored (this is the cheapest way to get to 180+..but it IS boring).<br />
<br />
Greater Potions can be VERY useful for melee's who like to solo.  Potions of Accuracy in particular can have a great deal of utility for a ranger who likes to go out and solo arrow-kite.  You can sell stacks almost double cost..and it saves them the trouble of finding buffers when they're alone out in the Wastes.  Give em one or two to try out..then follow up!<br />
<br />
Other potions..having limited usefulness..you should only make if you KNOW you have a buyer.  My favorites in this catagory are greater potions of heat/cold.  While the buff that this potion gives can be overwritten by certain other cold/heat buffs..it DOES stack with CoW/CoS..and can be a quick mana-less solution for low-level Dragon raiding or for fire epic beasties like Ixblat or the lava swim for the Monk epic.  Make sure that raid leaders, monks, and clerics who need these mobs know that you can make the potions needed on an hour's notice...you'll get the sale (and a repeat customer)..and you'll get the skill-ups.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, we have to work harder and smarter than other classes to get people 'hooked'....but once you have a loyal customer base, your trip gets a lot cheaper.<br />

<br />
Personally, I like using DS potions in a group when we have lots of pulls available, but our damage output is a little lacking--say, when we have a paladin as the main tank. Seeing hit after hit for 31 for 10 or 12 minutes makes it obvious that it's a fair amount of damage for the price, and would be more if the mob wasn't slowed.<br />
<br />
Another thought: You might be surprised at who would be interested in what potions. For example, I find rogues like levitate potions, in case no one's available to cast it when they need it for a CR. Mages and druids will occasionally be interested in damage shield potions--they're like expensive reagents which double the damage of their usual DS's. But most people won't think of it that way unless you helpfully point it out =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yesferatu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I speciallize mainly in damage shield potions and accuracy for soloing  rangers and monks.  If you can find a wealthy one, they will definately pay a few hundred for a 30 point ds, that stacks with their other ones, and extra dex for procs and crits.<br />
<br />
It is a small price to pay when an epic ranger needs to slow something and is lacking in DEX.  <br />
<br />
Monks love it too, they usually dish out a ton, but they can't take it so well, a huge ds helps them out and they keep coming back for it.<br />
<br />
Or, go where the money is...if you are lower mid level, go to guk and sell invis undead potions...folks will pay through the nose to get down there safely.  Or fire resist in Sol B.<br />
<br />
try it</div></div><hr />
