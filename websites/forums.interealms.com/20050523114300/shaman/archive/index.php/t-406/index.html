In the last patch Slow spells for both Enchanters and Shamans were altered so that they now have disease counters.  Has this made them into a spell which can now be removed by Cure Disease instead of Cancel Magic?<br />
<br />
Yes, that was the goal behind the change to the spell lines.<br />
<br />
Getting slowed by an NPC is incredibly debilitating to players, and up until now you either had to just be sad until the spell wore off or risk dispelling all of your positive buffs while trying to remove the slow.  This change should add value to classes that can cure disease and make the spell line more useful. <br />
<br />
We are aware that there is a problem with slow spells generating additional agro due to the disease component, and hope to have that fixed in the next spells patch.<br />

Note that even though these are a 'disease' instead of a magical debuff they still save against Magic for the purposes of resists (with the exception of Plague of Insects).</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's also good to know I wasn't crazy back when I posted that slow generating more agro thread!  <br />
<br />
Now I just wonder what they meant by &quot;Next spells patch.&quot; <br />
<br />
This seems to hint that it might not necessarily be fixed in the &quot;next patch.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xantrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It probably just means the next time they push a new SPDAT to the servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm just wondering how they will fix it. If they just reduce the number of counters (by a LOT), it would be great. If they instead reduce the aggro caused by disease counters, it seems like SKs would be pissed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Being &quot;aware&quot; of a problem and taking active measures to fix it are two different things.<br />
<br />
I am &quot;aware&quot; I need to run more. That does not mean I am turning in 5 milers every day.</div></div><hr />
