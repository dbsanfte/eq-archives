<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shlob</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey everyone was just curious where slugworms drop the most. i need them for aug ubaerfying and im not buying them for 45K a piece. i know they drop off trash in WoS and are very rare but hoping someother place have some also. thanx in advanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've gotten 2 in harbinger's spires off the named on the first floor... there's a strat around here somewhere for them...gotten 3 in Bloodfields off the golems that are in the first field out of DS....gotten a few in odd groups in WoS/NC/RCoD off random named.<br />
<br />
I've never gotten a trean fly, but i did get 1 discordant scoriae in NC off a named back by the bonecrusher dude.<br />
<br />
It seems that all the alchemy drops are rares off named through out OoW but are a little less rare the higher the mob is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shlob</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thanx for quick reply will go play in harrbringers.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">45K could sell almost instanty on Rodcet.  The general price for them has been closer to 70-80 for them, but has been dropping a bit lately.<br />
<br />
Ive gotten my hands on 4 or 5 slugworks since OOW shipped.  1 came from DS expeditions and 4 came from RCoD (1 from instanced sewer, rest from regular zone).  Have also had 2 Discordant Sciorie drop from RCoD as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i find this funny.. im swimming in trean flies...20 odd treeanic acid... cant get slug worms for love nor money... wanna trade?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Slowd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have seen them drop in WoS - 3 spawn.<br />
<br />
I have also bought them two other times.<br />
<br />
It is a bit of a let down to fail 3 times and have max Alchemy and Alchemy Mastery.<br />
<br />
I spent 20K on Slugworm.<br />
Then I spent 30K on another.<br />
<br />
I have some bad luck I guess.<br />
<br />
Sadly, I have the black inlay gold just can't make the first step of the augment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">All of the augment components are extremely rare drops off of anything in OoW. I've seen them drop from random trash mobs and named.<br />
<br />
until you GM alchemy and max tradeskill AA's, you'd be better off selling/saving your drops until you get them. I'm working on getting myself VT keyed simply to get the &lt;a href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12413&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Umbracite Swarm Orb&lt;/a&gt;, which, with all AAs and maxed skill, will give you a 90%-ish (89.somerandomdecimalhere actually lol) chance on combine success, which is FAR above anyone else's chance with augs.<br />
<br />
that kind of tradeskill power can make you very rich, very fast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I make money off making White &amp; Black Inlayed Gold.   Just none in Alchemy its seems.   And I am better suited for Alchemy ... go figure.<br />
<br />
I wonder if rogues with poison trade skills have a better chance at making an augment?  Rogues can get to 255 in poison trade skills right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Search bar is you friend!<br />
<br />
And you are incorrect.<br />
Rogue trivials are in the 300+<br />
Shaman trivials are in the 200+<br />
Since shaman can use skill mods to the full benefit, we have much better 'total' skill available.<br />
<br />
Just wish Sony hadn't gotten rid of the philosophger's stone,, that item was nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>KB1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">According to EQtraders a Shaman with max Alchemy AA and even just the philospopher stone has a slightly better chance at making an augment. Now it was iver a week ago I read that though so may have changed. I can't find the thred after a quick glance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Umbracite Swarm Orb, which, with all AAs and maxed skill, will give you a 90%-ish (89.somerandomdecimalhere actually lol) chance on combine success, which is FAR above anyone else's chance with augs.<br />
<br />
<br />
this not only includes shammies, but rogues as well...I don't have exact numbers on hand, but I believe they max succes somewhere in the 68-75% range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Have seen Scoriea and Slugworms in RCoD more than any other zone, and I spent an equal amount of time in WoS and PG.<br />
<br />
I personally have a rogue friend do my aug combines, since I didnt feel like investing the AA in advancing Alchemy and Salvage. He did his TS AAs, so I give him all the stuff I get (he makes for guildies, we all pass him stuff, and make &quot;future possible requests&quot; and he does what he can). Works good for us, and allows me to concentrate my AA where I need it, NUKES! (joking)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Do you experts have a good source for the base augments, as well? I've been holding a Slugworm &amp; Scoriae for months looking for a Kyanite to operate on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">well, you can farm &quot;flowstones&quot; in DS, easily.<br />
<br />
but for pretty much any drop it really seems that the instanced dungeons yield the best drop rate, but I'm just taking that from the experience of my friends.<br />
<br />
I've seen drops in WoS/MPG/RSS. not very great in any of the zones.<br />
<br />
RCoD sewers I believe is the favored dungeon type.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Brohg, your slugworms will do you no good whatsoever on your aug. You need trean flies. Sell the slugworm &amp; auction to buy kyanite. Ditch MPG, RSS &amp; CoA if you want augment drops. WoS, RCoD, NC, HS, .... thats where the components seem to drop.. Instances seem to me a good source too.<br />
<br />
<br />
Since moving on to MPG &amp; RSS, I have been getting skunked on aug stuff. GD dichotomy my ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Weeeeell, crap. Trean Flies, huh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Weeeeell, crap. Trean Flies, huh?<br />
Stones use Slugworms, Gems use Flies. <br />
<br />
On a brighter note, flies are BY FAR the most common of the various non-aug parts of the combines. They are under 10K on my server, along wiht Dust of Discord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">ummm... slugworms and dust of discord go together<br />
<br />
and discordant scoriae and trean flies go together..<br />
<br />
it's the difference between a lvl 4 and 5 spell focus aug or a lvl 2 and 3 melee focus aug.<br />
<br />
the stone type has NOTHING to do with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Oh yeah, I remember it now. Scoriea and Dust are lvl 5 and lvl 4 focus.<br />

Actually that's wrong. You use slugworm acid to etch flowstones. You use treanic acid to etch gems. Then you either combine with a white gold or black gold inlay, which use dust of discord, or discordant scoriae, respectively.</div></div><hr />

Most strange thing ever last night.  I have never gotten a slugworm ever to drop.  Then last night I'm on as my BL killing around the castle in DS for faction.  There is that one named guy that drops the shield and gloves down on the bottom.  Behind that building are two kyv mobs.  Killed both and BOTH dropped slugworms.  Killed up on the wall and everything kyv/ukun I could find the rest of the night and didn't see another.  It was just really odd that two mobs in a row dropped it when I had never seen one before.  GO GO RNG for random mob drops!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">grats, they are extremely rare to begin with, you either have an aug or two, or you're rich. take your pick :)</div></div><hr />

None of the ones that are best for shamans are good enough to use a lower level, but sellable ones are, like Cleave 2, Ferocity 2, etc.</div></div><hr />
