<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been playing EQ for over 2.5 years now and until recently have been taking a slow approach to leveling. I'm getting very close to the rest of my guild and I just want to get another 5 levels to make the difference so that I can actually group with my friends/familiy regularly.<br />
<br />
Here's my magelo, any suggestions.<br />

<br />
A lot of the time I pretty much have to solo because people above my level are in PoP and a lot of times it's hard for me to get into a group at my level in PoP. I do have a level 51 rogue I group with regularly so if you have a recommendations for a rogue/shaman combo hunting spot that is good too. BTW I do have remove curse, so if Scarlet Desert is really good xp, the curses they cast aren't a big deal.<br />
<br />
Thanks again brother shamans, I await your opinions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Soriathus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Craptastic, I have 2 profiles, I actually made this one WAY back in the day when I was a newb, hehe. I guess I'll use this one instead of the other one so I don't have cookie problems with the KoE board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">duo seafuries with the rogue.  Well, assuming you can take the heat of the agro.<br />
<br />
duo/solo in lguk.<br />
<br />
Maybe DSP rockhoppers.  I soloed them at 52 or 53 or something, you could probably duo them now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">if your server is like mine...don't do rockhoppers in DSP.  Every time I'm soloing/duoing in there, there are people arguing over the rockhoppers and what constitutes a camp and how many spawns each group/person is allowed to have, etc...<br />
<br />
Reminds me waaay to much of the mentality from LOIL and DL.<br />
<br />
Of course, since I'm not doing rockhoppers myself, I just usually turn /ooc off so I don't have to listen to it.</div></div><hr />
