<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Willowwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A while ago a former guildmate and cool comrade gave to me a gift.  Rather than sell it since doing so makes me feel bad I'd like to give it as a gift to any young KoE Bard that can use it.  It is a Sainy's Claw 6dmg 19dly 7dmg bonus 3int 10ac.  The only reason I have it is because of Fal giving it to me, second I have some nice items that replaced it thanks to KoE.  If you'd like it see me in game, drop an email at willowwing@hotmail.com or leave a private message.  This weapon is awesome especially mixed with a bard only haste song.  <br />
<br />
I also will be offering my skills as a Grandmaster smith to anyone in the next couple of weeks.  If you want small or medium plate leave me a message.  I'm gonna do a cash run in Rathe Mountains soon and will attempt to raise my skill in smithing up to 200 on my smith character.  The rates I give to VA members is only 10-15pp above my cost even if I fail examples are:<br />
Fine Steel BP- my cost 80pp- your cost 90pp and if you bring me materials all armor is free since you are paying for me to increase my skills.</div></div><hr />
