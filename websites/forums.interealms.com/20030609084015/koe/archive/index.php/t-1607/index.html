Primaries have first dibs, but alot of this stuff is 'twink' materials.  <br />
( also, I have a 25th level Iksar Monk who would gladly accept any Twink Donations :) )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Arsecn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just for your information...  as long as i've been in this guild I have received a few hand me downs and have not been asked to pay anything...  I am not asking anything in return as well, only that primaries have their choice at any gear (prolly resist if anything) but secondary also...<br />
<br />
After a week or so i will sell and save pp for resist gear ( ie diamond and blue diamond stuff the guild has been turning in...  im sure the other components must cost something)  I'm all for recycling guild stuff as i have experienced it firsthand.  Thanks KoE!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'll contact you in game for some of this stuff. I have a 18 Troll SK I am working on named Zral.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I keep missing you Arsecn or are in the middle of a raid or CR. I'll contact you in game and see what you have left. I might be able to use one of the robes for resists and some of the SK stuff for my SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Arsecn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">okies Chad... wurmie is yours.  CCS to Baracus (unless he wants the other Blackened Crystaline Robe i got last night!  ...one on my secondary, one on arsecn) and then SK stuff for whoever gives me a tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Baracus Baraculous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I will take / buy any enc items that you can spare. I got 13 and 14 with him, and I sense some more levels are coming. Fun class. Anything that you got that he can use would be appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thank you much Arsecn for the robe, shield, and vambraces. I really appreciate it. The robe is very handy for resists since my Apothic robe has no resists. I'll be wearing this my next trip to ToV. :)</div></div><hr />
