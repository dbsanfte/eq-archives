<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My son has stopped playing the game so I have taken over his account (which I was paying for anyway). His main is a level 63 shadowknight. I would appreciate advice on how to play this character so I do not screw up royally.<br />
<br />
What are my main group functions?<br />
What spells are my best friends?<br />
What is the best way to solo and what zones are good for this?<br />
Are there specific pieces of gear that I should seek to own?<br />
What should my hotkey setup be?<br />
Are there any good SK websites?<br />
Any other advice except for selling the account on ebay?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Probably a better place to ask the rest of your questions. Personally, I think shadowknights are a myth made-up by paladins. All that niceness and goody-goody stuff has to get to them sometimes and they wig out.</div></div><hr />

You main group functions are to pull and tank. On raids it will be to mostly assist and split tank as necessary. <br />
<br />
At 64 I have up <br />
1) Death Peace (our best feign)<br />
2) Rotating Slot- Mental Corruption *50 health 100 mana*<br />
Shroud of Death *50 health, good for disease immune mobs* <br />
Deathly Temptation *life to heath*<br />
Replace Shroud of Death with Shoud of Chaos if your son has it<br />
3) Torrent of Hate -Steals Attack and gives it to the group<br />
4) Festering Darkness - Another important spell. Great for holding aggro as it's a weak dot + snare<br />
5) Aura of Pain - Does 200 dd which can crit and steals a good chunk of ac<br />
6) Touch of Volatis - 350 Lifetap which can crit from nukes or Theft of Life for bigger heals<br />
7) Zevfeer's Bite - 200 point group heal + mana can also crit and can exceptional heal for every member of your part at the same time. <br />
8) Spear of Decay, or Deny Undead. <br />
<br />
The only hotkeys I'd worry about are Assist, Incoming, and a /attack off /cast # /cast # /cast # for feign. This is because it tends to fizzle a bit and having it try and cast 3 times will save you some hassles. <br />
<br />
The major gear piece for most SK's is the prenerf Circlet of Shadows. It has unlimited charges of insta cast gather shadows. It's a fantastic tool if you can find one for sale. <br />
<br />
Soloing is possible but most find it more hassle than it's worth. The general strat is to aggro with dots and run while your pet kills the mob from behind. Since SK pets are really really weak you have to constantly watch that it doesn't get aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Playing an SK is pretty easy.  Basically any of your atk taps, dots, or snares will hold aggro very well.  Festering darkness is amazing for aggro, since it casts so fast.  Ayestole casts slower, but is just an absurd amount of aggro.<br />
<br />
Apart from aggro, you are also going to want to use your atk taps to help increase the DPS of the melees in your group, and clinging darkness to help with heals and mana regen.  Just remember to pace yourself so that you don't go oom, which can cause problems in maintaining aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hemmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just as a heads up, that SK site that was linked is a wealth of information, just look around first before asking questions, most of what you need to know can be found easily with the search function.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gimmel Greatheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Make sure you have a thick skin if you plan on posting anything on shadowknight.org. Civility is not a strong point there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hasnt been much of a strong point here lately either.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">well my brother plays a shadowknight for a long time now, and he has said that one of the more understood rules on that board is go out and expariment your self. as in dont ever ask for something like &quot;how do you do somethignorother&quot; or &quot;howdo you break a camp&quot;. but that could just the people that where on there from before shadowknights where even realy considered good for anything besides aggro =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&quot;What are my main group functions?&quot;<br />
<br />
Split-tank adds and keep the aggro offa me and my wimpy caster friends. :)<br />
<br />
I die significantly less on raids with aware knights and LOVE having these guys in a group because they can grab aggro by the teats and swing it around.</div></div><hr />
