I think everyone needs to come to the realization that everything, and i mean everything, in this game is a time sink, much like getting shissar keys...some of u know what i'm talking about.  Getting torpor is the same thing.  The time sink maybe money or camping mobs that drop the spell.  Its the way they hook us.  <br />
<br />
My advice is to get your guild or friends to go and farm emp in seb.  And i'm talking about massive farmage...24/7 no one sleeps until it drops.  <br />
<br />
I know how fustrating getting our class defining spells are, but keep the faith.  In my opinion, with torpor, u can easily make back 90k in no time.  Torpor has given me the ability to get me into areas/zone and given me the opportunities to loot rare items, and to sell them for a premium.<br />
<br />
Stay strong and dont give up.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Yes I am aware that there is a rare Wizzie spell. And a rare Druid spell (Regrowth of the Grove?) Regrowth dropped off of a Jugg the other night.<br />

sorry, but prices for Torpor/Malo are so high because of 2 things:<br />
<br />
1. Those are wanted spells that make or break a shaman at lvl 60.<br />
And more important<br />
2. People really pay those prices.<br />
<br />
We have an open, uncontrolled market in EQ ... I can't blame those people trying to get the maximum cash. I can only blame the shamans that buy at those prices.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">There is only one true reason why the cost is so high. DROP RATE!<br />
<br />
Shaman spells are easily the rarest spells to drop from any high end encounter. I've raided ToV, Western Wastes, Old Sebilis(Juggs/Reets/Emp) and many other high end zones. Well over 100 raids and I've seen exactly one shaman spell drop - Focus of Spirit in Western Wastes.<br />
<br />
It's just ridiculous. What does VI have against Shaman? If Torpor and Malo dropped as often as Wizard and Mage spells, they would be 10k each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">after 100 raids you've seen one shm spell? you must have amazingly bad luck! in fact, it's so bad i dont believe you :)<br />
<br />
few hours in ww and you got 16 copies of c4 and focus and start destroying them.<br />
few hours at juggs and the chance of NOT getting any shm spell at all=basically zero.<br />
<br />
i sold my last copy of torpor for 40k, if people pay it, i'm more than happy to sell to them at that price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I would tend to agree that it's no one's fault but the buyers.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, if you're not rich, you're not going to get what you want if it's semi rare.  I'm a fairly rich guy.  I pay those prices.  I perpetuate the system.  I paid one guy 35k for malo.  Next copy he gets, he's not gonna put it up for auction for less than that.  He knows he can get more.  And because people like me say &quot;it's only money.  I can get more money, but very few people have a full spellbook,&quot; you're going to have this problem.<br />
<br />
Suck it up.  100k is easy to get if you're smart.  And no, I don't mean farming hill giants.  Money comes and goes, but not all your friends have all their spells.  Be the one that does, and then you never have to worry about crap like this again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">i'm not sure the problem is droprate, it's rather that most other classes arent so singularly reliant on one specific spell. lotta people of other classes without full spellbook, but they are rarely vital(of course there might be a droprate problem, but after changing torpor droprate like twice? they should know if theres a difference between it and other 60 spells)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I think Torpor drops more often than before, but it will take some time for the people to realize the change and stop hoarding them for future guild Shaman. Then the spells will hit the market more and the prices will drop accordingly when all those long-waiting and desperate Shaman have left the open market.<br />
<br />
Ive known many Shaman that had no Torpor whatsoever. Since the Spell drop changes, I personally know 3 people (me included) that were able to trade for the spell and my old guild got two drops of Torpor in two weeks Trakanon hunting.<br />
<br />
What hurted us before was the rarity. What hurts us now is the perception of rarity - and with it the inflated prices.<br />
<br />
At least that is what I hope, that the Shaman spell prices will go down to the normal value of other classes in the next months.</div></div><hr />

It is not right that our two essential spells are so insanely rare.  No other class even comes close to getting soaked so badly on the price of their spells.<br />
<br />
Please, please, please consider improving the drop rates or implementing spell quests.  There are not enough copies coming into the game for the number of shaman playing.<br />

I'll happily bash VI for the drop rates, but I personally should do more to earn the spells (I currently have less than 20pp to my name after a recent spending spree updating gear, oh and alchemy).<br />

Primal Avatar I will never see, because the warders no longer spawn on Fennin Ro. All the rest are so insanely rare, I never see them for sale in the bazaar. I saw Torpor for sale once for 50k. By the time I borrowed enough plat to buy it, it was already sold.<br />

As far as 100+ raids and one Shaman spell drop, I should clarify. I've seen Cann4 and Talisman spells drop many times, but only one level 59/60 shaman spell - Focus of Spirit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1)  Primal Avatar still drops off the remaining named in ST, I got mine after the Sleeper was awakened on Emarr.<br />
<br />
2)  I'm not sure about EB, but Levitation is not difficult to get at all.  It drops off one mob, not far from the entrance to the Deep.  He is a 20 minute spawn, with placeholders.  I've never seen the camp occupied and my guild farms it often for guildies.  This is definitely one of those spells that you CAN just go get if you want it.  Considering how many classes can scribe it, it shouldn't be too hard to get a group together to go camp it, exp is also good in that area.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly my point! He's the only one selling it. Doesn't that make it rare? If he had competition for selling the spell, the price would drop. He obviously knows it is a needed spell, so wants to make a lot of money. If there were 10 other people selling the same spell, the prices would drop significantly.<br />
<br />
It's all about Supply and Demand. The Demand is obvious and the Supply is very limited. If the drop rate was increased, the prices would drop. I guarantee it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>ryse_eq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I do believe the spell drops have increased in the past few weeks.  For the first time, I posted to sell Malo in the bazaar for around 20k and it sold fairly fast.  Unfortunately, today when I saw what was for sale... some mule was selling torpor for 100kp.<br />
<br />
I wish you luck to all the shaman out there who still need torpor and malo.  I know I went 3months into oracle without torpor.... which I hunted every damn day (pested guilds.. man-whored around... camped seb every second) and was able to finally buy it for 20k.  As for malo, after 5months of searching... some friends were able to get it for me off emp in seb.</div></div><hr />

The Mystical Order is probably the top guild on Fennin and last I heard, their spell mule was auctioning to buy Torpor and Malo for their members. If a guild that routinely kills in Vex Thall has to buy these spells, I would have to accept the rarity.</div></div><hr />

First off you have the big uber guilds who have said spells and have moved on to mobs that dont drop kunark spells so they have no flow.  So if they get a loss of a caster here and a twink to replace it here or whatever they have to find the spells for that character so instead of going backwards they just use some of thier riches to buy from the up and comers that are currently at kunark dragon stages or at velious stages but still keeling spell dropping mobs.  But these up and coming guilds need to outfit thier own members so they go into hording mode, if they get the drops.  a big vicious circle.  At least that is how I see it.  I dont think the up and coming are too interested in VP as &quot;better&quot; loot can be gotten a heck of a lot easier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How about my take on this sad, tired, old issue.<br />
<br />
Why shaman spells are so rare. <br />
<br />
It's not the supply, it's the demand.<br />
<br />
First off, everyone's 60 now. The game is old, and even casual players hit 60. Second, there are many newer 60s because IT'S SO DAMN EASY TO LEVEL WITH EQW AND RAMPANT 2BOXING. Lastly, for some reason, MOST newly dinged 60 shaman didn't go thru hunting in mm/sol a/old CT &gt; lguk/sol b/oot &gt; killing naggy-vox &gt; kc/os/hs/char &gt; kael/sg/tov/dn and accumulating the wealth and drops that come from that path. The game instead now is a race to 60. I've seen and talked to WAY too many newer 60 shaman that went loio &gt; ot &gt; dl &gt; sf/wl/grey, many with their monk bot. Gee, and after hunting outdoors solo or 2boxing for 60 levels they are suddenly surprised when they don't have a fungi and the spells they want, nor the means to purchase items that are in demand.<br />
<br />
/fakeshock<br />
/crying a river<br />
<br />
Shaman spells are rare. I agree. I had to buy torpor (traded fungi for it when both were around 35kpp), group focus, VoB and avatar. I am glad I had gear to sell and cash to buy (thx Gornit palo mine~). I was forunate enough to see spells like bane, malo, focus, tigirs, group regrowth, canni 4, etc drop. But I BUSTED MY ASS raiding constantly for a chance at these.<br />
<br />
Ya know what, some wizzy spells are rare. KEI is rare. Primal is rare. The game revolves around item control thru rare drops which leads to repetition of encounters, THUS KEEPING YOU PLAYING. Shock anyone?<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but to those who say I've killed Chottal 100 times and never seen a shaman spell, I say you're lying, because I HAVE killed him 100 times and I've seen a bunch drop. Just don't kill five guardian wurms and say &quot;omg our spells never drop!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ack, I think I've become more jaded than a CoM drop :(</div></div><hr />

Interesting, really. Lemme break this down. I spent 4 levels almost exclusively in OS, untold hours at RH + emp because I liked the loot potential. I can recall 6-7 level 60 shaman spells dropped (3 torpor, 1 avatar, 2 malo for sure). A poor ratio, I admit, though maybe I'm forgetting some.<br />
<br />
Now, this give me a pretty good persective on this camp, and when someone says &quot;I've killed the emporer 289367 times and a shaman spell has never dropped&quot; I can draw on my own experiences and surmise that, perchance, this person is stretching the truth a bit. <br />
<br />
Better?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Yes better.  But there is even the off chance that someone &quot;could&quot; be that unlucky.  And also that ratio is not poor... its horrible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Zaspacer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">&quot;What rare other spells? I have got 5 copies of &quot;Wind of Tashianian&quot; on my account. Bard song? Comp of Ervaj - think I have two.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'll take a $100 spell that works over a $0.10 song that is useless.<br />
<br />
If it's any consolation most bards have to buy their epics.<br />
(NOTE: bard epic is widely regarded as the make/break item for bards)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Orakul, Thanks for the advice, but I have already asked RoA, TKR, DoA, TMO, and all the others I can find. I commonly group with their members in FG. None of them have any of the spells I need. :\<br />
<br />
Mormegil, I didn't claim 100 kills. I said over 40. Huge difference. My friends are already tired of camping the Emp for me. I've resorted to pick up groups and agreeing to passing on all other loot just to get the camp. I'm up over 50+ kills now and I have finally seen four shaman spells drop - Acumen, Talisman of the Brute and Bane of Nife(x2). All spells I already have and none of them level 59/60 spells. I already have Malo, but would love to see that drop so I can trade it for Torpor.<br />
<br />
All in all, I still think Shaman spells are rarer than other classes. This may be a false perception, because I don't play other classes. I do know that in my time at Emp camp, I have seen half a dozen copies of Sunstrike and three copies of Emmisary of Thule, which are supposed to be rare if you ask a wizard or necro. The rarity issue is further complicated by the fact that Emporer Chottal often drops multiple spells. I have seen three at once on several kills.</div></div><hr />

Total agreement.<br />
<br />
It's not the person selling Torpor that drives the price to 90k...its the Shaman that BUYS Torpor for 90k that drives the price that high. <br />
<br />
With apologies Sir, Total Disagreement.<br />
<br />
You can go to bazaar and get Mala (the mage not-so-good version of Malo) for 25pp because there are dozen copies for sale.  People sell it to vendors after a juggs run.  If the drop rates for Malo and Mala were reversed, so would the prices.<br />
