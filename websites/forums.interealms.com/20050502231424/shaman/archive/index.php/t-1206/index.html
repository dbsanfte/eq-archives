<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mcdunno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've decided to put my alt on giant faction, and currently have him ally with kromzek, amiable+ with kromiff, but I'm still KOS with Tormax faction. Now, my alt is a level 41 ranger, and my guild is on CoV faction, so please don't suggest a Dain or Yelinak kill :)<br />
<br />
Does anyone know of a way to get higher Tormax faction as a lvl 41 ranger? I heard a rumor that there's a mob in the arena area of Kael that you can turn heads into that gives a bigger Tormax adjustment then when you turn them in to Bvellos, but was unable to find one. Is there such a mob, and if so, who and where is he?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nope bvellos is the best one to turn in heads to for tormax faction.<br />
<br />
Mobs you can kill for tormax faction are. Yelinak, Dain, velktor and the royal guards in ice well. Even the royal guards are well beyond what your ranger could kill even in groups. You might be able to tag along someone else's raid just for faction hits but thats about it.<br />
<br />
Heads or paws to bvellos is pretty much it.</div></div><hr />

- You can't solo pull them. They quad/triple. Unslowable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd go with a big solid hell no on that one. Like he said unable to single pull with out feign, hits for 300ish and are unslowable and pretty damm poison and cold resistant too.</div></div><hr />
