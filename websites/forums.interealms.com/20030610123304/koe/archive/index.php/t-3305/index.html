As a class, the warrior is incredibly useful in both group and raid situations, and in fact is often thought of as crucial to making an efficient group. The warrior does have a lot of things going for him now - the highest quality armor, excellent damage output, a large advantage in hit points and actual tanking ability, taunts, stuns &amp; slams, a vast selection of weapons with interesting and useful procs, as well as many useful disciplines. We're quite happy with the role a warrior currently plays in EverQuest, happy enough that we used the warrior as a baseline to measure the performance of other classes as we were balancing. &lt;B&gt;With this round of changes, we will be upping the warrior's taunt skill at level 60 to a cap of 230, to help deal with other classes gain in melee damage.&lt;/B&gt; We'll keep an eye on future changes, to guarantee a warrior always has an important role in the game, but there aren't any immediate class changes we feel are needed to make warriors more effective than they are.<br />

I'm almost amazed that VI finally took their head out of their collective arses.</div></div><hr />

I still think they should up the cap for all levels, but at least it's a start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">By the look of that, I would say it will be a pro-rated increase, Grinny, maxxing out at 230...</div></div><hr />
