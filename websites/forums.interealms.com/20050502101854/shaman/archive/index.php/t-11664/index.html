<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Many changes to shaman spells, including one we've been asking for forever... get rid of those damned stat buffs that are useless! Now we have group hastes, shrinks, tons of far far more useful spells. I was having a painful time grinding to level 60 knowing that there would be far more useless spells on that road than fun spells, now that has changed.<br />
<br />
I'm kind of confused about one thing though. Another positive change in this patch was the priest research, but it says &quot;- Added the ability for any caster to research dropped priest spells using the research books found in Gunthak. The research notes for these spells can be found in the Plane of Knowledge. Wizards, Enchanter, Magician, and Necromancers are able to create any of the researchable priest spells.&quot; The research notes in PoK? Does that mean that the elements of our spell research are bought from vendors? wouldn't that kind of destroy the purpose of random drops and stuff?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think 'research notes' refers to the books you can buy in pok to tell you how to do the research.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think 'research notes' refers to the books you can buy in pok to tell you how to do the research.<br />
<br />
<br />
At first I thought that, but if you'll notice, it says before that, the resarch books with the recipies are sold in gunthak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Reave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They are referring to the new book (container) that int casters must buy in gunthak to do the new combines in.  It is larger than the old one, allowing for the new numbers of components.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bufflo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would think 'research notes' would mean books about the components for the research. Much like the 'how to sew small sizes' type of book.</div></div><hr />
