<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>csivils</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Background:<br />
<br />
I'm working on a human smith, and would like to be able to make rallos zek cultural armor.  This means I need a level 29 ogre shaman.  I currently have a level 45 troll battleshaman on another account (w/iksar and jbb).<br />
<br />
I have greatly enjoyed playing as a battleshaman.  So much so, that I'm questioning if my initial stat points should go into wisdom...  It seems that stamina might be better.  I've read posts talking about this in theory... I'm curious if anyone has actually done it.  Is it going to be resonably realistic to get this shaman's wisdom high enough to work on alchemy when he's not bashing bad guys?<br />
<br />
One last question is, should I try to level my shaman high enough to have a better slow/regen spell to PL the ogre with?  The troll shaman is by far my highest character.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">put at least 5points into agi,<br />
<br />
and I say go with wis, as ogres already have great base sta (127 I believe)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Mez would put the points into Wis and I did.<br />
<br />
Mez think about this also before I born.<br />
<br />
Da extra hp from da higher stamina is an incramental<br />
advantage at da very high end game when joo have <br />
lots of wis on joo equipment.  This small advantage is <br />
baught at da price of lots of starting wisdom.<br />
<br />
The higher base wisdom allows joo to get use more <br />
ac / hp gear as joo lvl and have da same size mana<br />
pool.<br />
<br />
Mez think dat the tiny advantages acheived in da <br />
very high end game when joo have too much wisdom<br />
is not worth the added trouble to get to da point<br />
where joo get the advantage.<br />
<br />
Mez current operating wisdom is only 141 but mez <br />
have fairly nice ac / hp without uber equipment.  Works<br />
ok for mez and I ground exp as a battle shaman swinging<br />
da 2hb wid fbss till da jbb kicked in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My advice?  Keep playing your main shaman.  Get a 29+ ogre shaman to imbue what you need.  No point in re-rolling cuse you want to do trades, in</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can buff every stat except int and wis by massive amounts so I'd put 25 into wis. Ogre start with excellent str and stamina and subpar agility so I'd put my remaining 5 points into agi to avoid the AC penalty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Overall advice:  Dump all your other chars and just play the troll shaman to 60 :)  Then you will have the thousands of plat necessary for tradeskills, plus any gear you might want.<br />
<br />
Specific advice:<br />
If all you need is the Imbue Jade spell  - geez, just send a few /tells to the ogres on your server.  I'm positivly pleased when I get a chance to help someone out with that spell.<br />
<br />
On a(nother) shaman:<br />
Make sure your DEX and AGI are both above 75.  I don't know how much money you have for twinking (especially if your highest char is 45 AND you are spending money on tradeskills), but you can make up for you stats either way.<br />
<br />
If you dump all your points into Wis, a single ac 6/65 hp ring will get you more Hps at the lower levels than the 20 odd Sta pts.<br />
<br />
If you dump all your points into Sta, a +35 mana/+25 hp earring will make up the difference in Wis.  BUT - your skills will suffer greatly.  The dumber you are, the harder it is to gain skill levels.<br />
<br />
You should remember that Alchemy has a level based cap.  I would suggest having your Troll make your potions.<br />
<br />
Final advice:  You've already got a troll to 45, you should know how YOU like to play your Shamans :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>csivils</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There is some excellent advice in the thread... thank you.<br />
<br />
When I solo with Mareb (my troll shaman), I usually pull at about 20% mana.  I have a blight hammer for 34-44 and a jbb for after that and an iksar bp to help regen.  I maxed defense every level, and spell skills are just a matter of patience.<br />
<br />
The three pieces of advise that stuck with me are:<br />
<br />
1.  Its going to be painful to level without the extra wis.<br />
2.  I should consider making the ogre a level 29 mule (I've had trouble finding ogre shaman to do away with the mule)<br />
3.  I know how I like to play<br />
<br />
Putting these together, I think I will go with all my points into stamina with the expectation that it won't work and that I'll make the char a mule at 29.  If it does turn out to work... then its a pleasant suprise.<br />
<br />
Since I haven't heard of anyone doing this, I'll try to post back what I think once I hit 29.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What server are you on?  I know Ogre Shaman are a rareity, but there's always at least 4-5 on Prexus at any given time.  I'm sure if you post your server you can find someone here who can help. <br />
<br />
BTW, if you're making him as a mule, and want to level as quick as possible to 29, pump all points into WIS.  STA won't be worth it til higher levels, levels which that shaman won't ever see if he's a mule.</div></div><hr />
