<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I believe in the panther spell line, it has added enormously to my recent new found enjoyment of the game. I love people sending me tells saying how much FUN the proc is and how much they like it. I like having a REASON to keep a pet up.<br />
<br />
If panther is changed to a 30 second recast - I will no longer mem this spell, it will be ruined for me. After 2 years, I can barely manage an FA rotation without going completely nuts after 1 hour of exping. There is no way I can manage a panther &quot;rotation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sound off - who else really gets a kick out of this spell? <br />
<br />
If you thought it was unbalanced in its previous incarnation, how would you fix it in a way you would still enjoy it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I really enjoyed the spell line as it was. if I were to change anything, I'd up the duration to at least 3mins, and up the mana cost to balance it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">lol, that's making it MORE powerful, not less, T</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I absolutely love it, as do the people I group with.<br />
<br />
Triple the mana for double the duration; same cast time, same reuse. That's a 50% increase in cost, reducing how many toons can carry it at once, but it would still allow me to spread it around (at the cost of my mana pool) when we had an oh-sh** moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">lol, that's making it MORE powerful, not less, T<br />

That's fine with me!  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LachdanonColdpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The spell made my class fun to play again, it made me feel loved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">IF it gets nerfed i will still use it for one reason and one reason only. it has 0 agro when cast on others or pets.<br />
<br />
i think a different approach to &quot;nerfing&quot; this spell would be keep it the way it is but some how add an agro modifier to it or something. if you chain cast nukes you tend to get agro, right?<br />
<br />
allow one the oppurtunity to chain cast this spell but make it so that one wouldn't want to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was skeptical of panther at first but it works well with me. I love feeling usefull again. I am afraid if they nerf the best thing that has happened to shaman since kunark I will lose any enjoyment I get from eq. I am hoping the intended changes do not go live. Two targets at a time is useless, may as well make it like cheetah 6min recast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I absolutely loved Panther.  It was like a whole new game for me.<br />

I could choose to solo with dog dog and swing a mace again !<br />
<br />
Melee would constantly tell me how much fun that spell was.<br />
<br />
Raids noticed my presence again.  Actual comments about how it was nice to have a shaman back on (after I went on vacation).  I have never heard a guild say &quot;woot, shaman on !&quot; before.  Because we are entirely replaceable for 99% of raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Chain casting nukes generate agro mitigated by SCS though. DoTs have no such benefit - one reason this was a great alternative to DoTs.</div></div><hr />

I just can't dedicate another spell slot to a buff that takes that long to refresh.  Also, I refuse to put up with melee sending me tells for me to cast it on THEM and no one else.<br />
<br />
I thought we were going to get more spells in this line because Shaman LIKED IT THE WAY IT WAS.  Granted, we all knew the pet nerf was coming.  And I think we have all resigned ourselves to it.  But 30 second recast?  Damn, that's a slap in the face.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you pile on this buff, cast it on 10+ people during a raid fight, you get 0 agro. none.<br />
<br />
add an agro modifier. i feel that would balance it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just to be contrary, since it is a BUFF not a nuke or a dot - how much aggro does clarity generate on players? How much more damage is dealt or hitpoints healed without any additional aggro because of clarity?<br />
<br />
Just to note - this thread is about why panther currently rocks and our own opinions on how to improve/re-balance panther, it's not really to argue with other people about their ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I said up the mana cost, the spell costs a small bit less than single wunshi does, up the mana cost by an appropriate margin (on the lines of our DoTs) and it wouldn't be overpowering.<br />
<br />
for any nerf, I'd ask for compensation in duration on this spell line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">if you add an agro modifier to panther it'd still be a very desirable buff because you could still cast it often (before, during and after a fight), just not as often.<br />
<br />
this would be a fair balance, imo. we would not be &quot;nerfed&quot; or &quot;overpowered&quot;.<br />
<br />
we'd be &quot;balanced&quot;.<br />
<br />
that's all i'm really trying to say.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Who would it aggro on - us or the melee? If you want it to aggro on the melee, we'd be pretty much resigned to casting it on main tank only since who wants to watch aggro bounce around in an exp group or god forbid, a raid. We could also forget casting it on the random meleeing enchanter (this enchanter in my guild LOVES leopard so sometimes I cast it on him to make him happy).<br />
<br />
If it aggros on us - well, forget it! <br />
<br />
When would it aggro - every proc? every cast? Every time the buff lands?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">everytime you casted it and it landed on someone. like a heal. when you heal someone it doesn't land on the mob but it does piss the mob off, eventually.<br />
<br />
the person casting the buff would get the agro. but i'm not asking for tash type agro or slow/cripple agro, just enough agro to where if you chain casted this on a raid you'd wish you hadn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>hasek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hi All,<br />
<br />
I've lurked these boards, but this Panther issue got me so worked up I had to post.<br />
<br />
It was so heartwarming to see such hate towards the Avatar line of spells. I refuse to cast it, because simply put, I want to have fun playing this game. Worrying incessantly over when the bloody hell the spell gem will finally pop isn't my idea of fun. Yes, if I have to do that with Panther, I will not cast it in groups. <br />
<br />
If a cast delay is implemented, it's very possible that I will be driven from xp groups completely. On raids I'll be relegated to the MGB Wunshi bot and slower. It was such fun frantically casting Leopard/Panther on everyone I could. <br />
<br />
It's all about fun, that's why I keep saying that word in this post. Seeing my class dwindle in usefulness for several years now is saddening. Having something so wonderful introduced and then having it become Ferine Avatar the Revenge makes me want to go buy a cleric on ebay. Good Night, fellow shamans.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Triple the mana cost would be...1950 mana. That's like casting Talisman of Wunshi lol =P Really...noone would be able to keep that up at all =)<br />
<br />
But that is a solid balancing factor. Gives us the whole mana dump that we need for bosses. And for long fights, we can switch back to efficient DoT's. Choice is good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Pecannius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">One of the main problems was that this spell has a great damage to mana ratio. Increasing the mana sounds like a better, more fair change, rather than comopletely  changing a shaman's role in a group.  If it's on par with dot dps, what's the big deal? Just means i actually have something to spend my mana on.<br />
<br />
On a sidenote, i was thinking of a new focus effect they should have.  A focus effect that reduces recast time on spells.  That would be pretty nifty, maybe.  Making pained memory more l33t, and maybe making panther bearable... just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">This spell is really adding alot to the shaman no doubt about that, but do anyone of you cast any DD or dots dont you feel like they are all obsolete ?<br />
Dont get me me wrong i love the spell and dont think they should change anything, well if they think its to powerful then just up the mana cost.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Loved it as it was.  It was probably the most surprising spell ever created and definitely dealt with the shaman burst DPS issue in the most &quot;shaman&quot; way possible.<br />

Now Leopard/Panther can sit in my big box of &quot;remember whens&quot; alongside Manastones, Demon Claws, Lustrous Russet armor, charming bats in SolB, boat travel, LDoN, exp groups, etc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I loved the spell line. I think it was THE single best idea SOE could possibly have come up with to solve our DPS problem. It saved them from trying to re-code all the aggro out of our DOTs, yet it directly increased our ability to add DPS in all situations. <br />
<br />
If the proposed nerfs go through live, they may as well start finding a new spell for us though. This one will fall by the wayside FAST. 30 second delay. That means MAYBE 3 targets, with all AA and the highest EE focus, MAYBE 3 targets. Combine that with the pet-proc reduction, and we have a spell thats just to big a PITA to even bother memming. <br />
<br />
And you folks actually asking for BETTER versions of the spell, please wake up and read some of the other threads. SOE isnt gonna listen to &quot;make it last longer&quot; comments. COme up with a reasonable, liveable version or be ready to move Leopard and Panther to page 50.</div></div><hr />

Panther gave me something fun to do. It was the ultimate buff, because it indirectly gave us the damage output we desired. But wait! We weren't the ones doing the damage, the melee and the pets were! Hm. Who cares? We had a spell people wanted, and that gave them all sorts of happy DPS jump numbers that made them happy, and in turn it made us happy. Now they've broken it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
    Makes me angry, it finally brought back enjoyment for me in the game. I was playing once a week limited time. Now I'm play 5 days a week having a good time, feeling useful. <br />
<br />
If I was to change the spell... It would be <br />
<br />
1) Leopard, single target spell Duration, 10 minutes up the mana cost slighty, fixed the pet procing issue. <br />
<br />
2) Panther, group version, 10 min duration, Up the mana cost 3 times, and fix the pet procing issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rytan, it would be easier and cheaper for you to just give Blizzard all the old EQ servers as you shut them down - you don't have to go to these lengths to kill off this game faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Tenien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">&quot;but do anyone of you cast any DD or dots dont you feel like they are all obsolete ?&quot;<br />
<br />
DoT's are obsolete.  They have been for pretty much anything but boss fights since PoP.  Our DD's have always sucked.  We've mostly been ok with that.  Leopard/Panther was actually a fun spell to use.  It was a pain to keep mana up to keep it going, but it felt like you were actually accomplishing something by doing so.  Casting slow and getting the message, as someone put it &quot;you mostly suck or you partially suck&quot;=not fun.  Casting a dot and having the mob die 3 ticks in=not fun.  Dumping your mana bar to cast this on your whole group + pets when the crap hits the fan to help save the day=FUN!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">ok, lets use dots instead. if you pile on the dots, you're gonna get agro.<br />
<br />
if you pile on this buff, cast it on 10+ people during a raid fight, you get 0 agro. none.<br />
<br />
add an agro modifier. i feel that would balance it out.So when the proc goes off, it creates -- 405 aggro points, let us say, all of them assigned to the character who fired the proc.<br />
<br />
Your suggestion, Spang, would be that say 10% of that aggro gets traced back to me, and 90% gets assigned to the character who fired the proc?<br />
<br />
At the point where I have put this on 10 characters, then, if they each proc once this tick, they each gain 365 aggro, while I gain 405 aggro.  If I cast it on 12 characters, they would each gain 365 aggro that tick, while I would gain 495 aggro.<br />
<br />
There comes a moment where my aggro is highest, and I get summoned and splatted.<br />
<br />
The amount of aggro points and the 10 % are just numbers out of midair, to see if I understand your concept.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">no.<br />
<br />
you get some agro from casting the buff, that's it. the same way you get some agro for casting a heal or some casting a nuke. if you chain cast any one of those spells you eventually get agro.<br />
<br />
same would happen with Panther if my idea were used to &quot;balance&quot; the spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
because either #1 you have to be within a specific range of the mob to get spell casting aggro or #2 you have to already be on the mob's aggro list.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The theoretical maximum number of targets I could leopard is maybe 18.  The practical maximum is probably about 16.  So if I cast the spell on 16 characters, I should get summoned and splatted.<br />
<br />
But if I cast it on, say, 3 characters, I suppose I should not get summoned.<br />
<br />
Where is your ball-park estimate of where the break line ought to be, Spang?</div></div><hr />

I think if it wasn't for that spell, I would not have stayed with EQ1 after returning from EQ2. The rest of DoN is so so, in my opinion. The panther line stands out as the best thing of DoN. <br />
<br />
Any change beyond the obvious fix of the pet proccing will basically destroy the spell. Soloing is the only time I can see myself live with a recast time and soloing is boring.<br />
<br />
Sidenote: Spang! We are trying to get a reduction of  the obscene aggro shamans get from their DoTs for years. Your trying to add another source of aggro at a time we finally have a possibility to contribute without aggro tells me that you obviously missed most of the discussion for class improvement we are having since GoD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because to get aggro from buffing another player that player has to be on the mobs &quot;active&quot; aggro list.  In the case of the monk whether you cast a hot or a Heal on him, since he is FD and not in the mobs &quot;active&quot; aggro list, no aggro is passed.  If instead the monk is fighting a mob, and you cast a buff on him, like Quinessence or SOW, and then the monk dies (or feighns) the small amount of aggro you generated will cause it to come towards you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you chain casted the buff on melee during a fight, i'd say you would get summoned sometime after the 3rd or 4th chain cast, but there would be no recast time so you could cast it on some people before the pull and you could still cast it on multiple targets throughout the encounter by controlling your agro.</div></div><hr />

Granted, the pet proc rate needed to be lowered.  The recast change is not needed, however, and seems to be a quick fix that will do more harm than good.  Fix the pet proc problem and increase the mana cost (as well as the duration).<br />
<br />
The quote from the &quot;Reinvisioning&quot; post stating that shaman were happy with the spell was right on.  Is that fact lost on the developers or does it simply not matter to them?  This recast delay change ruins the spell and thereby ruins the enjoyment of Shaman and those we were having fun casting this on.</div></div><hr />

The 30 second recast will destroy this spell's usefulness, obviously.  It was such a breath of fresh air to actually have a use for my mana in raids.  With canni V and pained memory, you could keep this buff up on plenty of people (so much for pets) and you actually had something to do on a raid...that people noticed.<br />

<br />
You know... the ones that last like 2-4 hours.  It's there badarse buffs and all !!!<br />
<br />
Shaman get a minute buff..... and we liked it.  And now.... 30 second recast.<br />
<br />
It suddenly all makes sense to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Katgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Adding a recast time on this spell is so retarded that It's not even funny. I LOVE this spell because of the ability to chain cast it. Why can't they just put a proc mod on the spell to make it fire 10x a min. I think a 4k nuke for 650 mana, or even a 3k nuke for 650 mana is right in line with what a lvl 69 shaman can bring to the table with other spells. This spell and spells like it are what makes the game fun and if Sony is too blind to figure that out then someone hand me a clue bat and a plane ticket to California.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, this is probably the most insightful post I have seen on the topic. They have done this before too, more than a couple times. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">if you chain casted the buff on melee during a fight, i'd say you would get summoned sometime after the 3rd or 4th chain cast, but there would be no recast time so you could cast it on some people before the pull and you could still cast it on multiple targets throughout the encounter by controlling your agro.<br />
SPang, its not that I dont think the idea has merit, or that its a BAD idea, on the contrary, it really is an excellent idea to help balance the spell. I just think adding the aggro will complicate the whole thing even more, and its already a huge cluster-froak. I am more into trying to get them to balance the spell with re-cast and proc rate than aggro. Just seems easier to &quot;see&quot; and adjust.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">What MORON decided to add this recast?  Seriously????? 30 second recast on a 1 minute spell???? *** soe, you've really outdone yourself this time.<br />
<br />
Actually, there is precedent for this sort of thing. The warrior incite line is also a 1 minute spell with a 30 second recast. The recast time in that case is to stop warriors from generating huge agro levels, and the recast in this case is to limit the dps potential on a single target. It is not much different in concept from the 24 second recast time on our bane line of dots. That too was no doubt put in place to limit the dps potential of a single spell (on multiple targets in that particular case). And bane lasts 30 seconds, not a minute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I got thru ~3/4 of the first page and just couldn't read any further.<br />
<br />
Here is the only acceptable change: ZIPPO! NADA! NOTHING!<br />
<br />
That said, adjusting pets to be affected differently when this is cast upon them is a different topic, since (as SOE stated) the pets are being adjusted, not the spell.<br />
<br />
As for the spell(s) themselves ... LEAVE THEM THE F*** ALONE!!!<br />
<br />
And for those advocating a compromise to SOE regarding these spells ... SHUT THE H*** UP!!<br />
<br />
There is no compromise. There is no reason for the recast timer to be changed. So ... read slowly here, SOE ... DON'T DO IT!!<br />
<br />
When I see the crap shaman tolerate from SOE and read the threads that search for a rational understanding of SOE motives while attempting to find a tolerable and reasonable compromise to &quot;make everyone happy&quot; I am left feeling soiled and cheap. SOE is bending shaman over with this change. BENDING SHAMAN OVER. Suggesting balancing compromises is nothing more than saying ... &quot;pardon, me, but do you mind using this lubricant?&quot;<br />
<br />
This community has always been about doing the right thing for game and class balance. Always. But it has gone far enough. SOE is not balancing classes ... they are balancing other classes around the nerfage to shaman. That has to stop. Shaman trying to rationalize with SOE resulting in reduced effectiveness of the class at any level, in any way, has got to end. You cannot compromise if the other party isn't willing to work towards the compromise ... all you end up doing is giving away the proverbial inch to someone who is after the proverbial mile. Eventually, as you look back ... at this point in the game, as a matter of fact ... shaman have given up quite a few proverbial miles. So, at what point do shaman wake up and say, &quot;NO MORE!!&quot;?<br />
<br />
The only way to make it happen is to take the simple stand: DON'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!!<br />
<br />
Seriously. Don't compromise ... there is no reason to with this issue. To do otherwise isn't winning ... it's simply taking it ... again. So, don't compromise. Don't accept the change.<br />
<br />
The only acceptable adjustment to P/Leo lines is this: THEY ARE LEFT ALONE!!! THE RECAST ADJUSTMENT DOES NOT GO LIVE!! NOT ONE SECOND MORE!!<br />
<br />
Support this stand in the only way SOE understands ... end billing if it goes live. Stop paying. Or stop complaining. Either it is important enough to each of you to take a stand or it isn't. Stop compromising and, most important, stop RATIONALIZING to justify accepting the crap SOE is slamming you with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">you do realise that panther can be chain casted on an entire raid force without any agro?<br />

<br />
And thats *IF* no lag and Shaman did not cast ANY other spells.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Untrue. You're generalizing. My guild is top three on my server, I'm the only Shaman with Panther, and even at 9k mana raid buffed with tribute running I have a hell of a lot more to do than Panther the pets and melee. I don't know how you raid, but I very much dislike seeing my mana being above 70-80% unless we're having downtime.<br />
<br />
During clearing I keep this spell up on: the main tank, two melee rangers and a rogue. The only reason the rangers and Rogue get it is because they're friends. This spell is otherwise my way of contributing DPS to a raid boss, without laying on ONE FREAKING POISON DOT and a COLD NUKE and getting summoned to my doom.<br />
<br />
We've paid quite enough with aggro over the years, keep your masochism to yourself please. Other than the pet retuning, which *was* necessary, the spell is fine with no recast. <br />
<br />
As an aside, I have a friend in a family guild who has Leopard, and it's a major strain to keep it up on more than one person at a time.<br />
<br />
This isn't *just* about about the top Shaman on the servers, this is about *all* Shaman who hit 70 and get this spell through guild raids or pickup raids.<br />
<br />
I just don't get this self-defeating attitude so many of you have.<br />

Untrue.  There IS aggro.  It just isn't YOU getting that aggro.<br />

<br />
And since *every other thing I do* causes aggro, I am going to have to respectfully disagree with you. Heal? Aggro. Sinia? Aggro. Cripple? They hobble over and say bad things about my mother. Slow? They reenact Deliverance, I shore do have a purty mouth and do quite the impression of bacon. Breathe? Oh, snap. Zonewide aggro.<br />

Panther solved our DoT/Nuke aggro problems in one fell swipe, because once I had Panther I didn't bother casting nukes or DoTs. They were broken, and this gave me something fun to do that WASN'T broken, until now.<br />

I see no defense. I see you thinking that 0 aggro is a problem. I see it the opposite way. Everything else we do generates huge amounts of hate, it was nice having something that, for once, let me DPS without dying.<br />

Yes, you do. A nerf to this spell *is* a nerf to the Shaman class, or did you forget that class re-envisionment was placed around this ONE spell? Shaman were happy with it, and Sony was happy we were happy with it, then people who are accustomed to  being trodden upon come along and will accept even the mildest of nerfs to hang on to their Al Bundy years of Remember Whens. I'm sorry, but if I'm supposed to score four touchdowns in a single game, I'm gonna score four touchdowns in that game. I'm not going to tell God 'well, since I blew my knee out could I just make, like, one touchdown in a single game and we'll call it even?' I'd be asking for my freaking knee back.<br />

<br />
Did I ever say it FIXED our DoT problem? I said it solved them, in that there was no need to ever cast them again. Now, with this spell nerfed, we're back to relying on DoTs and nukes, which are still broken. I'd rather have SOMETHING to do that makes me contribute something of value, than stack a DoT or two and die.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You say &quot;0 aggro&quot; and you want to add aggro all over the place...  You respond with &quot;our pets get aggro also&quot; which of course, I know and use to MY advantage accordingly.  In fact, I brought up aggro on MT and BST aggro.<br />

And yes, aggro management is the key in EQ.  Not sure exactly why you want a &quot;buff&quot; to add aggro.  We going to add aggro for KEI, and Conviction next?  Unfailing Reverance?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, Sport, this sums it up. Do you have any clue what the &quot;dot aggro&quot; problem everyone else is mentioning is about?<br />
<br />
It is about waiting until the MT has built up aggro on a mob. The mob is likely in the 70% health range and you have cast nothing on this mob up to this point. So you toss in a poison dot.<br />
<br />
One tic ... summoned.<br />
<br />
Two tics ... summoned.<br />
<br />
Three tics ... Crit Affliction AA ... crit tic ... summoned, killed.<br />
<br />
Now, should this have happened? No. A single dot doing crap single tic damage compared to that wiz/mage critting nukes for 6-10K (with ~zero aggro)  that results in immediate aggro shift from the MT to the shaman is ... /bug. Not balanced. Not normal. Not justifiable. It is a freakin /bug.<br />
<br />
For you to claim you are supposed to get aggro from these dots is simply ignorance on your part. You clearly don't understand what aggro generation is with regard to the problem folks are referring to.<br />
<br />
Asking or an increased aggro generation to the P/Leo line is equal to expecting the damage done by damage sheilds to reflect aggro back on the DS caster and not the target the mob is actually hitting. Can you say ... &quot;Damn Silly!&quot;??<br />
<br />
Now for some &quot;Just for you&quot; information. If you want aggro from the spell, make sure the mob has the MT/tanks on his aggro list before you cast P/Leo. Then, if all of them die, and the cleric/druid/healers die and the support folks die ... then, you, as last man standing, will get to die because ... Sport, any spell you cast (generally speaking) on a player when that player is engaged with a mob will add you to the mobs aggro list. So ... in effect ... it does generate enough aggro already. Where you sit on that aggro list is the point you don't seem to get.</div></div><hr />

that's fine. i accept the idea panther will be nerfed and i do not want a recast timer on it. i also believe it is too powerful in its present state. just gotta parse it to prove it. that's why my idea is what it is. i'm not trying to argue with anyone (even if it appears that i am), just mearly trying to sell an idea.<br />
<br />
maybe an easier idea would be lower the amount of the proc. but i do not want a recast timer. i want the ability to choose how often i cast this spell, not the spell gem telling me when i can.</div></div><hr />

yes apparently he can chain cast it on 16 people... but by the time the last few are landing the first one is wearing off... 2 min later they all wear off and he is still very LOM. This also assumes no interuptions, no people moving out or range, no heals no debuffs nothing else... sure I could chain it many times in a row under ideal conditions if i didn;t do anything else... saying this is overpowered also assumes none of the targets die, none of them stop meleeing to cast, all of them are unstunned and meleeing away nonstop the whole time.<br />
<br />
hmmm unless your doing a mob with NO ae's, no kiting need, no nothoing but straight melee - this just isn;t as bad as many make it sounds.</div></div><hr />

No, you were challenged to cast it on 16 people on a single raid mob. And you know why you cant? Because if the Mob is a challenging one, then you as a shaman will have several responsibilities other than &quot;cast panther on everyone&quot;.<br />

funny you should say this, i remebmer reading posts before where shaman stopped casting on raids and no one noticed.<br />

Funny, it wasn't me. Was it?<br />
<br />
What I really can't figure out SPangloid is why you are lobbying so hard FOR this nerf?  A nerf is coming, we can shout about it until we're blue in the face we probably can't change that.  The severity of the nerf however is what we're trying to mitigate.  <br />
<br />
I just don't understand what you have to gain if you get your way.  Grats? Got us nerfed? Way to go?<br />
<br />
In my oppinion the change to pets was enough. The 30 second recast is ridiculous.  This is what we're trying to stop, SPangloid.<br />
<br />
If you do manage to cast leopard on 16 people on a raid mob, I want you to save that parse. Save it, because once the nerf hits, I want you to try it again. Try it on as many people as a you can.<br />
<br />
Then see how your post nerf dps stacks up compared to just dotting/nuking.  Guess what? It won't be worth casting at all...Grats, got your nerf.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Brokkem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">I have posted this before, and I will repeat myself.. why would you want this spell to cause aggro?????  The whole point of the Maw line in the first place was to resolve some of our aggro while dealing DPS.  If sony was going to take a nerf bat to our maw line like this and cripple it to the point that we want to take it out back and shoot it to put it out of our misery, why the heck didnt they just give us a dot line with little to no aggro and call it a day???  Much less work, far less imagination required, business as usual.  <br />
<br />
Bottom line, if they add aggro to Maw line, it defeats the purpose they created the spell.  It would be like having the cleric's ac/hp buff line also cast a minor cripple spell on the target.. reducing their ac/durability just for balance sake.<br />
<br />
Better that they leave this spell the smashed steaming pile it is slated to become then make it one more thing that begs for beat down.</div></div><hr />

I'm just curious on this...<br />
  You say unbuffed, and your unbuffed mana is 7740, (per your magelo).  How the heck, did you chain cast a spell 16 times, that totals 10400 mana?   Chain=non stop casting.<br />
<br />
There is no possible way you could do it, yet you state above that you did??<br />
<br />
Please let me in on your secret Spang, because I for one would love to have the unlimited mana that you profess having.<br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />

And the problem with the &quot;i can't do anything else&quot; argument is if its too good you won't do anything else.<br />
<br />
Now there gonna nerf it from 100 dps, to 75 dps, it looks like. If it wasn't group only, you would be doing 900 dps with 12 people. Now sure thats down from 1200 dps, but for a non dps class that's pretty good.<br />
<br />
But I just got why, as i was writing this. Your average xp mob lasts what 30s maybe.  So cause of the short durration you get half of it. So its like +50dps per not 100, now its gonna be +35dps not 50.. Ok..not it makes sense to me why the group nerf really is enough. Both makes it much less useful in a group.<br />

OK do you know what &quot;DPS&quot; means? It stands for damage-per-second. So every second, the spell did 100 damage when cast on a PC. Whether thats 30 seconds (3000 damage) or 60 seconds (6000 damage), its a ratio of damage per second.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You misunderstood. He's taking saturation time into the equation, which is perfectly legit and correct to do as you ain't going to keep a 100 second spell on everyone 100% of the time, but rather use it like a DoT that lasts 2 mobs or so.<br />
<br />
By the time you have slowed a mob and the first Panther hits your tank, you're probably between 7 and 10 seconds into the fight, another 5 seconds for the second melee and 5 more for the pet. You obviously lose total DPS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Correct, but you still won't have all your targets buffed when the mob is in camp 100% of the time. The DPS numbers need to be modified considering this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u115"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p115">Agreed. <br />
<br />
I've given up on keeping more than two or three targets buffed with it most of the time anyway. I just hit the ones that seem to be engaged most often. usually MA, my pet (from slow hotkey) and the Bard. Many Mage pets seem to just be staring off into space a lot, although some are better supervised. Sort of like Rangers, actually.</div></div><hr />

Thats fine, then adjust the total group potential, not the first 73 dps, THATS staying where it is, because I can guarentee you that at least ONE target will have the buff every instant a mob is in the camp, and more than likely it will be 2/3, and the 3rd for 80% of the fight. So of a potential 200 dps, I doubt I am losing 50 over the course of a fight. Maybe 25.<br />
<br />
There are variables. A lot of zones are more conducive to longer, mulit-mob battles (much of DoN, RCoD) and some zones are more &quot;pull one, then pull another&quot; (MPG because they are spread out, RSS because they hit hard). But in either of these cases, if I am attentive, and watch my message for when it wears off my pet, and re-buff it instantly, the time lost between is prety negligible. 3 certainly isnt a mega-mana-intensive number to keep it on, either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah..  I ment to say your getting 2250 instead of 3000, if the mobs there 30s. and yeah..for some reason i was thinking it's like a dot, not a proc, sorry at work doing more then one thing.<br />
<br />
But wasn't Yoppa's always more dps? its about 150 dps - resists, which should be better now..  I dunno..what's agro free dps worth? course on the other had did 25dps really make that much differance?<br />
<br />
Question also, is do you over nerf now and bring it back up, or nerf 2 times.. I dunno whats worse, although you get to say it was a &quot;community request&quot; if you reincrease the damage, the you get to play you are listening. And yes, I do think its play, I don't think they really listen.<br />
<br />
Unlock the raid, make the shaman raid leader, and what's it gonna take him to move around groups? with some practice not much, course with an all BL group you can do 11 anyway.. so /shrug but who wants an all BL group. ;)<br />
<br />
But where not dps, but either is a Druid right? Chain casting, there 70 nuke for 1 min, its 6 almost 7 casts. 189 dps for 2286 mana, no resists no crits. Even at +75 dps, You need 3 casts to go over that, and it only took 10sec to do it, and its no agro for you.<br />
<br />
But all these aren't real numbers, but sometimes I wonder if thats all soe uses. Knowing soe they used a SK with all the spell crit aa's to balance it with../sigh<br />
<br />
But when you look at the spells, the proc buff dosen't scale with gear and AA, you know all those rogue AA that increase spell damage. ;) Its like Avatar on a bazaar geared toon, is freaking bad ass, on a high end end game tank, its not all that good. Which is what makes shaman so hard to balance, we enhance other players, if its too good, then lower geared players gain to much, if its to bad higher end shaman never use it.<br />
<br />
And sorry I wasn't clear before, happens when you write a post over the course of hours, not all at once. :)<br />
