<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There have been numerous posts about how to uber twink your new baby pet shammie, or what you can buy for xx k of platnum to enhance your current one...<br />
<br />
What i'd like to ask you wise shaman, is what equipment is farmable, and at what level... <br />
<br />
Seeing as there isn't all that much good gear for sale on Kane Bayle, what can I get for myself... (i did the same thing with a bard on Mith Marr a good while back, quested an entire suit of lambent   aaah the good ol' days when you can follow in the wake of 50+ characters :)<br />
<br />
Anyways, i'm currently only lvl 17 (exams are a pain the the backside.), so if any1 has any idea's on where to hunt or when to farm something in the next 30 or so levels, please share.<br />
<br />
Many thanks !</div></div><hr />
