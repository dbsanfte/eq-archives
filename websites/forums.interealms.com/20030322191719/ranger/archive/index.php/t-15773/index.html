<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aedail Mistwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I used to be able to track Tallon Zek, Vallon Zek and Diaku Overseer from the zone-in in this zone.<br />
<br />
After the patch that made the zone indoors, I can't seem to get any of these 3 mobs at track at zonein, I have to go considerably closer to the target.<br />
<br />
Is this new? is tracking range supposed to be severly cut off in an indoor zone?<br />
<br />
It kinda bugs me because I liked being able to see the entire zone on track at zonein pretty much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tanares</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Good lord I hope not.... talk about a painfull nerf. Gonna head to Ssra right now and see if this is true for inddor zones...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Underbrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Strange, I seemed to recall having to move into danger to track the boys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aatrex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm positive it was nerfed in Tactics, badly.  Almost have to be right on top of the spawn to see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bobpork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yup, tracking was severely nerfed in tactics..probably due to it now being an indoor zone, although why that should affect anything I have no idea. Pre-patch could track twins and the basement named from zone in, now have to walk right to arena to be able to track basement named and still havn't found a spot to track the twins due to see invis mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fufinski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Indoor zones have always had a shorter tracking range then the maximum outdoor zones.  Outside I think it is 2500 locs, while indoors varies significantly dependent on the topography of the zone.  A good example is NToV where someof the tracking distances are very short.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>timcooper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">aye i have noticed some zones worse than others, never really thought about it track modifiers in zones ewww</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aedail Mistwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Silly to make Plane of Tactics outdoors in the first place, you can clearly see the sky in the outer area where Rallos Zek is standing. And there is also a zone wide emote saying &quot;The sky is filled with rage&quot; or something like that, how would you even see the sky if it were an indoor zone? =p.<br />
<br />
The only thing it achieves it's making it harder for druids and rangers to pull due to harmony not working, but this isn't really a valid reason considering pacification works fine. It's also more annoying to get a SoW or SoE, but I don't understand this either since you can just zone out and cast it then zone back in.<br />
<br />
Perhaps anyone knows what caused this nerf? It's obviously directed and rangers and druids mostly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Noggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There've been some indoor zones where you could see the sky in some very limited parts, yet you can cast SoW in the bottom of blackburrow or deep in the gnoll caves in laggedpine or whatever. While they generally stick to common sense, it hasn't been a requirement since forever. :p<br />
<br />
Prolly the change is for a specific reason though :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aluaden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">In outdoors flagged zones, walls are not solid in terms of aggro or spells.  You can cast through them, and you can aggro through them very easily.  PoTactics, being multileveled like it was, was having a ton of wall aggro problems (why they moved the zone in in the first place).  Raids were being killed by mobs below or above pounding on them.<br />
<br />
Thats why they changed it.  The effects on track they probably didnt even consider.  Each zone has a different track radius, dunno how they calculate it, but some zone definatly have larger than others, even between indoor zones.  Outdoor zone ones tend to be HUGE.  Indoor smaller.  Only problem is, its now an indoor zone with an outdoor scale, so track stinks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hyppolyta Ironrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">A good example is Kael, when you check the distance from where you can track KT or Vindi its much smaller as outdoors, also Ntov Per example the point from where u can track Aary.<br />
<br />
So they changed it to indoor and track radius is smaller.<br />
<br />
Wall agro can be a reason,  so they should BoT also change, ok in some place u see some outdoor yard but at all it really dont look like outdoor, but when you stand in wrong corner you will be some seconds later destroyed by a train.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Xzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've noticed this too. I really wish track range was the same indoors, and tactics as indoor sucks. No more SoE :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Elessar Elfstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Aye...Overseer is easy enough to check, but V/T are a pain to track. I hate checking them now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Roophus Gunthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I never noticed these issues before PoP, due to the fact that it was nearly pointless.  Now there are key quest mobs and such up that are needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Voronwë Nimbrethil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">as to the 'sense' of indoor / outdoor, i think we can go back to the original alter planes where we learned that some spells dont behave normally there.<br />
<br />
PoH being outdoors for example...does suck about tracking nerf though.  its nice to know when spawns are up, so as not to waste time otherwise</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Xequecal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I don't think this stuff is zone dependent. Karnor's Castle is an outdoor zone, yet the walls in that dungeon are solid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Reandn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Originally posted by Xequecal <br />
I don't think this stuff is zone dependent. Karnor's Castle is an outdoor zone, yet the walls in that dungeon are solid. <br />
<br />
Errr... I gotta disagree there.  Karnor has some quite spectacular wall aggro.  You can't walk through the walls, but you can certainly aggro through them. <br />
<br />
I used to pull there a lot, and there are quite a few spots I would go to pull mobs that I have no clue whatsoever where they were physically located, or how many I might get.  It depends a lot on level though -- a pull that was good for 4-5 mobs at 52 would get only 1 or 2  at 60.  A couple of my pulls I would just  warn my group &quot;Wall aggro pull coming, be ready!&quot; and then I just walk up to the spot and stand there a couple seconds until stuff starts hitting me.  (And no, this isn't an exploit -- I just was walking along the normal areas, not purposely pushing into a corner or something...)<br />
<br />
Other examples of outdoor zones with buildings and wacky aggro would be Unrest and Mistmoore.<br />
<br />
I haven't fought in Plane of Tactics, but I can definitely understand why making it an indoor zone could have fixed some wall aggro issues.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gwadwog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">As far as wall aggro goes in outdoor zones I can personally attest to that whacky stuff happening in places like KC, Hate and especially Tactics (Drunder). It was just crazy aggro (especially when the zone in and graveyard were one in the same).<br />
<br />
You could be doing a CR and the next thing you know you got a Diaku Death Knight and a couple of his buddies coming to pay you a visit.<br />
<br />
As far as tracking goes. From the GY you can check for RZ and other named around the arena area (overseer, armorer and glykus the pig farmer).<br />
<br />
If any of you with access to Drunder haven't yet. Turn on your partical effects and move to the opposite side of the arena from the zone in and look up. Rallos sits up there overlooking the arena and he's one bad looking mofo.<br />
<br />
I guess in a few weeks our guild will be in a position to go and and take a crack at him.<br />
<br />
ciao tutti</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Xequecal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">In most outdoor zones, you can cast a spell on anything as long as you're in range. Doesn't matter if you can see it or not, if it's behind something, whatever. In KC, you can't do that. You'll get a &quot;you can not see your target&quot; message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Celt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Aluaden hit the nail on the head :)<br />
<br />
Might be nice if they expanded the track radius but I doubt it.  Besides, its a tougher zone, I'd much rather it not have wonky &quot;come kill me stampeeeeede&quot; agro than to be able to track tallon/vallon hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Keltaras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Where do you have to stand exactly to get him on track? Does anyone have a good map? =P</div></div><hr />
