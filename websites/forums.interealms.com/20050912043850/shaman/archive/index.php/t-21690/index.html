<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stormieweather</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I normally play on a blue server (have a 65 epic'd enchanter, 64 druid, 55 SK, and 51 pally on one), but for variety, have started a Barb Shammy on RZ along with a Barb Roque (on my 2nd account).  They are currently level 6 and both have a full set of newbie armor. (No twinkage on a new server...lol). <br />
<br />
Three questions:<br />
1) As I am plat-poor, where would you suggest I take them to level? Need easy access/regress (due to PK'ers) and nearby vendors to offload loot. Any advise would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
2) Can anyone link for me any quests for better armor? If you can direct me to the zone, I can find it on Alla's with that info but don't have paid subscription, so I can't search by class.<br />
<br />
3) What kinds of weapons would you suggest I obtain? Poor shammy is lucky to have enough pp to buy spells and can't do potions for sale for a few levels yet. <br />
<br />
Thanks for any assistance.<br />
<br />
