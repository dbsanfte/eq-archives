<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">was just sort of thinking ahead. I was wondering what you guys did to get your Elder Title<br />
<br />
Canni 5 is obvious<br />
<br />
(just going down the list)<br />
<br />
Alchemy Mastery, dont use alchemy much/at all<br />
<br />
Mass Group Buff, not in a rading guild, or any guild for that matter<br />
<br />
Pet Discipline, semi usefull... but for 6 AA?<br />
<br />
Quick Buff, pretty usefull. esp for 3 second torpors/Qs but I wont have eather of those for awhile<br />
<br />
Rabid Bear, ummm no<br />
<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery, very nice. BUT I would have to put 12 AA into Spell Casting Reinforcement first.<br />
<br />
any ideas? info? or just what you did would be cool<br />
<br />
thanks for your time guys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>veggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Canni 5<br />
SCRM<br />
QB1<br />
MGB<br />
<br />
not the fasted way, but didn't have to waste aa's on less usefull stuff...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">how many aa pts does it take from our class specific abilities to get our next title... 24 i am assuming from reading the previous post. I haven't even thought much about my next title but i guess i will have soon enuff with canni5, mgb already trained &amp; 4 aa pts to scrm. i'm then training rc1 then qb2. woot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Need 24 class AAs for Elder<br />
<br />
Canni V is a no-brainer.  19 points left.<br />
SCRM (after SCR3) was my next choice - 6 tick torpor/Q is awesome.  10 points left.<br />
MGB is next on my list - a great boon if you raid even occasionally.  1 point left.<br />
QB1/2 - these will give the much-loved 3.3 second Q with a Hadte of Mith. item, and give you the Elder title after QB1.<br />
<br />
That's my route to Elder anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wasnt in a huge hurry to get there, wanted all my AAs to be useful more importantly<br />
<br />
I took the semi-slow route as well, getting SCR3 before SCRM<br />
Of course CannV came first<br />
Also raid a lot so MGB was a no-brainer, QB1 finished it off for me (around 60 aa at the time I think)<br />
<br />
Did spend 3 practically worthless AAs on my rogue to finish his title though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ditto: Canni5, SCRM, MGB, QB1.<br />
<br />
If you just cannot take having MGB -- well, there's more QB and a level of AM or RB or something, but you might as well just get MGB anyway on the off chance you end up on a raid.  It's not a bad thing to have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Is having the word Elder over your head more important to you than having skills that you'll actually use? I too hardly ever raid (so no MGB), and I have a Wicked Bone Atlatl (so only QB2). 265 AA's and still Venerable.<br />
<br />
Definitely get SCRM and QB2. If you don't have a spell haste item and don't forsee getting one soon, then go ahead and get QB3 for the title.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My suggestion is to go for the skills you want, let<br />
the title come when it does. Many people have <br />
titles turned off anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Im also in a halt on this same question. Right now im working on SCR2 and 3 so I can do SCRM.<br />
<br />
I have Cana5 and I am doing SCRM and MGB for sure (im a raiding shammy) but that last skill has me boggled.. I have Spell Haste (Haste of Mithaniel) ... does QB1 stack with Haste of Mithaniel? or is it just a waste of an AA? ... I was thinking doing Alchemy Mastery1 or Pet Discipline to top off Class title.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Quick Buff AA stacks with spell haste focus effects, up to 50% max haste, so qb3 would be a waste for you, but 1 and 2 would be of benefit.<br />
<br />
Personally, I just finished off SCRM, so I think I'm doing RC1, followed by MGB, followed by some Quick Buff.  I'm not really going for the title or anything, but the stuff I want is going to get it for me anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I did run3, metabolism3, mc3, canni5, mgb, scr3, scrm, qb1... I think that is when I got the elder title.<br />
<br />
And yes,  QB will stack with your haste of mithanial item... QB2 will bring you to the maximum 50% spell haste cap, or at least close to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kaneex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i had over 80AA b4 i got elder title, arch type AA's rule :)<br />
<br />
Vhalis, if your a raiding shammy /pet hold AA owns... plus its just nice in general to make sure you dog dog behaves himself.<br />
<br />
lets face it, for the most part alch is useless, i will spend AA in all my resists b4 i touch that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My shaman was already almost level 57 before PoP came out, so here was the plan I went with.<br />
<br />
Run1 (1)<br />
Run2 (1)<br />
Run3 (1)<br />
*ding 58*  [3 total]<br />
Meta1 (1)<br />
Meta2 (1)<br />
Meta3 (1)<br />
MC1 (2)<br />
*ding 59* [8 total]<br />
MC2 (4)<br />
MC3 (6)<br />
*ding 60* [18 total]<br />
*ding 61*<br />
canni5 (5) {5 in class}<br />
RC1 (2)<br />
*ding 62* [25 total]<br />
SCF1 (2)<br />
SCF2 (4)<br />
SCM1 (2)<br />
SCM2 (4)<br />
SCF3 (6)<br />
SCR1 (2)<br />
SCR2 (4)<br />
SCR3 (6)<br />
*ding 63* [55 total]<br />
<br />
That's what I've done so far, currently have 3.5 AAs banked.  My current plan for progression is:<br />
<br />
SCM3 (6)<br />
RC2 (4)<br />
FOM1 (3)<br />
SCRM (8) {13 in class}<br />
QB1 (3) {16 in class}<br />
QB2 (6) {22 in class}<br />
Pet Disc (6) {28 in class, ding elder}<br />
*ding 64* [91 total]<br />
<br />
I haven't figured out yet what I want to do in 64...I'll have finished my training as a master buffbot, and have my Elder title, so I might just gun for 65.  If I do AAs, it'll likely be ND1/2/3 and SC1/2 and maybe a little VP.  I'm thinking my current root slot will become my ferine avatar slot when I ding 65, so VP is probably a good idea (already have ornate legs).  Maybe I'm crazy, but I find AAs to be more fun than levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thanks for replies :D<br />
<br />
QB2 will be my choice after SCRM/MGB since it will stack; <br />
<br />
/pet hold also sounds like a resonable skill =)<br />
<br />
...30aa more or so should get me there :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Personally I was like 80 or 90 aa's before I got elder. I did<br />
Run 3<br />
Regen 3<br />
MC3<br />
Cann v<br />
MGB<br />
QB1<br />
ND3<br />
SCM3<br />
QB2<br />
SCR3 + SCRM and that when I finally got my title.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm currently at 72 AA spent, 2 banked, still Venerable.<br />
<br />
After careful consideration of the class AA list, there aren't 24 points that I want to spend there. Odds are I'll be like House, never having Elder title. It isn't something I care about having anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rellix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">get rabid bear!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Arriana,  I'm happy with everything I bought in class:<br />
<br />
MBG - raiding shaman must have<br />
Quickbuff 1 &amp; 2 - love love love<br />
Can 5 - 'nuff said<br />
SCRM - drooooool</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">damn, thanks for all the replies. I think I might go Gloriana's route. never know when Ill need MGB and SCRM is candy =P but I'll probably get some other AAs first. like RC1 VP1 ND mabye some other stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">My current plan is:<br />
<br />
Canni5 (Done) - 5<br />
QB2 (Have 1 currently) - 9 (14)<br />
SCRM - 8 (22)<br />
<br />
MGB would do it, but I honestly have no intention of getting MGB. Can't even buff newbies with it anymore, and that would be the only use I have. The rest of the class list is either &quot;Who cares?&quot; (Pet hold) or downright insulting (Alchemy Mastery, Rabid Bear).<br />
<br />
Having &quot;Elder&quot; by my name is so low on the priority list that outside of this thread, I don't think about it for an instant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I thought you raided a lot Arriana?  No MGB?<br />
<br />
Run 3<br />
Regen 3<br />
MC 3<br />
Cann 5<br />
MGB<br />
VP 1<br />
SC 1<br />
RC 1<br />
ND 3<br />
QB 2<br />
SCM 3<br />
SCR 3<br />
<br />
Working on SCRM now.  I have like 86 AA and am still Venerable.  Should be Elder soon.  It's not a big deal to be an Elder, but it is a better title than &quot;Venerable&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Got Elder title on 89th AA spent, didn't even notice till a guildmate mentioned it to me when we zoned out after exping in PoE. Had just bought QB1 if I recall.<br />
<br />
MGB is kindof handy unless there is absolutely no chance you will ever raid. SCRM is a good one to have for obvious reasons and Canni 5 is downright essential. Rest as you pointed out are pretty much a waste of space.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Pet Discipline is awesome!  especialy if you solo or do small groups with friends and end up as puller.  Great for PLing that 2nd box too :D</div></div><hr />
