<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blind568</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im just looking for some advice on my gear.  Currently Im level 41, with 871 AC and ~1300hp.  Here is my current gear:<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=443407<br />
And if you click on my &quot;near future&quot; profile it will show some of the upgrades Im thinking about getting.  If anyone has any better suggestions or comments Id love to hear them.  Thanks.  Also, I plan to get the JBB first, before all other upgrades.  I should be getting it tomorrow though if all goes well.<br />
<br />
(By the way, I do have a decent amount of money (can make ~10k a day), but try to keep it within reason.  Nothing more expensive than 20k for a single slot)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">How do you make 10k a day at 41?????<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, that just boggles my mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lets face it, if this guy could make 10k a day, he would not be wearing a single item that is currently showing on his profile. He isnt wearing a single item that is worth 1k, let alone 20k.<br />
<br />
so, lets ignore the 10k per day because it smells remarkably like bull****.<br />
<br />
Given the gear that the guy is wearing, which is, lets face it, pretty average for his level, here are  some suggestions for upgrades that are probably not more than 1k per slot, or can be reasonably quested / camped / looted:<br />
<br />
Ears - get Earring of cleansing / purity / twisted leaves<br />
Face - Crystal spider eyes<br />
Wrists - Jarsarth, Coldain Military<br />
Gloves - Crystal chitin gaunts, silver chitin handwraps<br />
Shoulders - Elder wolf hide<br />
Legs - Kromriff Military, Jarsarth<br />
Feet - Black fur boots</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
...........<br />
Try looking at the quest section under the &quot;Coldain Military Wristguard quest.  Read it... then read it again... and maybe once more for good measure.  Then attempt to piece it together.  Think to yourself &quot;Hmmm.. this quest takes about 2 hours total to complete, and I can sell the multiquest for it for 5k to other players.  How might I make 10k a day doing this?&quot;.  Then, come back to this thread, and reread my post.  THEN see if you will be telling me that I smell remarkably like bull****.  Please do a little research before posting stuff like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I must apologise. I thought you were a liar<br />
<br />
I see that you are a fool as well as a liar!<br />
<br />
<br />
Since you are such an expert on the Coldain Bracer, you will, no doubt, be aware that it is a lore item, right? That means you can only have one....which makes it damned hard to farm, right?<br />
<br />
Furthermore, given your thorough knowledge of the Coldain Bracer, you will know that it is also no drop, which means that once you have it, you cannot sell it. again, this would make its useful as a cash-cow farming item seem tenuous at best.<br />
<br />
I know a little bit about the Coldain Military Bracer Quest. I have, after all, completed it 3 times in the last 3 weeks. If you click on &quot;ghetto gear&quot; in my signature, you will see that I am wearing said bracer, which is more than I can say for your good self, sir. This indeed begs the question as to why somebody would wear a piece of sh1t Ulthok Bracer when they could, apparently, be wearing a Coldain Military Bracer.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, since I am on the topic of making you look like a liar and a fool, I am going to suggest that you are a liar for saying that you can even do the bracer quest. The final mob (who is called Korf, but seeing as yuo are such an expert, I dont have to tell you that), would not be do-able by you. A level 41 shaman could not take Korf. Well, maybe a fungi wearing uber-twinked shaman with serious cleric buffs might, but with the gear you are wearing, no way jose! (again, bear in mind that I have killed Korf, so I know what I'm talking about).<br />
<br />
So, Sir, Given that I did actually point out some equipment that might actually be within your financial range, and given that your spurious claims have been, I think, effectively shown to be bull****, I advise you to let it lie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cazec</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Excuse me but where to Earrings of Purity/Cleasning drop or how much do they sell for? Thanks ! : )<br />
<br />
<br />
Cazec</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Earring of Purity<br />
2AC +1wis +35hp +35mana, counteract disease <br />
<br />
Earring of Cleansing<br />
2AC +1wis +35hp +35mana, counteract poison<br />
<br />
As far as I know, both drop from an &quot;Iskar Trustee&quot;, in Chardok. This mob is, I think, level 57.<br />
<br />
Prices will, of course, depend on your server: On Vallon Zek these typically sell for around 1 - 1.5k in the Bazaar, but mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cosik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not ussually one to jump up and defend/correct people but you can make 5k per Coldain military bracer the post he was refering too was this one <br />
<br />
http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4110<br />
<br />
and if you read the fourth post down in the thread you will see what he is talking about.  He is not selling the bracer he knows that it is lore/no drop.  <br />
<br />
He is getting a character with the Giant Control Harness on it then selling the turn in. So he gets paid to turn the Giant Control Harness in to the Broodmother in to start the quest to make the mob who drops the bracer spawn.  He does the leg work of getting it ready then gets paid to let someone else finish the quest.<br />
<br />
So on a good day and could find the people to pay for this you could make 10k pretty quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I stand by my assertion.<br />
<br />
If this guy is making 10k per day, why is his gear so, so, so...&quot;ordinary&quot;?<br />
<br />
Without wishing to denegrate the poster of the thread to which you refer, I would hazard a guess that his case, if true, is fairly isolated: I mean, one can do the whole quest oneself in approx 2 hours! I did the whole quest in less than 2 hours, and I am max coldain / min Kael Drakkel faction.<br />
<br />
So, who do you know that would rather spend 5k than do a 2 hour quest? Anyone prepared to drop 5k to save 2 hours must have so much frikken plat that they probably dont need a CMB anyway. I mean, the bracer is nice, but even if it were droppable, I would not pay 5k for it.  <br />
<br />
I'm not going to say that the bracer has not been multi-quested, nor that a mule with the harness in the broodmother cave could not make &quot;some&quot; money, but I will bare my arse in the front window of safeway if anyone is making 10k per day regularly - certainly it ain't happening on my server.<br />
<br />
Even assuming that it is possible to make &quot;good money&quot; (whatever that might be) as a harness mule, the fact remains that this guy (a) does not have a CMB himself and (b) is wearing gear that altogether isnt worth what he is claiming to have available to spend on each slot. Go figure....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blind568</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks Cosik.  Unlike some people on this board you apparently have some common sense and know a bit about this game.  Perhaps isntead of a sarcastic, misinformed &quot;apologoy&quot; post, you could post a real apology, Weyalan.  After all, you were not only rude, but you were wrong :)<br />
<br />
As far as the people asking why my gear is so ordinary for my level, it is because of this;  I just learned of this coldain quest, and so far have made 33k in 3 days.  I bought a JBB with the money, and now am just looking for suggestions as to what I should buy with this newly found income.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Also, I dont really care whether or not you guys believe that I am making that kind of money or not, that's not the issue here.  I just want some gear advice, so you can either kindly offer some or just move along.  All I want is some help, not a huge argument.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If I have wronged you, I wholeheartedly and inequivovally aoplogise, no question.<br />
<br />
I am flabbergasted, and I do mean absolutely and completely gobsmacked that you are making 33k in 3 days doing something that people could do themselves in a couple of hours! I don't know what server you play on, but man oh man the economy must be FUBAR. It is not like 5k grows on trees. I cannot understand how anybody would seriously weigh up the option - will I (a) spend 2 hours doing a quest or (b) give somebody 5k...hmmm..I know  the answer - its (b)!....incomprehensible.<br />
<br />
So, yes, assuming the veracity of your asserions, you have my contrition and apologies.<br />
<br />
Ok, as penace, I offer gear suggestions. Some of them are a fair bit more than 20k, some a lot less:<br />

Secondary (or back slot): Lodizial shell shield, Orb of the infinite void, Shield of Bane Warding, Sarnak Battle Shield, Skull Marked Shield<br />

Chest: Fungi tunic or Jbone BP or Emerald Dragonscale tunic<br />
