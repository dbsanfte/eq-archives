<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faeanan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi everyone. I'm looking for some advice on good duo spots for my 70 SK and 67 Shammy pair.<br />
<br />
These are the two magelos:<br />
SK       http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=336033<br />
Sham   http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1062305<br />
<br />
I'm in a time level guild and we've killed everything up to quarm but I've been away for a while and so the gear on the two toons is only elemental level but will be upgraded soon I hope. The SK has his 68 pet and the shammy has all spells up to PoP but no GoD or OoW stuff. <br />
<br />
I don't really care about loot. I just want a place to duo to get away from the boredom in fire. You can only root rot there for so long =/<br />
Thanks for the help in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>forsurenot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You could try RCoD, while you are there, can do statue camp with 3 PHs near by.  SK pet single pull and have a chance at some OoW spells for your shammy.  The new buffs rock.  If that's too easy, can do Bowlord's  camp top left corner on the map of same zone.  <br />
<br />
I have 69 shammy and I duo with 67 Necro with his pet tanking, can take on nameds but hard on my mana.  Cuz we are both not in raiding guild, so gear wise is not that good, also only have 150ish AAs.</div></div><hr />
