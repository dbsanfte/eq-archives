<br />
As can be seen in my Mag I am in need of some upgrades (if them blasted giants in Kael weren’t so stingy with the chain : ( ).  Thanks to some lucky runs in Seb I have about 7.5k to spend.  Since the time and funds are always limited I am looking to get some items that I will use for the rest of my life : ).  At the moment I am thinking of getting an ikky chest piece (or a FUNGI drool-ok done dreaming) and maybe some CC gaunts or some coldain skin gloves (could camp the ikky but there is ALWAYS a druid in my way it seems plus w/o track kinda hard).  Figure I can do this by selling my froggie chestplate after buying the ikky.  I know my earrings and my bracers need to be upgraded but do not know any cheap upgrades for them.  As an alternative, I do have a Jarsath chest plate which would suffice for a time if the money could be put to better use elsewhere.  I would love to scrap the money together to get a JBB but there does not seem to be any available for sale atm (Friend of mine has been auctioning forever on Zeb for one).<br />
<br />
Been looking at the mag profiles that are posted but have no clue as to how much things are going for. <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Howling harpoon is a direct upgrade for your range slot, 6wis 40mana over 5wis 10mana, and its very cheap.  If you can find them, barbed rubicate bracers and helm are good, not to expensive (and drop in ct).  Most people wear some form of hp/mana gear for shoulders (ww mantles come to mind).  Coldain skin gloves would be great, I really think jb gear blows.  No hp, mana, or wis... yeah it has ac but what item doesnt have ac?  Your gear looks pretty good for your level.  I wouldnt get an iksar regen bp either, if you cant get a fungi then save for a jbb before you buy an iksar regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Agreed on the JBB part.<br />
<br />
I'd probably upgrade the legs first and both wrists to a better AC item but my first would be the belt.  Go with the chitinous belt, sells for 1k-1500 on BB and would be an upgrade via both AC and Stamina.  Maybe go to JB Boots as well to get that AC up some.  Maybe also get a goranga idol for your ranged slot.   Again though I&quot;m an AC/hp junkie so if your style is more rooty-rotty then your going to want to ignore me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Verata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Black sapphire earrings, get 2 black sapphires, auction looking for jeweler(someone who sells 6/65 rings, to confirm thier skill level).  Ask if they will combine with enchanted electrum, and if they succeed on both you will offer them 100p (150p might be better)  That gets you a pair of the ac 2 hp 35 mana 25 earrings for about 500p.  Chance that they will fail is about 5 percent.<br />
<br />
Crystal spider eyes, 1k<br />
<br />
Coldain skin gloves 2500<br />
<br />
Or iksar BP for the whole wad... shrug, i would go with the BP actually, as 5 hp regen plus your spell still makes a world of difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drachen183</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">IMO save up for a JBB, i am pretty sure you are from Zeb also so they arent too much if you can find one being sold. Or just level a bit and try to get into a crypt group in seb, which is probably your best bet, at 51 i had no problems finding a group in seb if i was patient, and at 54 i still get MASS exp using JBB, other than that your equip looks very very good for the level, the only thing i really want to upgrade is to get a horsey! =D <br />
P.S. drop me a tell if you are on Zeb if you have any questions, hopefully i can answer um!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Save your cash you will be needing that for spells soon enugh :(<br />
A lot of the stuff already sugjested would be good and is getting in your lv range to go camp or already is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A couple of cheap suggestions...<br />
<br />
Arms: Upgrade them to JB. RE Arms aren't that great, except for the MR. Else, you're better off with the AC of JB armor.<br />
<br />
Leggings: The lesser Dragon Leggings from WW are cheap, and offer good AC.<br />
<br />
Bracer: If you're wearing that for the effect, I suggest doing the Coldain Military Wristguard quest. You get an EA III item, with much better statistics overall.<br />
<br />
Cloak: For a few KPP, you could probably pick up an Ancient Seahorse Cloak. AC20, +25 HP... a very nice upgrade.<br />
<br />
Boots: Get some Tribal War Boots. Better AC and statistics. You can click your Black Fur Boots from the inventory, like JBoots, so no worries here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vadmir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hey Shaala<br />
<br />
Yep I am on Zeb and splitting time between OOT and Seb.  <br />
<br />
Can I touch yer tunic : )?  I promise not to drool on it.<br />
<br />
BTW know anyone selling a JBB?<br />
<br />
<br />
Gloob.....<br />
<br />
Actually I got rid of the JB arms for the RE.  First (and only) hate raid so they are sentimental.  Also my resists suck : (.<br />
<br />
<br />
Others<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice.  We will see what happens since it all depends on what is avail.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>WM231NIKE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Bracer: Replace CBB with a Sentry Bracer<br />
<br />
Boots: Tribal War Boots or JB Boots<br />
<br />
Cloak: If you know any tailors that will combine for free, try to get supplies for a arctic wyvern cloak.  Seahorse one is good too.<br />
<br />
Face: Crystal Spider Eyes<br />
<br />
Ring: Replace the wedding band with a 6ac 65hp ring or Shadel Bandit Ring</div></div><hr />
