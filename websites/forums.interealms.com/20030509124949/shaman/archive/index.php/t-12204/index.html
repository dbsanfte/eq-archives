<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Antmf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya all I am 54 and want to know what buffs are best to use ? Like harness or Infusion and why and what other buffs should I stack with infusion etc. And what is the main difference between the 2? Thanks...<br />
Also when soloing what buffs do you use on yourself and the pet :) its been over a year since I played and just reactivated my acct and very rusty lol Thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At 52 these are the buffs I use most of the time:<br />
SoW from Black Fur Boots; Harnessing of Spirit<br />
and Stamina. These or their replacements are your most effective &quot;buffs.&quot;<br />
<br />
In a group I need enough mana to slow. It is more important than almost anything else. I almost always have sufficient mana to give everyone stamina, haste melee if no enchanter, and to HoS tanks. I will HoS casters if mana permits, or Talisman of Altuna. I do not pass out agility usually. <br />
<br />
The group spell I sometimes use is Spirit of Bih'Li which enhances attack as well as provides group SoW.<br />
<br />
I also may Guardian and Rage and Bear Form myself.<br />
<br />
Dog-dog gets HoS, Alacrity and Spirit Quickening.<br />
<br />
I use Stoicism all the time now. Great for casters and for myself. By the way, have mana, and be prepared to cast Superior Healing if Stoicism doesnt keep up with DPS upon that caster. The tank should be able to pull the mob of the caster if the mob is not running.<br />
<br />
My spell line up is as follows: 1. Sup Heal 2. (Buff) 3. Immobilize 4. Malosini 5. Turgurs 6. Envenomed Bolt 7. Stoicism 8. Cannibalize II.<br />
<br />
Good luck. It is a great solo and group class. Also remember to hand dogdog two weapons. It adds a slight bit of damage (15%). DogDOg is nothing like any of the other pets, but this helps a little.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Morrighan Dreamwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My usual line-up at 58th is:<br />
self;<br />
sow/billy<br />
talisman of tnarg (I like the extra hp's)<br />
talisman of the brute<br />
horse  ;P<br />
tanks;<br />
hos<br />
billy<br />
brute<br />
agi (if the beg good enough)<br />
casters;<br />
billy<br />
brute<br />
<br />
With cann4 + stoi I can, and have been, main healer in a tier 1 pop group, as well as keeping up those buffs plus slow and haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In grouping situations, I cast Talisman of Kragg on all members, except the melees who complain and want HoS because they think that stats do something. Talisman of Brute is also one I always cast. I occasionally Billy unless there is someone to cast Pack Spirit in the group. 15 atk is nice but the duration on billy is sooo short. I also do talisman of the Cat and Rhino when I'm feeling particularly buff happy. They dont really do anything but I cast them anyways to shut the melees up. If there is no Enchanter in the group, I haste as well.<br />
<br />
Solo, the buffs stay darn near the same. very rarely Ill cast Guardian on myself for additional AC, but otherwise it stays Kragg, Sta, and Sow.<br />
<br />
As for the pet, I think lots of people overbuff their pets. 90% of the time I give my dogdog. The other 10% I put haste and sow, when I know we will be running around together. I basically never HP, AC, or stat buff my pet. I have never noticed a signifigant difference, at least one worth the mana.<br />
<br />
Of course I do dual-wield buff him :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tappion Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I normally on tanks or people who need dex do kraggs infusion dex and stam. Casters get just Kraggs. Then i do billy, and occasionally haste. Non tank melees will normally get HoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kraegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Solo: kragg / regrowth / sow; pet - regrowth / haste<br />
<br />
duo with monk: me - kragg / regrowth / bih li ; monk - HoS / Shroud of spirits (ac buff) / regen / haste  ; pet haste<br />
<br />
group - HoS for melee / haste / bih li for group and kragg (sometimes) and regen for me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grimmlukk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In grouping situations, I cast Talisman of Kragg on all members, except the melees who complain and want HoS because they think that stats do something.<br />
<br />
Hrmm...HoS increases STR by a significant ammount, which, in turn, increases DPS. SUre, its not a HUGE increase in DPS, but every little bit of DPS means more experience for the group (and me ;) !).<br />
<br />
Ditto for AGI and DEX buffs.  AGI adds a little bit of AC for the tank, so he gets the best AGI buff I cand cast, not as a PRIORITY buff, but as soon as I can free up the mana for it.  DEX only gets buffed for people who have proccing weapons...or for folks who request it.  <br />
<br />
The truth is that stats (and stat buffs) DO something.  Not as much as we would like, but every little bit helps.<br />
:)<br />

Editorial PS: I just wanted to point out that if you have a rogue in your group and you AREN'T giving him STR/HoS, then you are doing yourself (and your group :) ) a great disservice: the effect on STR for a rogues BackStab ability is the ONE place where our STR buffs really shine.</div></div><hr />
