<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Opafaf</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 02:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are there any rangers out there that would use a Blade of Carnage?  I know I may be jinxing us, but the Avatar of War has been VERY good to us with these and we have 2/3 or our warriors already equipped. At this rate there may be some available to rangers in the future. :)  I'm just curious to see if anyone would use this sword. Would it be just for soloing? Could a warrior keep taunt off you if he was using one as well and would that make it raid usable?  Just curious as to what you all thought.<br />

primal is better still /sigh bow really needs an upgrade, suppose thats why most of the rangers get one.</div></div><hr />

Great blade to hold for stats if you're an AM3 ranger, but there are a lot better out there...</div></div><hr />

<br />
look the only time this would be useful is when your soloing because when you solo you are the top of the hate list anyway.  If you actually melee with this thing you are a retard since we were given jolt for a very good reason.. so having a blade casting the negajolt ( hate increases) would be stupid. Rangerstains do no damage...</div></div><hr />
