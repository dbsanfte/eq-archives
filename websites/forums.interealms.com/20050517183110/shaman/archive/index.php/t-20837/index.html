<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Joromitar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A friend and I are going to duo. Me being the shaman. We may also pick up 1-2 more people. Which class is best for Duoing with a shammy? Which 2 classes, not including me, the Shaman, should be sued for a Trio? Same question for a Quad. Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can do anything really...just depends on what your goals in the game are.<br />
<br />
My group runs a SK/Druid/Shaman/Cleric.  That is me and my RL friend who 2-box.  The idea is too be as self-suffient as possible, and we have obtained it.  Plethera of buffs, rez, summon corpse, debuffs, ports, mana regen, and enough healing to survive an encounter that is waaay over our head.  We can also kite non-summoning mobs with the greatest of ease :D<br />
<br />
Downside = lack of DPS.  GoD mobs eat our lunch, so we avoid going there.  Other than that, its slow and steady killing :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well shamans lack snare and FD, two vital pulling and crowd control spells and two of the very best spells in the game by far.<br />
<br />
Shaman's strength is buffing melees.<br />
<br />
So...why not add a melee that can bring you snare and FD?  Shadowknight.  I love mine.  He's a melee who can tank, too, and summon corpses.  That's a lotta love.<br />
<br />
You could also use some more DPS since both SK and shaman are pretty low DPS.  And shaman heals leave a lot to be desired.<br />
<br />
So why not add a healer who can do some DPS?  Druid dps is very respectable -- they can both root and DOT, and when they get enough levels, they can charm pets for very strong pet damage output.  Plus, their heals are very respectable.  And, they also have snare and very, very good buffs, and can even evac you out of trouble if things go bad, or just port you from place to place.  All in all, a very very good class.<br />
<br />
That would make an ideal trio I think.  You've got healing and buffing and pulling and corpse summoning all very well covered.  And, nice utilities like tracking in the druid, damage shields, ports...SK's eventually get a spell that can give you mana and hitpoints in small amounts when they cast it(zevfeer's bite i think it's spelled)...it's just all around a pretty beautiful trio.<br />
<br />
Fourth?  Whatever you like really.  You've got the basics covered.<br />
<br />
A bard or chanter would be really nice for crowd control.  You already have two snarers and two rooters in that trio above, but you can never have too much crowd control.  Chanters eventually become incredibly powerful toons that are central to the game, too.  If you get them high enough(and courageous enough) to charm pets, they become the highest DPS class in the game by miles and miles.<br />
<br />
And clerics can buff/heal/rez, necros can mana twitch, snare, FD pull, have a decent pet DPS, can kite, DD ok, DOT incredibly well, even mez and charm some mobs and have a necro rez.<br />
<br />
Lots of choices.  <br />
<br />
I really think the trio I recommended above pretty much covers all your major bases, and very well.  Not that plenty other combos won't work great too.  (Some people are terrified of deaths and won't dream of going anywhere without a rezzer -- so some will not accept a trio without a pally or a cleric.)  And after you have heals/pulls/(probably going to want at least one)tank down, garnish as you like with whatever, with a lot more freedom to choose whatever weird combos you like without feeling like you're lacking anything.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kinrab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">for a trio i would go your shaman a paladin and a monk(thats what i do)shaman healing/slowing/buffing/debuffing/DoTing. paladin stacking buffs/heals/group heals/REZZ at all times/stuns/root and monk pulling/major dps. imo this makes a far far better self sufficient trio than with an sk/shaman/dps. but for your quad if you have a cleric in it then i would go for an sk and mage as your partners.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mrwallace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I play a 65 shaman and a 65 rogue.  I love this duo.  Most encounters are over in a very short time.  The rogue can get me into places I ordinarily couldn't, can scout, ranged dps, very good close dps, corpse recovery.  You might think keeping agro would be difficult...I actually will dread the day that they fix or DOT agro:).  Either way though, root agro always works.  I typically slow and BoS...pet auto engages when the mob hits me.  Switch to rogue and apply the hurt!  Another thing, if it goes really bad, rogue can escape and live to fight another day:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Duo:<br />
Shaman + Paladin<br />
<br />
Trio:<br />
Shaman + Paladin + Rogue<br />
<br />
Quad:<br />
Shaman + Warrior + Rogue + Cleric</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">shm/war/cle/wiz is a nice quad.  Sometimes when our enc/rog friends are off elsewhere we'll kill Dozekar with the 4 of us.  Long fight, but still pretty easy.  Little weak on DPS, but not bad overall and you can live for a long while.  Could probably swap rog or mag (maybe ranger too) for the wizard for some more utility or dps.<br />
<br />
If you're going to have 4 people around, you'll want the ability to rez, something is bound to go bad eventually.  Either bring a cle, or paladin to tank.  Maybe necro if you don't mind the added expense, or don't die often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Althoug I duo Shaman/Ranger, I wouldnt recommend it for a duo since Rangers arent great tanks.  Heres how I would do it if I had a choice<br />
<br />
2 players - Shaman/Paladin.  Buffs work togther and pally has res ability.<br />
<br />
3 - Shaman/Paladin/Druid.  Druid have additional buffs that stack nicely, provide additional healing, add decent DPS, and have porting ability.<br />
<br />
4 - Shaman/Warrior/Cleric/Wizard.  The cleric takes over healing completly (so Pally healing not needed) and having a wizard allows you to have the highest DPS class in the game.<br />
<br />
5 - Shaman/Warrior/Cleric/Wizard/Bard.  This is one combo I have seen in action; one of our guilds top warriors does this regularly.  The bard brings in the mana songs, additional melee DPS, Mez, charm, resists, etc.  This player sometimes does a 2nd cleric on raids.  For lesser targets like Emp, he runs his own chain.  Additionally, he hydra'd the Tipt trial.  These 5 classes work well together with very little overlap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think paladin is over-rated, but then I have always found worrying about rezzes over-rated.  I'm the adventurous type, and I know in advance I'm going to die sometimes.  So what?  I pick things worth dying for.  <br />
<br />
I'd rather have the FD and corpse summoning and snare of a SK than the stuns/rez/buffs/heals of a pally.  Pally buffs are undoubtedly nice, and heals, but so are SK AC and ATK boosts and superior DPS, and the regular clockwork infusion of mana/HP that a SK gives with z-bite.  Plus, you just gotta have a FD puller.  FD and snare are huge in this game.<br />
<br />
Obviously, all kinds of combos can work out.  Personally, I tried a warrior and missed the FD pulling of my monk a LOT, so I got a FD puller who can actually tank -- sort of like a warrior/monk combo in a way, with many bonuses.   Snare pulling and pet pulling and just regular FD pulling with SK's is very fun and can be pretty creative.  And nothing helps you land a malos or malos/slow combo on a mob like having the mob run around snared while you do it at your leisure.  Pally stuns are great right?  They prevent some damage.  But so does running something around snared till you have it completely debuffed -- yet with no chance of running for you because you slowed him, like they would when I duoed with my warrior or monk.<br />
<br />
To each their own; but FD and snare are really huge, and I'd rate corpse summoning higher than rez any day.  One is convenient, and one is a terrible necessity.<br />
<br />
Maybe less so now that your corpse goes to that new graveyard zone in a week.  If you want to wait a week that is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Wizard gives utility of ports and snare, high DPS, and evac if things go wrong.  For a third, I think that would be ideal.  For the second, obviously a tank of some sort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Shaman+Bard for duo.  We completely complement each other.  Neither has downtime (well, I may have some).  We keep going and going.  Bard makes up for lack of snare, lull, feign, ds, speed, mez.  Magic debuff from both stack.  Shaman can heal, slow, and buff, bard can help with mana regen.  Bard can preslow/predebuff.  Bard can tank.  Bard is a great puller.  Bard can kite while shaman dots and heals (even if mob summons).  Bard can tank while shaman slows and nukes.  Bard can tank an unslowed mob with damage shield while shaman heals.  Bard can charm mobs while shaman buffs them or malos/roots to make the charm easier (and give bard charisma).  Shaman just won't run out of mana (too often).  Bard is immune to mana drains.  Shaman can make potions for bard, like Gate potions.  Shaman can tank too, and can add decent dps via buffs, pet(s), and spells.<br />
<br />
My brother and I duo'd the Va'dyn at the zoneline (bards are good pullers), which took about 1 hour of nonstop fighting... and we didn't even have to get virtue for him.  We were stretching it though.  There were times I couldn't keep up and I asked him to run around while I healed (although Va'dyn summons, he doesn't summon over and over again immediately, so although the bard gets hit, it's still a lot less damage than if he stood there taking the hits).<br />
<br />
The only limiting factor is I can't feign.  If I could then we'd be able to accomplish things faster.<br />
<br />
Mind you, I have 200+ AAs and my brother has 300+, so that is a factor, although we were quite capable of many cool duo stunts before that.  Neither of us are elemental+... we're mainly bazaar geared with some decent really cool items (bard isn't even in a guild, and I haven't gotten anything from my former or my current guild except help with epic(s), Remove Greater Curse, and good company).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jinin Raine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I've been 2-boxing my shaman and warrior for a long time. I just started doing 3 box myself with a necro. I love it.<br />
<br />
If i was to start duo today: SK + shaman<br />
but my 3 box works well with: warrior + shaman + necro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">well, yeah ... bard + anyone makes a great duo, hehe.  just hard to find bards, and I got the impression he was multi-boxing for some reason.  Anyway, I'll agree with Xev_Grammar.  Get a bard if you can.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL maybe a bard with 200+ AAs and good gear can tank but bards are crappy tank and have poor dps at low and medium lvls.<br />
Plus, bard are too hard to play in dual box.<br />
A duo Bard + shaman need too much attention to be effective in dual boxing and worst in tri boxing.<br />
<br />
Shaman-Necro or Shaman-SK are best duo in my opinion.<br />
Shaman-Necro for outdoors (but hard to play) and Shaman-SK for indoors.<br />
<br />
For a trio my suggestion is :<br />
<br />
BST + CLERIC + NECRO.<br />
With this one you have very good DPS.<br />
Great tanking abilities with 3 tanks. (2 great pet + BST)<br />
High DPS, Good Tanking abilities, Haste, 65% Slow, Sow, Stats buffs, Mana regen from BST.<br />
Best Rez, Best Heals, some DPS, Stun, Best Hp buffs, Pacify from cleric.<br />
High DPS, Snare, Fear, Feign death, Summon corpse, Some CC, high mana regen from necro. (93% rez in case cleric die)<br />
<br />
You can try too this one if you prefer :<br />
PAL + SHM + NECRO.<br />
Plate tank, Taunt, REZ, Good Hp buffs, Lay on hand, Stun, Pacify, good heals.<br />
Best Slow, Haste, Good DPS, Best stats buffs, Heals from shaman.<br />
High DPS, Snare, Fear, Feign death, Summon corpse, Some CC, high mana regen from necro. (93% rez in case Paladin die)<br />
<br />
If you find better than these two trio let me know cause they are best trio i've played and trust me i tried a ton.<br />
<br />
For a quad you ll need high DPS if you want to do some LDON :<br />
<br />
With the BST, CLERIC, NECRO trio i would probably chose a magician.<br />
With 3 pets summoned armor and weapons is a great addition. Druid is a very good choice too at a 4th member. 2 healers is always a good thing  in a party, plus druid can teleport, have nice DPS, DS, and the 14 min snare is invaluable too.<br />
<br />
With the PAL + SHM + NECRO trio : Magician, druid or cleric.<br />
<br />
Anyway you need for a good DUO or Trio at least :<br />
DPS, some Tanking abilities, Feign Death, Snare, SLOW (very important in end game), Haste, Heals, Sow and if possible REZ + Mana regen of some sort and summon corpse.<br />
Best class who have lot of these are : Shamans, Beastlord, Shadow Knight, Necro. It's why most good duo or trio have one or several of these class in their rang.<br />
