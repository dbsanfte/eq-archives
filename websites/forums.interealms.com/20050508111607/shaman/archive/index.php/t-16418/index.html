<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I posted this guide on EQTraders.com earlier, just thought I'd post it here too.<br />
<br />
Someone asked me how it worked in the channel last night, and I suggested I posted it here in the forums to make it easier to explain to the hordes of people still confused by it.<br />
<br />

<br />
As you can see, I have earned a total of 153pts in Miragul`s, and 51 in each Takish &amp; Rujarkian. I have earned none in Mistmoore or Deepest Guk. I have spent some of those points, giving me 135 points avaliable for spending.<br />
<br />
I can only buy items from a certain theme, costing the same as, or below the total amount I have earned there.<br />
<br />
Taking the picture, I am currently at Ruj. I can buy the Orc's Earthen Belt (40pts) but not the Dusty Old Coin (52pts). If I wanted to I could buy the belt and the Orc-Tooth Necklace (40pts) since the total earned stat doesnt change when you spend points.<br />
<br />
You can usually see a few items just out of reach of your current total points at a camp, to wet your appetite for what you can get next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">there are also items that are &quot;general&quot; you can use points from all the area's to buy them they are the ones that have the ___ for the theme ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep, I'm still pretty confused, regarding the points earned, where you earned them, where they go, and where you can spend them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stickygoo Onjooshoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Think it works like this. <br />
<br />
max points you can spend at any site = points you have earned at that site. <br />
<br />
if you only do 2 missions for north ro (say 104 points total).  Then you can spend up to 104 points at that sight no mater where you earn them. In order to see the realy good stuff you need to raise the max points you can spend at that location. <br />
<br />
At least thats how I figure it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There are several excellent explanations floating around.  This is the one that stuck in my head (from Zanithar I think):<br />
<br />
A - When you 'win' a dungeon, you get *2* types of points - 'spendable' points and faction points.<br />
<br />
B - Your spendable points can be spent to buy stuff at any wayfarer camp you want.  They are the &quot;Points Available&quot; in the picture.<br />
<br />
BUT<br />
<br />
C - &quot;Total Points Earned&quot; (in the picture) are faction points. A merchant will *only* sell you something that costs less than your Total Points Earned for his camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There are 2 kinds of points... think of one as faction points and another as spendable points.<br />
<br />
They acrue at the exact same rate. (ie an adventure that gives 51 points gives 51 faction, and 51 spendable)<br />
<br />
Spendable points can be spent anywhere.<br />
<br />
Faction points are for the specific camp you adventured at.<br />
<br />
so... I earn 1000 points at rujarkan hills, and 500 at deepest guk: I can spend all 1500 at either place, but the vendors in rujarkin like me more -so they will sell me 1000 point items wheras the vendors at guk will only sell me up to 500 point items. I could buy 3 500 point items at either camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hehe... well it seems that alot of you know about it already :) And can explain it better than me</div></div><hr />
