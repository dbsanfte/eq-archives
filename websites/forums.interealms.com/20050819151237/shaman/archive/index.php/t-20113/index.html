<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know if this GoD raid is just plain bugged atm or is there really a way to kill them without the damn things repopping for hours and hours? <br />
<br />
We have managed to kill the odd golem but have no idea how to repeat it consistently.  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well if I could help you You wouldn't ask ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">gakal.. tell shummn to check his private messages, i responded to it on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes, better keep this rocket science secret for the rest of us monkies :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brodda Thep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They are just bugged.  They are still killable, but bugged at the same time.  Sometimes what is supposed to kill them doesn't actually kill them.  Hopefully it will be fixed soon.  What is otherwise an interesting idea has been ruined by the expected sony bugs.</div></div><hr />

Or utility or intelligence or wisdom.<br />

<br />
Val sent me the above messages, and I assume that's how they're supposed to look instead of guessing/getting lucky on the kills.<br />
Thinking that they are more than usually bugged on some servers..<br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">very bugged for us last night.... got some good xp for killing them hour after hour though...<br />
<br />
brawn fell for us fast, talisman and bard song didn't... *** is talisman?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think we've gotten a talisman killed with a shaman :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Looks to me like you need to tank mezz everyone of them when they pop then kill one of them at a time first to see what class needs to do the finishing touches on it.  Once one of them is dead and you get that message above <br />
<br />
[XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX] Your skills were insufficient to defeat the sentinel!<br />
[XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX] The creature appears vulnerable to summoned elements.<br />
<br />
Then use whatever class is necessary to put the finishing blow on the mob, being sure he does a greater percentage of dmg to the mob than everyone else combined.  No, i don't know if that's the exact solution, but it's one that worked for us.<br />
<br />
The summoned creatures one is of course a mage.  <br />
<br />
Oh, Shummn sent me a private message and I responded to it before Gakal posted this, which is why I stated above to have him check his PMs, not that i was deliberately trying to withhold information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">yeah, me and hargurce (another guild shm) were allowed to kill 4 of them, 1 completely duo by him and I with a tank aggroing to take the hits.  no worky.  dots galore, nothing.</div></div><hr />
