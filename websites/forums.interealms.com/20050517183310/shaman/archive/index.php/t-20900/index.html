- Short races should be able to manage steps and slopes more easily, so gnomes and halflings will again be under foot.   <br />
- Arrows should no longer make NPCs look like porcupines. Please note that we have nothing against porcupines and consider them a fine animal. <br />
<br />
You will now have the option to bind cycle through PC and NPC targets to a hot key of your choice.  You can hit your select nearest target key at any time, during cycling, to reset the cycle.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Ok, anybody wanna call the odds for Bearform, Shrink, and Levitate being messed up yet again?<br />
<br />
I used to be a little bear that could climb the tallest trees and highest spires, now I can barely climb these little steps!   Help me!  I've fallen and can't get up!</div></div><hr />

So the first thing i do when i log on after the patch is get a nice big kite together in PoD on my bard and die because of a collision issue...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Maybe this means you can position most bosses in time correctly without stupid wall spinning and warping.....fighting inny through his portal rules.</div></div><hr />

I am sure it sucks for them to have to jump, but fatter races get can't go through alot of doors :( I am guessing however it was a much bigger problem for them with the DX 9 engine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I just wanted the mount bugs fixxed, so I don't have to look at the inside of my own head as I ride my horse (and thats IF I can get the horse moving at all).<br />

I had the opportunity to watch a gnome guildmate of mine attempt to enter the sewers the other night, up the steps there.  Trust me, it was pretty funny to see him bounce back every time he tried to go up, you could almost see the smoke coming from his ears lol :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">That's about as funny as running into an auto-sit trap in Kod'Taz.  Couldn't stand to move, couldn't stand to cast, had to wait for CoH.  Invis wears off...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>KudorWolfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">As a barbarian I seem to get stuck a ton on ladders now after this patch. Not the kind of stuck where you need to duck and jiggle to get out of. But the kind of stuck where you cant move at all ducking , jumping, spinning real quick dont help. Had to /q 3 or 4 times just to finally get unstuck. Very very annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>krindaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Aye, I got stuck i Lguk on a ladder today, thankfully a druid succored me eventually. I've also crashed while zoning 4 times and had some weird /duck/sit bug that plays havoc with my casting. It's as I always say...SOE patch fixes 3 things and frells up 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The pathing is still atrocious in GoD......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ducking has got me. I can duck sure, but heck I can't &quot;unduck&quot; without either sitting or jumping first. Damned annoying, really messes with patch healing MT on raids or anything else where I want to duck out of casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">same here Goldark. Have to duck, then sit/stand to get up from it.. Pretty annoying with 4 hardhitters in &quot;camp&quot; and another shaman slows before you :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I always just jumped to stop casting because of where my hands are positioned with my keyboard/mouse/hotkey set up, it's a lot quicker.  Plus it's one less keystroke!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My shrunk Ogre Shammy got stuck under a levi'd halfling. Ducked to get out of casting a spell, the halfling sank, stuck ogre. Couldn't move at all, couldn't stand back up.<br />
<br />
All the while, the halfling giggled happily away over having &quot;pinned&quot; the ogre.<br />
<br />
Damn halflings.<br />
<br />
Wastrel da Leezurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Same happened last night in POW, which seemed to make it even clumsier.  Could not get out of ducking without sitting down and standing up.  Considering how much I spam ducking to change the person I'm healing when someone else starts to heal him, or stop trying to slow a mob when someone else hotkeys out they've slowed it, etc...this new bug really put a cramp in my style big time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>SalaniSkahdi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The Duck bug annoyed me greatly while raiding last night - I asked several other people if they were having the same problem and based upon those responses I found the cause:<br />
<br />
If you FULLY shrink yourself (maybe as a large race only) you will get the duck bug every time.    Either shrink yourself once, or twice then grow, and the problem goes away!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Ah thanks I will try that.  I am an ogre and always triple shrink.</div></div><hr />
