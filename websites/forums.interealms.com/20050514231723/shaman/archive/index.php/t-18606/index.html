<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I've been playing Star Wars Galaxies a bit lately, and in that game SOE is giving out holocrons (items that give a hint on how to become a jedi) to every character on Christmas day.  So I thought it would be cool if SOE did something like that for EQ, but then I wondered what could they give?  I figured maybe a +HP augment (everyone needs hit points), or some really good stat food (fruit cake or gingerbread cookies).  Any other ideas on what SOE could give out if they loved EQ players as much as they love SWG players?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd just be happy if they gave out something neat/unique looking. Doesn't even have to have stats, or great stats. Just something to kinda show off, and make it different each year. UO gives out Holiday Gifts as well.<br />
<br />
This year they're giving out a little gift wrapped box, that contains a Snowman with a random GMs name on it (like when you hover your cursor on it, it says A Snowman then below that (GM Name) the Snowman), a Wreath, a Poinsetta(spelling), and a snowflake.<br />
<br />
None of them have any uses, but you can show them off in your house or whatever. Just a nice little thing to have, they're nifty.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">GM cookies and milk are the best.  We have some of the nicest guides and GMs on the Nameless from what I've seen personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zugarbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I wanna see undead wearing red hats and Christmas stockings on their feet.  I think Santa ought to be a GM event. Only he'd be Satan Claws and he'd be unsanare-able, unslowable, unrootable and he'd have an uber 2hb Bag o' Toys with Bowl Full o' Jelly Proc. <br />
<br />
Eight summoned pets. You guess the names.<br />
<br />
Drops would be:<br />
Christmas Toy<br />
LORE, NODROP, NORENT<br />
Range, Charm<br />
HP/mana +25, Char plus 100, <br />
effect: Holiday Cheer (worn)<br />
<br />
Holiday Cheer: puts a smile on your face making your body shimmer in a light, golden glow <br />
<br />
These would be stackable so Satan Claws' corpse could have hundreds for peeps to loot. But everyone would only get one.</div></div><hr />

Cute!  But I think I'll be happy if they can just stabilize the current patch. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Give everyone one Can o` Whoop Ass (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=11175) (effect (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=911)).<br />
<br />
Much better than a can of cranberries.</div></div><hr />

I was grouping an alt with a friend's alt yesterday and he was collecting charcoal (lumps of coal, hehe) to give out to friends.  :P</div></div><hr />
