<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Allrighty I checked out the FAQ and nothing pertained specifically to my problem so I thought I'd run it by you all :)<br />
<br />
I am a Level 53 Shammy ( this is my first toon ever, so I trained it late if that pertains in any way) :D <br />
Here is how my specialization reads<br />
<br />
Evocation--50<br />
Conjuration--50<br />
Divination--50<br />
Abjuration--50<br />
Alteration--51<br />
<br />
So any particular reason why in ~20 lvls of casting alteration non-stop would equal out to zero skill ups in specialization?  In a group I fully buff, I heal, I canni. . . I don't get it  :confused:  this is a desperate call for help!<br />
<br />
please?<br />
<br />
<br />
perty please?<br />

    Actually I made the same mistake too awhile back. I imagine you trained the specializations skills awhile after you got them(level 30). I did it this way as well and ended up with spec skill of 50 in all disciplines, which isn't possible. The only way to fix it is to do the quest in sol ro that will reset all the skill to 49. Then just spam a spell from the discipline you want until it gets to 51, then you're gtg.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">baaah that just seems so odd. Your right I did train it late  :D  Didn't quite understand it and held off a few lvls before I did the specialization thing.  Just seems so silly to make me do that quest when I have it set up right . . which I took to usually be the cause for doing that quest. . .<br />
Thanks for your help, geuss I'll go bite the bullet then  ;)     <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">no problems with haveing all specialize skills at 50.  I would petition before you did the quest in solro.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Phinger Bang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I had something similar happen.  I was updating my skills in magelo and noticed on magelo that I was 50's with 200 in alt.  But on my character I was all 0's!  This isn't my first toon and I just don't see myself making that mistake.  In any case, I ran to our trainer to put at least 1 in each spec and got ready to spam an alt spell to get 50+ in spec alt.  So when I started spamming my spell I didn't see the instant improves that I expected, so I looked at my skill list and all my specs were 64 (my level) and alt was 50!  Rather then even make an attempt at contacting a GM, I went right ahead and did the spec reset quest.  This put all my specs to 49 (as it is supposed to) and a few canni's later I was spec alt 52 and climbing (now maxxed).<br />

Hope that helps : )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Asyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Okay!<br />
<br />
I /petitioned it and here is perty much what they have to say so far.<br />
<br />
First well gee thats odd we'll send it over to a GM.<br />
Second do the quest  :eek: <br />
<br />
Soooo though it isn't a normal thing to happen really I guess the solution is still the same.  If i hear from a GM on it i'll post it here too  :p <br />
<br />
thanks for all your help  :D     <br />
