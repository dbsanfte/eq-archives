<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a bit upset with BLs now. Haven't really spent much time with them, but I am way angry.<br />
<br />
The BL slows a hell of a lot better than I do. He doesn't need Malo. He casts as fast as I did with the affliction Foci. I cast Malosini and get 3 resists. He casts before any debuff and hits first try.<br />
<br />
I used to be the one to slow and root adds. I dont have that job anymore. BL slows and his pet tanks.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This has me so hot I dont know even what to type. This is very wrong. Now I am just a buff bot. <br />
<br />
What am I useful for now? <br />
/t Meku for buffs and I will go watch a movie</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You forgot that the BST can also clarity the group and regen and give equivalent buffs to a shammy's focus line.  And melee, and nuke for as much as a sub-64-with-Velium-Strike shaman.  <br />
And their spells are much easier to get.  <br />
<br />
Dude, you're getting a Beastlord!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have not once called for the nerfing of a class, but, I think there might be one needed. I might as well just have a BL with my shaman on /fo for Sta buffs.<br />
<br />
I went from a main slower on raids to a buffer, now all I am is a gimp healer. I am now put in groups to be a healer while the BL slows.<br />
<br />
Anyone see a problem with that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dude, you don't need stamina buffs at late game.  VT gear in sufficient quantity will put you well over maximum stamina.  Several shamans in my guild have over 300 stamina unbuffed, as do most of our warriors.  <br />
<br />
Buffs are growing to be more and more meaningless.  We are the VI-titled &quot;King of Buffs&quot; so where does that leave us when our best buffs don't even compare to the buff lines of any of the other buffing classes in terms of usefulness? <br />
What would you rather have?  500 hps from Focus or 340 + attack from bst?  17mana/tic mana regen or 25hp/tic hitpoint regen?  just get a beastlord for 8mana+hp/tic regen!  Or a ranger for some massive attack and 200 hps.  Or a paladin for a stacking 250hp buff that lasts hours!  Plus all the reasonably useful cleric buffs.   <br />
<br />
The choice is clear and it is not shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My guild has 2 BL's.  Both are higher level than me (62 atm) and they don't bother slowing.  If your jealous of their abilities, level.  I've done enough buffing over the years to be glad to let someone else do it.  I have np doing sporadic heals on the casters while debuffing and dotting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hey Grim, I guess you got a special new slow to drop at L65. Wanna clue me in where to get it?<br />
<br />
And if both your BLs are 65 with their new slow and they are not slowing, then you need to kick them out. The 65 shaman we have in my guild is so uber it isnt even funny, but it takes him three times as long to slow mobs on raids. Maybe you know something he is doing wrong. We arent all as 'in the know' as you, so why dont you clue us in.<br />
<br />
Some of you might say this is a good thing, they get the slow in fast then we come up behind. But I am not a second rate slower. I should be the queen of it. People should ooo and ahhh at my slowing abilities. But now I am a buff bot. A BL should be the second rate slower, not me. If you can't understand that then you arent a real shaman.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Name:  Sha's Revenge  <br />
Level:  65 <br />
Mana:  150 <br />
Class:  Alteration <br />
Era:     Planes of Power <br />
Vendor(s):  Unknown <br />
Approx Spell Cost:  Unknown <br />
Researchable:  No <br />
Type:  Instant Single Target Debuff <br />
Max Duration:  6 minutes <br />
Casting Time:  3.5 seconds <br />
Recast Time:  5 seconds <br />
<br />
Actual Effects: Target: Reduce Attack Rate (65%) <br />
<br />
Description: This spell reduces the attack speed of the target by 65% which significantly lowers the damage output of the enemy.<br />
The spell is however magic based and can often be resisted.<br />
<br />
From what I have experienced, it is almost Lure type resist. In NToV the BL can slow with one cast, while it takes our 65 shaman to cast Malo to be able to slow.<br />
<br />
Theirs is a faster refresh. Theirs lasts just as long. 10% isnt much of a difference in slow speeds. The enchanters shold be up in arms about it.<br />
<br />
I could see 50%. But that is too close for me.<br />
<br />
I had no beefs when I had the Affliction Foci</div></div><hr />

65% slow (the difference is almost minimal), they can chain it, /disc, np, clerics will actually heal them, and they're almost always right on top of the mob.<br />
<br />
its not 'better' perse, but they're in a much better position/situation to use it. Not to mention its damn cheap mana wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">1.  What zones are you doing.<br />
2.  Is your guild going to remove you because you don't feel effective?<br />
3.  Malo, OSS, Tash still works for me.<br />
4.  If you are referring to Kukar (65 BST in your guild) in your post, the 3 level difference between the two makes a huge difference in slowing mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Read my post again Grim. I am comparing a 65 shaman and BL.<br />
<br />
My guild still wants me, but I feel cheated. That is what this is about.<br />
<br />
They gave me a reason why Shm are better than BL because we dont run oom. But now what that says to me is I am a back up slower for the BL.<br />
<br />
You dont really have an idea what I am talking about though Grim. Grab yourself a 65 BL with his slow and check it out. I bet you wont be happy. And also since you need Malo + Tash + OOS to slow, they dont. I have seen the BL slow when the mob hasnt been debuffed one bit. This is my problem. <br />
<br />
And if they were buffing then I wouldnt care, but they are stepping on my toes. It would be like if we got a 90% rez. Clerics would be up in arms and I wouldnt blame them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">sha's revenge: http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3462&amp;source=Live<br />

<br />
They have the same resist check.  They cannot malo their mob, thus we have an easier time landing our slow than they do.  On top of that, their level 65 spell (which takes a rune) does not slow near as much as our level 51 (free) slow does.  If you say you're a backup slower for the beastlords, then I'm sorry, that's your own fault.<br />
<br />
Focus stacks with almost everything.  It does not stack with their Infusion of Spirit buff (which we have as well), but focus is far far better for HP unless you're casting it on someone who's sta is under 255 AFTER our sta and infusion.  Their clarity and hp/atk buff is nice.  It doesn't conflict with us in any way, it just makes them desirable as well.  They are not better buffers than us, and even if they were, it wouldn't matter because our useful buffs stack.<br />
<br />
They nuke harder than we do with their ice spear spell.  Unfortunately, this spell has a long recast time (45 seconds i think).  Thus, their sustained nuking damage is less than ours.  Even if it wasn't, who cares?  We aren't nukers and never have been.<br />
<br />
Their dots are not better than ours, end of story.<br />
<br />
They are a useful and versatile class in exp groups.  They can function as a slower, but you will NEED a healer in order for your group to survive.  In groups I make, I function as both the healer AND the slower.  All you need is a shaman and a tank to have a functional exp group.  The rest is just gravy.  A few melees and a beastlord cannot be a functional group.  They might get a few kills, but they'll have down time and if **** hits the fan, they're all gonna die.  Beastlords are a powerful class for exp groups, but not nearly as powerful as us.<br />
<br />
The only complaint I have about beastlords is that their powerful and uber-rare 60 spells (sha's advantage and savagery) were put on vendors for 3pp.  Beastlords thought that the spells were too hard to get and complained, so the spells got put on vendors.  That's a slap in the face to the shaman community that has been asking for a torpor/malo fix for years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Lucy might say they have the same resist check, but I have seen them in use. There is no way they do. I have seen the BL slow things faster than a 65 shaman. And not just once or twice but a lot of times.<br />
<br />
I still think they are infringing on our slows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You basically jealous.  Pure and simple.  I'm not jealous of Beastlords one bit.  You are because you feel that they are taking away &quot;your&quot; responsibilities.  When you are raiding and the mob(s) are slowable, nobody cares who slows it, just as long as it's slowed.<br />
<br />
The shaman class has more than 1 niche to fill in EQ.  If you don't know this after 62 levels, you have what we call in the real world &quot;Operator Error&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Err...riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight.<br />
<br />
If a beastlord's willing to burn disc to suicide slow--that's fine with me. However, don't bother pushing your theory on the shaman community because &quot;you have seen BL slow things faster than a 65 shaman&quot;.<br />
<br />
You know, there are nights where I can slow anything that moves without malo. There are also other nights were I get resisted 5 times in a row after full debuffs.<br />
<br />
The same is true with enchanters and beastlords.<br />
<br />
BLs suffer from having no form of MR debuffs--have you seen a BL trying to slow in a CoD, BoT, PoT, or HoH exp group pre malo/tish? No?<br />
<br />
That's because they learned their lesson after the first time they got pounded into the floor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Sure I am jealous. Would be the same statement from a druid if a ranger got ports. Or a Paladin got CHs. Or SKs got better pets or dots than the necros. IMO the casting parent class should be more powerful in its spells than its child. If not, why play the parent class. If I can slow just as well with a BL why not quit the shaman and have great melee with a better pet? They have the ability to melee which gives them a huge advantage over the parent spell casting class. If a Pally is oom he can still put out some melee dps. <br />
<br />
You yourself said that your BLs dont have the spell, so please come back and post after you have been in my situation. You have no experience with what I am complaining about. Landoragon has experienced what I am talking about. <br />
<br />

<br />
I wouldn't mind their slow if it was 50%, but 65% and easier to land is encroaching on the shaman's territory.<br />
<br />
If you don't believe me, then fine. But why dont you go take a 65 BL with you and have slow contests. See who slows first and more often. Do it to prove me wrong then.   :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Let's see.  Going to keep responding to this until I log for the night (playing a beastlord atm to boot!).<br />
<br />
Rangers don't ask bst lords for most of their buffs since it interferes with their own attack buffs.<br />
<br />
Shaman than I know don't other than the mana/hp regen ones.<br />
<br />
Pure casters don't care about attack buffs.<br />
<br />
Neither do druids or clerics.<br />
<br />
Hmmm, I've just eliminated half the classes in EQ for beastlord buffs.<br />
<br />
Sure the other melee may want to waste 3 spell slots instead of one but for some reason even when both of my guilds beastlords are on the raid, I still get tells for FoS from the melees.  I'm pretty certain you can also add a fair chunk of SK's to the shaman &gt; bst buffs since they have a number of self buffs and debuffs but would depend on said SK's attack.<br />
<br />
Yes beastlords can buff more hps than shaman using the spells you have posted but I think you are missing important point on higher end raids.  Only the Main Tank and the backup tanks need those buffs if they want them.  Everyone else should be happy with just FoS.<br />
<br />
And as far as your comment that beastlords are encroaching on the shaman's territory.  Well, I think you are alone in this due to the lack of other threads stating this.<br />
<br />
And if you really really miss buffing folks, make an enchanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Delirios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Jeesh, class envy, on this board? Beastlords taking over the world? Hold my hand please...  <br />
 Think they'll replace shamans soon? Think again, or better yet, play one before you start repeating the &quot;slap in teh face&quot; mantra. <br />
They have great abilities and I love seeing them going from total gimps to powerfull dps/utility class.<br />
 However I dont understand people who yell nerf to other class and then cry momma and cancel accounts when the bat hits you instead. (hi affliction focus fix, you knew it was coming right?)<br />
<br />
If youre afraid that they'll replace you as a slower or raid buffer, you havent obviously played one. Quit crying about beastlords already...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I can't believe you're jealous over a 65th lvl spell.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Lucy might say they have the same resist check, but I have seen them in use. There is no way they do.<br />

I, too, am convinced that the spdat.eff is actually a file full of false information, and the real spell information is saved serverside. They've been leading us on since the beginning! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I don't think I need to prove how well I slow or what raids I am single slower and buffer. Or what experience I have being the main shaman. I have enough, but that isn't the point of this.<br />
<br />
I want you to see how well they slow. Better than a shaman even. Landragoran has noticed it. I never took him seriously until I saw it in action.<br />
<br />
If you dont want to believe it, then that's fine. But I DARE you to prove me wrong. Go grab a 65 BL with his 65 slow and grab yourself a 65 shammy with Malo and see the facts yourself.<br />
<br />
If I have to drag Thott in here with a graph I will. <br />
<br />
I remember when the shaman community said &quot;Slows aren't being mitigated. I think you are just seeing things.&quot; Well we learned that mobs were mitigating.<br />
<br />
So instead of nay saying and sticking your heads in the sand, why don't you look at the evidence. Or are you to scared for the truth? I am going to grab my BL friend and do some tests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Wontonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I don't think beastlord can replace us in term of buffing.  Yeah their buffs are almost as good as ours, and their buffs give atk/mana regen.  But no matter I'm in raid or in group with them, people still asking me, the shaman for focus.  The only buff BST have to worry about is the mana regen one.  Keep in mind that hybird class have a much smaller mana pool than casters. Ask them to buff a whole group or even a raid with all their buffs? They'll go insane.<br />
<br />
As for slow, I haven't group with any 65 BST yet so I don't think I can give any comment on rather their spell have a better chance to land than ours.  But isn't enchanter also have the 70 percent slow? Their slow stack better than ours which is well know.  They can haste way better than us, they can give kei, did they replace us? No.  Actually most enchanter would like a shaman in group to do slow so they can focus on mez or other task.  I think the same goes to BST.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">bst slow can be useful when you take out the yardtrash and if they have a good slow I am most happy with it.. It helps you, me, and everyone at that particular raid. You will notice that you will be choosen as slower anyway when it comes to bosses of any kind..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The point is not that we shamans can slow a little bit better due to our resist debuff line Malo, the point is that beastlords can do everything we can do to ALMOST the same degree except for two areas:<br />
1) Healing, we got em here with our UBER miniCH, oooh.  They got Chloroblast as their top heal. <br />
2) Cannibalize <br />
<br />
Everything else the can also do and do to a similar degree.  PLUS they get a kick ass pet PLUS their melee damage is really really decent, more than a paladin can put out.  They can even haste to 50%, where we get a minor &quot;Upgrade&quot; to 60% haste.  Woopdefriggendoo.<br />
<br />
This is the point.  They get everything we do, and a LOT more.  So we can heal better?  that's our advantage?  Too bad our one advantage is severely gimped due to druids crying about us also having slow.  <br />
<br />
I just think there is a balance problem here that needs to be looked at.  If you are going to make beastlords do all these crazy cool shaman things almost as well as the shamans, THROW US A FRIGGEN BONE!!<br />
A little less nerfing for instance, would be nice.  Every patch, beastlords get an upgrade, shamans get the nerf bat.  <br />
I'm just ****ing tired of it.  I'm too far advanced with this character and there's no chance I'll be starting over with another character that's currently on the receiving end of Sony loving.  <br />
It sux that my chosen class is the target of so much developer h8!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Bazoom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">In a given amount of time:<br />
<br />
Unslowed mob hits you: 100 times (0% slowed)<br />
Beastlord slowed hits you: 35 times (65% slow)<br />
Shammy slowed hits you: 25 times (75% slow)<br />
<br />
Thus a mob slowed by a shaman will hit you 40% LESS than a mob slowed by a Beastlord, which is a significant number - especially if you are talking about a raid-class mob.<br />
<br />
<br />
Isn't this correct?</div></div><hr />

Do you want to be set back to second rate by a hybrid class? I caught flak when I used to rant about how much warriors were getting shafted(much like you're doing to land and others here)  when they were upgrading knights..I don't see many laughing about it now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Thank you Jharassik. Just raising a flag on something I have noticed.<br />
<br />
I ask people to prove me wrong but all they do is say 'It isn't so'.<br />
<br />
Yes, a mob does hit more with a BL slow, however, you have to take into account the time the mobs is unslowed while I am trying to stick Malo, Malosini, and Turgurs. While I am fooling around with those three spells, the BL has already slowed on his first try because his is resisted far, far, far less. This makes the 10% of the shaman's slow inconsequential due to the extended time that the mobs has already been slowed. <br />
<br />
Many large mobs it is imperative that the mob is slowed right away. This is why you have CH chains with very short times in between. With a BL being able to slow right off, you dont waste the mana for all the CHs. YAY for the BL!<br />
<br />
However this encroaches on the shaman's job as the primary slower. And this is the reason why I am bringing this up. Because if the BL can slow better than we can (not percentage wise, but time wise) then what role are we going to be shoveled into? Just buff bots? Third rate healers? Low end dps? <br />
<br />
I can AE FoS, go watch a movie, come back, re AE FoS. Can you see what am I talking about now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Is that your problem??<br />
That you need to cast Malo### and need oos from bard and tash from chanter before you can cast slow?<br />
Then think of it the other way around.. Lets say you have statue incomming.. If you need slow to stick fast you just send in the bst who slow instantly (doubt that they do). Then to help out more you can in all your coolness stick malo### have oos and tash on statue before you even try to cast your slow..  <br />
<br />
I like to discuss, I try to view the problem from all aspects (as good as I can) and I can only see benefits right now.. Did you know enchanters can stick a 70% slow on mobs? And it looks easier for them than it do for me when I cast turgur... Sure, they dont have the meleebenefits as a bst do, they got trunes though..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I personally agree that Verant has yet again ignored the shaman, while boosting the capabilities of a BST quite a bit. I personally don't care how few less percents the BST can slow, it's STILL quite a bunch and they are crawling into MY area. Sure, people ask for Focus and that, but it's ONLY because it adds few buffs under ONE buff slot. You all should be happy that there are still only 15 buff slots in the game. Because if Verant one day increases it, to, say, 30, then NO ONE will ask buffs from shaman, simply because BST CAN and DOES buff better then we, supposed &quot;King of the Buffs&quot;. King of the useless buffs, I'd say. Not to mention that most classes like BST buffs more because these stack with more class spells then shammy ones do.<br />
<br />
I am pretty much even afraid to see, what the heck Verant (or SoE, whatever they name themselves now) will present with the release of new LoY spells. And I am pretty SURE that shamans will get shafted yet again, or at least totally ignored. Not to mention that since the LoY is generally for pre-60 levels, the shamans wont get any &quot;adjustments&quot; or fixes above lvl 60 anyway, and now will be also nerfed below lvl 60.<br />
<br />
And I find those people, who say &quot;You have a class envy!&quot; to be total morons. YES, I bloody do check the things related to MY class and other classes, because I LOVE my class and I see the use of MY class slip more and more behind. We got first - and last so far - new things with Kunark. We not &quot;not so useless&quot; general improvements (AA) with Velious. In SoL we got nerfed already - our main damage spell lines became in many cases useless - mobs are literally immune to poison and disease. Slow got hit first time hard with the appearance of totally immune mobs to Slow. We didn't get anything new or useless regarding the spells, these still remained at Kunark level. PoP came out and our slow is screwed even more, with more immune to Slow mobs and to very common slow mitigating mobs. Our damage spell lines, like poison, are still being totally resisted by mobs. AA upgrades are plainly pathetic joke and spells are even worse. So called &quot;upgrades&quot;, which last 2-4 times less then old spells, which take 3-4 times more mana per cast and which add minimal bonus over the old spells. Indeed, a bloody &quot;upgrades&quot; I'd say. Verant had to think REALLY hard and long to come up with that stupidity. <br />
<br />
And other classes got improvements, which brought them closer and closer to us, in ONLY area where we still have any REAL use - slowing. But you see, for some reason other classes do not have even HALF as hard time slowing the mobs then we do. Sure, Lucy shows that every spell is equal regarding resist checks and all, but reality shows different things. BST lands a Slow on totally unbuffed mob without any issues, I get bloody resisted even after debuffed the mob with Tash and Malosini (common XP mobs). Enchanter slaps slow easily on non debuffed mob in ToV, while my slow wont land with Tash, Occlusion and Malosini all being on the mob already. And these are not rare cases, these are constant cases. So either Lusy is full of crap regarding the spells, or there is something &quot;else&quot; on the spells, what Lucy wont pick up. Whatever the case is, this is the fact.<br />
<br />
Of course, after we get shafted in LoY too - and I bet that we WILL get shafted - there's not too much time left when the SWG is out. So probably I could say &quot;Screw this, it wont matter anything soon anyway&quot;, but I don't because I STILL care about my class.</div></div><hr />

- Since you don't play a BL nor do you play with one often and you are crying wolf?<br />
<br />
The BL slows a hell of a lot better than I do.<br />
- Same resist modifier, ours is 10% better, ours last much longer, shorter cast time, we have specialization, yadda yadda yadda ...<br />
<br />
 He doesn't need Malo. <br />
- My ass. I raid with 2 65 BLs on every raid. Guess what? 90% of shaman slows land before BL slow. Not because ours is resisted less but because (1) Our is faster (was 1.7 with affliction focii and BoR) and (2) Our is better timed because we Malo, we know when to fire it up.<br />
<br />
He casts as fast as I did with the affliction Foci. <br />
- Lay off the crack pipe.<br />
<br />
I cast Malosini and get 3 resists. He casts before any debuff and hits first try.<br />
- Do you know the basic concept behind luck and random number generators? I think not.<br />
<br />
This has me so hot I dont know even what to type. This is very wrong. Now I am just a buff bot. <br />
- Crack does that to your brain.<br />
<br />
If you dont want to believe it, then that's fine. But I DARE you to prove me wrong. Go grab a 65 BL with his 65 slow and grab yourself a 65 shammy with Malo and see the facts yourself.<br />
- Instead of talking out of your ass, you should listen to your own advice and do the same. <br />

Oh and do a little test, take your BL buddy to Tactics and have it slow Diaku Elites without Malo. See how many times he is willing to die.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Wild Lord's is the crappiest armor ever<br />
- Their buffs are garbage I moved to the back of the book 20 levels prior<br />
- 50% slow wont save a ranger<br />
- The have no parachutes; no root, no mezz, no gate, no FD<br />
- The bring nothing to a raid except pet problems (back before the pet aggro changes)<br />
<br />
Today, I look at beaslords and see:<br />

- They have amazing DPS<br />
- They can tank.  Not just their monster pets but they themselves.<br />

- They slow nearly as well as we do<br />
- They can solo no problem<br />
- They are an asset to any guild<br />

I do think SoE was too generous with the 65% slow, but overall I don't see any need to nerf the class.   They changed beastlords from total gimps to something enjoyable.  Having seen them nerf my monk into a one dimensional, boring lump I can tell you that gutting a class does not translate into more for everyone else.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">This argument actually brings up an interesting question.  I regularly group with a 53 BL.  On the resisty mobs, they would use their (35%?) slow while I'm malosiing the mob.  Then I slow it.  On a couple of rough pulls with no enchanters, I'd go on a suicide slowing frenzy and attempt slows without malosiing.  I would not get resisted on the mobs the beastlord had already slowed.  <br />
<br />
So we have made this sort of a standard.  They slow first, which doesn't get resisted often.  Then I slow, which doesn't get resisted often.  <br />
<br />
Is it possible that the BL slows have some sort of MR debuff in them?  I realize that this is probably just a misinterpretation of events due to it being a smallish sample size, but I have to wonder.  Has anyone tested this?  How would one test this?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm always happy to have a BL around, especially if they make my job that much easier (at least having a psychological effect).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Gawkmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">OMG some of you crack me up. Talk about class envy. Read Zorlak's post there is some good info there. The biggest point is that 2 levels has a HUGE difference in the ability to land spells on a mob.<br />
<br />
Let me give you some background so you know my experience. I was one of the first level 50 Shaman on my original server back when 50 was the cap. I then restarted another shaman on a new server and got him to 60. I quit EQ and later came back and restarted as a Beastlord which I was one of the very first to hit 60 and then 65. I also started another shaman which is currently 64.5. So I know quite a bit about both classes.<br />
<br />
First off BL slows are resisted exactly the same as Shaman slows, no better no worse. BL's do not have a malo line of spells in which to help us land spells better. Our buffs are considerably less robust than shaman buffs, not that I enjoyed the buffing role as a shaman anyway but then again who really does. In fact BL's don't even have an AGI buff. <br />
<br />
Yes BL's are a melee class with a pet and yes our DPS is finally up near the top when compared to other melee classes. However that DPS is only obtainable with a pet and casting spells that aren't very mana efficient. That efficiency is even worse due to the lack of spell specialization. But don't forget BL's wear leather and their damage mitigation is much worse than any other melee except maybe monks and that is debateble.<br />
<br />
The 15% difference in slows is a big deal regardless of what some of you may think. The difference can add up to a significant amount of damage saving over the course of a major fight. Damage savings equals mana savings. <br />
<br />
Bl's have finally become a very capable class and I enjoy the heck out of playing mine but then again I have a blast playing a shaman. With that said though I would never consider a BL capable of totally assuming a shamans role in most situations. The shaman still remains a fundamentally important class that is not easily replaced and for most people is a necessity for almost all high end encounters.</div></div><hr />

Uhh, you do realize that the other rare hybrid spells were placed on vendors when POP, and they forgot to add in beastlord spells. They were correcting an oversite.

 <br />
<br />
<br />
Our DPS is sub-rogue/monk, I've been parsing for 2 weeks traight, fight by fight, I might do the damage of a ragebringer-rogue at 65th level...<br />
<br />
I've -tried- tanking in BoT exp groups... it.. 'worked'... but cleric had Wind of Marr + Tranquility + Spiritual Dominion + Pot9 &amp; was bearly keeping even......... so we tank like old-school rangers... Our pet's ARE good Add-tanks though, I will admit, I love sicking my pet on add's til they can be mezed, but that only helps the chanters, doesnt hurt shaman..<br />
<br />
Our buffs are PLAGUED with stacking, our stat buffs dont work when a shaman in the group (talking infusion/frenzy/weaker shaman buffs)...<br />
That's obvious since we are weaker shaman, but we have a harder time using spiritual vigor, since it's overwriten by Rangers &amp; paladins BMB line...<br />
<br />
<br />
at level 65 we slow like a 52nd level shaman, BIG DEAL.. ask for a new slow, dont ask for nerfing beastlords... I DO NOT SLOW MORE EASILY THEN A BEASTLORD... I think you shaman complaining over it are seeing beastlords casting their slows in after malo/OOS/tash and getting lucky.. I get resisted ON AVERAGE FIVE times in BoT trying to slow, EXP group w/o shaman/chanter lol, so we do not have 'lure' slows<br />
<br />
<br />
we can sometimes solo, but it's not easy, Trust me I've tried.. it's psosible, but It's boring, slow, and there's not many uncrowded places 61+ a beastlord can solo at that are decent exp that COMPARE to any EXP group in POP<br />
<br />
An enchanter/shaman is an asset to any guild, why wouldnt a beastlrod be? for months we = jack **** to guilds, now we are wanted...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
point is, Shamen are MUCH better buffers &amp; slowers, and bring more to a group in certain situations then a beastlord...<br />
<br />
In higher end POP zones a beastlord cant slow mob's w/o tash OR malo OR OOS, so you'd have to compare bard/enc + beastlord = shaman slowing.. and that's still a bit off... Chanter slow better then beastlords, so if theres a problem with our slow you need to look at enchanters first..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually this change was not a result of BL whining it was the result of a programming error with PoP that put all the other hybrid level 60 spells on vendors. When the error was discovered SoE determined it was too late to pull the spells off because greedy types had already filled their bags with tons of the spells. So since the cat was out of the bag so to speak they decided to make the hybrid playing field even by placing our level 60 spells on vendors too. Lots of us didn't agree with that change but the fact is the 2 spells they made vendor spells where 2 of the rarest spells in the game, one dropping only off the Ssra Emperor and the other dropping only off Thought Horror Elders found near THO. These 2 spells made Torpors/Malo drops look plentiful in comparison.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
the spells were put on vendors because luclin mob's wernt killed enough anymore for the spells to easily be obtained by guildless beastlords, so basically the spells were becoming extinct by guilds moving to POP, and the only 2, then6, mobs that droped the spells were no longer commonly killed on spawn...<br />
<br />
Tropor/malo are still obtainable by a solo shaman (I know, i got ALL 3 'big' spells solo @ 60 for my shaman--torpor, malo, and avatar), off Emp. chottal, but you cant solo IV, or Emp. Ssra, and since Luclin was a rather 'short-lived' expansion there was only ~20-50 copies of each spell per server for the hundreds of beastlord nearing that level to worry about them...<br />
<br />
NO BEASTLORD ASKED FOR THEM ON VENDORS, I know because I worked with sony on trying to make them easier to obtain, but it was SONY'S choice to vendor them Beastlords simply asked for 1-group solutions for obtaining the spell</div></div><hr />

Bukar is right on this, as usual...<br />
<br />
Though it was expanded to Ahveka mob's... AFTER POP release.. it was almost useless in increasing the spells circulation, so after 2 months of that, it went to vendors, i guess what bukar said is also true, but i dont play other hybrids<br />

Must be a sooped-up beastlord.. I have 'standard' soloing beastlord gear and It was almsot chain CH before slow landed..

I am a 60th lvl Beastlord of the proud Vah Shir.<br />
<br />
Upon reading this post I decided to post my view on this tpoc.<br />
<br />
For one, we beastlords have no parent class, are in fact a unique class that similarities to a few other classes. Hense our pet is alot stronger than yours, and we are a major pet class where as you guys are not. Plus we are a mjain DPS class, toe-toe only 2nd to rogues and we battle for 2nd with monks. That depend son situation.<br />
<br />
Now, I shall explain the slow situation. Us ebastlords are the 3rd best slowing class, out of a total of what? 3 slowing classes. SHamen TOp the list with a 75% slwo at lvl51. At that level we only have a 30% slow, but lets not bring that into the picture, a beastlords best slow is 65%. That si 10%difference than what you guys can do at lvl60. Now it may be only 10% difference in slow percent but if the beastlord slows he is pushing 15%more dps than if a shamn slowed. <br />
<br />
Now you must also remember your best slow is obtained at lvl51, and isnt difficult to get at all. For beastlords to get that 65% slow we first ahve to become lvl65, which si an accomplishment upon itself. After reaching this accomplished level we ahve to obtain a spwll rune form planar bosses, then if we get lucky and get one of those, we ahve to hand it in and hope we get that spell. So in fact, just getting our 65% slow is very difficult. Any beastlord with it is a very accomplished beastlord indeed, and is most likely in a nice strong guild, and is uber by most people standards. Before this lvl, our best slow is 50%, and we dont egt that till lvl60. But, you gusy dont see enchanters has competition? Beastlords are 10% behind tou on the slowing area, but enchanters are only 5%.<br />
<br />
The order goers liek this....If all classes had there best possible slows. Sham 75%, ench 70%, beastlord 65%, any beastlord with that spell IMO has every right to own it, and use it. We arent stepping on anyone's toes, and if the beastlord pre-slows the mob for you, thats less aggro for the shamen or ench to obtain, not to mention saved mana on heals because the beastlord pre-slowed the mob, means less DPS for the mob.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now for buffing, Beastlords. Until level 61 we only get stamina, altuna, dextarity, raging str, thats it. AT level 61 we get a nice little all-in-one buff called Infusion fo spirit.<br />
<br />
Infusion of Spirit<br />
4: Increase Strength by 50 (L49)<br />
5: Increase Dexterity by 55 (L49)<br />
6: Increase Stamina by 45 (L49)<br />
<br />
This Happens to stack with the single stat buff lines sta,str,dex. And if you add Altuna and Spiritual vigor on top, yes we can buff better than focus, at the cost f what? no less than 8 buff slots! SO the rumors are tue, but no one I kwno if going to sacrifice over half their buff slots to have a better stats than focus can offer in 1 slot. Its great thing for us beastkords to show off with, but its useablity and practicality beyond a sgamenless group are non-existant. When on a raid the only thing beastlords ever get asked for it spiritual Vigor(225hp 40atk buff), Spiritual Purity, and of coarse Savargry(that 100atk 50 save vs. all buff that cost a peridot and last 6min) or even the lvl 65 version of it since we count the lvl65 beastlrod slow, Ferocity(150atk 65sv all).<br />
<br />
Beastlords are a great and versituile class, we 2nd only a shamen with buffing, are 3rd best in slowing, and are a really good toe-to-toe DSP class. We bring alot to the table and can fill quite a few roles if needed, such as slower or buffer.<br />
<br />
You shamen are a powerfull class, I am proud to share some of my spell line witn you, and would be more than glad if I had Dots even near the quality fo yours. Truth is, we cant replace a shamen, but we can take respsibility for a few of your roles.<br />
<br />
We compliment each other, we dont compete.<br />

This is my argument, my shamen friends.</div></div><hr />

I really don't mind BL's, or chanters, having a good slow. I just don't want to base my class pride on a marginal superiority.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I'll also tell you because nobody has mentioned it.  Beastlords are NOT a hybrid class.  Yes, they share some of the same spell lines but, they are thier own class.  This was clarified by the devlopers among several thousand posts on eqbeastlord.com<br />
<br />
Secondly, I play a 63 BST atm.  One of my best friends is a 65 BST.  We are in the same guild.  We have a role, its not to slow mobs primarily. What our role is, is to add DPS and mana regen. <br />
 A subrole the bst has is to land a pre-slow on mobs that require perfect agro control (IE, Plan e of Fire).  Admittidly I don't do enough pre-slowing because I am lazy alot.  However, this saves a ton of anguish to the shaman and definetly saves the raids from losing people all the time.  <br />
<br />
For you to come here and rant that beastlords need to be nerfed because your opinion is that the class is too powerful is just outright pure jealousy and resentment.  Maybe it didn't occur to you that it takes you twice as long to slow a mob because your system of doing it is wrong.  Maybe you should be working with your other shaman in raid to time the debuffs accordingly and to work as a team.<br />
<br />
Please keep spouting off so I have something to do today at work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Llorian Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">As you can imagine, beastlords are now aware of this post.<br />
<br />
I cant honestly believe ANY shaman at level 65 would tell you they feel underpowered. <br />
<br />
Shaman are one of the most powerful classes in game at high levels ( 60+).  Shaman get snapped up for groups within 5-10 minutes of logging on.<br />
<br />
Why does a BL slow seems to land before a shamans ?  its really, REALLY simple ( ESPECIALLY On a raid ).<br />
<br />
Mob inc ...<br />
<br />
Shaman starts casting malo<br />
beastlord starts casting slow<br />
<br />
Shaman Malo lands<br />
beastlord slow lands<br />
<br />
<br />
See how simple that is to understand ?  Beastlords CALL slow first on boss mobs usually because the SHAMAN malo before they slow, enabling EVERYONE who is attempting to slow a better chance.<br />
<br />
On a &quot; big bad ugly ass mob&quot;, a shaman might Malo, (malos), then malosin ( malosinia), before they attempt to slow.  All the while, most (competant) beastlords will be attempting to land their slow, because SOME slow is better than NO slow.<br />
<br />
Infusion of spirits is available to shaman.. AT LEVEL 49.  Its a level 61 beastlord spell.  Yes its TRUE that infusion + kragg + spirit vigor + str + dex + sta can out buff focus.. at the cost of 6 buff slots rather than 1.<br />
<br />
Shaman can choose to do the SAME thing, except cast BETTER, longer lasting buffs than &quot; stamina&quot; and &quot; dexterity &quot; which are beastlords best stat buffs, and shaman get at level 49.<br />
<br />
As for hitting the stat cap, The stat cap for a tank without planar power is 280.  Its 305 for a tank with planar power.  They might have 1 stat thats high ( most tanks have high sta ), but i guarentee you they are NOT hitting the stat cap unbuffed on all of their stats.. even with primal procs, and even with VT gear.<br />
<br />
Yes, i know how beastlords balance out to shaman, because my first character was a shaman.  My shaman was level 50 when kunark came out, and level 55 one month after, when i started playing an enchanter out of frustration back then.<br />
<br />
See.. back then, you got CHLOROBLAST at 55 instead of 51 ( or whenever you got it ), you didnt have any better heal at all, the group stat buffs all were LESS stats than the single target, there WAS no focus of spirt combo buff spell.<br />
<br />
Yeah, shaman have REALLY been neglected.  You might ask ( why didnt you level your shaman to 60+ rather than start a beastlord ?).. well after 55 levels of being a shaman, then 62 levels of being an enchanter, i was TIRED OF BUFFING.  I wanted to hit stuff, but i like shaman spells, so i played a beastlord.<br />
<br />
Now.. is my level 65 Beastlord more powerful than my 55 shaman.  Yes, he is.  quite a bit actually.  Can i do everything a 65 shaman can do ?  NO.  Can i substitute as a slower in most groups with even my 50 percent slow ?  Actually yes i can...  IF i have a BEEFY plate tank.<br />
<br />
<br />
Does my slow help save both enchanter AND shaman lives ?  YES IT DOES.  Good beastlords slow mobs even if shaman are in the group.  Why ? because it pulls the agro to the beaslord , and off the shaman ( who can also function as healer if needed ).  Do i expect a shaman to slow every mob in a group i am in ?  YES he better !  Shaman slow is significantly better than mine.  I just use mine to share agro.<br />
<br />
The notion of shaman being underpowered at level 65 is rediculous.  You can function as groups main slower, AND main healer, even in places like Plane of storms, and Bastion of thunder.  You can solo in places hardly anyone else can... Your 61 pet is BETTER than a level 60 beastlords pet.  You get HUGE dots ( beastlords get plague at 65 heh ), have access to epic + jbb for manaless damage, and with canni 5 have THE fastest mana regen in the game.<br />
<br />
Beastlords and shaman coexsist quite well in groups together as well.  hell i am HAPPY to see a shaman in my group because it means the group gets better buffs, AND better slows... not to mention the damage a shaman can do with a decent taunting tank by throwing on some dots / jbb / nukes.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, level 65 shaman dont stay ungrouped for very long.  Not long at all in fact.  Im sure your high level shaman on this board will tell you that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">The only issue that would bother me about BLs is if their slow was less resisted than ours. Two say it is, most say it's not. So until I see some extensive logs I would tend to believe resists are the same. Buffs, who cares. No one is going to want 5 or 6 buffs just to get a few extra hitpints over focus. Heck I can almost fill up my exp groups buffs slots let alone the buffs you get on a raid. And if you want to compare a level 65 Shaman to a level 65 Beastlord, they can add more DPS by themselves, we add more DPS to the entire group with ferine avatar (plus focus et al), our pet, our nukes/DOTs, and Quiesence is incredibly powerful, especially for a Shaman with SCRM and QB3. Casting that spell in 3 seconds is amazingly good. Don't fear the Beastlord, welcome them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">I think that collectively the shaman community has become a little paranoid.  <br />
<br />
When you see other classes getting balanced in a possitive way and we continually are balanced in a negative way after a while your eye starts to twitch. <br />
<br />
My biggest concern is that shamans will fall into the crappy area clerics were in for a while.  They were the best healers but you could get by without them in exp groups. The same as Shamans are the best slowers but you can get by without them.<br />
<br />
In an exp group it is possible to bypass a shaman in favor of another class if a BL is in the group.  <br />
<br />
I understand that there is a 10% difference in the slows but I think the additional DPS would offset that.  You also rarely use all 15 slots in an exp group.  So it is possible to be more flexable with the group structure. <br />
<br />
As more BLs reach that lvl this will become more apperant to the masses that are unaware of the benifits of the BL class.  <br />
<br />
That being said I do not think that this is a problem in reguards to the BL class nor do I think they are overpowered.  <br />
<br />
The problem is on the shaman side.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My primary was a shaman, played her from Spt of 99 thru SoL when I started a bst to check out the new race, liked it &amp; kept playing.<br />
<br />
In exp groups a bst can fill most shaman jobs.  We don't do as well as the shaman does on buffs/debuff, but we bring other things.<br />
<br />
On raids, I am there for DPS and for mana regen.  Can I slow almost as good as a shaman. Yep.  Can I slow anything of note without a shaman debuffing the hell out of it first.....nope.<br />
<br />
It's a fun class, no 2 ways about it.  I like punching stuff - it's what we do.  On some occasions I'll run in on nasties and close to melee range and try to land the first slow. Maybe it hits, maybe it bounces.  Either way, more than likey I'm dead cat.  If one of the 2 is gonna have to die, it should be the beastlord - the shaman frankly to my way of thinking is a little more critical. Dead beastlords sit and med after a rez while things move on.  A couple of dead shaman will hold up a raid.<br />
<br />
One thing I really noticed recently when I was playing my shaman the other day while farming junk in PoD.  At level 62, with cani5, wearing vintage SoV gear (HoT gear, not NToV) with her ghetto epic and l33t JBB - that is still a damn powerful toon.  Drop my bst into all SoV gear and watch my DPS/manapool drop to a shadow of itself.  A well geared bst is stout toon,  but then again so is a nekkid shaman.<br />
<br />
I hate to solo with my bst - I cant snare/root/gate, and I sure cant root &amp; rot.  However, if you put a duo of a shaman and a bst together...shudder.<br />
<br />
I love my bst, but he will no way, no how never ever never replace a shaman in a raid situation.<br />

Thanks man you just summed it up.  Malo Cast, BL Slow, Shaman Slow.  On a raid situation I have single handedly saved our shaman in our guild countless deaths due to cancellation of aggro, ala NTOV flurry drakes.  Most potent tool of a bl slower is stone stance, gaining that aggro instead of the shaman and avoiding the damage using the discipline is the goal.<br />
<br />
I don't see it as an issue and I'm sure if some of my guild shaman would chime in on this post they would tell you that my slow is most welcome, the goal isn't to usurp the shaman role, the goal is to speed up and increase productivity on raiding and grouping.  <br />

<br />
This is really the problem, whenever someone sees a problem on the horizon, others say not to worry, that our saviors in beta will protect us.  Well, they haven't done so.  We know that nobody from the dev team plays a shaman.  Did anyone in PoP beta (or any other expansions) play a shaman? <br />
<br />
Any problems of shaman have nothing to do with Beastlords.  Someone is making them a scapegoat for the real problem:  Shaman communicating their problems and concerns with those who can actually do something about them.  Since there aren't any SOE employees to contact that represent our classes, the only method that seems to work is being a whiny crybaby, calling for improvements to your class, or nerfs to another class.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>stewardx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">This is a question more then a statement so don't flame me if I'm wrong.  Is a 10% difference in slowing really 10% anymore?  In PoS I've been fighting giants mostly which partially mitigate my slow.  Ass i understand it now my slow is about 37.5% partially mitigated, an enchanters 35% mitigated, a beastlord would be at 32.5% and a bards/rangers at around 25%.<br />
<br />
Personally, an enchanter slow doesn't threaten me because they seem to get squished alot after slowing, especially if they tash plus slow.  Bards and ranger slows also have a big enough gap not to bother me.  But, a beastlord who stands up to a beating as well or better then I, with additional regen/mana regen capabilities and damage that is on par with a monks is a more direct threat to my groupability.<br />

As I said earlier tho this is a question.  I have never grouped with a lvl 65 beastlord.  I probably won't for quite sometime either.

Heck people usually only take enchanters for a last ditch effort for slow.  I have a few enchanter friends and they usually want a shaman in the group to slow because slowing for them can mean death very fast in PoP.  There are many mobs in PoP that require debuffing before landing slow, which a BL doesn't have.  You call on people to bring out proof as to the slows and the lucy spell file base was checked, and tada the spells had the same resist checks.<br />

<br />
AS for issues with the shaman class, personally I see only one problem, that really isn't all that big of a deal anyway, and that is the STR/DEX spells requiring spectral turn ins. While some may argue that that is a big deal in the grand scheme of things it is but a small blip on the radar. The shaman's role and the spells he/she is giving to accomplish that goal are some of the best tools in the game. In my opinion my shaman at level 60 was as powerful as most level 65 characters. We are THE most versatile class there is and we have always been and will remain one of the most sought after classes.</div></div><hr />

This is the main function of our slows in most group/raid situations - pre-slowing and taking aggro so the Shaman or 'Chanter doesn't die.<br />

<br />
When you attend a raid, is your focus on the succcess of the raid or is your focus on being seens as the hero who saved the day?<br />
<br />
In my guild, we have two shaman that are basically equivelent to each other.  Almost the same level, almost the same spells, almost the same gear.  When we both attend a raid, we typically agree that one will malo and one will slow.  On tough mobs, where slow is resisted alot, we both slow until it lands (sometimes we will have one focus on grummus and one focus on turgurs).  Do I feel bad when my slow gets resisted and the other shaman's slow does not?  No.  I would feel bad if the mob was not slowed at all and proceeded to kill the MT, ST, TT, and half the casters.  <br />
<br />
If a beastlord (at any level) can slow (to any degree) before I land my slow, GOOD.  That means three things to me; <br />
<br />
1) if I get a resist, the mob will not likely be able to kill me before I land something. <br />
<br />
2) I can try to land a betterr debuff since the mob is almost neutralized anyway (like insidious decay or malosini). <br />
<br />
3) I can let the MT build a little more agro before pouring on my spells.<br />
<br />
These are all good things.  These are all things that affect the success of the raid.  I would be happy if we had 10 shaman on a raid, 35 beaslords, and 2000 enchanters.<br />
<br />
Are you on a team or not?<br />
<br />
Remember, too, beastlords bring alot of other things to the table too.  Their health/mana regeneration is great.  I love it.  I want it.  I haven't yet had spiritual vigor cast on me, but I'm pretty sure I want that too.  <br />
<br />
If I could only convince the beastlords to cast their stat buffs on people whether the poeple want them or not (heh, maxed is maxed even if its a less than superb buff that gets you to the max) then I would be truly happy.  I could focus on my true forte; healing!  Er, Nuking!  Er, hmm, what is it I do well again besides slow?<br />
<br />
Anyway, the point is that beastlords are not our enemies.  They are a powerful class and they contribute alot -- and that is a good thing.  <br />
<br />
The people that should be really worried about beastlords are....  nobody.  Everyone has something to contribute.  So let them contribute, and be happy for them.</div></div><hr />

Beastlords have been screwed up for a long time , whey were a WEAK hybrid class that no one care either way if theyw ere in a group or not.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Beastlord has buff yes , but they are sub par. Not that they arent useful , far from it , by sub par i mean , they are ment to be filler for other classes . Who you want givng attack buffs , the ranger or the BST? The ranger ofcourse holds domain over this and if bolth are int he group , the BST isnt buffing no ones attack. With a pally and BST in the group , who you want giving that extra HP buff , BST ( SV)  or pally ( brell ) again , to me the choice is obvious.<br />
<br />
BST is a good filler class for when the other master class is not present. They also bring GREAT dps. I havent parse anything , but i can tell you , in BoT i notice the DPS boost when the BST comes to the group ... as it should be , they are 2 bodies. they have their own to bring to the table , the man/hp regen is very nice , but nothing spectacular on its own.<br />
<br />
<br />
 So to wrap it up , the beastlord has been a screwed up and semi neglected class for a while , they were essentialy broken with nothign unique or desired over another class. I feel they have gotten the attentiont hey deserved. They are now desired in guilds and in groups. Gratz to them ...<br />
<br />
There is only one thing i can think of off the top of my head that kinda ticks me off about them. Their AA that is a group topor and mana regen. To me this is somehting that we should have had all along and its a bit of a insult to see a hybrid class get this ability. Now we arent about mana regen , so this skill they have doesnt fully fit us , but there is NO reason that we shouldnt have a AA that would give us a group heal over time with NO mana regen that heals BETTER then what the beastlord is. This isnt about class envy or jealously , its about the shaman bringing more to the table and being stepped up in power in line with the other class progressions. I do not feel its a vailid excuse anymore to not update us as the other calsses cause we were over powered many expansions ago , or that we can heal too well at low levels. this game is played int he 50+ field now , in general the bulk of 50 and below i feel are alts, not to say no one is new ofcourse.<br />
<br />
I really do think its time they take a look at us , i think these so called bones we been getting lately  are a joke if they are intended pacify us. Fixing the neg affects on alchemy was nice , but they are still useless cause the cost of them are not inline to what they are worth. This GM trophy .. please. <br />
<br />
But i think the thing that pisses me off more then anything as a high level shaman is the stealth  nerf on our mana regen.   Little by lil spells last shorter , cost more and increasing the length of time you can re-use can5 are issues i have with our current class abilities.<br />
<br />
But anyway , this sint about Shaman , this is about BST. So i say , more power to them , fact remains their resist check on slow is the same. It pissed me off too to see the BST landing a slow before me in BoT. but guess what , it was ALL persepction , cause if you stop casting ebuffs you will find sometimes you can slow fast too ,its all luck of the draw , but as the gentlemen above stated , in general they have to cast it 5 or 6 times to get a slow to land ( why can they cast faster again ? ) I think what your seeing is the itmes it gets lucky and lands , not the times its unluckly and doesnt ....<br />

<br />
It does not purport to be the whole equation.  The &quot;resist adj&quot; field is just that -- an adjustment.   <br />
<br />
Common sense would dictate that every mob has a certain level of resistance built-in (for example, some mobs are harder to slow than others).  It cannot be said with certainty that mobs are resistant to certain broad spell categorizations, but I would say (from subjective experience only) that this is likely the case.  Some mobs are not at all resistant to magic based damage, but are very resistant to magic based slow.  Some mobs are very easy to snare, but very hard to root.   <br />
<br />
That is only speculation, mind you, but the point is that it is not sufficient to look at lucy and say anything beyond spell a should or should not be easier to land that spell b on a given target.  <br />
<br />
It may be that turgurs is not considered to be the same category as sha's advantage -- perhaps its divided up into &quot;hybrid slow&quot;/&quot;pure caster slow&quot; or perhaps its devided up differently, or perhaps it isn't divided at all.  The point is that there is really no way to know without objective testing.</div></div><hr />

That is the biggest crock of **** I've ever heard, I can't even land on shimmers tashed or maloed ever, one time and this is a one time only I got it to land with the 30% slow back when I was lvl 54 and that was just luck of the dice.  Dgarn, he's hit or miss but I do land on him after a few casts, but 90% of the time he's resisted and I just give up and let the CH chain work it's wonder on the tanking MA if that's the case.<br />
<br />
Stop spreading rumours, and believe me you are, about beastlords being able to slow shimmering drakes with regular slow when it takes a shaman to do it with grummus. I'm a lvl 65 Beastlord and I can't land a slow on a shimmering drake if my life depended on it they just got way way too high MR even after being tashed.<br />

For a mob with a delay of 20:<br />

The percentage 75 is 10 higher than the percentage 65.<br />

You are throwing away the original value, the attack rate of the mob, and focusing on the difference of the sums to derive a new and rather meaningless comparison.  If the slows were .00075% and .00065% you could still claim a staggering 40% improvement.  Not that it would amaze anyone.<br />

75 is 40% higher than 65 but the difference between the damage done by a 75% and a 65% slow  is only 10% of the value an unslowed mob would do!  So essentially by casting 75% over 65% you are saving 6 seconds per minute of what an unslowed mob would produce in dmg/sec.<br />

TRUE and False (I don't know how you equate the beastlord pet and a mage pet as even being similar, a mage pet is far more likely to out perform a beastlord pet) I am a melee class they are a caster class, one thing my pet will always do out perform other pet classes in combat as I am aware of my surroundings and position my pet instead of point and click /pet attack<br />

Leave beastlords alone, they are fine. Instead of trying to get another class nerfed, let's get shaman issues fixed.<br />

EDIT: One last note to people spouting lies about BST slow resists, last Mithaniel Marr encounter we had every single slow capable class chain cast magic resist based slow on MM. (I was able to land Curse of the Spirits and magic taps were landing for full). Not one class was able to slow it. We had about 3 chanters, 3 shamans and 2 beastlords chain casting magic based slow. No luck at all, for none. So if the BST slow would have been SOOOOOOOOOOOOO tough to resist, why didn't any slow land for about 4-5 minutes? Oh right ... <br />

So what that the Shaman class didn't get some really wild new spell line that no one has ever seen before.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u113"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p113">On the numbers game above, the conclusion seems to be that the practical difference in damage mitigated between the 75% slow and 65% slow is equal to:<br />
<br />
10% of the unslowed mobs damage output<br />
<br />
which equals<br />
<br />
40% of the slowed (by 75%) mob's damage output<br />
<br />
Using some numbers, if the unslowed mob does 100 dps, the BL-slowed mob does 35dps and the SHM-slowed mob does 25 dps.  The delta of 10dps could be thought of as 10% of the unslowed 100dps, or 40% of the SHM-slowed 25dps.<br />
<br />
If you figure that the encounter is balanced around the mob being slowed 75%, or that most people think about damage from the perspective of fighting a shaman-slowed mob, then it is practical to say the BL slow allows 40% more damage to be taken than what people are used to after slow lands.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u118"><b>Rastik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p118">One reason why a beastlord will not fully replace a shaman..<br />
<br />
1. No crowd control aside from pet offtanking. We *suck* at handling adds. Every single caster and hybrid aside from BL has at least some sort of root or other crowd control measure, even mages get earth pets for that. We get adds, we have to live with them, or rely on cleric or other casters for roots.<br />
<br />
2. No shaman mana regen. It's not that bad when the group only wants us to slow, maybe cripple too.. but if they also want us to handle haste and stat buffs for several melees, we're slowing the group down.<br />
<br />
3. We get our decent, level 65 slow from a friggin GLYPHED RUNE WORD instead of a vendor selling level 51 spells. It's cool that they put the level 60, 50% slow on vendors a few patches ago, but at level 59 I'm still only slowing for 30% , at which point shammys have had 75% for several levels.<br />
<br />
4. Least but not least, most groups expect us to melee in groups, which is how we get our good DPS. However, if we focus on fighting we can't focus on our surroundings, especially with pet pushing the mob around and position must be adjusted constantly. Adds, especially mobs of the same type, will get us off guard, unless someone spots them first.<br />
<br />
So basically.. shamaning isn't our forte. We can do it, but would much rather have a specialist. It's DPS where we'd rather major at.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u120"><b>Shere Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p120">I play a Shaman and a Beastlord 2 boxed. Sometimes I dual them alone or in xp groups, but very rarely in raids. Basicly I have always used a pre-slow unless in a very good group.<br />
<br />
I only have 50% slow on Beastlord; I doubt I will see a 65 spell for quite some time as most classes have preference for runes before beastlords. (why waste a rune on 65% slow when you could get Malos, Bot9, VoQ etc).<br />
<br />
After about 15 levels and numerous aa points of playing these 2 together I have found that both slows get resisted the same amount. Sometimes BL cant land a slow to save himself and it's a damn good thing shaman is there, sometimes it works the other way around. And I don't pre-slow on raids, the shamans have that down pat. The agro I get for pre-slowing 3 seconds before turgur's lands is merely an annoyance and doesn't really help for only 50%.<br />
<br />
The exception is Shas Lethargy; level 50 Beastlord slow for 35%. This has a resist adjustment against it and very good for pre slows at that level. None of the later slows has the resist adjustment.<br />
<br />
As for Beastlord buffs? If its not a group buff, I hate casting it  :mad: . There is nothing worse than trying to stat buff 3 melee plus yourself with 5 single cast buffs. By the time youve finished its time to rebuff your pet. That negates all your own melee damage for that time and either equates to group downtime or lots of medding.<br />
<br />
The affliction nerf sucks, even more so because I thought the affliction only applied to dots until 2 weeks ago. I was just gearing affliction foci when the nerf came. Yet my Shaman is just as useful now as he was before.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u121"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p121">The 65 BL was slowing just fine and dandy in BoT without any form of MR debuff. While my spells bounce here and there. Maybe it is because I am 62, but I am pretty sure the 65 shaman in my guild was complaining about slows bouncing as well.<br />
<br />
The BL does just fine tanking any adds we get. I am actually surprised how well he does it, because I would think that a monk could do it better. He can do it because if he starts to get hurt, he backs off and his pet takes full aggro. I don't know about you but my pet sure as hell cant take aggro off me when I slow and dot, like his does.<br />
<br />
I am trying to get you guys to notice these things going on. If you dont want to fine, but I will be laughing in the future when these same 'nay-sayers' whine and bitch about their class not being the 'best' at what we were designed for.<br />

Thus I find it completely unsurprising that a BL can out-tank a monk. In addition to having decent slow and a pet to hide behind.<br />
<br />
Mind you, pets suck on raids, and since the BL DPS is dependant on the pet that counts as a class weakness in my eyes. But in XP groups, wow, they bring a lot to the table.</div></div><hr />

Man I don't understand how any of you with a straight face can claim the shaman class has been nerfed or gimped in anyway. My shaman is still one of the most powerful toons I have ever played. He has done things that I could only dream of doing with most of the other twinks I have had over the years. <br />
<br />
So what that the Shaman class didn't get some really wild new spell line that no one has ever seen before. The spells we did get are still nice upgrades and really nice additions to our already strong class. Granted a couple of the spells are less than desireable but the ones we did get make up for those in my mind. <br />
 <br />
<br />
Gawkmar,<br />
<br />
there are a few things here that make us feel &quot;nerfed&quot;<br />
1) (not so shaman only but still) No explanation or posts from an official SoE guy on our boards explaining stuff.<br />
2) nerfs in our prime abilities. When we got a lesser heal then druids and clerics (and paladins) it was explained by us (Note no official statement by SoE but it seems a logical explanation)<br />
Then they nerfed slow (whole zones with mitigation is plain wrong imo). When you combine this you will get a feeling that something is wrong.<br />
3) When SoE made PoP an expansion with hard hitting mobs that had less HP then the Luclin mobs, Dots where a lot less effective to deal damage to that mob, often a mob (in an xp group) is killed before my Poison dot has worn off (and thus I do less damage)<br />
4) Our AA skills are geared towards abilities that are not our prime stuff, We get skills to improve healing, we get skills to improve nuking and we get some general skills (root, radiant cure) but we do not got any skill to improve debuffing or Dotting a mob.<br />
5) The way our spell hand in worked out was screwed, First we get stuff other classes can buy on a vendor as hand in (even long after this is fixed for other classes (Swift like the wind)), we get a spell that we can not get from our own trainer but we need to do a turn in at the BST guy and we have a few spells makes you wonder if anyone even looked at them (hi str and dex)<br />
6) After a long time we are told that our affliction items are &quot;fixed&quot; and that all is now is it was mend to be. Even when we look p[ast the fact that this was never in the patch message it is a blow when you look at the cast times for many shamans out there as often the cast time on your slow decides if you will survive after a resist.<br />
<br />
That is why we feel &quot;nerfed&quot; and I understand that for an outsider (or even a shaman with a different playing style) things do not look that bad but for me they are.<br />
<br />
And to give you some background, I do not only play a shaman but I also happen to have a chanter,Sk,War and mage who all are played by me. I know from personal expirience that the chanter can do almost all things the shaman does in an xp group.<br />
Tash and slow is about is fast as malos and slow.<br />
With his runes the chanter can take about as much beating as the shaman to survive.<br />
But the chanter brings a few extra abilities to the xp-group like insane dps (go go charm) and mana regen.<br />
Before PoP the shaman was able to heal, not very good but good enough to keep people alive but in PoP where you encounter mobs that hit for 3-4 times 600+ in 1 combat round my heals just don't cut it.<br />
<br />
Still I love the shaman, I can do some funky stuff with her but I also know that my power has diminished when I see other classes outperform me. I don't seek a nerf for those classes, I don't seek a new power ability for my shaman but I do seek something that makes her an addition to the group I am in. And for that a 5%-10% slow advantage in a mitigating zone aint it.</div></div><hr />

I seen it with my own eyes, BST slow mob almost on contact, once a BST pull with slow and just tank straight thru it, at 2nd tier and up plane shm will get at least 50% resist rate if u dont malo/malos first, BST? they almost slow on contact everytime.<br />
I dont know why people believe everything Lucy said other than see the proof with their own eyes...thats wrong.<br />
<br />
Bazoom:<br />
Its all about &quot;get mob slowed first&quot;<br />
Shm can stick a turgur in after its &quot;slowed&quot; or even enchanter can do it, there WILL NOT be 10 more hits from any raid mob.<br />
In exp group mob just die too fast u dont notice the difference.<br />
<br />
Grimrod:<br />
If there is no 65 pally casting BSS, I would use Spiritual vigor over Strength of Tunare, and since all caster shouldnt care about atk, they should all get SV other than SoT if there is no BSS.<br />
<br />
Zorlac:<br />
first, u dont have any proof they are on same resist check, HAVE YOU seen BST and SHM slow mob in action at same time? if you havnt please DO NOT copy and paste some Lucy's info act like you are Lucy. Lucy =/ SONY or VI.<br />
Btw in general BST can slow mob better (not in %) than us<br />
they can chain when we have to wait ont turgur grey out (or cast slower torgor) in that 1 or 2 sec slowed or not might matter u need a CR or not when mob is hitting upward 500ish, ok so Mob in PoTactic is harder to slow, does all mob in PoP act like them? I think not unless u can run shm vs bst slow contest on every plane.<br />
So dont bash Meku like he knows nothing at all, because u dont know much either apparntly.<br />
Oh I only been up to BoT, you can call me noob if u think been to PoTactic is superior than others.</div></div><hr />

You don't decide if your reputation is honorable or not......those around you do.  If you have to TELL us that you have an honorable reputation, chances are you don't.<br />
<br />
Posting like a 3-year old half the time doesn't help your cause much either.   Pwned?  I think you need to look in the mirror.  Gawkmar has shown 10 times the maturity level of yourself, and has actually brought up good and valid points.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I think a lot of you are forgetting something.  Gawk has PLAYED a beastlord AND shaman to lvl 64/65.  How many of you have done that?  Of every single person here, I would trust his opinion first and foremost just for that reason.  <br />
<br />
Myself, I play BOTH.  I play a shaman AND beastlord.  My slows land the same on all mobs thus far.  I have started 2-boxing them, and I simply use my beastlords slow to preslow (use it to pull, and take some aggro away from my shammy), and then my shammy hits the mob up for a bigger slow (I still do this even if my epic proc lands..which is 55% slow).<br />
<br />
Give it a rest.  Shaman are NEEDED on just about every single high level event in this game.  But yet you complain.  Beastlords aren't NEEDED yet on anything....are they wanted/welcomed?  Sure, but so are shaman.  Go to ANY of the planes with a lvl 60+ beastlord and shammy, shout LFG, and see which one gets a group first.<br />

Seriously Rebelheart, do you realize how dumb this sounds?<br />
<br />
You are asking for PROOF from someone claiming that the slows are the same when so far:<br />
<br />
1. He has presented PROOF from a well respected site that they are on the same resist check.<br />
<br />
2. You have said you've seen it the few times you've grouped with a beastlord.<br />
<br />
Which one of you has more &quot;proof&quot;?  Seriously man, try to DISPROVE Lucy....please.  Bring logs of fight after fight proving that beastlord slows land much easier than a shaman's.  I play both, and I say you are full of it.  My beastlord slows land the same as my shaman.  Gawk plays both, he says you are full of it.  So far just about every person here that plays both classes has stated the slows are the same.  Yet you insist on claiming &quot;You've seen it with your own eyes&quot;.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u132"><b>Eatbugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p132">BST? they almost slow on contact everytime. <br />

*laugh*<br />
<br />
That's because you're not playing the BST.  It's a common phenomenon - you notice when someone else has good luck and you don't.  The other person's string of bad luck doesn't come to your attention because it's not your problem.  The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence, when you're looking. (because you don't bother looking much when it's not)<br />
<br />
Seriously, the argument about the Beastlord 65 slow is silly.  Most of the people complaining about it are not level 65.  Guess what?  Spells land a lot more often if you're higher level.  If you want to test it (and it probably should be tested by someone, to either dispel the rumor or confirm it so we can bitch to SOE - it would be stupid for a Beastlord slow to work better than a Shaman slow) get a 65 Shaman and 65 Beastlord together (Hey Gawkmar, level your Shaman!) and log a few hundred tests on a highly MR mob.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, a Beastlord landed some slows before I did the other day!&quot; means zip.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u133"><b>Brat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p133">Look, the beef here is clearly frustration with SOE's work with the shaman class.  Personally, I all but quit my shaman when SoL came out &amp; they pulled the poison based DD's there were going to go to shaman.  Another expansion of malo/slow cast singlefocus 20times canicanicanicanitorporcanicanicani did not appeal to me.<br />
<br />
Now, that being said I think this uber bst lure slow is a joke.  If you have played a shaman for any length of time you know sometimes you can slow a damn thing, and some days you can slow things by looking at them.<br />
<br />
Have you played a beastlord to 65? Sometimes I will slow something right off the bat before the shaman do.  Sometimes it will bounce x3 and I get my face caved it, then finally &quot;your spell will not take hold&quot;  Don't try to pee on my head and tell me it's raining k?  Anyone who has built a shaman from level 1 to 60+ knows somedays are good, some days are bad.  Having played BOTH I can tell you the door swings both ways.  To advance some notion that bst have some super duper slow is just making a strawman arguement.  Wail on that strawman all you want, rail against Lucy, then play both classes &amp; tell me what you think.<br />
<br />
My guild is blessed with some very good shaman, and none of the feel threated in the least bit by me.  Maybe it's because they are damn good shaman and they know what their can do.  I assure you, none of them are losing any sleep over my slow.  On the flipside that would much rather see a curled up Ghoat corpse than a dead bear.<br />
<br />
I'll say it again, the day my guild says &quot;Raids are off, we don't have any beastlords&quot; - get worried.  Until then address the shaman problems for what they are (and there are some that need addressing) and on thier own merits.  If you can't argue on that basis and have to drag a hybrid class in to support your point (with faulty &quot;facts&quot; to boot) , then maybe you need to rethink your position.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u134"><b>Rebelheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p134">Salorm, its from personal experience, like we are used to cast malo/malos before slow in exp group; sometimes people like to do thing from they have learned, yea I dont have number data to further prove my words nor able to duo box Bst shm to try.<br />
Dont get me wrong I like Lucy's data, at least more info than Castersrealm but people just use the data in wrong way.<br />
people quote Lucy's data like they did the math their own.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I think this thread turns into &quot;who is cry baby who is not&quot; Shaman bash each other is the LAST thing I want to see.<br />
<br />
FACT: our aa sux, we need 24 aa to heal as a good a druid who has no aa in healing adept. and VI secretly force us to put points into those aa not in our field (who reallly want to get Virulent Paralysis, Fury of Magic andHastened Rabidity to rank 3?)<br />
<br />
FACT: we are not been defined in any role other than a buff machine, primary slower? try mala/tash/malosinia (from mage)/then bst slow or enchanter slow ( feel left out now?)<br />
providing at end game (btw rune is not even consider rare anymore on my server, we farm BoT named 24/7 they are killed upon spawn, oh they are one groupable if u dont know, so BST can win rune too)<br />
<br />
FACT: alchemy still sux we got like 1 new POP recipe, even rogue poison making got like 20ish, VI totally forgot alchemy is even exist (do u know u got 10% money back sell 10dose potion when it has 1 charge left? 10dose poison will get at least 80% money back if do the same) but anyway I r sucker I blow plat get alchemy to 186 and make trophy on 2nd try so it can replace my uber shissar fang in ammo slot.<br />
WHINE: BST 65% slow is not fine, maybe they didnt beat us in %, or in cast time, they sure kick hell of enchanter's slow (3.5 sec vs 6sec, 65% vs 70%, I will take 3.5sec thanks) and why would a melee hybrid outdone magic than caster?<br />
<br />
I probably will get some flame becuz the posts I wrote earlier, but the point is &quot;we need to stand up and work as one shaman community&quot;.<br />
Dont be blind about what is coming, or dig ur head into sand either, we should /feedback whatever u think should be improved to VI/Sony whether or not read it.<br />
At least u are DOING it so u wont regret months later says &quot;shoot I should have spoken up...&quot;<br />
Shm start to worry about Bst is becuz we been left out by VI but they got pick up by VI, I think thats a FACT...<br />

Let me give a few &quot;interesting&quot; opinions from there<br />
<br />
Shaman's get regen, heals, and really mean stat buffs<br />
<br />
but one shouldn't forget that Shamans are quite capable solo'ers themselves. ( Shamans can solo the dragons in WW, for example. Bst's last I checked couldn't.<br />
<br />
Though...the image I get from the origional poster is nothing but a barbarian foaming at the mouth and spitting while trying to talk...<br />
<br />
Shamans dont need more abilities. <br />
<br />
Alchemy (the benefit of this ability is HUGE if the shaman actually work on it. They get a long list of out of class buffs including a DS with this ability.) <br />
<br />
I dont see why shamans needs more eyecandy. They got pleanty of things going for them<br />
<br />
The difference between having a 75% slow and a 65% slow on a raid is that if you got a raid force setup thats sufficient with 65% slow and then a shammy shows up you can send 1/3 of the clerics home.. Thats a huge difference. <br />
<br />
Shaman are one of the best balanced classes out there.<br />

 &quot;Pre-RoK a 50 shaman was a freaking god. Total power. Shaman were still powerful in RoK, just not quite as (relative) powerful. SoV was pretty lame to shaman imho. SoL was a kick in the nads to shaman (to me anyway), enuff so that I became a bst. PoP looks to have helped shaman on one hand, but I don't blame them for being miffed. Whoever is designing shaman spells is a tard. Why give new group stat buffs when you have foucs? Aside from agi, those are a waste of spell slots in the book. Upgrade focus &amp; cut the duration? /boggle <br />
<br />
That being said shaman are still damned powerful, but they just need some more flash. Aside from Cani5 and better healing, shaman have had the exact same job, with almost the same tools to do it since RoK. Give 'em some fun stuff I say. I don't blame em for being pissed, but beastlords are not the problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hey, at 50 a necro &amp; shaman had the same dot power (shaman a little better actually) and a druid &amp; shaman had the same healing skills.  That changed for the worse with every expansion.  Do shaman have a right to be a little bent? Oh hell yes.  I think you will find most bst dont have a dislike for shaman.  Matter of fact a LOT of bst were shaman as thier previous too.  Lot of us understand the class more than you give us credit for. Can't expect you to understand bst that well - but you might have a different point of view if you understood beastlords a little better. <br />
<br />
Maybe not.<br />
<br />
I still remember the week Ebon War Spears came out. How cool was that - put the old Gatorsmash up &amp; try these new pokey things :)  And dont get me started on camping that freaking bear for my hat.  Hell, I still remember when Mill posted he was gonna stop drinking. That lasted a few weeks ;)<br />

Yep, lot of bst know,understand and sympathize with the plight of the shaman. Taking one post &amp; trying to paint our whole community with it is not cool.</div></div><hr />

here is the other side of the story:<br />
<br />
http://bcope16.phpwebhosting.com/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=3392<br />
<br />
Let me give a few &quot;interesting&quot; opinions from there<br />
<br />
Shaman's get regen, heals, and really mean stat buffs<br />
<br />
but one shouldn't forget that Shamans are quite capable solo'ers themselves. ( Shamans can solo the dragons in WW, for example. Bst's last I checked couldn't.<br />
<br />
Though...the image I get from the origional poster is nothing but a barbarian foaming at the mouth and spitting while trying to talk...<br />
<br />
Shamans dont need more abilities. <br />
<br />
Alchemy (the benefit of this ability is HUGE if the shaman actually work on it. They get a long list of out of class buffs including a DS with this ability.) <br />
<br />
I dont see why shamans needs more eyecandy. They got pleanty of things going for them<br />
<br />
The difference between having a 75% slow and a 65% slow on a raid is that if you got a raid force setup thats sufficient with 65% slow and then a shammy shows up you can send 1/3 of the clerics home.. Thats a huge difference. <br />
<br />
Shaman are one of the best balanced classes out there.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: Most quotes should be seen in the complete post they are writen in but I believe the view our BST &quot;friends&quot; have of us and the reason so many pop up here is clear now <br />
<br />
First off, I'm not *your* friend.  Sorry if that sounds blunt, but I have ZERO tolerance for anyone that purposely tries to pit two classes against each other. <br />
<br />
I have a very simple question for you.  Why did you ONLY link the VERY FEW so called *negative* SECTIONS of posts from the beastlord boards?  I could just as easily go over there, and get the same amount of statements that show an enormous amount of respect/admiration for the shaman community?<br />
<br />
Oh wait...I have the answer to that question already.. Because you are a troll that wants nothing more than to continue this silly flame war.   <br />
<br />
Again, sorry if that sounds blunt, but I see NO OTHER REASON for your post other than that above.<br />
<br />
<br />
and in response to:<br />
Shm start to worry about Bst is becuz we been left out by VI but they got pick up by VI, I think thats a FACT...  <br />
<br />
Wrong, beastlords weren't *picked up*, they were *brought up to speed*.   They didn't all the sudden jump on SoE's favorite class list or anything, they were simply adjusted up to a point where people would actually play the class.  That's it.  <br />
<br />
Anyone that has the audacity to state that shaman are worthless, or that shaman are being replaced by beastlords either:<br />
<br />
1. Haven't logged into EQ......ever.<br />
or<br />
2. Simply like to start trouble.<br />
or <br />
3. Like attention and jumping on bandwagons.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and &quot;I think thats a FACT...&quot;  When you put the words &quot;I think&quot; in there, it ceases to become a FACT. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u142"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p142">This all sounds silly without any proof. Ive been doing all so been fighting the same mobs at same lvl for awhile and landing slow is streaky. I can play 3hrs one night have maybe a resist than very next time i play on same mob first 2 pulls bounce it 2 or 3x in a row each and have more resists over all in 3hrs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u143"><b>Rodney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p143">Howdy all, this is my first post here and just wanted to say HI first.  <br />
<br />
     I play two toons in EQ, my main is a 63 Warlord and alt is a 51 BL, they serve two different roles for me. <br />
<br />
     From my warriors view Shaman are the best class in game to group with bar NONE they are awesome, if there are just two make it a war and shaman.  I would rather have a shaman then a cleric in a two man group.  I can see your point on this but take a look at what has happened to warriors, palies have replacing them on all but DEF type raids, but thats another story.  Point is form a warriors viewpoint shaman are an awesome class.<br />
<br />
    From a BL's point we play 2nd string to shaman most of our lives.  Most groups will always take a shaman over a BL and if both in the same group just about all my buffs are useless.  Even when I do more damage the the tank and the same as a monk no one sees it cause we dont make the big hits we dont spam like a monk.  When in a group with a shaman I just buff my pet and the shaman does the rest, I'm just dps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u144"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p144">What an unbelievable whine-fest this has turned into. Let's look at some important points here.<br />
<br />
1. It takes 65 freakin levels for a BST to get his 65% slow. It's not vendor sold, it requires a rune that's hard to get and still have to pray you get the spell on turn in. Our Turgurs is vendor sold and starts at 66% slow up to 75% at 60. We are in huge demand at 51+ in XP groups and a necessity at most raids.<br />
 <br />
2. In an XP group a BST brings a great pet  but no form of crowd control via root like we can. No debuffs for the casters to land dots/nukes easier. They can't root/dot either. We both solo quite well but a beasty still can't gate if something bad happens. <br />
<br />
So you're 62 and a 65 BST is landing slows easier, duh 3 levels makes a huge difference. Enough peeps responded to the one guy's claim that the beasty slows shimmers without any form of debuff to convince me that is a bunch of bull.<br />
<br />
I'm probably the most un-uber shaman equipment-wise you'll find out there but always feel like a god when I group with others. A 75% slow is just sick, add in 25/tick regen, 50% haste, the ability to CC via root+slow, debuffs so I and others can land spells better, a 1500pt quick acting dot that's easy to get, a 2khp heal, a pet that can tank many slowed mobs. All this and I still don't have epic, torpor, malo, JBB, Pox.<br />
<br />
And here you are jealous over a hard to get 65th lvl spell and trying to get another class nerfed. I pity you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u145"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p145">If you sort through the crap there are some very nice points being made here.<br />
<br />
I would like to point out that most of us dont want anything changed in reguards to BLs, we want changes to our class.  BLs are just the one other class that has similar spells to us in reguards to buffs and slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u146"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p146">Beastlords kick ass.  Its true.<br />
<br />
They have The ability to rival a shaman in slowing, can tank like a hybrid, and have a pet that is nearly equal to a mage pet... all in one package.<br />
<br />
But they dont start out that way.<br />
<br />
You are looking at a level 65 beastlord in good gear with level 65 spells.  On the way up, they are behind shaman at every stage -we get a spell effect, and several levels later they get the same.  At the top end, they do seem overpowered, but so do a lot of classes.<br />
<br />
At 64 I dont need malo to land slow on 99% of the exp mobs in PoV, PoS, BoT.  I always malo a named or mini-boss type mob before I even try to slow, otherwise I just cast turgurs.  At 65 I expect it to be even easier.  I can take 5 meeles and myself and go hunt in any of these zones.<br />
<br />
Shaman arent underpowered, and our upgrades are nice... but I would like to be able to do something unique or that makes people go &quot;Ohh wow&quot;.  Everything I can do someone else can do almost as well.  I have enough to make me wanted in any group, but nothing to make me stand out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u148"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p148">I think the main problem isn't BL's, it's that the Shaman core competencies have been leached and given to other classes over time.  Healing, buffing, debuffing, slowing, DoTs have all been given to or improved in other classes in such a way that the shaman is either way behind or only a half inch ahead in any area.  The one thing shaman have that other classes don't is the ability to still have mana at the end of a long, bloody fight.  <br />
<br />
Problem is - our ability to shorten fights in a regular exp group is pretty weak but carries more aggro in comparison to just about every other class.  I think only bards and enchanters have it worse with innate DPS, but make up for it with the ability to use charm for DPS and by significantly increasing the manapool of every caster in the group.<br />
<br />
I don't want to see SOE nerf anyone.  I do want to see Shaman given more offensive power (DD or short, high damage, low aggro, low mana dots) and more healing power.  I'm not gonna hold my breath though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u152"><b>Corwil Delyonhart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p152">The problem in a nutshell for me is simple. <br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Every expansion Verant releases instead of coming up with all new ideas it gives peices of the shaman class to other classes as part of what it is selling to us. <br />
<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Anyone who has been around the game for a while and especially those who have played a shaman since the begining know this to be true. <br />
<br />
So I don't care about Bst's being powerful, the highest level beastlord in my guild and I talked about this thread last night and laughed about some of it. I am glad they are a powerful as it helps our guild out. :) We talked about differences and in that conversation I made a comparison to a monk thread I read recently. <br />
<br />
http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=36900.topic<br />
<br />
Basic jist I got from that thread is that monks don't see they have a unique class defining purpose anymore in pop. Pop doesn't require feign splitting and they are second or third best damage dealers etc etc. They said it better than I can but the point again is this... <br />
<br />
some monks don't see they have a defining purpose in the game. <br />
<br />
<br />
That sort of thing is what I care about, what makes a shaman a shaman. What makes my class different. <br />
<br />
Landragoran pointed out bst can do 80% of what we do. Others have pointed out with mitigation in some areas of pop all of our slows crush down to where it's fractions of a percentage difference. <br />
<br />
That sort of class defining holy grail thing is probably something that I fear we will never find in EQ again. Verant doesn't seem to understand that each class needs a purpose that is at least somewhat unique of the other classes. <br />
<br />
I do care about the watering down by handing out of abilities that has caused the class to be where it is today. <br />
<br />
The line is no longer clear what a shaman is, or what several of the classes are when looking at all of them as a balance question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u153"><b>xilsharn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p153">Let me say a little something here, playing a fairly high level Beastlord (lvl 62)<br />
<br />
I would rather not slow.  I don't like it.  My cripples suck, and the time it takes me to land a slow even in Tier 2 planes is silly if it gets resisted a few times.  Plus, our cripples suck.  I'd rather keep a few extra pet buffs up than keep up my &quot;shaman&quot; spells.  (altho' that 1200 DOT is nice)<br />
<br />
Maybe I&quot;m just lazy but I'd rather play the melee that I chose to play when I rolled my BST than a priest-type with a crappy mana pool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u154"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p154">Shaman, generally speaking, are pretty balanced as a class, imho.<br />
<br />
I don't see a problem.  <br />
<br />
Sure, some things make me shake my head.  Our spectural spells are beyond stupid (or 50% of them), Avatar is broken, Kunark spell tables are busted, and most of our spells and spell upgrades carry too much mana cost.  Sure, we have good self mana regen, if that's all we do.  If we actually cast stuff, it's not the same story.  <br />
<br />
The heal thing I don't really agree with, rangers and bl with better more useful buffs I don't quite get, but outside those quibbles, shaman are fine.  <br />
<br />
Alchemy is not broken either, just getting portable DS and invis to undead is worthwhile.  <br />
<br />
Let the chain drop in HoT and elsewhere, and I'll be happy!<br />
<br />
However, if I were to start over, I'd probably be a beastlord.  They seem to get to the fun parts of shaman without the dudgery.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u157"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p157">This is just an observation...<br />
<br />
I 2 box a 54 monk and 54 shaman. I have been getting the monk resist gear because we suck against casters. When buffed the monk is around 130 in all resists. (not great I know but not too bad for our level)<br />
<br />
We tackled a level 50 vampyre caster in Tenebrous Mountains the other day and were completely owned...both died very quickly. A level 55 BL can solo this mob. Seems mighty strange that a single toon of about same level can solo a mob that we cant even hope to duo for at least 3 more levels...<br />
<br />
But maybe it is just that this pair sucks against casters...we can usually take yellow melee types. But have been getting resist gear and it doesn't seem to help at all...not one spell was resisted by either of us against the vampyre.<br />
<br />
I'd be interested to hear from BL's if they are especially good against casters or something? (and why). I am definitely not calling for nerf, just curious...(and wondering how on earth my duo can possibly start taking dark blue casters on)<br />
<br />
PS. Monk also has an adamantite club to stun casters and alpha dog has gnoll lariats but vampyres immune to stun.</div></div><hr />

- Beastlords are a good class<br />
- Shamans have very defensive tendancies recently when it comes to their class, probably since it's less overpowered now than it was in some past expansions. The fact that shamans can't ever not get a group (double negative pwn) speaks volumes.<br />
- Beastlords have an incessant and deadly habit of creating wormholes on their class boards to other class boards discussing beastlords, then perpetuating the thread, which in this case is just made by some troll maniac tripping on acid and having sincere difficulty discerning the hallucinations from reality. This thread would be dead if the beastlords hadn't so over-defended themselves.<br />

No one is changing anyone's mind here. You believe in magic or you don't. You believe in an undetectable resist mod on nonbard spells, or you trust in lucy.

Uh oh, smart guy.<br />
<br />
Beastlords don't get snare.  You're referring to STaylorTest, a snare that was listed in the spell dat file for all hybrids.  They don't get it. Paladins don't get it.  No one got the new level 55 snare.  It's not live.<br />
<br />
Warriors have _nothing_ to do with beastlords.  They have ZERO to envy about beastlords.  <br />
<br />
I read through that post.  Oddly enough, I don't see anyone saying mage pets are equal to BL pets.  Mage pets are still the best tanking and damage dealing pet out there.<br />
<br />
In the necromancer thread, all I see is some conjecture and heresay.  <br />
<br />
What were you right about again, exactly?<br />
<br />
You're spewing propoganda.  You're most likely another poster in this thread pretending to be a new person.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u164"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p164">In fact, let's break your ridiculous little nonsensical caterwauling rant down.<br />
<br />
&quot;BST have pets equal to Mage Pets &amp; Greater then Necro Pets&quot;<br />
<br />
Wrong. Mage pets still tank better and do more damage.  Necro pets happen to have a nice little lifetap proc.  If you want to compare this to BL proc imbues, you could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good Melee Dmg&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, there's an intelligent, detailed statement.  They can melee as well as a bard.  No double attack, aside from AA DA.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dual Wield&quot;<br />
<br />
Shouldn't this go with &quot;good melee dmg&quot; ?<br />
<br />
&quot;Good Nukes&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, let's see : At level 64 they get a 675 damage nuke for 250 damage.  Sure, that's nice.  It also has a 30 second recast.  Is it anywhere near as good as mages? Wizards? Necromancers?<br />
<br />
Why, it looks like shaman get a 925 damage nuke at 64 for 300 mana. <br />
<br />
&quot;DoTs&quot;<br />
<br />
Right, this is an area where beastlords are a HUGE threat.  Let's see : Plague, all the way at level 65, and Scorpion Venom at 61.   Quite outclassed by shaman and necromancers in this area.<br />
<br />
&quot;65% Slow that MAY be less resistant then Shaman&quot;<br />
<br />
You can't argue with conjecture.<br />
<br />
&quot;Equal Buffing&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, there's another detailed statement.  Shaman get 7th at 65.  Beastlords get Kragg as their best HP buff.  Granted, it's nice for them to have Kragg when a shaman isn't in the group.  I won't even talk about stat buffs, because they're irrelevant anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mana/HP Regen&quot;<br />
<br />
This is a unique ability of the beastlord.  It's a lure for them to get groups.  Shaman have no basis for complaining about this spell.  It was never a shaman spell in the first place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better AAs&quot;<br />
<br />
Uh, you're comparing apples and oranges there, chief.  Lots of classes get better AA's than shaman.  You can't compare a melee hybrid's AA's to a priest's AA's.  This argument holds no water whatsoever.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pet Heals that are equal to a Clerics&quot;<br />
<br />
They're pet heals.  Your point being?<br />
<br />
&quot;Descent heals for self&quot;<br />
<br />
They have chloroblast at 62.  That's the only heal of merit they have.  You could count Regrowth as a heal, too, if you want, but they get that all the way at 64, the same as rangers do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pet Buffs like no other&quot;<br />
<br />
Gee, let's see:<br />
<br />
Beastlord's best pet buff:<br />
<br />
1:  Increase Attack Speed by 85% <br />
2:  Increase STR by 115 <br />
3:  Increase AC by 71 <br />
5:  Increase ATK by 75 <br />
<br />
For 450 mana. 300 mana than the mage buff.  Granted, it IS better, but we know how useless strength is, and the 35 ATK is a marginal damage boost at best, most likely.<br />
<br />
Mage's best pet buff:<br />
<br />
<br />
2:  Increase AC by 22 <br />
3:  Increase STR by 80 <br />
4:  Increase Attack Speed by 85% <br />
5:  Increase ATK by 40 <br />
<br />
For only 150 mana.<br />
<br />
<br />
While beastlords may in fact have the best pet buff, they're so similar it's a moot point, not to mention the fact the mage's costs a hell of a lot less mana.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hybrid HP table&quot;<br />
<br />
They are, and correct me if I'm wrong, on the same HP table as rangers.  Paladins and SK's have higher HP, and they're hybrids.  You're generalizing.<br />
<br />
&quot;and Didnt they get a form of snare also, though i saw that on EQBeastlord.com&quot;<br />
<br />
Beastlords do not get snare.  You may want to check up on your reading comprehension.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can Shaman have a mage pet too?&quot;<br />
<br />
No, they're not mages.  Beastlords don't have mage pets, either.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really if Shaman arent slightly upset by this, then they should be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Really, only whiny children who aren't content with that they have should care about an argument that doesn't hold any water in the first place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell Shadowknights, Paladins, Necromancers, Mages and Warriors should be just as upset.&quot;<br />
<br />
Um, boggle?  I'm not sure where Beastlords have anything to do with SK's, Paladins, or Warriors, but you're at least right in comparing them to other pet classes.<br />
<br />
&quot;They are basiclly two WHOLE classes combined into ONE.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hmm? Which classes are these?<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no problem here.. /sarcasm off&quot;<br />

Good luck to the level 55 Beastlord.  At level 60 with 150+ resists, I do pretty well against the vamp casters in TM - some of the time.  If they flurry much (Gorelaz flurried 20 times last time I fought him, with that 200 point lifetap it tends to hurt a bit) or land a debuff, I'm gone.  I seriously doubt I could have taken them at 55, the 60 pet and 59 pet haste are a giant upgrade to the 54 pet.<br />

<br />
Sorry, no.  Close to Mage pets and slightly better than necro pets, sure.  A Beastlord pet will generally lose a fight with a similar level Mage pet.<br />
<br />
ask on the necromancer board thank you very much. <br />
<br />
Arg? Ask on the Necromancer board about whether Beastlord pets are as good as Mage pets?  What would they know about it? And what would what they think have anything to do with what you think?  Aren't you a Shaman?<br />
<br />
As for BST snare...<br />
<br />
http://bcope16.phpwebhosting.com/ph...highlight=snare<br />
<br />
<br />
Read third post down please? As i said i saw it on the BST page. <br />
<br />
Yep, Makani talks about us getting snare there.  What he doesn't say (and you apparently didn't read enough to find out) is that it's an AA purchased pet proc that only snares for a few seconds, and doesn't stack with any other proc.  This a) costs a ton of AA and b) greatly reduces the pet's damage output.  It's a toy, not worth the AA to purchase. (as it should be, really - I agree with Makani, adding a general purpose snare to the class would be unbalancing)<br />
<br />
Hell Shadowknights, Paladins, Necromancers, Mages and Warriors should be just as upset.<br />
<br />
And yet, oddly, they're not.  SK's and Necros have their own roles, in some ways superior to Beastlord roles. (I play both classes.)  A 60+ Mage is a power to behold these days - I don't know a Mage in those levels who's unhappy with the class now.  A few months ago, maybe...  Warriors tank better than anyone, end of story.  (And yes, a hell of a lot better than I or my pet does.) Try doing much of PoP content without a Warrior or Shaman.  Have fun on the CR.<br />
<br />
<br />
Can I call you a troll now?  Dunno why I'm going through this stuff really - if you want to argue about the Beastlord class, come read the boards.  (Or play one for a while, so you have a clue what you're talking about.)<br />
<br />
This is a Shaman board, I'm going back to reading about how to be a Shaman.  (About which I know nothing.)<br />

Appreciate u didnt pop more foul language there, I didnt use any and I dont expect any in return if we think shaman as a whole.<br />

and by the way, I DID NOT try to disprove Lucy, but people who use lucy like they are actually lucy is wrong.<br />
Lucy is human and human made mistakes; what if she made a type on something do you HAVE TO believe that? thats the question.<br />
People can say &quot;according to a trusted resource that post in lucy, we can &quot;safely&quot; say [insert a term] is correct ...&quot; but &quot;not BECAUSE lucy said xxx, so you HAS TO BE WRONG&quot;.<br />
the difference is small but thats what I meant.<br />

and I did not, by all mean try to get BST and SHM fight each other, I love shm its my main; but I dont think any one can say SHM was design/balanced correctly in PoP<br />
think of first Fosoul was only hp buff, and our uber str/dex buffs, u dont see that mistake in other class. oh and hasten rabidity? that sounds like a joke to me.<br />

<br />
No, you DON'T have it straight.  Mage pets are much higher in the DPS category versus Bst pets.  They are close pre 60, but the new PoP mage pets DPS is second to none.  Beastlord Pets are probably a bit more powerful than necro pets, but they are meant to be when you look at the supporting spells necros get versus beastlords.<br />

Good Melee Dmg, Dual Wield, Good Nukes, DoTs, 65% Slow that MAY be less resistant then Shaman, Equal Buffing, Mana/HP Regen, Better AAs, Pet Heals that are equal to a Clerics, Descent heals for self, Pet Buffs like no other, Hybrid HP table, and Didnt they get a form of snare also, though i saw that on EQBeastlord.com.<br />
<br />
1. Good melee damage?<br />
  Sure, it's not bad.  Before AA abilities though, we aren't much higher than pallies...probably on par with them.  We are like a one-armed monk.  <br />
2. Duel Wield?<br />
 Yep, but no double attack (we can get DA with AA, but even then it's very minimal)<br />
3. Good Nukes?<br />
 Decent, but with 30 second refresh time, we can't exactly nuke something to death.<br />
4. 65% slow that may be less resistant than Shaman?<br />
Get a clue, they DO NOT land any more frequent than a Shaman's.  The original poster was 2-3 levels LOWER than the 65 beastlord.  On top of that, we only have to LEVEL TO 65 to get that slow, and THEN pray to the norrathian gods that we get a rune...then on top of THAT, we have to hope that we get the correct spell upon turnin!!!<br />
5. Equal Buffing?<br />
Oh yeah, of course you ALWAYS see beastlords buffing entire raids with our AC/HP/Str/Sta/Dex/Agi buffs right?  <br />
6. Better AAs?<br />
Have you looked at our AA's?  They aren't bad, but we don't even get MGB!  Do some research.<br />
7. Pet Heals that are equal to a Clerics?<br />
Oh brother.  BEASTLORDS DO NOT GET A COMPLETE HEAL FOR OUR PETS!  So therefore, how are we even remotely close to being able to heal our pets like a cleric?  Sure we have the best pet heals in game, but that is our niche....  pet heals!<br />
8. Descent heals for self?<br />
 Oh yeah, that 428 point healing spell sure is uber!!!  Not to mention we don't even get it after lvl 60!!<br />
9. and Didnt they get a form of snare also, though i saw that on EQBeastlord.com?<br />
No, we DID NOT get a snare.  Reading is your friend.  Do more of it.  We don't even get root.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Can Shaman have a mage pet too? Really if Shaman arent slightly upset by this, then they should be. Why eve have a Shaman in an experience group with a BST around that has all his spells?<br />
<br />
No, no problem here.. /sarcasm off <br />
<br />
That's funny, although Shaman don't have a &quot;mage pet&quot;, I've seen several parses that show a shaman with a fully buffed pet approaching the DPS of a beastlord self buffed warder.  Hmmm....did you see beastlords whine about the DPS of shaman pets?  Nope...most of us said &quot;good for shaman!&quot;.  Funny how that isn't happening now.</div></div><hr />

Sony, in its infinite wisdom, has created a mindset in its players that has everyone running scared from the nerf bat.

It's kinda sad that beastlords feel they must go to the shaman board to scream how they suck in order to feel like they are doing their part to make sure they stay under Sony's nerf radar.  <br />

Rebel,<br />
<br />
I went back over my posts, and didn't see anywhere where I used any foul language.  I apologize if it came off that way in my response to you.<br />
<br />
As to an answer to your question:  <br />
There is a difference between what you are saying, and what others are saying.  I can easily go disprove to you that you can't find that spell in a cleric/pal guild.  I just have to log on and go to those places to prove it.  Therefore, we could say &quot;Lucy is wrong&quot;.<br />
<br />
We are saying lucy lists two spells exactly alike in regards to resist checks.  We are also seeing SEVERAL people come here that play high level beastlords AND Shaman stating that there IS NO DIFFERENCE in resists between the two.  Therefore we have TWO pieces of pretty solid evidence there stating the same thing.<br />
<br />
On the other hand we have the statements of a select few stating that it seems bst slows land more often than shaman slows.  But yet those people don't group up HALF has much as someone 2-boxing both classes on a daily basis, or someone who's played both classes to lvl 64 and beyond...  In fact they all happen to be shaman that have just grouped with a high level beastlord from time to time.<br />
<br />
Do you see what I'm saying?  I'm saying that AS OF RIGHT NOW, we have no reason to distrust Lucy *on this matter*.  It would be different if every person that has played both classes came here and stated the bst slows landed BY FAR more often than the shaman's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u172"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p172">Yes yes, all you who say how &quot;weak and poor are BST pets and how other classes have nothing to envy here&quot;. Bla bla bla...<br />
<br />
So show me 2 mages, who can dual mobs in PoV with their pets. I have yet to see them manage it. And I don't mean the frogs or skellies (heck they wouldn't be able to do even that), I mean the crystalline golems and arachnids and crawlers etc. Show me 2 pally's/sk's/warriors/monks/whatever other melee class who can do this. Doubt you can. But 2 beastlords can do it. Seen them do it on my server, a lot and nicely. And no, they don't fight one mob and then med for 1 hour, they were at times pulling mobs even faster then couple of groups around them (and no, not gimp groups either). So if the BST's have so many disadvantages regarding any other pet class and heck, any class there as someone said, then how can they do it easily and no one else can do it like that? I mean 2 persons of the SAME class.<br />
<br />
I don't want to have BST's nerfed. I don't want to have ANY class nerfed. Why the heck.. But I want that shamans would get the attention too. And wondering if this will be the 4th expansion where shamans get either nerfed more - make all mobs there immune to slow, poison and disease and put even more shaman spells on items as procs/self buffs, add more stats bonuses to items making the buffs even more worthless - or just ignored, which seems to be latest &quot;trend&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Okay, /agree on that one. I'd love to be talking about how much fun my Beastlord is to play.  I do it often, actually - on the Beastlord boards.  Not on the Shaman boards, where presumably people are looking for comments on the Shaman class.  (right??)  On the other hand, if there were a long thread on the Beastlord boards  full of ludicrous inaccuracies and posts about how Shaman should be nerfed, I'd expect a few Shaman to show up.<br />
<br />
Maybe this thread is a good thing for me.  I'm spending a lot of time over here reading the non-stupid threads (pretty much all of them besides this one) - I may start playing my Shaman twink again.<br />

I don't feel there need to be all that many changes to the beastlord class pos/neg at this point in time (at least to the level I've played up til...can't comment past that).  <br />
<br />
Where, in all the posts by the beastlords, have we stated flat out that we suck?  The ONLY thing I've seen in the posts here are beastlords trying to DISPELL some of the myths being brought up by others here on the shaman boards.  We aren't saying &quot;we suck&quot;, we are trying to explain things so people aren't spreading rumors about things they don't know.<br />
<br />
And even after saying all that, I LOVE playing my shaman as well.  He's a blast to play!  I think that the shaman class is extremely balanced as is right now.  Whine all you want, and feel free to disagree...that's fine, but the fact remains.  I can count on ONE HAND the amount of raids that could happen without the assistance of a Shaman.  They are similar to beastlords in that they are a jack of all trades, but they take it one step further...they ARE the master of one!  SLOWING!</div></div><hr />

Funny, I solo those.. course I root/rot. But seeing how I can tank BoT militis i dont see why i shouldnt be able to do the same with arachnids. And no, im not particularly uber.<br />
<br />
Yes I can agree shamans have seen little power increase since kunark. Basically til i get my 65 spells(malos and quie) i will be using spells from my kunark setup. Turgurs will ofcourse always be there as there have been no upgrades to that spellline since then. <br />
<br />
However I couldnt care less if beastlords sprout tiny leather wings and fly away to verantland.<br />
<br />
One thing im curious about though is this supposed lower resist on beastlords/chanter/bards, if it could be related to their spells being higher level. For example turgurs is 51, sha's is 65. Course there isnt an easy answer to this without testing, and if i had a 65 bst i would try it out.</div></div><hr />

You have a valid point, about bragging possibly bringing about nerfs.  But sometimes, BS is just BS, and we've got to get the facts set straight.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can tell you with absolute certainty that a level 55 beaslord can't solo tenebrous nameds.  MAYBE, just MAYBE, if epic proc's on first swing(55% slow), I've got aego, focus, and c3...and the RNG is feeling particularly kind that day.<br />

<br />
Beastlords pets tank as well as our air pet, and do as much damage, not to mention proc some nasty stuff while ours have to cast a spell. It will do as much damage and take as much of a beating.<br />
<br />
As for our water pet, it will outdamage the beastlord pet but tanks like a wetpaper towel. Just wanted that clear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u181"><b>harius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p181">Speaking as a level 65 Beastlord:<br />
<br />
1. Our slows are landing no better then yours. We're just not in the habit of maloing/tashing before we throw them. So we get lucky sometimes. On average I'm making 2-3 attempts to land slows on BoT mobs. I wouldn't call that very ubber. <br />
<br />
2. Our buffs are older shaman buffs. Much like a Pally can &quot;simulate&quot; Aego by throwing a Heroic Bond and stacking a symbol, we can &quot;simulate&quot; a focus of spirit but throwing a Infusion of Spirit and Talisman of Kragg. We're diet coke shamans. I except that, but am happy that I can kind of fill in when there is no shaman.<br />
<br />
3. I would like to see these beastlords duoing Valor mobs like golems like cake. My GF is also a level 65 beastlord and we've tried to duo Tier 2 and 3 mobs. It's doable but far from effiecient. It takes alot of mana to heal those 544 point double attacks. The pets have decent hps, but our 2k heals only handle 4 attacks. It's just not mathmatically fesable for 2 beastlords to efficiently melee Valor or higher mobs. I will admit you can agro kite fairly well, but thats alot of effort.<br />
<br />
4. Mages have better pets hands down. That doesn't mean Beastlord pets suck. But mage pets are and really should be better damage dealers.<br />
<br />
5. Hobble of Spirits is a proc we can put on our pet and is to snare what Earth Pets Root is to Root. Lasts 6 to 20 seconsds if it lands.</div></div><hr />

Your guild is not an uber guild it is a collection of characters purchased off of Ebay and given the same guild tag. Granted as far as I know you aren't ebayed, I can tell because you still act like the 12 year old you always have. Your abilities as a shaman have always been sub par, in fact I know many, many people that won't group with you. In fact it has been comical readig the responses to your guild applications for the true so-called uber guilds. So please go on about how knowledgable you are, I need more laughs in my life.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u189"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p189">Well, I'm not sure if many people will understand this, as many people seem to be unable to comprehend the mathematical significance of percentages (just something I've observed in my lifetime):<br />
<br />
The problem lies in the fact that casters get very touchy when melees gain access to a certain class of spells.  These spells are what I call &quot;lever&quot; spells, because their effectiveness is not fixed, but increases or decreases depending on the situation... they act as a lever to multiply a character's effectiveness.  Many spells that are considered to be imbalanced or overly powerful have some sort of effect like this (Complete Heal's effectiveness scales as the target gains HP).<br />
<br />
Example:  Slow is a perfect example because it is a straight percentage-based effect.  Turgur's Insects, when cast on an orc pawn, is practically worthless.  It does what it is supposed to do, but in actuality it's not very useful for 250 mana, a small heal would achieve the same effect at the end.  However, Turgur's Insects, when cast on a powerful, hard-hitting mob, has a huge effect and can potentially reduce needed healing by 75%, saving thousands of mana in a raid.<br />
<br />
Example:  Haste is another percentage-based spell that works in a similar manner.  Cast on a level one warrior, the spell does just what it is supposed to do... but in the grand scheme of things, it really doesn't add much damage output.    However, cast that haste spell on a high-level warrior, and you're talking a serious increase in damage, and a much greater effect.  As a ranger, I was very upset that Paladins were given a haste spell, because of that reason.<br />
<br />
These spells act as levers, and when properly applied can swing entire battles in your favor.  It has been VERY rare for melee classes to be given &quot;lever&quot; spells because of their inherent sturdiness and lesser dependence on mana.  For a melee class to be able to spend 150 mana on a slow that is 85% as effective as our slow is unbalanced, period, because the &quot;lever&quot; effect of that spell makes it incredibly efficient overall (so many fewer heals needed, much lower chance of death, etc.).  I don't care how hard it is to get at level 65... I don't have copies of Torpor or Malo, yet my spell lineup post 50 takes them into account, so I don't feel like this statement is irrelevant.<br />
<br />
Melees should never be able to save a raid or group thousands of mana with one spell.  Melees are never as in-tune with mana and spellcasting as pure casters are, and there has never been a precedent for the type of mana/health regeneration and slowing/hasting that has been given to beastlords.  It doesn't fit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem with this analysis is in applying it to the Shaman class.  By your description, the Shaman class gets a HUGE number of &quot;Lever&quot; spells - Slow, Haste, partial Cheal, the Malo line, etc.  High level Shaman don't seem particularly mana dependent - I have yet to see a 60+ Shaman be OOM for more than a few seconds.  <br />
<br />
Wouldn't that make the class unbalanced?<br />
<br />
(Note for literalists - it's a counterexample to show that the argument doesn't make sense, not a real argument for a Shaman nerf.)<br />
<br />
edited for clarity</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u192"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p192">The point is that it is unbalanced to give spell-based levers to a melee class.  If you read that part of the statement, it was pretty clear.<br />
<br />
Also, you are not making a new point.  People have been complaining that slow was &quot;too uber&quot; for a long time, but it was kept to two pure-caster classes to be used &quot;on demand&quot; and used as a proc on very few weapons.  We have paid the price for those spells for a long time, so don't tell us we're not balanced.  We are casters, and it is our realm to manipulate our environments using mana.<br />
<br />
By the way, Malo is not a lever spell, and our &quot;CH&quot; caps at less than 2k, so that isn't a lever spell either (CH will stop being so when melees start to break 10k).  They are fixed in benefit.  I can see that you have no idea what I am talking about.  Also, what is the &quot;etc.&quot; at the end of your flawed list?  Meh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u193"><b>Eatbugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p193">The point is that it is unbalanced to give spell-based levers to a melee class. If you read that part of the statement, it was pretty clear.<br />
<br />
Actually, it wasn't.  The reasons you list apply to any class, not just to melee classes.<br />
<br />
 We have paid the price for those spells for a long time, so don't tell us we're not balanced. <br />
<br />
I'm not, read it again. (It even had a freaking disclaimer on the end about that, sheesh.)  I'm saying your argument that we're unbalanced with lesser versions of the same abilities is dumb.<br />
<br />
By the way, Malo is not a lever spell, and our &quot;CH&quot; caps at less than 2k, so that isn't a lever spell either<br />
<br />
Fair enough on your &quot;CH.&quot;  By your description, Malo is most definitely a lever spell - sure, it helps on lower level stuff a bit but it wouldn't be worth the mana most of the time.  The more powerful something is, the greater the effect (the ability to land spells you wouldn't otherwise be able to, in this case) is.  There are many high level encounters that can't be done at all without it. <br />
<br />
The etc is because I'm not a shaman, I don't know the rest of the spell lines, and I'm fairly sure you can't be bothered looking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By the way, I never said that I would like to nerf beastlords, but I do believe they were overpowered to make up for the fact that not enough people were interested in playing them.  Most of the people who started up beastlords, in my experience, did so because they were attracted by their power and solo ability.<br />
<br />
Ask yourself, honestly, if beastlords were in the game from day one, would they have all of the spell lines they have now?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u198"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p198">Fair enough, malo does have a greater effect on higher-level creatures, but not in the same fashion and not necessarily.  It does not have any scaling effect, but it does have situational uses that make landing spells much easier.  By your reasoning, Enduring Breath leverages people's inability to breath when they go to the Grey, because you can't fight there without the spell or item... but it's useless outside of the Grey.  Malo is vital in some areas when fighting resistant mobs, but there are plenty of fights where malo is not needed, and would just be a waste of mana.  I fight stuff in exp groups all day, where haste and slow are vital levers to multiply my effectiveness... but I never have to cast anything in the Malo line because it is not needed.<br />
<br />
Show me a meleer where spell haste doesn't improve their DPS, and show me a mob (that is able to attack players) whose DPS isn't reduced by slow (discounting immune mobs) and then we can talk.  Don't try to change MY definition of a term i created for this discussion.  :)</div></div><hr />

So I figure it was BS too or maybe he was an uber equipped twink or something, or just very lucky.<br />

I think the castle vampyre nameds are just a massive undercon as last night my same duo could easily handle the named casting wurms in Burning Wood which are allegedly about the same level (maybe a bit lower). <br />

Getting another class nerfed is NOT going to do a damn thing to make YOU more desirable.  Honestly i think the original poster is probably the root of his own problem.  He sounds like a whiner and i'd guess a VERY average shaman.  If your guild is asking the beastlord to do YOUR job then i'd say it's almost definately YOUR fault for sitting on your butt and doing nothing but slowing and buffing and WHINING.<br />
<br />
Personally the only thing I agree with is that shaman need SOMETHING, anything to make them a more viable class as i think as they are now they are kind of a joke.  I've permanently retired mine for some time now as it's just too boring to play him, but getting beastlords nerfed isn't going to help your penis envy any, you'll just find another class to whine about.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u214"><b>Zaspacer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p214">&quot;10% isnt much of a difference in slow speeds.&quot;<br />
- MekuDeku<br />
<br />
&quot;For a melee class to be able to spend 150 mana on a slow that is 85% as effective as our slow is unbalanced, period...&quot;<br />
- Xanden<br />
<br />
You REALLY do not understand the dynamics of % changes in slow.<br />
And poor Bazoom spelled it out on page 1 of this thread too.<br />
<br />
A 10% change to slow has a RADICALLY different impact the higher percent of the slow.<br />
<br />
RADICALLY!!!<br />
<br />
Class A having a 75% slow and Class B having a 65% slow is equivalent to Class A having a 40% slow and Class B having a 0% slow!<br />
<br />
The rule is, the HIGHER the % slow, the MUCH BIGGER impact each % increase will have.<br />
(interestingly enough, haste works the OPPOSITE: the LOWER the % haste, the MUCH BIGGER impact each % increase will have)<br />
<br />
For a clearer understanding on the impact of % changes at high levels, let's look at TAXES instead of slows.<br />
<br />
Let's say you get a very nice job and start earning $100K a year.<br />
Now let's say that the government has a tax rate set at... 75%.<br />
You will end up taking home $25K a year.<br />
<br />
Now, imagine the government decides to be nice and give you a break on your taxes (yes, I know this is fantasy). It changes that tax rate by a mere... 10%, so now the tax rate is 65%.<br />
You would then end up taking home $35K a year.<br />
<br />
You would think 10% is not that much of a difference, but in this case, it is a 40% increase in your take home.<br />
You are going to be able to afford a MUCH different lifestyle.<br />
<br />
In contrast, let's say you took a job overseas in a different country.<br />
Unfortunately you were unable to find another $100K job, so you had to settle for one that paid $35K a year.<br />
Fortunately, this country has a tax rate that is only 40%, so you end up taking home $25K a year.<br />
<br />
Now, imagine this other country's government decides to cut it's taxes entirely, to 0%!!!<br />
Wow, that's a 40% swing.<br />
<br />
You end up with $35K take home a year.<br />
THE EXACT SAME $ change you saw in the original country, even though the % change was VERY different.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sigh <br />
In a given amount of time: <br />
Unslowed mob hits you: 100 times (0% slowed) <br />
Beastlord slowed hits you: 35 times (65% slow) <br />
Shammy slowed hits you: 25 times (75% slow) <br />
Thus a mob slowed by a shaman will hit you 40% LESS than a mob slowed by a Beastlord, which is a significant number - especially if you are talking about a raid-class mob. <br />
Isn't this correct?&quot;<br />
- Bazoom<br />
<br />
Yup. :)<br />
<br />
&quot;Haste is another percentage-based spell that works in a similar manner. Cast on a level one warrior, the spell does just what it is supposed to do... but in the grand scheme of things, it really doesn't add much damage output.&quot;<br />
- Xanden<br />
<br />
It's all relative.<br />
<br />
A 65 warrior with 0% haste will outdamage a level 1 warrior with 130% haste... yes.<br />
<br />
In contrast, a level 1 warrior with 0% haste will out XP a level 65 warrior with 130% haste.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, the actual impact on the % change of the # of swings for a level 65 warrior and a level 1 warrior with EQUAL hastes will be the EXACT SAME.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, a mob does hit more with a BL slow, however, you have to take into account the time the mobs is unslowed while I am trying to stick Malo, Malosini, and Turgurs. While I am fooling around with those three spells, the BL has already slowed on his first try because his is resisted far, far, far less. This makes the 10% of the shaman's slow inconsequential due to the extended time that the mobs has already been slowed.&quot;<br />
- MekuDeku<br />
<br />
Now THIS is an actual issue.<br />
A quicker slow DOES mean that a dps will occur sooner, which does lower the overall total dps.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, a 75% slow is still MUCH GREATER than a 65% slow, and in most raid situations you WILL want the mob slowed as MUCH as possible.<br />
IF it is the case that once a mob is slowed past a certain % it becomes trivial (mob will not kill you and mana/time saving is inconsequential), then YES, any number above that &quot;certain%&quot; is a non-issue.<br />
<br />
In your case above, your guild WILL want your slow no matter what.<br />
If there is no BL, then after your slow lands it will reduce melee dps up to 75%.<br />
If there is a BL slowing before you, then after you slow overwrites it will reduce melee dps up to 40% more.<br />
<br />
That IS a BIG factor for almost any raid.<br />
<br />
If there was only one slow in the game and it was for 40% do you think a guild would think it unimportant to use on a raid?<br />
<br />
IF the BL was not there, then your guild has to be able to weather more early damage, and more total damage to be able to defeat the encounter.<br />
Do you want your guild to be more efficient? To be able to take on tougher encounters because it can reduce more early damage and more total damage?<br />

it's no longer a 10% increment of the same value as 65 to 75 % when everyone's slow is between 35-40% - as a for instance on the second number I don't know what it is exactly when it mitigates. <br />

Isazo's post on page 1 sums it up better than I have for an example, and I don't remember if it was in that thread or not but someone got into math where slows were mitigated lower than 50%. 50% you can parse and prove shaman slow is better, at 30 something percent or lower you are hard pressed to prove even that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True.<br />
<br />
Bazoom said it clearly on the first page and no one seemed to pay attention.<br />
I was hoping I might help stick an understanding of it for some of those still caught up in a comparison of simple base numbers.<br />

Sorry if I was VERY late in getting to this thread. I just posted on it because I saw it on the front page of the board.<br />
<br />
I agree this is likely a dead horse, but it does still get me that so many players don't understand the actual implications of many numbers changes.<br />
<br />
While I have seen some very impressive numbers thinkers among all classes, I think most players do not fully comprehend the ramifications of flat numbers changes in the game. Most just see some numbers change and feel compelled to get upset based on an often horribly misleading number vs. number comparison.<br />
<br />
My &quot;long winded&quot; post was an effort to help breach the gap of understanding for those players.<br />

I DID miss that thread.<br />
I just went and read it.<br />
Thanks for citing and linking it.<br />
<br />
And yes, with slow caps in the game as explained, there WILL be less of a difference between slows.<br />
The lower the cap, the smaller the difference the actual effect of the different slows will be.<br />
<br />

<br />
Based on Isazo's equations and numbers, we have the following at 50% and 30% caps:<br />
<br />
@ 50% cap<br />
70 slow lets in 7% more damage than a 75 slow<br />
65 slow lets in 13% more damage than a 75 slow<br />
<br />
@ 30% cap<br />
70 slow lets in 3% more damage than a 75 slow<br />
65 slow lets in 6% more damage than a 75 slow<br />
<br />
&quot;We can conclude that in terms of overall damage mitigation, a shaman slow is 16% better at mitigating damage than an enchanter slow.&quot;<br />
- Isazo<br />
<br />
I think it's just easier to not get tied up in term of &quot;mitigation&quot;, and just look at the above terms instead to be:<br />
<br />
We can conclude that in terms normal circumstances (no slow caps), that a shaman slow reduces damage 20% more than a chanter slow, 40% more than a beastlord slow, and 80-92% more than a bard slow.<br />
<br />
These are the actual numbers that a guild/group/player will look at when weighing just the actual landed slow effects (NOT taking into account cast times, resits, duration, etc.) of the classes against each other on a normal mob.<br />
<br />
(NOTE: all classes above are referenced against a shaman slow, the numbers for each class against each other are different)<br />
<br />
Caps are in the game for some mobs because an unmodified 75% slow MAKES a huge difference. The caps DO provide a universal scaling based on existing class levels, but YES, because they reduce the slow the actual reduction over each other is GREATLY reduced.</div></div><hr />

Thus a mob slowed by a shaman will hit you 40% LESS than a mob slowed by a Beastlord, which is a significant number - especially if you are talking about a raid-class mob. <br />
<br />
<br />
It was wrong the first time it was posted and it is still wrong the second time around! (I let it go the first time around but twice was just too much BS for me to handle).<br />
<br />
The shaman slowed mob attacks (75-65)/(100-65) x 100% = 28.6% less often than the beastlord slowed mob.<br />
<br />
The beastlord slowed mob attacks (75-65)/(100-75) x 100% = 40% more often than the shaman slowed mob.<br />
<br />
It might seem pedantic but if mathematics is to be used at all it really should used correctly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You would be correct.<br />
<br />
My numbers were focusing on the % increase in damage the lesser slow is allowing relative to the greater slow.<br />
<br />
However I instead worded it incorrectly as if it was focusing on the % reduction in damage the greater slow is allowing relative to the lesser slow.</div></div><hr />
