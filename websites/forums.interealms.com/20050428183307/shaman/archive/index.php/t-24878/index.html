<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kargren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I currently have a 61sk (38aa's 1450ac/6700hp buffed) and a 52 shammy (crappy hp but ft5 on and fungi tunic and jbb). Sorry no magelo I am at work. Some restrictions are that I don’t have the time to be lfg normally. Because of new wife/kid and I can get called away suddenly. Also no LDON spells for shammy yet.<br />
Well my question is this: <br />
1. How does my xp compare with places that I might be at. xp/hour preferred over xp/kill<br />
2. Would it be better to group my shammy with characters around her lvl, Duo her, or solo her till 56?<br />
<br />
I can kill in any of the tier 1 planes fairly well with the exception of going to deep. I have tried the goo's (7k ish hp I think)in POD and get about 1% aa(sk)/reg xp(shammy) but they take probably 2 min to kill and I don’t like em just because they aren’t static spawns and I tend to get adds allot. I have done the POD flies (5-6k ish hp) for simpler results except they died quicker and there wasn’t enough of them for steady pulls.<br />
<br />
POJ zone in gives roughly .25%aa/.3%reg, POJ capts room gives maybe .3-.5%aa/.5reg, and the caves give 1%aa/1%reg. the zone in is usually camped and the mobs are a little to far apart/not enough to be great. The Capt's room is better but still not to many mobs around and a little lower xp/kill then I would like. The caves I recently found and they might be my best choice. The xp is great the mobs have low enough hp and there is plenty of them. Because I have recently found them I am not exactly sure what is the best camp spot for them if there is even a decent camp spot. I consider decent a spot with out 1-2 mobs spawning in camp or within agro range of camp. Any recommendations on the caves would be great.<br />
<br />
PON I have done some with the birds and trees but not recently. From what i remember it was about .5-1%/kill or so. My main problem with these guys is that I get such low xp/kill off mobs that have fairly high hp.<br />
I hope to get the shammy to 56 so i can slow/heal my sk on the Gobs consistently. Duoing the gobs with my SK and a cleric i borrowed I was getting 2%aa/kill on both. Or 4%aa/kill solo with sk and cleirc outside group hoting and nuking constantly.<br />
<br />
Veksar Killing the bloodgills I get .5-1%aa/.3-.5reg xp. With only 12-14 mobs spawning roughly 15 min its ok but slow still and not being able to use a horse hurts my shammy's mana regen alot. The sentry's a little deeper in give just slightly better xp then the bloodgills but have considerably more hp. Bloodgills being 4-5k ish hp and sentry;s being more like 7-8 I think.<br />
<br />
I have also tried KC, Nurga, katta, Velks. All were disappointing. So can anyone recommend any good places for my duo to hunt? Or any good spots for my shammy to solo? Hell even just letting me know that your experience says that I should be grouping with people my own lvl and not duoing please give me your suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">west wing charasis<br />
GE<br />
Chardok gyard/mines<br />
maybe nadox<br />
<br />
dunno about murkgliders in NC?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kargren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the ideas. I think I will have to try GE again. The mobs seemed to have alot of hp the last time I went but I should prob try again after I get shammy up a little more. I recently read that POtorment was a hot zone but was told by a friend that it isnt a good spot for xping any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grimmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Torment blows.  I'm currently duoing my 51 shaman and 66 ranger (100+ aas) in GE.  I can pull 2 mobs at a time and tank 'em both, but it isn't very mana efficient. =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kargren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yah I tried torment and it does suck. With all the birds casting silence on you you can get and heal or slow spells of for the first 15 seconds of the fight. So instead of there I went to Nadox. 1% every kill to every other but much faster kills then the other places I have tried. <br />
The mobs hit for almost nothing and might have 8-10k hp.</div></div><hr />
