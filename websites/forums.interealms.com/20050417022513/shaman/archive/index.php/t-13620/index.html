<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was pretty happy with the grimlings. Dont hit hard , can handle 2-3 if truly needed , constant pulls , was workign great with my  druid adding on a DS.<br />
<br />
But i dinged 43 and they all seem light blue now , unless i just got a bad set of spawns, but either way they will be light blue soon anyway. So where is next? Is there another place of this sorta design? Many pulls but not too many and that doesnt really run out ?<br />
<br />
Thnx</div></div><hr />

Right after you zone in, invis up and get by the mobs in the &quot;passage&quot;.  Those sometimes come in pairs.  Once out in the open area, you might have to fight one without your pet, but you can pretty much single pull in the big open area all you want.  <br />
<br />
If there aren't enough of those, the passage between the buildings on the right has one single pullable outside one of the buildings and if you stay in themiddle of the passage you won't aggro anything in the buildings.  At 48 my enchanter was able to single pull from the buildings using slow.  I hear shaman can too, but I don't know at what level.    Further down that passage hang a right and go up against the stone wall.  No mobs wander there(though they do close by) and if you dont allow runners you shouldn't get adds.</div></div><hr />
