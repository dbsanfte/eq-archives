<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">People have never done caller quest a great deal (bit mystifying as pre PoP it was one of the better exp spots for a balanced group) as such the Fungus Vest isn't terribly common. Also it's not a click effect as implied in Seredith's post but a constant worn effect.<br />
<br />
Incidentally it shows as black chain on a barb instead of the banded look.</div></div><hr />

Get an Ikky Regen BP if you're looking for that.... personally, by the time you are able to do the caller cycle for it, it's use is diminished. I'd rather have HP over regrowth. (I use replenishment and have all 3 regen aa's, so I'm not hurting for regen).</div></div><hr />
