<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know this might sound silly to some, but what would you all think about releasing a server that starts out with only EQ classic content enabled, with a new expansion enabled on the server every oh, say, 2 or 3 months (or whatever time Sony deems appropriate), in the order they were released (Kunark, Velious, then Luclin, etc.)<br />
<br />
I would enjoy it, though I'm not sure it would have enough of an appeal to other people to have enough signups to be worth launching.  Still, it's a neat, novel idea I came up with while I was half asleep at work today.<br />
<br />
I would love to see some new players go through the evolution of the game, and have people re-encounter Vox, Naggy, Karnor's, and some other areas of the game.  They could even Re-Enact some of the GM events we had prior to the launchings of some of the earlier expansions. Not sure how many people share my mindset enough to enjoy such a server, though :)</div></div><hr />

If you look back at this post I mentioned almost the exact same thing.  It would be a nifty idea, and it is amazing to watch the evolution of a server in action.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This idea has been mentioned so many times on many different boards, except there are a load of poeple that think it wouldn't work, and secondly SoE don't seem to want to do it, then again their innovation does only extend to increasing the hits of mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think they should do it, if only for the devs and make them play it.  That way they can watch as the some classes gain incredible amounts of power and then lose them the next expansion or two,and would give them a chance to play some characters beyond level 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ack, I'm sorry, I didn't know it had been mentioned.  Honestly thought it would have such little appeal to people, but I was just thinkin about it the other day and thought &quot;Hey, bet nobody's thought of that before!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bah &gt;:( my bad</div></div><hr />
