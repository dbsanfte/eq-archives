How come the other classes are getting new spells that are applicable to new and old content AND is an upgrade from previous spells, but we get a slow which is designed around the new content while being a downgrade in our contribution to the game?  Not only is the spell slowing less, it's aggroing more, and it has a duration of Crap + 1.  The only positive thing about it is the -40 resist adjust.  Hi, retards, just put that resist adjust on a clone of Turgurs?  And remove the recast time.<br />
<br />
Also, new disease dot?  No thanks?  2.1 minute duration?  Let me see if I understand this.  Our new slow only lasts 1.5 mins.  Our new dot lasts 2.1 mins.  So mobs are either going to die fast, as usual, making a long duration dot pretty useless, or mobs will die very slowly, and we're going to have to waste even more mana by reslowing, or trying to apply Turgur's Insects.  I don't know about you, but I am sick of spells with short durations (/finger Ferine Avatar), and I don't have room to keep up another spell FULL TIME.<br />
<br />
60% slow is a slap in the face.  I don't see the other classes getting spells that are poorer in performance but with a resist adjust.  So this just makes everyone else even better yet again versus Shamans.<br />
<br />
Welcome to Gates of Discord.  Shamans here are your new spells.  They're not a potent as your old spells, but they'll get the job done just fine!  Now I know what you're thinking, everyone else got shiny new spells that do more than what they could do before, but please, don't forget to buy Lords of EverQuest, you'll get 10% off of Gates of Discord for your new twink characters that you are SURE to start up immediately!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now that's a sure fire way to get things done, a fine compliment such as you have written.<br />
<br />
<br />
60% slow is a slap in the face. <br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously? Did it leave finger marks? I'm just wondering because it seems that a lot of you get slapped in the face and I've been slapped before. I haven't yet felt that similar feeling from any of these GoD spells. Does that mean I don't know my class?<br />
<br />
My point here is that we can sit and wonder all day why we don't hear from the developers. Would any of you in a similar position come into this kind of area and post unless you were made to? I doubt it.</div></div><hr />

I'm quietly waiting until GoD is released to form my final opinion, but the first time I see this message in a group with a Beastlord will be the day I seriously consider retiring a shaman I've played since Nov. 99'...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Khang Runningwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Am I the only one not threatened by other classes slows?<br />
I never have trouble getting a group, and everyone I know will pick a shaman to slow before anyone else, we have the best slow, and people want it on the mobs they are fighting. I was in a group with an enc and a beastlord, the enc immediately deferred to me for slow, when the BST asked if he could do it, the entire group shot him down right away.<br />
Same goes for raids, would you rather have the council of the 12 BST slowed or SHM? I'm guessing SHM, since its the job of our guild shaman's to keep them slowed and crippled, same with every mob we encounter in raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Am I the only one not threatened by other classes slows?<br />
<br />
Don't worry, you are not alone :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Its negative resist, its quick casting, I don't think its necessary to complain, I see this slow as (1) a very good prelimary slow (2) a very good Ldon slow, especially normal when mobs last 30 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">In all honesty this is old news, but it is still a cause for concern, due to the fact that it is still not taken out from test.<br />
All they did is take the BL slow spell, subtracted 5% of its effectiveness, and added a 10% resist modifier.  So .........<br />
<br />
-WIll this make us more wanted in groups = most likely not<br />
-Will this make us a more effective slower = not at only a 60% slow we wouldnt be<br />
-Will this make our class easier to play = no way.  I am certianly not going to cast 2 slows on a mob that will die a few seconds after i get done slowing it a couple of times.<br />
 (I cant believe how some of you people are saying this is great for an initial slow before you cast the real slow on the mob.)  Wouldnt it be easier just to spend the time to malos it instead, wouldnt ya think ?<br />
-Will this help our class overall = I cant see how.  <br />
<br />
 I am still trying to determine in what situation this spell would actually be effective.  If there are a bunch of mobs in camp, Tigirs would be more effective.  If a Hard mob needs to be slowed fast, we would most certianly die right away, (not to mention, it would be most likely need to be malosed/tashed anyhow) and then it would need to be Tugured then anyways.<br />
<br />
Let me ask all of you something, if you all have the Time's Antithesis,  would you even consider acquiring this spell ?      I know i wouldnt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, having a TA (or root click item) would make me more inclined to get this spell.  Currently, I don't know where the hell I'm going to put this damn spell.  There certainly isn't room for it on my normal spell lineup.<br />
<br />
I can see uses for this spell...but I have no way to mem it without dropping some other function, such as resist debuffing, FA, healing, slowing, canni, root, or bane/velium strike.<br />
<br />
More spell slots, more buff slots, ****ers!<br />

the biggest problem I have with all the other class slows is the stackablity part, shaman already dont stack with shaman, its really lame that we are now having (limited but still) stackability with other classes.</div></div><hr />

There isn't much AA-wise.  Have you seen all the content of the expansion?  Unless you're in beta, and are breaking the NDA, you haven't.  We're not just paying for a few exorbitantly priced AAs here.<br />

yes, in fact i've played my beastlord and shaman in the same group vs the same mobs (in earth) and I can tell you, that they do not have an easier time slowing.  In fact, i was cursing up and down every slow bounce cause there was no way to debuffing the mob so that slow would be easier to land (both are on the same accounts).  They def do not have a resist modifier.<br />

so you can finally stop bitching that our everyone elses slows have a resist modifier on it and land easier, and also so thatyou can stop bitching that slow isn't on the mob till 80% and by the time you are ready to do dmg the mob is dead... that's why.</div></div><hr />

I would really love to see some conclusive tests to finish that annoying discussion once and for all. Hey, maybe i get of my lazy rear and do them myself  ;) . As i group with a beastlord buddie sometimes, maybe i can get him to call his resists or make a log and compare it to my slowing efforts /shrug.<br />
<br />
The complaining about the new slow is hilarious (and was done in a few other threads already ...). SoE seems to view our old slow as overpowered or game-unbalancing (see mitigation, see the non-existant updates for 5 expansions). Whoever thought we were getting a substantial slow upgrade without any disadvantages to counter them and keep them at the same 'power level' as Turgurs was smoking some pretty good stuff.<br />
<br />
Loramin,<br />
<br />
as far as i know the pet AA was changed from a 'buffer AA' to an AA usable for pet classes themselves to help their own pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Another thing to bear in mind with the new slow is, allthough it is fast and has a resist adjust, it will probably also be a major agro magnet, so I'm not so sure that it is going to be used much as a preslow, except when someone has been assigned kamikazi duty ;).<br />
<br />
The main applications that I can see are (1) on those mobs with insane MR; (2) to save your ass when regular slow bounces on a particularly unpleasant mob (basically an &quot;oh ****&quot; spell :) ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>EeyonRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">looks like a pretty sweet spell for grouping if you ask me. less resist is more time and more mana, which equals more damage. also, with the relatively slow refresh time on turgur's, it'll be awfully nice to have a backup that you don't have to wait for when trying to do multiple mobs at the same time, because tigir's is a horrible spell. not really sure why anyone would complain about getting a new utility, especially before even trying it out.<br />
<br />
by the way, i've been looking forward to the new shaman aa's, because a lot of them increase shaman damage, and that'll be great for adventures. bane with focus items and critical affliction will be pretty nice damage, and anything that makes your pet do more damage is good, because it helps us in the one area we suck, which is short duration damage. the pet buff thing doesn't sound bad to me either. everyone uses mage weapons these days, and casting a group speed would increase your wolfpack damage quite a bit too i suppose. <br />
<br />
bottom line is this though. you should always at least try things out before you start whining about them, because its really hard to tell just how practical something is until you actually use it. i'm pretty sure i'll like a lot of this new stuff though, and i don't really concern myself with what other classes have or are getting, because i don't play those classes and don't particularly care.</div></div><hr />

warrior:  /g Mod Inc<br />
me: /cast 4  /cast 4  /cast 4  '&quot;you beging to cast malos&quot; ( neg 55 mod )<br />
warr: mob in camp /autoattack<br />
me: /cast 3  slowed !!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly i dont see this issue of not being able to slow a mob. once in a while in BoT ill have a militis be a pain, but if malos is -55 and this new slow is -40 i dont see how this is going to help that. No to mention yout not debuffing the mob anyway, so you have to cast malos on top of it and now beyond that the mob is slowed significantly lower then a enchanter or even a BST would, its right about where a bard is slowing. So again, whats the point of this?<br />
<br />
If i was casting malos purely for myself then i would be forced to agree, but im not, im am debuffing the mob so that procs land, nukes land ,mezzes land, roots land and pretty much anything lands better, thats the point of the malox line. to help everyone, not just me.<br />
<br />
I take it back, im not warming up to this slow lol</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">This is pretty much an emergency and special situation spell.  On raids a bard HoSing and a beastlord slowing incoming mobs will negate any usefulness of this spell.  Slowing raid targets isn't an issue, though it *might* help with high MR mobs like MM and Warlord Gintolaken (I doubt Warlord could be slowed with just an extra -40 adjust).<br />
<br />
If they wanted to make it useful, they could increase it to 70% so it would overwrite beastlord slows and not be a waste of mana.  Enchanters don't usually slow on raids (they get enough aggro from tash and mez), so it won't be an issue.</div></div><hr />

We could go back to every post on this forum that has talked about how with mitigation, our slows are &quot;NOT THAT MUCH BETTER&quot; than a beastlords or chanters.  So, with mitigation, I guess that means that this slow is &quot;not that much worse&quot; than a beastlord or chanters, but has a lot better chance of landing.<br />
<br />
personally, the only thing slowing me down alot is waiting for malos to refresh while there are multiple mobs in camp.  TA lets me slow quick, but I still have to wait for malos to refresh to bring down the mr a bit before I recast.  I think that putting this in my old slow spot, I can cast malos on a mob, slow it with TA, then cast Nihil on the second mob, and then assuming that I don't get any resists, if there's a third one use malos on the third one then slow again with TA.  Hey, I like this concept.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">If this Slow is so good why not lower the slow rate to 30 percent and increase the resist modifier to -80 and cast time to 1 sec and duration to 45 seconds.   It would realy rock then!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Quiinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">There is a reason its only 60%.  Its so it wont overwrite a better slow.  This is a raid spell only.  Get the bonus resist modifier to get it landed on raid level mobs which then gives you 42 seconds (or so) to get malos and a better slow landed.  If this was a 70% slow, can you imagine the gripes on the forums when a Chanter or BL slow was overwritten then allowed to expire 42 seconds later.  <br />
<br />
Well, since my guess is that this spell will be purchased with Adventure points in a fashion similar to LDoN, I think I can comfortably say that I won't be scribing it anytime in 2004.  At least not in its current form.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">These are the only uses I can figure out (all of them are highly situational for most of us):<br />
<br />
1. You have Time's Antithesis and want a back up slow spell.<br />
<br />
Advantages: Resist modifier and fast cast time make it superior to turgurs when something is resisting.<br />
<br />
Disadvantages: The slow is lesser and is only 1.5 seconds faster than clicking the TA.  It only lasts 1.5 minutes, if you are slowing multiple mobs you will end up clicking the TA to overwrite the spell or casting the new slow again.<br />
<br />
Overall: Situational at best, and probably not worth the spell gem.<br />
<br />
2. You are on a raid and want to slow things that are highly resistant.<br />
<br />
Advantages: -40 resist mod above and beyond any other debuffing already on the MOB (tash/malxxx/OOS/etc).<br />
<br />
Disadvantages: It's still only a &quot;pre-slow&quot; and you'll still be chaining Turgurs (most likely) for the extra slow.  It only lasts 1.5 minutes.<br />
<br />
Overall: Probably the ONLY real use of the spell, and it might make things a little more smooth for slowing.<br />
<br />
3. You are in a group and slowing after applying malos is usually not worth the mana.<br />
<br />
Advantages: Resist mod makes it unlikely (but still possible) mobs will resist the slow.  Mana saved on malos (not to mention time).  Quick cast time allows us to canni4 once extra (unless you raid and got chaotic pain, but I'll leave that ripoff of a spell for other threads).<br />
<br />
Disadvantages: (hello, multiple resists on certain things even after the -55 on malos!).  Multiple mobs in camp means you either have another slow up anyway (or you have a TA, and that is discussed above).<br />
<br />
Overall: This is the weakest application of the spell.  Group with a 65 beastlord and you WILL see &quot;Your (worthless slow spell) will not take hold&quot; eventually.<br />
<br />
The thing that really bothers me: the 65 beastlord slow would STILL overwrite this even if it slowed 65% (theirs has the 3 minute superior  duration).  Why is our 65 &quot;upgrade&quot; spell a lesser duration and % slowed than our level 51 spell we got several years ago?  It would be like giving a cleric a new heal at 65 that heals for less than superior heal but casts almost instantly (but has a 6 second refresh time).  Sure it has a use, but do we honestly want it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">In Ldon normal adventures I would guess most people don't malos in fact that was a poll that actually suggested and proved this. The quick casting slow is very useful for that, cast slow and most likely it will take hold. This is a super spell in my opinion.<br />
My criticism is this, because mobs in normal adventures last so short, most people do not bother with debuff however it is almost crucial for our dots to land or get the best use of our dds. So its a kinda catch-22 in a way. Bane with -resist would be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I can see this spell being usefull, but as a lvl 65 spell I am unsure. Being in a fast paced group that takes down mobs faster then your dot can last, or a slow bounces and the mob is at 40-50% health before slow takes. 1.5 minutes and 1.5 casting time with reduced mana can be nice. But goodness we only have so many spell slots. I can see this being nice for maybe a lvl 60... oh well, I don't have to buy god</div></div><hr />

TA lets me slow quick, but I still have to wait for malos to refresh to bring down the mr a bit before I recast.  I think that putting this in my old slow spot, I can cast malos on a mob, slow it with TA, then cast Nihil on the second mob, and then assuming that I don't get any resists, if there's a third one use malos on the third one then slow again with TA.  Hey, I like this concept.<br />
<br />
Why not just mem malo as well as malos? With the instant refresh on the TA, you'd end up getting the mobs slowed, AND debuffed. <br />
<br />
The 1.5 sec cast time on nihil is nice for the 99.9% of us that haven't got a TA though. If Sony really wanted to sell GoD they'd give us an AA for an extra spell slot, so we had room to mem it.</div></div><hr />

Then we did phase 1 in potime. I thought we'd be numero uno cause we can nuke, heal, slow debuff.. but guess what learned quick that 1 shaman / trial is more than enough. <br />
<br />
Once I malos and slow the mob (takes about 30 seconds for all of them) I can either patch heal with does almost nothing unless it crits, but it's decent.. then everything is under control, I go to do some dps.. bane, forget about it it resists MUCH too MUCH.. (never landed it with full debuffs hos, tash, malosinia (no sk debuffs) but please..) so I can land bane and I can nuke using velium strike.. I nuke woot lots of crits for 1850.. while the druid next to me is healing better and his regular uncrit nuke is.. 1500.. 350 more damage that is just ASS.

I have to disagree, i think this is a exp group slow, cause in a raid the mob is going to be tashed and malos and slows starting to hit it very fast. That being said, there is a way around making it not overwrite a better slow... make it a better slow :D<br />
<br />
I would only mem this in a exp group is it was a 2 min slow with a 75% reduction.<br />
<br />
 We could go back to every post on this forum that has talked about how with mitigation, our slows are &quot;NOT THAT MUCH BETTER&quot; than a beastlords or chanters. <br />
<br />
First off, not every single mob mitigates slow. Secondly, you state that under mitigation, all the slows are pretty close, but this slow is even lower then a BST or a Enchanter. Im sorry, but when you start parsing things about and ignore the % number looking the same, there is a noticable different in the slows. This is slow that should be replacing Turg for groups, cause as i said above, i dont see its effectivness in a raid. I have more aggro problems from landing my slows in PoP then i have with bouncing them.</div></div><hr />

It can not therefore is yeat another situational slow.<br />
<br />
How often do you use Grummus on a daily basis?<br />
Enough said right there.<br />
The times we would use this on raids are almost identical to the times we would use Grummus and Grummus is 14 minutes.<br />
It would be very limited use and not easy to keep up on a boss without gaining aggro from the 24 disease counters every 1.5 min.<br />
It is simply going to be overwritten on any yard trash.<br />
<br />
There just simply are not enough spell slots to warrent having this memmed unless either a) It can replace Turgur b) They give us more spell slots c) It becomes an aa slow.<br />
<br />
It would not replace Malos in our line up.<br />
The times we need to Malos we need to Malos for the group or raid not just ourselves for slow.<br />
<br />
Considering its 8 more counters than Turgur its going to be more aggro.<br />
<br />
Its only real use is a preslow in exp groups....<br />
Ok so take a LDoN hard then...<br />
Preslow Malos Turgur<br />
I just cant see a point of it taking up a spell gem.<br />
Malos doesnt just benefit slows.<br />
LDoN normal slow just isnt all that critical.<br />
Most of the places you would use this in exp groups you will likely Malos anyway.<br />
<br />
Just another situational slow the way it stands.<br />
You can argue it any way you want no matter what way you put it it can not replace Turgur. It will have its uses yes.<br />
But it is going to be another spell gem.<br />
<br />
I for one really would rather have a real upgrade for Turgur not something I will have to mem alongside it when I dont have the spell slots now.</div></div><hr />

From lucy, grummus duration: 3.1 mins @L61 to 3.3 mins @L65<br />
<br />
Also.  I would not use this where I would use grummus.  When I'm using grum, it means the mob is 95% or 100% MR.  HoS, tash, and malos/sinia are plenty if it's at all magic hittable.</div></div><hr />

It is going to be about 30 counters vs 16 counters for the same duration.<br />
Basically close to doubling your aggro over Grummus.<br />

Yep those are the mobs you would try this slow on the ones you cant get Turgur on :)<br />
Not saying that neg 40 is going to help but its the same class of mobs.<br />
If you can land Turgur your going to. If you cant your going to Grummus.<br />
<br />
Where exactly is this going to fit in? Neg 40 isnt going to fill a very big gap in between the 2 on a heck of a lot of mobs.</div></div><hr />

Valsuvious,<br />
<br />
that list is about two months old.  Don't believe everything that you see.<br />
<br />
Actually as the author if that article I can assure you that it was the list as seen on Beta as of Jan 23 (when the article was posted).  So no, its not two months old.  And since that time the only changes have been:<br />
<br />
Lost both the pet AAs (Ancient Fury and Rabid Companion)<br />
<br />
Gained Fury of Magic Mastery (yay, more crits on our severly underpowered nuke) and Spell Casting Subtlety (no complaints here, we've been asking for it and now we finally got it).<br />
<br />
So while having SCS added is nice, its an AA from a previous expansion, not really anything new. Thus I contintue to affirm that &quot;We get ass for AAs&quot; in GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Yeah loramin, check back under the thread that I made the day that the changes were into affect.  They also added the Quickened Curing AA too. <br />
<br />
Click me (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19351) <br />
<br />
On top of that, they also changed the pet AAs, as well made Call of the Ancients a regen heal now, instead of a endurance regen.  They never added Consumption or Spirit Speed or the other AAs that escape me.  My whole point in pointing out that the list is old, is cause things change every day and will continue to till release.  I've seen our AAs posted on about five different sites now, and every list has been old.  So, until Feb 10th, I wouldn't hold too much into any list that you see.<br />
<br />
Litgrov, man, I don't think that you understand my position on shaman.  I love the shaman class.  I'm not saying that there aren't things that we could improve on, and I agree with most of the changes that have been proposed.  What I've been saying is, that we do get some neat new abilities, and that the world is not coming to an end just because some of you aren't happy with what we are getting.  I've been pointing out that we need to stop getting upset over every little thing that goes on.  Learn to maximize our abilities.  Sure, we aren't the best doters or nukers, but I'll be damned if someone doesn't say that I don't try to bring the dps each and every pull.  We aren't the best healers, but we will still save people in battle.  We are the best curers, since we can cure everything with our variety of spells, and it's pretty cost efficient (there is a reason why they keep me in the cleric group for Bert and Quarm, I can cure everything that's AEd and I can keep the group alive easily too).  <br />
<br />
Now, how do I feel about our slows.  I love them.  I do honestly think that our slows are still alot better than theirs, even when mitigated (as I'm told by the clerics, they can still tell a difference).  When I stated that our mitigated slow is not that much better, I said it while making a point that OTHER posters have stated this to be true several times, in a billion threads, and I used it to justify the reason why when you said our new slow is SIGNIFICANTLY worse than beastlords and chanters its just not true.  <br />
<br />
Okay, on to Khozik and phase 1 of time.  Just realize man that not every trial is the same.  Take the earth trial.  You can literally average 700 dps in that trial if you really tried to.  Some of the waves of undead are the same.  Any trial that has mobs that won't be mezzed are a huge bonus for us.  There are some of them that don't like our cold nuke very well (water especially i end up removing that spell for the trial).  Get yourself a nuke focus, and your nukes will become alot stronger (I had a 2349 crit today).  Use bane on the mob, throw on a rain, and then hit him with a DD while the waves are going through.  We can do dmg on it, you just have to push yourself a bit (and, well, that is what all the Time fights are about basically.. the only time I almost do no dmg on a mob is in phase 3, and that's cause there is literally a mob coming into camp every 4 secs).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Arctarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Wizards constanytly nukes for average 3K, while you crit for 2/3 K every 15 nukes, and that makes you happy?<br />
I don't want wizard nukes, it's their ability (they had to fighr hard about it during velious).<br />
I don't want mana regen, it's chanters ability.<br />
I don't want complete heal, it's a cleric-specific.<br />
<br />
Why don't we have a true and decisive ability like this?<br />
<br />
Slow isn't anymore, because of mitigation. And beside slow what can we do?<br />
<br />
I agree this slow has to go, this is clearly an exp group spell to use against MR mobs such as elemental or hard LDON mobs, for a lower effect than tugur, that a BST will overwrite within a minute.<br />
<br />
I dont know wether or not BST have less resist on slow, but their cast time being 2 sec and their slow almost as good as us considering pure %, i don't see myself using the 60% slow during exp groups to see it overwritten by BST a second later, this is totally ridiculous.<br />
<br />
I don't want slow i have the best of the game already, but it's not far ahead of others classes.<br />
<br />
Shaman need something else, something that stacks on raid, something thats very useful in group.<br />
<br />
Maybe when all the blind sheeps on this board will realize how bad we need a fix, Sony will, maybe, listen to us, or come up with something new and innovative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">You know, I don't like this slow very much, but I think it will have its uses when multiple shaman are on a raid.  I usually raid with at least one other shaman, and when we encounter a big nasty, my usual spell progression is:<br />
<br />
Malicious Decay, Cloud of Grummus, Turgur (or Malos first if no one else did it), Cloud, Turgur, etc.<br />
<br />
Others might do Malos, Turgur, Tigir, Turgur, whatever.<br />
<br />
I think adding this -40 resist slow into the mix might increase our chances of slowing the mobs early.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Okay, so -40 to MR resist check is not exactly a &quot;Lure&quot; level slow, but that is the concept.<br />
<br />
How can this not be fantastic for the shaman class?<br />
<br />
We have complained about no longer having a noticable &quot;edge&quot; over the other slow casting classes. This spell should help to restore that edge.<br />
<br />
Consider that GoD will likely have mobs that are very high MR. Consider that BSTs have no way to lower a mobs MR themselves. Shamans have Malos and now Balance of the Nihil. That allows us to effectively reduce a mobs MR by NINETY FIVE to land a 60% slow. Aganist the same mob, the BST will be getting resist, resist, resist ....<br />
<br />
I think this spell will go a long way toward helping us recover our dominance in the slowing department. Against mobs with VERY high MR, we can pull out Balance of the Nihil or Cloud of Grummus. We may end up as the ONLY class that can effectively slow in the GoD high MR environment.<br />
<br />
Consider that forcing us to use Balance of the Nihil against GoD may be a new alternative to making mobs mitigate slow. Instead of mitigation, we just have to use a 60% slow. Instead of making mobs mitigate 75% slow down to 60%, we just have to use a 60% slow to effectively land it in a reasonable amount of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Tragik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I don't like this slow at all.  The -40 adjust to MR is nice, but coming in a full 15% less effective than a level 51 spell and being 5% inferior to a 65 beastlord's spell (granted that has no neg adjust) is a hit on the ego no matter how you look at it.<br />
<br />
When PoP was released, many of the new spells for other classes, including shaman, had a single new feature to them.  An innate negative adjust to MR of ~20.  For us, the best example is the two new root spells, Petrifying Earth and Greater Immobolize.<br />
<br />
At first I kinda did - sorta thought I'd look forward to a 60% slow with a fast cast and -40 adjust for things like LDoN groups where a quick &quot;lure&quot; slow would be better than wasting time with malosinia then Turgur's (mob would be at 40% health at best by then).<br />
<br />
In reality, they should have made a carbon copy of Turgur's with a -20 adjust on MR.  Not overpowered, perfect for exp groups while allowing the shaman to remove that malo(s) spell from his/her lineup for more dotting, nuking, what-have-you.  A -20 adjust would be perfect for turning the tide against average exp mobs all the way to elemental yard trash while not being overpowered for the boss where full debuffing is still warranted.  If you want an example of how well this would work just look at how much better our roots are or the new SK/Necro snares perform (which have a -20 also).<br />
<br />
A bonus would be that this would be a level 65 spell.  If I remember correctly VI once stated that a resist check is made against the mob's level vs. caster level, MR and the spell level.  Don't have anyway of verifying if this was/is still true, but if so than an increased spell level can't hurt.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that's my take on it.  I think the shaman class is pretty solid, otherwise I would have never taken the time to level mine in addition to my necro (not 2 box, same account), but some of the changes/lack of improvements have left something of a bad taste in my mouth.<br />

<br />
The issue I see is, in xp groups or raids, people will want you to use your best slow, regardless if it's a mob that's only going to last 50 seconds or a cleric CH team can adjust in a large scale fight.<br />
<br />
People say use it as a pre-slow.  So assign one shaman in guild to cast Balance once, just to get overriden by Turgur's in quick fashion?  I don't see the point of it.  Besides, if normal slow can land anyway, even with extra effort involved, it's best to just have shamans cast Turgurs.  <br />

I see this spell as having limitied use as Grummus does, even in GoD.</div></div><hr />

hi, wizards never use lures when not forced to, which is very rare outside of kunark and velious.<br />

No it isn't the concept.  The concept is mobs are harder to slow in GoD.  So we get a friggin gimped slow because Sony doesn't know **** about Shamans, and everyone else gets IMPROVED spells which are applicable to OLD CONTENT.<br />
<br />
If Sony treated the other classes like they treat us, the other new spells would be doing EVEN LESS THAN THEY DO NOW.  Just like OURS.<br />

<br />
If you think mobs in GoD will be harder to slow and this Slow will be required to slow mobs, you are really ****ing dumb.<br />
<br />
In the past years Sony has tried to spread out the ability to slow, in order to make more readily available for groups. What the **** makes you think that they are going to have only Shamans reliably slowing in GoD?! Do you really, even for a second, think that they will make Bard, Beastlord and Enchanter Slows almost ineffective?<br />
<br />
Learn the ****ing game. Use your brain or shut the **** up.<br />
<br />
This spell will be a situational Slow. Convenient, yes, but NEVER necessary.<br />
<br />
For this very reason upping the resist modifier to -70+ wouldn't have changed a ****ing thing. And it would have been a great spell(drop the cast time to 1 second, though)<br />
<br />
Edit: For the love of god(not the expansion), stop bull****ting people with a 700 dps figure. Under no circumstance will any Shaman reach 700 dps in a fight with GoD. ****ing hell.<br />
<br />
Another hint. Parse your fights and whenever you feel your DPS is crazy high, check your logs. You need to realize that you are fooling yourself. And just like you fool yourself about DPS, you fool yourself about healing and the overal things you actually bring to a group/raid in a post-trivial environment.<br />
Whenever you feel like your DPS is 300, in reality it's more like 120 over the course of the whole fight.</div></div><hr />

Consider that GoD will likely have mobs that are very high MR. Consider that BSTs have no way to lower a mobs MR themselves. Shamans have Malos and now Balance of the Nihil. That allows us to effectively reduce a mobs MR by NINETY FIVE to land a 60% slow. Aganist the same mob, the BST will be getting resist, resist, resist ....<br />

ok do you know how long it takes to cast those spells ? by the time you do all of that .. the tank is either 1. dead, 2. 30% hp's<br />
and i guess you didn't know a journeyman's walking stick is useable by bst's too huh ?<br />
am i the only person who see's this ? malos + malosinia + 60% slow (crap) + turgurs = waste of my mana for a multiple pull situation.<br />
seriously on a 3 pull in ldon hard, im using VP 3 and /pet attack /cast root more than casting malos and trying to slow them all, having mobs that mitigate KILL MY MANA POOL. i hit 4178 mana today, i got 2 more flags, i can't keep up with the damage output, crowd control is the only way, and even then sooner or later root wears off , or my dog gets eaten.<br />
im just bringing groups down by trying to do hard missions, im not gunna ask my grp to cater to my class, because they wont.<br />
so, i just do my normal ldon's and such and keep saving my plat and maybe, just maybe i can buy those damn ldon hard boots and bracer.<br />
because i know for damn sure i can't get it in a group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes it does literally mean &quot;nothing&quot; or &quot;non-existant&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>EeyonRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">The reason that shamans don't continually get upgrades to their best spells is that we are an alteration class that was originally designed for a 50 level game. You can only make a slow so good before you've just broken things and have to add slow immunity flags and slow mitigation in order to keep guilds from steamrolling everything in sight with ease.<br />
<br />
I get really really really tired of all this grass is greener on the other side talk that constantly goes on in all class forums. Just stop and think for a minute about some of the things you guys are saying with regards to other classes and their spell upgrades.<br />
<br />
Would you rather have level restrictions on every single one of your spells like enchanters do?<br />
<br />
Would you rather have mind wrack and some more pet damage in place of quiessence and turgur's, but yet keep essentially have the same damage spells like necromancers do?<br />
<br />
Would you rather be strictly a damage caster that can't hold a candle to the damage of a well equipped melee class for longer than 10 minutes like mages and wizards?<br />
<br />
Would you trade in your haste and slow spells for ANYTHING a lowly druid has to offer? I wouldn't.<br />
<br />
If you're going to compare classes, you really have to do it one at a time, look at the total package instead of comparing every aspect of your class to a seperate different class and then getting mad that you're not the best at everything. How many classes even have as many anytime dimensions as a shaman to compare to anyways? NONE.<br />
<br />
Here's a quick play I made to illustrate what different casting classes bring to the table that is always useful. Hopefully everyone finds it useful!<br />
<br />
Cleric: Hi! I cast heals. Bye.<br />
<br />
Wizard: Hi! I cast damage spells. Bye.<br />
<br />
Druid: Hi! I cast second rate heals and damage spells. Bye.<br />
<br />
Necromancer: Hi! I have an annoying floating pet and lots of high agro long duration spells. My mana is better used by you. Bye.<br />
<br />
Mage: HI! I have an annoying floating pet and some direct damage spells. My mana was better used by you, but that got nerfed. Bye.<br />
<br />
Enchanter: Hi! I have the best buffs and I neutralize monsters. If there are no monsters to be neutralized, I make jewelry. Bye.<br />
<br />
Shaman: HI! I have third rate heals and a very efficient heal over time. I also have the best debuffs and second rate haste. Oh yeah, I also have basically the same damage set as necromancers, but I don't use it nearly as much because a lot of times I have better things to do. Bye.<br />

If you think mobs in GoD will be harder to slow and this Slow will be required to slow mobs, you are really ****ing dumb.<br />
<br />
In the past years Sony has tried to spread out the ability to slow, in order to make more readily available for groups. What the **** makes you think that they are going to have only Shamans reliably slowing in GoD?! Do you really, even for a second, think that they will make Bard, Beastlord and Enchanter Slows almost ineffective?<br />
<br />
Learn the ****ing game. Use your brain or shut the **** up.<br />
<br />
This spell will be a situational Slow. Convenient, yes, but NEVER necessary.<br />
<br />
For this very reason upping the resist modifier to -70+ wouldn't have changed a ****ing thing. And it would have been a great spell(drop the cast time to 1 second, though)<br />
<br />
Okay Einstein, in what situation (since the spell is situational!) is this spell gonna be useful to have?  Essentially everything is moderately to incredibly easy to slow after Malos/Tash/HOS.  On raid encounters with mulitple Shamans, Beastlords, Bards, Enchanters, getting something slowed is usually NOT an issue.  A 60% slow isn't going to help there.  In exp groups, you either Malos then Slow, or don't even bother and just hope slow lands, because LDoN Normal's are pretty easy anyways.<br />
<br />
There's only a handful of mobs that this spell will be useful on, and a few raid encounters, which you will probably see &quot;Your Balance of the Nihil spell has worn off&quot; a lot of the time.<br />
<br />
So another disease dot, a negligable upgrade to Quiescence, and this spell.  That ****ing blows.</div></div><hr />

Are you really asking in what situation a -40 Slow will be convenient(keep in mind that I have been lobbying for this same version with a 1 second cast and a -70 resist adjust for as long as this slow is on test)?<br />
<br />
You picked LDoN normals and raids to make a point(that Einstein remark doesn't make you a witty btw), which are the 2 situations were this spell will have very little impact. <br />
However, on LDoN hards, exp groups with mobs that hit for 1 k+ and in solo situations this spell will have a greater impact.<br />
<br />
Imagine catching aggro in the elementals what would you do?<br />
<br />
You have 2 options. The 1st is casting root(or VP) and the 2nd is casting this very Slow, which is more likely to stick than any root or spell we currently have. <br />
Have you ever met root/snare immune mobs?<br />
<br />
And I am not going to go into detail about the convenience when soloing mobs, because that should be more than obvious.<br />
<br />
This spell isn't perfect(read my suggestions above on how to make it a great spell), but it is certainly convenient, as it is fast casting(less likely to be interrupted), low resist(lower than any other spell/form of crowd control we currently have) and effective enough(60% slow) to make a difference between dying and staying alive).<br />
<br />
On a scale of 1-10 this spell gets a 6 from me(would be 9 if they changed it to 1 sec/-70 resist adjust.)<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, this Slow and the Canni are NOT enough of rebalancing by any means, but it has its uses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">You know, they could make very many of us happier by simply raising the slow to 65%.  Seeing beastlord slow overwrite is going to really upset us all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A 65% Slow would still get overwritten by a Beastlord.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LDoN hards and exp groups with 1k hitting mobs?  Why I think I would just Malos them first, benefiting the spell casters of the group, melees and pets with weapon procs, and myself to land a superior slow.  -55mr &gt; -40.<br />
<br />

Cry and call my Mommy to make it all better.<br />

Sounds like a great survival tool for an expansion that has been out for more than a year.  Glad they're giving it to us now!  I can't wait to figure out what spell I'm going to have to give up just so I can keep up two slows.<br />
<br />
And I am not going to go into detail about the convenience when soloing mobs, because that should be more than obvious.<br />
<br />
1.5min duration slow is gonna own for soloing!<br />
<br />

<br />
The only way this spell would be convenient is if it slowed 75%.  Hell, it can keep the 1.5 minute duration.  75% slow, no recast time, and I'll be happy.<br />
<br />
Otherwise this piece of crap is a downgrade, plain and simple.  Our role in the game is to slow mobs.  We should be the best at it, have the easiest time doing it, and not be easily imitated.  60% MR slow is an insult to our class.</div></div><hr />
