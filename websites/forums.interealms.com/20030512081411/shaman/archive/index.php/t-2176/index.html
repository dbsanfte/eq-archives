<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>imel007</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got my faction maxed and ready to turn in Child's Tear, but I am not sure where to pull Rak's Reaver.<br />
<br />
Is it better to:<br />
<br />
1) Pull to right outside the entrance to the locked door.<br />
<br />
2) Pull down to the Courtyard next to the Goo House.<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
3) Just fight him where he spawns.<br />
<br />
Also, how many reavers does Rak's Reaver spawn before Rak spawns, and could a 60 warrior, cleric, 58 shaman kill the reavers and afterwards have a 49 magician pet own it while we heal it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you can pull the reaver far enough, the courtyard is the best place to pull him (option 2).  The long hallways leading to the castle area are good, too.<br />
<br />
As for the group of 3 on the reavers . . . depends.  Probably not.  If your cleric has blessed armor of the risen and also some FT items, it might work.  A single warrior won't be putting out that much damage, so killing a reaver will take a while.  As a shaman, you can't help much--reavers are VERY resistant.  You may also get 2+ reavers on the pull.<br />
<br />
As for the number of reavers, I can't be a lot of help there.  I honestly can't remember if that particular reaver spawn pops more reavers, or if it automatically pops Rak.  For some reason, I thought it popped Rak.  For the ones that spawn other reavers, it's random.  I've seen Ghiosk pop after one reaver and also pop after about 9.<br />
<br />
I don't know if a 49 pet can take Rak with only a shaman and a single cleric healing it.  58 pet maybe.  Best to get another cleric and another pet. :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can fight him anywhere you can (1) keep him from going into the water, (2) can control or eliminate adds/repops, and (3) keep him very close to where he spawned when the reaver died, or he'll gate.<br />
<br />
We had 3 high level fire pets, and it still took a goodly while to take him down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">3 fire pets took a while?  Ive always been told that two 49 fire pets well buffed and hasted can kill him in about 6 minutes.<br />
<br />
As to location, make sure you attack him either at his spawn point or very close.  Dont pull him away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">someone posted on the &quot;old&quot; crucible that the 49 firepet was preferable to the higher level firepets.  The story was that the 49 were better able to hold aggro, so the healers did not draw aggro away from the pets.<br />
<br />
I have not kept up with pet changes for mages, so I do not know if that is still an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't know if Rak is immune to fire damage or not, but he will be a very very red con to any pet, thus their spells are practically worthless.  Rak is killed mainly by the fire pet damage shield and partially by their mediocre melee output.  Their casting does about 0-1% of the damage.  That being said, you don't want them to cast.  The level 50+ mage pets all cast a lot more than the level 49 ones, which is why you use level 49 pets.  We used two pets to kill rak for my epic two weeks ago, and it took about 8 minutes or so.  I had heard beforehand that two pets takes about half an hour to kill him, but this is ABSOLUTELY WRONG and NOT EVEN CLOSE.<br />
<br />
As for positioning:  Rak was already popped when we got to CoM, so there wasn't much we could do about where we fought him.  As you open the locked door of the castle and look into that room, rak was centered against the back wall, facing out... taunting me.  Our idea was to park the pets next to rak and have the mages and cleric (we just had one) stationed outside, and heal through the door.  This was a very very bad idea.  When I turned in the tear, rak didn't AE immediately like I expected him too.  He stood there and beat on me for probably a good minute before his AE went off.  Be ready for this.  Once it went off I keeled over and died and repopped out on the bridge (where I bound myself).  With my dying breath, I saw the mage fire pets attack rak!  Everything was going by the book.  I ran up to the door and started healing pets through it (assisted the mages to get target).  Then, we started getting the &quot;you cannot see your target&quot; error message.  I didn't know what to do at first, but I quickly realized that we had to go in.  The rogue opened the door and I charged in.  As I expected, rak had been pushed into a corner.  I ran to the opposite corner and started healing pets.  Rak's life was dropping fast and everyone was fine on mana.  A pet died, a mage resummoned another, yada yada yada.  Eventually I was running low on mana and the cleric had to come in the room to help heal.  The cleric was sort of clueless about the whole deal and stood frighteningly close to rak.  If the room were labelled like a clock, the cleric stood at 6 o'clock, while rak was pushed into the 7:30 corner.  I thought the cleric was going to die and lose the raid for us, but surprisingly she didnt get hit at that range.  It appears to be a very very small AE.  When he was at about 20%, some melees charged in and started beating on him to finish him off.<br />
<br />
So, in hindsight, the best place to fight him is probably in the little room where i fought him.  He can't fall into the water, and if you clear the place beforehand, you won't get adds.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions or I wasn't clear on something, just ask.  I'm very very tired, and as you can see, my writing and thoughts are a bit jumbled.  It's very very scary to go in to your epic fight not knowing what to expect, so I'll do anything I can to help you out.<br />
<br />
Just to clarify, these are the things I did not know going in to the fight that are not documented ANYWHERE that I have found:<br />
-2 level 49 pets = ~8 minutes to kill rak<br />
-one cleric and one shaman with KEI = more than enough healing output<br />
- AE radius is very small, and is not procced often.</div></div><hr />
