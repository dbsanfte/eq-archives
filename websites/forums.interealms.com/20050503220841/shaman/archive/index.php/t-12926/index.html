<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brettation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I wish that they would hurry up and already change the partical effects. Before, I heard that they were changing the darkness and rot line of spells, I figured it was not gonna be all that great. Now after seeing the rot line and swarm druid type spells, I was like hellll ya.<br />
<br />
<br />
*Now, They need to make the &quot;flies&quot; on the swarm type spells to keep swarming the mob till the spell effect wears off.<br />
<br />
*Rot needs to have a &quot;dark Emmision&quot; thats not very large, to foam out from the mouth of the mob thats rotted till the spell effects wear off<br />
<br />
*When a PC or NPC is healed, I neets to paulse blue unevenly and fade out, same with Heal over times but the uneven blue pulse stays till the effect wears off.<br />
<br />
*The shock line of spells needs to have more of a *break of the sound barrier* sound after the spell casting time is complete, and a red circular aura around the whole mob freezes for about 2 seconds, then fades off.<br />
<br />
*Now the controversal one, When shield spell is cast I wish it was the 3 colors and not just the orange and green ugly balls that come out of the hands. After the spell is cast, I wish that there would be a VERY light haze of the shield around the body, if this is a buff such as strenght ect. *it would be light blue* if it was a buff such as a talisman, shield of the arch mage ect. *light green aura* for as long as the buff last NOW, when buffs are stacked such as sow and talisman ect. the aura would be an alternating color switching from green to blue, very very light, so it would not get on anyones nerves, and there would be a seperate option button for the PC to turn off that specific feature.<br />
<br />
*Posion line of spells would be the same as rot I would just not like to see balls of green shoot up from the ground. I would like to see green *slime* drip from the hands then after the spell is cast the mob would foam green and every once in a while drip.<br />
<br />
<br />
These are just a few examples of what I would like to see, the effects of the spells lasting longer would give players a perception of the spells lasting time.. it would help from having to look at your damn buff window every 15 mins.<br />
<br />
<br />
Im just blabbing, tell me what you guys think about this</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">personally i wish they fixed the torpor line of spells to not blind you from everything for a coupple seconds every time i have spell effects on i go in 3rd person for cani 5 /quisc  cause its annoying as **** other then that its a kewl spell effect ohh and btw  blood of nadox spell effect owns</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Brett those are good ideas but it looks like laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaag city to me :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i run my spell particles on except for raiding situations where they're quite laggy .. <br />
<br />
you can set your transparency % in the video options screen, I use only 21% transparency myself .. it makes all the particles see-though but quite visible still .. and it doesn't make a mess out of your screen, .. or blind you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brettation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would understand that it might create lag, but if varent had a mind, all the server would do was send a signal to create &quot;this partical effect for this amount of time&quot;, so its all client side, for me i would not lag, same with alot, but that might be vise versa with many other people that have 56k connections</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can have nice spell effects without lag.  I play daoc as well, and the spell effects there (and the models, and the landscapes, and everything else graphicswise) blow EQ away, but I don't lag at all.  In EQ, though, I have to have my spell effects off or I lag.  Is it because I have a bad machine?  No, it is because anyone that has been in any way involved with EQ graphics is completely incompetent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Only real lag-causers for me are the darkness / disease spells, the Torpor line, and Pillar-type spells / effects, such as the PoT waterfalls and the beastlord pet cold procs.<br />
<br />
Oh, and all the bard healing songs with the blue flashes. I think all Bard songs have an inherent lag modifier to try to screw up their twisting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Try setting your &quot;near clip plane&quot; to maximum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brettation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">yes the beastlord type spell effects and pillar give me lag to, just to many polygons</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">When are they gonna finish them?  I thought I remembered seeing a cool picture for the SoW effect, but hasn't been implemented.   Poison hasn't been updated.  Roots.  Etc.</div></div><hr />
