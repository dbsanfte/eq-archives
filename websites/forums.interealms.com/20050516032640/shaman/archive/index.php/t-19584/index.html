<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Most likely this is already quite nicely covered somewhere, so could somebody provide me with a link or a breakdown perchance?  I only found one topic which seemed to talk about it on search and it was pure speculation and rather old.<br />
<br />
  All I have seen so far is that you can turn in items that are not NO DROP tagged to get points (hrm, wonder if they remembered to exclude the NO RENT tag as well...).  You then spend the points on buffs (by the sounds of it) and those buffs will automatically refresh themselves at a tribute cost so long as you can afford them.<br />
<br />
<br />
  If this is the case, hopefully they have given some instances of which buffs are available so I have a little something to look at.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Anyhow, /wave from temporary retired land and thanks for the info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is a brief list of some (maybe all) of the tribute abilities.<br />
http://eq.stratics.com/content/features/god/tribute.php<br />
And I can't find the article right now, but you cannot give no drop and no rent items.  You give dropable and plat.  Hurray, way to feed Yantis even more....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mitrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Based on the screen shots, the Tribute System is a lot cheaper than potions.  (0h n0z... I might lose the one customer I have!)  Of course, it would have to be if part of the idea is diminish the total amount of platinum in the game.  It looks pretty good so far, I'm anxious to see how practical it will be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sensei Xarrais</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The best is the mana regen one the rest are worthless.  Comes out to be about 275 pp per hour to keep up 10 mana regen.  <br />
<br />
althought have seen some conflicting reports on it <br />
<br />
eq.stratics.com/content/features/god/tribute.php<br />
<br />
says it is 2 per teir and 5 tiers Others said it is Just FT 1 per teir and 5 teirs.<br />
<br />
The buff doesn't take a slot so guessing this will stack with KEI/VoQ.  Kinda expensive to keep up full time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its usefulness to me probably depends on how long it lasts.  275 is expensive but I might pay it sometimes.  I'd probably be more likely to just pay 50p for KEI, though.<br />
<br />
Do you have to go back to your home city or is this available in PoK?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would imagine that kei would stack with it, not replace it.<br />
<br />
I think it is an interesting idea, this tribute system.  Not sure about the effect on the economy though.  Also the actual use of it.  If you have to go back to your home town to turn on/off the buff, that could be rather tedious pretty quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually, this will be a great system IMO.  I'll take my extra 150 hps and 50 AC for little to no cost.  It's also an easy way to get the focus' that you don't have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I believe I saw somewhere that you have to go to your home city to give the tribute.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">So for 100K I can get 150hp/50ac for 3000 hours<br />
<br />
I can't run there fast enough to hand over my 100K!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hrm, any restrictions on what level can get what kinda buffs?  Sounds like the new age twinking to me :)   Ah well, still not a good enough reason to return to game :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sounds rubbish at first glance, no idea what its like in practise.</div></div><hr />
