Try your pet shrink spell, Tiny Companion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then why my grow spell is working on my pet ??<br />
I can make a huge dog using my grow spell but not shrink him with normal shrink ?<br />
<br />
Excuse me, but it's BS to be forced to use tiny companion, even if I don't care and never shrink my pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hmm..I never mind using tiny companion.  Its  a spell I have to cast about once every 2 hours or so..BFD.<br />
<br />
As to Pet affinity, I heard through the /ooc in PoK last night that it wasnt working; I cannot confirm as I dont have PA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Patzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Was working fine for me on Povar. I make my pet Huge, then was able to shrink him back down using normal shrink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I seem to remember something about that a long time ago . . . if you Grow the pet first, regular Shrink will work.  Otherwise, just use Tiny Companion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tindaorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">why are you complaining about loading a spell you have to cast once until your pet zones and dies... to me just looks like your looking for something to complain about<br />
<br />
seems to me we really need to look at other things that have a much more important impact on the game then something that is fixed just not the same was as it was before ..it now is just a LITTLE more unconvienent. and the spell cost like 10pp so...i'll log on whatever server your at , get the needed money on a lvl 1 character and give it to you so you can buy the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">What's wrong with them fixing it so Shrink works again, Tindaorn?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tindaorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">shrink does work..just on pets you have to cast a spell tiny companion..i just dont see anything wrong with that. like someone said before shrink for PC and tiny companion for ...companions ( pet )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">That's ridiculous. Shrink worked fine on pets for years. I'm not buying a spell that was intended for pet owning classes that didn't have shrink as a spell.<br />
<br />
I want them to fix our spell so it works like it always did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tindaorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">it should work as intended but its sony.. so to me.. tiny companion is fine</div></div><hr />

Can anyone else confirm this ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Though if they left it in it would be nice, even though it would screw over the people that saved up the 20aa for PA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I can confirm that Tiny Terror DOES shrink pets for players with pet affinity. Tried it out last night much to the pleasure of my mage duo partner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">One other point is that at the moments pets do not resize when zoning like players, therefore last night a shrunk my pet once in about 5 hours worth of play with multable zonings and a camp out to switch stuff from an alt he stayed shrunk.<br />

For once I actually hope that this is &quot;working as intended&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't have PA and MGB buffs are not hitting my pet. Do you understand that PA only affects your own pet?</div></div><hr />

Excuse me, but it's BS to be forced to use tiny companion, even if I don't care and never shrink my pet.<br />
<br />
My guess is that each spell reduces or increases size by a fixed increment, and that if that increment goes past the minimum or maximum total size for your pet's model, it will do nothing.<br />
<br />
Companion has always shrunk to a different value than Shrink, it's just that the old wolf models had different max and min sizes.  People whined and complained about them giving Shaman the tiny companion spell when they already had shrink... well who's laughin now, MUAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAA.<br />
<br />
But yeah, I hear it's available in PoK from mage vendor.  Not sure, I bought it when it came out, can't remember where from...<br />
<br />
And as a nice side benefit, we can make our pets REALLY REALLY big!  Try it on a raid, I hear the raid leaders love it!  Or maybe it was hate, I get them mixed up a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Pet Affinity makes any group buff cast on the player also hit his/her pet. That includes MGBs. So if you want group buffs to affect YOUR pet, then YOU need to spend the 20AA's on Pet Affinity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why would you want to waste a hard earned AA point on something you have a perfectly good spell for?</div></div><hr />

To avoid having to swap spell slots to do it, of course.<br />

Pass the remote plx</div></div><hr />

Never had a problem swapping spells... especially when they last multiple hours. But that's just me. Even more so now that pets zone with you... and keep their shrunken size on zone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you sure they keep their shrunken size when they zone?  I haven't shrunken mine yet, but I sure as heck know that MY size resets when I zone.<br />
<br />
And when are you gonna pass me that BLASTED remote???  I'm in my comfort zone here.</div></div><hr />
