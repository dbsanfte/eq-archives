<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I play a lvl 29 shaman and 28 necro, and have been hunting the guards in hhk on and off for the past few levels. I would like to stay here, but I cant find enough guards if there is anyone else camping them(and there often is) I see these other people pulling guards that I just can't seem to find. I was wondering if anyone had a map listing where the pullable guards are and what level they are?<br />
<br />
So far I have just pulled to the courtyard right after zone in. I was also wondering if there was another good spot to set up(the jail, any of the other floors?) I have looked around as much as I can, but it is kind of tough being kos, and not wanting to get caught somewhere dangerous when invis drops.<br />
<br />
We can kill blue cons with no problems at all, whites shouldn't be hard, and yellows would be doable if fm, especially after the necro gets lvl 29 and new pet/dot. We are basically naked, shaman has full banded, both have about 100hp worth of gear, more gear is not an option.<br />
<br />
Is there another place that we can try? I really like hhk guards because they are good exp, amazing pp, and pretty easy kills. The problem is that they are often camped, and with even 1 other person on them I find the exp pretty slow. I have considered gorlas, and now that the shammy is 29 I will check them out later, but I know the plat wont be as good, and plat is very nice for spells and gear upgrades.<br />
<br />
Thanks a bunch.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sola gnomes are basically permacamped, rotating new members into whatever groups are there. Most groups there typically dont get 2 open spots so I would prefer to go somewhere I can just duo, and group if a group hapens to show up. If need be I will go to ot, did a bit of that when I couldn't get bandit groups in pc because of overcrowding.</div></div><hr />
