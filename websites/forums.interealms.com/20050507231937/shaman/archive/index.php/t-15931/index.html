<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vivala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all,<br />
<br />
Guild is doing Mith Marr tonight, i only have 2 of the 3 HoH trials complete.  I have heard rumor that there is a 15% rule for this event.  How exactly does the 15% rule work?<br />
<br />
When I click to enter the zone, does it look at the number of people in the raid in the zone and determine 15% at that time?  I'm trying to figure out if I need to get there early and get in the raid early.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gummox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If 85% of your raid is flagged for and inside a zone then the 15% of your raid that is not flagged and waiting outside, can zone in.  There's a set # of people that need to be flagged also, I'm thinking it's somewhere around 32-36.<br />
<br />
So for example: if your raid has 42 people and 36 of them are flagged for and already inside HoHB, then the last group of slackers can zone in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's so guilds with members that havent been able to get flagged yet can still join their guild on raids. If the people drops to below 32 people you get ported out after one minute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It can also be very buggy... you might need a ton of patience for the raid into HoHB.  Our guild did MM and we had to disband the raid about 4 times that night to make it work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i hear you need the hoha trials as well ?  well not to kill mm  but to gain elemental access ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes, you need all three HOHa trials to do the following two things:<br />
<br />
1) Zone in to HOHb without a piggyback<br />
2) Progress through the planes (SRT, EP)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Some tips on piggybacking:<br />
<br />
* Create the raid in the destination zone.<br />
* Do NOT have the raidleader zone after that.<br />
* Have all groups created and group leaders invited in the destination zone.<br />
* Have all flagged people in place, THEN send a group leader out to invite them and have them enter.<br />
<br />
This usually works with the smallest amount of bugs.  Remember, your raid needs to be at least 32 people, and the max number of unflagged you can get in a full raid is 10.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You cannot zone in unless 85% of the raid members already there are flagged. As has been said above, minimum number is 32.<br />
<br />
Whoever said you have one minute is wrong though. I was in HoHb when I died, and a lot of the raid camped out, so dropped below the 32 mark. When I was rezzed back, I got a warning at 3 minutes, one at 2 minutes. Presumably you get one at a minute, but I camped before that.<br />
<br />
If you die, wait for a rez, do NOT zone back in. The 85/15% thing is calculated based on an unflagged person zoning in through the portal, so you could be using up an extra spot if you zone back in instead of waiting to get rezzed back in.<br />
<br />
I'm not 100% sure of this, but once you're in the raid and the zone, it doesn't seem to matter if other people go linkdead, or a large number of people die, as long as there is 32 people minimum in the raid. About 10 people went LD on one raid, and none of the unflagged were kicked out.<br />
<br />
If an unflagged person goes LD though, they have to get a reinvite within the 3 minutes, and that has to meet the 85% requirements. So be careful if you're unflagged and go LD. You may have to camp and wait for other people to come back from LD, etc.</div></div><hr />
