<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shaben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If I've not got my knickers in a twist, the PS2 version has recently come out. Does anyone know if it will be using the same servers? <br />
<br />
If so, I guess there will be an influx of new people - may be time to turn into a bear, charm a mammoth and run around Everfrost newbie area for Ohhhs and Ahhhs :D <br />

p.s. Killed my first Ogre bouncer last night. Bwahahahahha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Read up on it.  It's a totally different game.  It's silly to think it'll be using the same servers.<br />
<br />
On a related note, those commercials crack me up.  &quot;It's time to kill the dragon!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tranzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">nope completely different server and completely different building if i remember correctly. The two games are nothing like each other and people playing them will never see each other. IE you dont have to worry about meeting someone playing on thier PS2 while you are playing on your computer. Besides the PS2 version is a long time in the past anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">different servers, different games, different stories, different playtype, different times, some similar lore/zones though<br />
<br />
