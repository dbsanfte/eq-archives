<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mohadeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have 235 in specialization for whatever spell type.. but I noticed that all my other specialization are like at 92 or something... I am a 64 shaman... are these numbers correct?  Can I need to do something to get them higher?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ranguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your specialize looks bugged. Only 1 should be over 50 (Alteration I assume) The fact that more are higher than 50 means there is a bug from what I've read and that you must do the SolRo quest to reset Specialize. NOTE: It will drop all to 49 and the one that you want to max will have to be cast continuously until it breaks 50, otherwise you could specialize in something you don't want (IE Divinate) My shaman not over 60 yet, so not sure if Specialize goes higher after that or not, as it's not talked about from what I've seen...but AFAIK Alteration is what you wanna Specialize in, or Conjuration if you solo extensively.</div></div><hr />

Did someone make this guy and his magelo as a joke? can anyone say druman? <br />
<br />
And he doesn't understand specialisations...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No, even at 65, specialization is limited to 200/50/50/50/50.<br />
<br />
I'd recommend speccing in alteration even if you solo a lot.  There's still a lot of alter stuff you do when soloing, whereas conjure's kind of a one-trick pony.</div></div><hr />

*** is your problem?  This guy has done nothing except ask a legitimate question and you flame him for his gear?  It isn't what I would pick, but if I he is here asking a question, I am guessing he has read enough of the crucible to know all about our &quot;HP vs Mana&quot; debates and is fully capable of making his own choices.  Just because he picked something you wouldn't does not give you the right to flame him.<br />
<br />
Anyways, if you have a specialization at 235 (cap should be 200) and everything else is higher than it should be, then you should consider just leaving it alone, since you're getting a good deal ;)  Correct numbers would be 200 in one spec, and 50 in everything else.</div></div><hr />

He's 64 and he doesn't even realise that specialisations cap at 200/50/50/50/50? and you think he's serious? He's probably trying to communicate with us that his conj/div/abj/evoc are stuck at 95 because he was too lazy to train them, yet he had to use his heals and slows for people to even let him in groups so it's at 235 (the cap)</div></div><hr />

So why didn't you say that instead of insulting his gear?  You might very well be right about his &quot;specializations&quot; but there is no reason to go after him like you did.  If someone is a little ignorant about the game but has intentions towards legitimately improving themselves as both a character and a player, there is no reason to treat them disrespectfully.  If all everyone does is insult anyone who knows less about the game than they do, then this wouldn't be a very productive board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It really sounds like he is talking about specific spell skills and not specialization.  I doubt that Verant would let a bug like that slip through.  235 in a specialization would be nice :)  And being able to get others above 50 would be handy too, but it sounds like he has really bad spell skills except for alteration.  Grouping will let your conjuration fall behind since things die so fast it's not worth it to cast a DoT, but Alteration flies up in a group setting.  Abjuration/divination/evocation are the shaman skills that seem to lag behind though.  Even in a constant group setting these 3 skills require me to stop every few levels just to practice so they don't fall behind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mohadeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My question was about the 200/50/50/50 question... I wasn't sure about my numbers so I just guessed.. but I think they are 200/50....<br />
<br />
My main is a 65 Rogue.. and FVDladian if you would like to look and his equipment go right ahead.. I don’t think you can laugh at anything there...<br />
<br />
Plus on a Shaman = Spells &gt; Equipment (Dumba$$)<br />
<br />
As for my knowledge on skill caps...  just asking if these numbers were correct... if they weren't I wanted to fix them.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help guys.<br />
<br />
and FVDladian don't even try to perceive me as a newbie; if you would like to swap information on EQ, be it different class information, zones, quests, and/or expansions I will wipe the floor with you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think that FVDladian is saying that most people who have played an int caster past 20 and a priest past 30 will know what their skill caps for specializations are.  Perhaps you just didn't do any research on specializations when you were leveling up your shaman, and you didn't pay attention that one of them proceeded past the 50 mark while the rest stopped.  It really sounds like a question that someone new to casting would ask, and being a level 64 caster that should not be the case.</div></div><hr />
