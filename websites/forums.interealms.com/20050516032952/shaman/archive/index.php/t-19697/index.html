not really sure, boxes usually mean AA's hotkeys or Hotbuttons.<br />
but maybe if you click on and it says &quot;no longer useable by this class, race, and or diety&quot; then it was given to another class or removed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bhone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">someone making new spell gem icons did a sloppy job, and did not use image layering properly.  so the &quot;square&quot; that is the top layer should have been a layer down, and the surrounding red/blue top layer was instead overwrote with some black pixels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have those on all my spell gems, and I cant get my custom interface to load no matter what I try. I dont even recognize my spell book with those old ass icons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd assume that the file that contains those icons has become damaged and the alpha channel that specifies transparency isn't being read properly or was created incorrectly. I'd redownload the file and that will probably solve it.</div></div><hr />
