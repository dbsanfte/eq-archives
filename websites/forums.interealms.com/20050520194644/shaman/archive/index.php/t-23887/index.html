<br />
Obviously the 292 mana cost was incorrect, but the new proposed mana cost is a significant DOWNGRADE in efficiency by like 1/6.<br />
<br />
The cleric elixir line is getting ever more efficient eash expansion.<br />
<br />
Celestial Elixir: 4.0 hp/m<br />
Supernal Elixir: 5.0 hp/m<br />
Holy Elixir: 5.0 hp/m<br />
Pious Elixir: 5.26 hp/m<br />
<br />
Torpor: 6.0 hp/m<br />
Quiescence: 6.0 hp/m<br />
Breath of Trushar: 6.0 hp/m<br />
Spiritual Serenity: 5.26 hp/m<br />
<br />
To keep in line with the increase in efficiency that the cleric one got, Spiritual Serenity should heal 820 per tick and  cost 520 mana.<br />
<br />
Stupid oversights like this just drive me crazy. Then again you know what they say about monkeys and typewriters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think that what has happened is that they wanted to make it more in line with the cleric line of spells as far as efficiency goes.  I would at least be satisfied if we kept the same efficiency leaving the mana cost at 547.  I will not be too upset with the new mana cost of 625 if they manage to fix the rest of our bugged spells in the same patch.  Including the 67 pet spell and Vindictive Spirit (it looks like they have already made Vindictive Spirit detrimental on Test).</div></div><hr />

That's very relative. If you are indoors, throws mounts out the window and it's safe the say the majority doesn't have FT capped either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i say keep 625 mana but increase the heal to 938:)  i be happy witht that, but failing that reduce it to be inline with all our hot spells so 547. but feed it back:)<br />
<br />
problem is they really missed a trick here, you could have had shaman healing problem sorted by given shaman the best hot by a good way and lowest direct heal (pretty much as is), so our healing would be balanced, then druid get middle for both and cleric best direct heal worse hot. I recon you could have balanced the classes healing power via this . obviously cleric would be most useful for the power of their direct heal, and then druid, but shaman would still be viable healers for alot of situations, just using hots more.<br />
<br />
<br />
now if they just did that with our dots too i be happy with our crap dd:)</div></div><hr />

Oh Goodness sakes another idiot trolling.  Put the mana at it's appropriate level and let's get on with things.  Maybe it's difficult to put out a bug free expansion, but I don't think so.<br />

PS: Shaman 67 pets. Hmmmm, cough cough, cough, cough....... I used to stand up for Soe compared to Verant. Hello 6.0 efficiency like all our other hot's.  How tough is that?? boggle.  I am amazed and confused, time to put my resume into SOE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Fix the efficiency to same value like all our other HoTs.<br />
<br />
GD mana efficiency of heal over times was like our only strong point in the healing department. Leave it alone.<br />
<br />
Sigh Chifari. Yet another one, that advocates nullifying advancements in some areas with losses in other areas. Why? We are supposed to get more powerful with levels, this is just the way characters develop in almost all RPGs. These increases in power should be balanced against more difficult content - not against losses in other abilities.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I wish they'd up the healing to be equal to the Cleric's since they don't stack anyways. Then they'd be free to make it as inefficient(relatively) as the Cleric HoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">We also get mana regeneration capabilities that exceed anything we've had before<br />
<br />
This is a gross misconception.  Our mana regeneration capabilities are nowhere near where they used to be.  When the FT cap is raised, everybody does not benefit equally.  It's hard to grasp, but if a class is known to regenerate mana well or quickly because of an ability that remains static, then by increasing the FT cap for everybody, that one class loses relative power in mana regeneration versus the others.<br />
<br />
And though it'd be nice to point to our new cannibalizes, last I checked, they aren't a significant upgrade in mana regeneration efficiency.  Granted, they make life easier, but because that efficiency remains the same, and because Canni V remains the same with no upgrades, the new FT cap only hurts us in relation to other casters and their mana regeneration capabilities.<br />
<br />
So in one sentence, I'm telling you that that argument doesn't hold up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">And though it'd be nice to point to our new cannibalizes, last I checked, they aren't a significant upgrade in mana regeneration efficiency.  <br />
<br />
<br />
The new canni (and ancient) is an incredible increase in mana production over canni4.  Instead of 81-2 a tick with 0 seconds to act over 3 ticks, you get ~102/tick (I called 2.5 + 18 secs 3.5 ticks, 360 mana/3.5 ticks = ~102/tick), with 2 ticks of freedom to do other things, including sit down and meditate for those two ticks if you needed to.  You get a huge benefit out of this.  To anyone who doesn't have ancient canni/pained memory, get it and see if you still disagree with me.  Regardless, ancient/pained gives an additional 20/tick increase  ignoring any other arguments in its favor.  I don't see how anyone can call that irrelevant or merely &quot;convenient&quot;.<br />
<br />
I can't even find a way to make my mana bar go down anymore, dot stacking, casting yoppa's rain of venom (which imo is turning out fantastic).  New 9, c6, additional ft5, it's just getting crazy.  Maybe once I have champion, it will be different, but I don't think so.  By keeping ratios of spells the same but increasing mana regen, it makes the mana regen of every class go up a great deal.  As such, I personally feel many spells should be slightly less efficient (although not moreso than the upgrade in mana regeneration, a little improvement isn't bad) to compensate.  While I agree this hurts shaman, because it makes everyone's mana regen get better (closing the relative gap decreases the impact of shamans' self-regen), it doesn't invalidate my basic argument, which that keeping the mana per hp ratio for spells the same when you dramatically increase the mana regen in an expansion *might* be a mistake.  <br />
<br />
I also don't understand why the previous poster labeled me a troll when I've posted many times on the Crucible before (just because I actually disagreed with the original poster's argument?)<br />
<br />
If anything, torpor and Q were vastly off in terms of their ratios... those spells have always been undercosted, imo.  A move downwards in ratio to gain a substantially larger value of healing is not, in my opinion, unreasonable.  A better question would be why clerics' HoTs weren't better/more efficient ever since day one.  Another one would be why the ratios of any such spells (barring bugs/something broken about them) ever get better from expansion to expansion.<br />

it is not really a big increase, if you clicked canni iv every time it poped or clicked the new canni everytime it pops the mana return is very close to being equal, for canni iv assumes 5 sec cast recast is 324 mana in the time pain memory works, or 92 ish mana/tick. So there is a slight increase (10 mana a tick) but really really not huge thats an extra 1.5 mana/sec , where it really helps iss purely as you mention you can do others things rather than just clicking, which isnt the same thing. it terms of pure mana regen it is the a tiny increase, the fact it is easier to use and less hassle is the  bonus, and as you likely will be able to click this once much more than click canni iv 3-4 times. so you could say that it is an increase because of this, but this is not a huge increase and very nearly not an increase.<br />
<br />
where as before 10 mana a tick might have been good increase, when other casters can now get 54 mana  tick from beast,druid,enc and ft15 (can get 20 now but lot of aa) it is not the advantage it use to be , when clarity 2 gave 9 a tick, and no mana regen spell other than beast first one at that level, we had about 56 mana a tick( from canni 3),  about 6 times more, now we are only 2 times more . now that is a huge difference, and not in our favour.</div></div><hr />

Everytime Chifari dies, he's at FM. He believes we need a retro nerf on q and torpor to below clerics hots and with higher mana costs. As he levels and gets new spells, he wants their efficiency to go down. He believes being more efficient as you level is actually a bug.<br />
<br />
He believes shaman healing at 1965 is just right.<br />
<br />
You are an embarassemnt to the shaman community. You probably wonder what a tool is, looks like you should look in the mirror or re-read your post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Actually he's right. Unless you're spamming heals it's very hard to make a significant dent in your mana pool during a fight.

I was grouped in Ruined City of Dranik the other day and the damn Murkgliders are really poison Resistant, so all I could do is Bane and Vstrike. Using those two spells in conjunction there was no way I could make a negative impact on my mana.<br />

I'd gladly take a 20% or so efficiency hit to our ice nuke line if they'd cut the casting time in half.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just don't want to think about what one or 2 people asking for a 20% cut in efficiency would do to the rest of our spells.  Do you think they would only change 1 or 2 spells to make this change or make it category wide, making all of our Cannibalize and HoT spells less efficient?  <br />
<br />
Why ask for a nerf?  Don't necros have even more efficient, passive hp-to-mana conversions, and better more efficient DoT's with resist adjusts...and Dire charm...and FD...and invulnerability...<br />
<br />
Why ask for a nerf again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Why ask for a nerf again?Because I can't burn through mana fast enough using the ice nuke. by the time I cast it twice, with 18% det haste and BoR, pained memory is up again, and I have all the mana back.

<br />
I understand that you have more mana than you can get rid of, but at my level, with my gear, spells, and AA's...I do not.  Perhaps asking for more damaging/higher mana cost DD's or DoT's without asking for a nerf to our mana regen abilities would help you and other people in similar situations to you without breaking every other shaman that still doesn't have the mana to spare like you do.<br />
<br />
I am assuming that you and Chifari feel this way partly because of your gear/aa's and what they enable you to do.  I may be wrong though.</div></div><hr />
