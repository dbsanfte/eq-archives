Won, heh which ended up being a close one.  Wern't expecting the adds from A Monsterous Mudwalker<br />
I personally had to change my tactics on fighting this guy, we had initially a tough time keeping him cornered, due to his AE root.  I ended up melee'ing when I got lucky to be with in range of him, so I made sure I had natures rebuke up.  Also chain casted Exile Summoned seemed to help with the DPS when I was rooted out of range for melee and he was cornered.<br />
<br />
This fight really makes us adjust our tactics at a moments notice. <br />
<br />
Tough but really fun fight.<br />
<br />
I'm interested in hearing how others approach this fight.</div></div><hr />

After that, we pull the FG to the zone in and kill.  Named spawns and rushes raid add-free since nothing assists it.  We've also never had him spawn adds while fighting at the zone in, so it may be a proximity thing.</div></div><hr />

We had like 15 spawned adds every 30% or so.  Not a great deal of HP on them but hit for 300 - 400</div></div><hr />

I poped in to grind just before a raid was called but I think it was Conviction doing the rings last night.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RedChief</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 07:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks to the server problems, we finally got to do mud last night also.  Before we had pulled everything to ZI (Bard puller) but this time moved to the abandoned temple in the center of the zone (there was xp grp at ZI).  Puller pulled every mud for cycle and no lurker popped.  We went on and started the vine ring when the puller got what seemed like a roamer mud and when it died the lurker popped.  The one advantage I found by doing it in the center of zone camp was there was a lot more room to work with.  The Monterous Mudwalker didnt need to be walled and its possible to avoid the root AE (which is hard at ZI).  This made it easier for mezzers to get the adds off the rooted people and away from the raid.<br />
<br />
Adds + root AE make this a fun fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenas</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 09:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That temple you fought in was where the Dust ring spawns.  Once you kill the &quot;a dusty warder&quot; near Jaggedtooth's temple, that temple becomes very, very unsafe.  So be sure, if nothing else, to not pull the warder there :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nerple</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 08:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We just pull everything to the corner right outside of the zone in area and still have the named pop out 15ish adds there.  Any ranger can also easily pull this ring to there.</div></div><hr />

We generally kill him in the Skelton room</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hawkwind Dniwkwak</div><div class="date">12-27-2003, 11:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lots of noob questions inc, please bear with me  :D <br />
<br />
1. What's the trigger to this ring?<br />
2. How hard is the boss? He can't be that hard if a lot of newly EP-enabled guilds are doing Mud and Rock rings over and over easily. Decent chunk of HP and hits for 1kish I presume?<br />
3. The entire ring consists of this, from what I've gathered. Trigger event, X amount of mobs spawn (any idea on the amount?), then 5 Filth Gorgers spawn, kill 4 of the FGs at the temple (which is to the right side of the zone if you just zone in, right?), then pull the last gorger to zone in, kill it and then the Monstrous Mudwalker spawns on top of that mob and then kill him.<br />
4. What's this about &quot;spawning adds&quot; and &quot;lurkers&quot;?<br />
5. He AE roots, so (attempting to) push him to the corner is good, and then kill him - he's effected (affected? :p) by bane-summoned DDs?<br />
6. Best way to heal is to /assist the mudwalker since the root messes up who tanks and stuff, right?<br />
<br />
Sorry for all the questions, trying to get info together for my alliance so we can attempt these rings soon.<br />
<br />
Thanks a ton in advance. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.  Trigger is killing any &quot;Earthen Mudwalker&quot;, once one is down you have to kill them all to spawn &quot;Sludge Lurker&quot; before respawns.  <br />
<br />
2.  He is pretty easy, only real problem on him is the AE Root can sometimes keep your melee damage out fo the fight.  His HP I would say is actually on the lower side.<br />
<br />
3.   There are only 4 Filth Gorgers, you can kill them anywhere, it doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
4.  All Sludge Lurkers and Monsterous Mudwalker have minor adds that pop out.<br />
<br />
5.  If I recall correctly Exile Summoned and Nature's Rebuke work on him (I know they do on Rock Ring).  It doesn't really matter where you kill him, I think most push him to a corner (usually at zone in or dust temple), we always just do him in the open.<br />
<br />
6.  We haven't really encountered this problem with aggro control since the first time or two since we have done him, but I think we first solved this problem by having a Paladin tank him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shareel</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 09:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We kill him a little bit different. We fight the 5 splitters near the temple and &quot;split&quot; the rushing 4 mobs with 4-6 rangers (we have a lot of them) by snaring and rooting. One chanter helps with AE tash if the come the steps down.<br />
<br />
The last mob of this 4 will be hold rootet if non damaged or offtanked by an Paly. Than we clear all respawns around the temple and pull the last rusher inside the temple where the final mud boss with AE root spawns.<br />
<br />
The final rusher will be killed in the center of the tempel and an paly grabs aggro and chainstun him until he dies. We keep him centered most times but sometimes he end in an corner of his temple if the pet users mess up the positioning.<br />
<br />
Most fights (9 of 10) are an cakewalk and rangers (we have a lot of them *eg*) can pull out some good dps with this tactic.<br />
<br />
We tried the &quot;corner at zonein&quot; style as we started with this encounter and have serious problems because we managed it two times to push him &quot;over&quot; the corner and the end was really bad. He is an nasty corpse camper and you dont get an second shot if you wipe at the zone in.</div></div><hr />
