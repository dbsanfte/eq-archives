<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>EVOLNOSMIRC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a 39 iksar shaman and in a few lvls would like to explore doing some of the twilight sea quests.  Since I am KOS in Katta and running through the fungus grove sounds real scary, what can I kill efficiently to get me to dubious in katta castelum?  I also want to faction there as it would be nice to have another town I can walk into and bank, etc.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
why?<br />
<br />
a) I am a 39 ... shaman<br />
b) what can I kill efficiently <br />
<br />
Vampires in Tenebrous Mtns give miniscule faction hits.  but they are high 40s and 50s mobs.  Hunting in Sanctus Seru is another option, but the guards there are also high lvl (50s?)<br />
<br />
There are a *few* quests that you could do to raise faction, but since you are KOS you won't be able to do them. <br />
Wish I could give you happier news.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the santus earring quests,  gives katta faction plus others. first 2 are doable by u. not sure the faction for the initial turn in guy though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>EVOLNOSMIRC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I can't really do quests in sanctus seru either cause I am soooooo KOS there (still bitter from a really bad CR there...hehe)...I know there are lots of Hands of Seru in Marus Seru that are either blue, light blue, or green to me...has anyone ever killed these or does anyone know if they will bring up my faction in katta?  Thanks for you prompt responses to my questions btw, I really appreciate it :)<br />

You can run through fungus or katta untouched, thanks to this wonderful and often over-looked spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah you can kill the hand guys in marus seru, but the faction hits are miniscule.  Raising either katta or seru factions for an iksar is a total pain in the ass.  It'll take you less time to run back to the bazaar every time you need to bank than it will to raise either faction high enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">wheres a good resource for SoL quests? Im on a questing binge recently, and would like some new stuff to go for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Running through Fungus is not as dangerous as it sounds. The mobs are widely spaced and don't roam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you want to raise most of the Seru factions, kill Thought Leeches in Mons Letalis. I think this should be doable in a good group at about level 40.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Boraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Killing the &quot;hand&quot; and &quot;Lego&quot; dudes in Netherbain raises Katta Guard Faction, I'm not sure it raises merchant faction.  <br />
<br />
Anyone know how to raise faction with Lcea Katta?  I am amiable to all of katta except her and her cronies, they all scowl at me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My monk went through 38/39 mostly by killing hands in marus/netherbian. Passable xp, zero change to katta faction, still scowling(Sneak questing is how he is raising it now).<br />
<br />
Damn the &quot;evil&quot; combines for not liking evils anyway. They have all the good quests too :(</div></div><hr />
