<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if anyone can make Mithril Plate?  It and Mithril Chain are the 2 types of High Elf cultural armour, both of which can be imbued by a Tunare Cleric.  Thankfully Verrant pulled their you know what's out of their butts and made it imbuable to the actual ore instead of requiring the Blue Diamonds.<br />
<br />
If anyone can, then I was wondering how much a Visor, Gorget, Bracer, Sleeves, and Cloak would be.  Medium is fine, but small would be even better.<br />
<br />
If noone can, well then I'll spend my pieces to further fund Sherazad's development of her skill until she can.  She's at 140 which with her good charisma won't cost too much more (hopefully) to get her up to near 200.  BTW, Ransure that means she should also be able to make the Enchanted Mithril Chain you've been wanting.  Also we'll need Morning Dew (foraged in Faydarks), Vials of Swirling Mist (Mist Elementals), and Essence of Moonlight (Castle Mistmoore) for the Moonlight Temper (requires bewer).  If someone CAN make it, I'm sure Sherazad will still continue to developer her skill, but as I'm trying to upgrade my (Sori's) weapon of choice (Sherazad), this is the next logical step (replacing the last bit of banded she has with Mithril).<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chadias Spirithealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have a vial of the swirling mist if you want that. You can have it unless its also for an Enchanter in which case Ravi gets it =) hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well FTI Imbued Mithril chain IS wearable by all the High Elf caster classes, or at least I believe so.  And I believe it's WIS/INT armour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>wassabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I to am working to make Mithril Chain mail for my Wizzard. I think it would be so Cool to have a wizard running around with this stuff on!! Any who my skill is curently at 179 prolly not high enough to attempt this yet. Look me up in game the biggest pain is the  Essence of moonlight i have one bottle and been in castle mistmoore a cpl days and havent seen it drop. But FYI a mage friend of mine killed a Dreead wolf and it droped there. Well any way look me up i am interested in helping you.</div></div><hr />
