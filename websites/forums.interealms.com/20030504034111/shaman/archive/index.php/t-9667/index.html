<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">According to Lucy, Stoicism is going live today as a non-vendor level 44 SHM spell:<br />

<br />
Now let's find it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not really sure where they could put it to drop.  Rare drop off Naggy and Vox?  Only makes sense.... heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ok now i want to be able to cast this on mob.  Sure it will counter a bit of our dot power but its still snare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jowjo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Level 44 spells should drop like rain fairly commonly, eh? But then again, we know how much VI hates shaman. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">1:  Increase Hitpoints v2 by 160 per tick <br />
3:  Decrease Movement by 100% <br />
11:  Decrease Attack Speed by 30% <br />
<br />
Ya know, being able to cast this on a mob would have it's uses<br />
at higher levels. I think theknightmax might have a point. <br />
<br />
Sure it's healing the mob, but the mob can't run away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kialan Lecariuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">But has anyone found it yet? :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Patch isn't even scheduled to be completed until 1 PM PST (3 PM CST) which is still a little over an hour away.  :)<br />
<br />
Servers are *just* now starting to come back up, but I wouldn't expect much uninterupted play time for a few hours. I'm sure there'll be an emergency patch or two before they get things stable again.</div></div><hr />

If its Kunark, expect drops in Chardok/Seb... Velious, expect it in CS off drakes, or maybe PoG. Luclin? Well, who knows, i have yet to see a non-level 60 spell drop in SoL :)</div></div><hr />

Hunting down those yun shamans being chased by undead and mobs that see thru inviz and most are yellow and red some blue at level 39.<br />
Oh and going into KC at 39 is also loads of fun. Even when u know the zone u still have to GET to the hands room and mobs see inviz and there is undead Weeeeeeee.<br />
But the quest was not as hard as they could have made it c'mon u guys u can make it harder.<br />
Make the components for this spell drop in the plane of time. They have to of course be extremely rare drops off rare spawn mobs. So that all 65 shamans will eventually get a hold of the spell and mem it many many levels after it becomes useless.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Saytok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">This is prolly just a dead end but here it goes.There is a quest in Pok one of the collection quests for the museum the quest giver is a barbarian.Anyway as of the patch the quest had not been completed due to the fact noone could find one of the components a&quot;goblin two hander&quot;.So anyway if it was infact broken and the goblin 2 hander wass not droppin anywhere.SOE may have fixed this quest and had some mob somewhere start droppin the 2 hander .Then slapped our spell on the quest as the reward.On the other hand all the other quests in this buildin that had been completed give one of those &quot;fine antique&quot;items as a reward so this is prolly a dead end.For anyone who might want to follow up on this the quest info is on allahkazam.I prolly won't get the opportunity to follow this up for a while and the follow up patch cut me off today.Almost forgot quests name is Gammles display</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">well Lucy states that the spell is not vendor bought, so it won't be on a merchant if it has gone live. However a good test to see whether the bunch of spells has gone live, is to check the 2 other classes, enchanters and beastlords are expecting a merchant sold spell to go in, bsts called malaria, and enchanters called Scryer's Trespass. When I see one of them in I will be pretty confident stoicism has been added.</div></div><hr />

If Pure Blood not in game yet, maybe Stoicism not either?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Reports over on the Cleric boards regarding Temperance (the new level 44 &quot;mini Aegolism&quot;) is that even Clerics on Test were never able to find it before the spell was sent to the production servers. Speculation is it's not really even in game yet. Might be the same case for Stoicism.<br />
<br />
Nifty how spells never even found by people on test (you know....where this kind of stuff is supposed to be TESTED) are supposedly live now. Sometimes ya just gotta /snicker at this kind of thing. Ya know? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Zethrir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">My guess is none of these new spells are in the game yet, and that it was just easier to take whole the new spells file, rather than patching the file.<br />

The bugged Malaria (LOL) pretty much confirms to me that they are not in yet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">IF these spells are in-game, chances are they are going to be on a mob or surrounded by mobs that exceed the level of the spell by about 6 levels.  Since the spells are fairly powerful and sought after they are probably going to be sidelined into some difficult dungeon or area that nobody really goes to like Summon Corpse, Levitation, Shroud of Undeath, Torpor, and Malo are.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">More likely, it's not yet live in implementation.  Sure, it's in the spell list on live servers, but it's not yet available.  I think Acumen of Khura and Primal Essence were in the spell database for about 5 months before they actually were put in the loot table on certain mobs.  <br />
<br />
For now, I'd assume that the same thing applies for this new spell.  Relax guys, it's not &quot;live&quot; until you can actually get it.  If Sony had wanted it to be acquired, they'd take credit for it in a patch message.  <br />
<br />
Then again, slow mitigation messages were overlooked in the last patch message.  <br />
<br />
Also I think they re-nerfed Tier3 spell drops.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This actually is the case.  The way Lucy works is it reads in the game code info...the hooks for Stoicism are in the game, but the actually copies of the spell won't be release in game till Febuary 21, with the new expansion.  Also, in reading the information on the legacy page I agree with the poster above, in that Stoicism spell will probably require LoY.<br />
<br />
Sales and marketing folks truly are evil.</div></div><hr />
