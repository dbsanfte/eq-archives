<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I managed to wind up with about six stacks from taking my fletching from 211 to 213, and rather than sell them I kept them around.<br />

All I have to say...is I cannot WAIT for EQ. I blew my old crit record away by 201 points two nights ago. Only difference was the arrows. When your max was only in the 600s, 201 more damage is a lot more damage.<br />
<br />
WOW!<br />
<br />
I'm also done whining at how much a pain in the ass making mithril arrows is. I'm just going to use what I fletch and only do a few stacks at once to keep the carpal tunnel away.</div></div><hr />
