<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Do you find it easier on the eyes to have the same UI on both of the chars you box or to have a different one for each?<br />
<br />
<br />
Many thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Numzan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Id suggest using the same one, unless your really seasoned at 2 or 4 machines. Sometimes using the default UI is better then all the fancy colors, and spell gems. I end up finding it more confusing to relearn new gems. It also depends on the individual, if you can handle more then one UI interface.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When I 2box what it looks like doesn't matter...<br />
my secondary system is all about hotkeys... hotkeys to assist off tanks and my main system, hotkeys to follow..the rest is just alt(1-8) <br />
<br />
The second system character doesn't move much and I don't watch it much so long as they are both in the same group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I changed the colors on the other box.  I had to because I kept trying to Canni with my SK, and snare with my shaman.  <br />
<br />
Other than that I use the same interface, with the same window layout.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Very similar layouts, but my warrior has a slightly different UI to make weapons switching faster.<br />
<br />
But I don't dual box much, I prefer to be shaman, and warrior is kinda hard to bot if they're being pushed around a lot in raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Taldur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">2 boxing is much easier with casters.  You dont have to move around as much with them.  I sometimes 2 box a 61 rogue, or my monk i am currently PLing up at 43 atm.  It does take some getting used to, but having the same ui is very usefull.  Also the hotkeys helps alot.  On my sham my heal key is 6, on the monk 6 is mend, somewhat same thing.  Having the screens close to eachother helps alot too.<br />

No... this is not my set up:<br />
