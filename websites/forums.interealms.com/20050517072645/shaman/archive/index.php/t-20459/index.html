<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am looking at moving to the 7th Hammer server to join a bunch of friends at work who play there. My current guild isn't really raiding anymore, although I am 2 flags from elementals. What I am wondering is how crowded is the higher end game and is there an overabundance of shaman there. Thanks.  :confused:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Here's a look at the guilds in Elementals there (scroll down):<br />

And here's a look at your competition there (figure the same percentage of folks use eqrankings across servers):<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">7th has 4 time guilds (1 of which is euro) and 2 that are 1 kill from time. My guild needs Rathe, another needs Coirnav.<br />
<br />
Total is 9 guilds elemental enabled. Yet we're the &quot;Slow&quot; Server, Quarm didn't die on 7th until a few months ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">a) couldn't you just ask your friends?<br />
<br />
b) if you're moving servers to play with friends, why not join their guild?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just based on your info, 2 flags from elementals and your gear level, there are a lot of guilds that you would &quot;qualify&quot; for on 7th Hammer... but we do have a LOT of Shaman on the server.  I can't even think of a guild that's accepting shaman applications.</div></div><hr />
