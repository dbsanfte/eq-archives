<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you are looking for spells, then your best bet is to get KT flagged.  To do this, you need to complete the following:<br />
<br />
1. Sewers -OR Smith Rondo<br />
    There are four sewer trials that you need to complete.<br />
    If you are in a guild, you may want to suggest for them to kill Rondo.  He will flag you for all the sewer trials so you do not need to complete it.<br />
<br />
2. Vxed<br />
    You need to kill approx. 50 mobs, and a nihil ghost will spawn near the end of the zone.  There is a zonewide emote that is triggered when he spawns.  You can then crawl to the end of the zone to hail this npc.  Once you do that, there is a stone you can click to exit.  Named drop spells here: GoD Slow and GoD heal.<br />
<br />
3. Tipt<br />
    Your goal here is to kill a boss kvy, and he is quite the nasty.  There are basically what my guildmates refer to rooms.  First room is the crag trap.  This trap will spawn 4 crags.  Once all the crags are dead, a named crag will spawn.  He is always dark blue from what I have seen.  He drops a piece for BiC as well as a few decent augs - a hp/end or a hp/mana.  The second room are undead.  The ghosts can drop a piece for the BiC quest.  Once you clear that, you go to the riddler.  ( I think there is something before this - I forget )  If you complete the riddle correctly, you will get a BiC quest piece if you did the pre-flag in AS for Tipt.  After this is the boss.  WAR cannot go defensive on it, or it will turn on your healers.  SoE thought this was a good way to balance this encounter so that knights could tank him.  /shrugs.  The boss drops the last piece, and you need to cross the bridge and hail a npc.  Once you do that, you can click on a stone to exit.<br />
<br />
Sewers, Vxed, and Tipt will grant you access to KT.  <br />
<br />
KT is an awesome zone for xp.  Generally, groups will xp off the crags and hynids in the field that is the right of the summoner's ring.  To the right of your camp is a temple.  There is a kvy that spawns in the doorway that is a PH for a named.  Named can drop spells.  Also, trash can drop a decent range item and a mask.  Named can also drop augs.  Your best bet to get yours spells are in KT since the frequency of named are greater than they are in the sewers, vxed, and tipt.  Also, if I recall correctly, Jeikli (sp) [ BoT / Q upgrade ] only drops in KT+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sewer trials are pretty easy, I'm going to be doing them this weekend. It helps if you go through the Furnace one and just farm the four skulls with no intent of winning, then bank them and go back through at a later date and use the skulls.<br />
<br />
Vxed isn't bad at all, just got to make a really nasty split to break the &quot;room&quot; at the end, and from there it's single pulls to the ghost you have to hail. We cleared half the &quot;room&quot; and just hugged the mountain wall to the NPC. Tipt was interesting; The boss Kyv (yellow con, IIRC) was not so bad as we thought he would be. Something like a real sharp AOE or some sort of a DOT, I can't remember ... there was too much excitement lol. The ranger WS'ed him down and then the monk took over when he died, and the Kyv dropped pretty easily. Ranger was the only death, the rest of us were about 50m and all full health at the end.<br />
<br />
To complete your flags, you need to go hail an NPC, then the messenger guy next to him, and then re-hail the first NPC. It will tell you in yellow text that your flags have been made permanent.<br />

Just have Vxed so far.  We got to the last room with the Spiritist or whatever and had a bad pull.  I managed to survive by getting no aggro along with a couple others.  We invised through the room, uninvised, hailed, and clicked the stone super quick.  :)</div></div><hr />

Usually have a set group I go in with ... dunno as though I'm too keen on the idea of Vxed/Tipt runs in a pickup group. :cool:<br />

Interesting ... let me guess .. you had an enchanter with a charmed pet in group? Otherwise I don't see how you can do that much damage in 18 sec (ranger WS).<br />
Last try I made at him was with paladin tanking (10k HPs, clsoe to 2k AC), and 2 cleric 1 druid and me healing. We could not keep the paladin up. When we used spam heals it worked but we ran OOM before he was dead .. when the 2 clerics CH and me and druid spam inbetween the Kvy hat a good round I guess and killed the paladin. We made 4 attempts, trying different healing strats (good to have a FD necro with you in that room .. you wipe and can easily try again).<br />
I am pretty pissed at this Tipt trial design.<br />
<br />
So long<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You needed more dps Nirtox. Way too much healing and almost zero dps. 2 Clerics should be able to keep a tank alive, rest of the group needs to go dps. I have to admit I have't tried it with a non-warrior though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">you had an enchanter with a charmed pet in group?<br />
<br />
I call it the &quot;Charmed Pooka of Doom.&quot;  Give that bad boy some Mage weapons (Like putting M-80's on a nuke as far as I'm concerned) and go to town.<br />
<br />
MOBs that were taking 1 minute + to die now go down in 15 seconds.<br />
<br />
Just wish I could zone with him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Interesting ... let me guess .. you had an enchanter with a charmed pet in group?<br />
<br />
Nope. We did up until right close to the end. Seems like she went LD at the Riddler guy, I remember having to wait on her to come back after killing her little pookah. :( Poor little pookah. We had a monk, a nearly 8.6k paladin, a ranger, a cleric, myself (with puppy!!), and an enchanter (no pet) ... my standard group of friends. <br />
<br />
The reason you failed ... well, you listed 2 clerics, a druid, yourself, and the paladin. That's 5 people ... who was your sixth? Did you have a sixth? Replace a cleric and the druid with perhaps a necro/mage and you'd be a lot better off IMO. Sounds like the DPS was SORELY lacking in that group. The key to survival is slowing and killing the SOB **FAST**. And yeah, it's not like we succeeded on our first attempt. We've made probably five or six attempts to finishing Tipt. Cleric had no problems keeping either of them up with me chipping in a spam heal here and there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Key to GoD = DPS ....<br />
<br />
No matter where you are, DPS is king .... as an example ....<br />
<br />
I get called to KT cause there is a named up in the animal area (described above in relation to the Summoner Ring) ... The Group: SK, DRU, BRD, SHM (me), NEC, NEC ...<br />
<br />
The pull went something like this I cast BoT (our HoT spell) on SK, Bard pulls with Dispell and HoS, I Malos at max distance while the SK snares on incoming,  I Turgur just as named gets to camp, Druid spam healing with NI, I lay down Bane, Anthemia and then start rotating Daluda's with the Druids NI, everyone goes DPS .... named Hynid dead in around 30 seconds ... <br />
<br />
The group was so effective at killing, we decided to stay a couple of hours XPing .... <br />
<br />
Point being, if we were lacking DPS, both the Druid and myself would have been OOM from spam healing before the mob was dead .... so, in summary .... DPS key to all 1 Grp GoD encounters ....<br />
<br />
Tek<br />
<br />
PS. Neither the Druid or myself could have been primary healer, we had to work together to get the heals sorted (even with the mobs slowed) .. so Clerics are still the only viable 1 person primary healer for GoD encounters (which I believe is bunkus, all priests should be viable 1 person primary healers IMHO) ...</div></div><hr />

Sixth class was necromancer (if you had read carefully oyu would have noticed I mentioned we did it 4 times through being rezzed back), who dotted and send pet .. and FDed so he could rez us back when the named killed us.<br />
And you surely are right .. you need more DPS. The main point is .. who do you replace? The druid actually is not bad DPS if he goes fullout nuking. You need 2 clerics surely to keep the paladin standing. You need the necro to try again if something goes wrong. That leaves the shaman. I felt so totally useless at that point it wasnt funny anymore. And actually it would be far easier if the had replaced me with DPS class at that point. Sadly, I need the flag. And we wanted to give it a shot to kill him with something different than the perfect group.<br />
<br />
So long<br />
Nirtox</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I would have replaced a cleric and druid with any of the following: Rogue, Monk, Ranger.  Main reason?  Avoidance dicipline.  This would give you 10ish seconds to get the mob debuffed before the first tank had to step back and lets WS tank #2 tank it (agro droping ability is useful here).  W 2 WS tanks you get about a free 30ish seconds of tanking, and if the pally can step up w/o letting WS #2 drop, then you are golden.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Touchy, Nirtox, touchy. <br />
<br />
Anyway ... yes, more DPS, and Xilinx is right ... rogue, monk, ranger for their avoidance disciplines. In my group I had both a ranger and a monk AND a paladin. (I don't know as though a rogue would have worked in my group ... we were fighting in this little niche in the wall, and there wasn't any room to un-wall the mob, so backstabbing would've been a problem.) <br />
<br />
You do not need two clerics to keep your tank standing -- at least, you shouldn't, not with a 10k paladin who himself has heals. If he needs two clerics and a druid to keep him standing, you need a new tank. Get rid of one cleric and the druid, and replace with any of the three classes mentioned above. That way, you'll have yourself, paladin, DPS1, DPS2, cleric, necro. More DPS = much better group. With your spam healing, the cleric's healing, and his own healing, the paladin should have no problems -- indeed, he shouldn't have to even lay blade to the mob until after the ranger and monk (to use my group as an example) are finished. The key to success is NOT more healers, it is more DPS. Kill him faster.<br />
<br />
I have no idea why you felt useless; in my typical group, there is ALWAYS some way in which I can contribute, spam healing and slowing being the two most important, in my view.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Tipt:<br />
<br />
First trap spawns 6 cragbeast babies, not 4. Most are easy to single pull, and a skilled puller can get all 6 separately.<br />
Then Enraged Cragbeast Mother or something like that: easy to take down with ranger WS, or just heavy DPS, as she doesn't have many HP. Two healers spamming fast heals is usually plenty. Mama drops, IIRC, 4 different augments: 30hp/30mana, a +10atk/+2HP regen one, one with HP and endurance on it, and I think a 4th one. Temporary Power Cell A drops (I think 100%) on mama.<br />
<br />
Point about ghosts: total of 8 ghosts, and some are VERY hard to split, so you'll get 2 at a time sometimes. And when each (first) ghost dies, a second one spawns on death spot, so you really end up killing 16 ghosts. Temporary Power Cell B is random off of ghosts, and frustrating cause the drop rate is still too low IMO.<br />
<br />
Third trial is a room pretty tightly packed with mobs, one of whom drops a key to a gate later up the canyon, so you have to clear the room until the key drops. Mobs can be single pulled in most cases, and if you clear one side, you can ignore the other side and move on. Temporary Power Cell C drops from any of the mobs in this trial, and often drops more than one per run.<br />
<br />
Riddler is easy. They've added some new riddles lately, but all are pretty easy to figure out, especially if you go ahead and collect the drops and see what he's offering as the solutions. Temporary Power Cell D you get from Riddler--just hail him (after completing the riddle) and if you have the Tipt &quot;preflag&quot; from Vaifen in Abysmal Sea, he gives you some text like &quot;I sense that you are here for another reason than your companions, I think you could use this&quot; and hands you the Power Cell.<br />
<br />
Final trial: WS works well, tank with Furious works well (don't use Defensive disc, as that now drops you from the mobs aggro list and he kills somebody else--usually your healer). He always drops a bracer, but class is random. All are in the 130Hp range, plus ACs appropriate to the class, and some effect appropriate to the class. Temporary Power Cell E is (again, I think 100%) dropped by the named Kyv.<br />
<br />
Tipt is fun, and its good exp too, just slightly less than what you would get in KT for the same period of time. Its just hard to motivate people to go there, because you are committing yourself to probably 3 hours or more of grouping, depending on whether you use pooka pet and how good the group is.<br />

And, are you sure about sometimes not dropping the Power Cell? They changed it fairly recently, and I have been told by GM (as if that were a reliable source) that both Cragbeast mama and Kyv are supposed to drop 100% of the time now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It could have been changed recently.<br />

And powercells drop off of:<br />
A: Maternal Cragbeast<br />
B: Chance from a ghost<br />
C: Chance from the next village (any mob)<br />
D: Riddler IF you have the preflag (talking in Abysal sea)<br />
