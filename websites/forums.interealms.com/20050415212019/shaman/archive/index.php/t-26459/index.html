<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, I'd like to see that jackhole Rytan explain this one.  Let's take some excerpts from the posted patch message.  (You guys will have to excuse the quotes--I'm bad with post codes!)<br />
<br />
&quot;Test Server Update 4/05/05 Options <br />
<br />
Described below are most of the changes that have been introduced over the past few weeks on our test server. The information includes a host of new features, changes, and bug fixes. We have not updated you in a few weeks so here it is. The patcher and login news screens have been updated with this information as well.<br />
<br />
*** Headliners ***<br />
.......<br />
<br />
 Re-envisioning has begun!<br />
<br />
- Over 600 Spell modifications.<br />
<br />
.......<br />
<br />
*** Re-envisioning Specifics ***<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
- Many modifications have been made to the cast times, recast times, mana costs, and damage potential of many single target direct damage spells. The largest changes have been in level 1-50 spells, but many 50+ spells have been adjusted as well. These changes have caused the damage-per-second potential and/or the damage-per-mana values of these spells to be increased and should benefit the classes who use these spells in nearly all cases. Note that this also includes special purpose spells such as undead and summoned direct damage spells. Please check the in game descriptions for specific changes.*<br />
<br />
.......<br />
<br />
- Added a 30 second recast time to spirit of the panther and spirit of the leopard. Additionally, the rate at which pets trigger the effect of these spells has been lowered to match the rate at which players trigger effects.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, pray tell, how in the hell is adding 30 seconds cast time AND reducing its proc rate on pets going to add dps potential?  I'm fielding complaints from NON-MELEE classes about the changes, because THEY liked to do some melee dps.  Rather than screaming for a nerf, everyone actually LIKE panther.<br />
<br />
I was generally of the mindset that Panther was a poke in the eye at shaman anyway.  We've complained bitterly about how little we like casting avatar-line spells with their assassine 1 minute refresh timer and 6 minute duration.  So along comes Rytan with another Rytan special--let's give them a 1 minute buff so they REALLY have something to complain about.  The downside was, shaman (and everyone else apparently) actually LIKED the spell.  So, naturally, the cockgobbler had to go and change it.<br />
<br />
How overpowering is it really?  I can see changing the pet procs--they're proccing 60% too much--though given the general usefullness of shaman pets (yet ANOTHER Rytan special), at least now our pets can do some damage.  But the bottom line is . . . IT'S A BUFF.  TO DO DAMAGE, IT REQUIRES A PLATFORM ON WHICH TO CAST.  That means we can't go out and solo the world, because we need bodies upon which to cast the spell.  Clerics love it, casters love it, melee love it . . . but the shaman also like it--which is why it has to be nerfed apparently.<br />
<br />
While we're at it, I have another question--this was going on the test server, right?  HOW FARKING WELL CAN IT BE TESTED IF YOU PUT IT ON ABOUT 12 HOURS BEFORE THE PATCH?  I'm going to go out on a limb and guess you didn't want it tested--you just wanted to shove it down our throats as usual and introduce the surprise screwing.<br />
<br />
So let's examine what's happening on test atm.  Paladin heals have been increased.  Enchanter and beastlord slows have been upgraded.  Panther is getting nerfed.<br />
<br />
So, now shaman heal worse than a paladin, our slows are decreasing in effectiveness (thanks to near universal mitigation), and the other slowing classes are doing it as well as we are.  Clearly . . . shaman need another nerf.<br />
<br />

Sigh. Back to crappy DOT DPS and resisted nukes, I guess. Where did I put that Curse-Nuke Spell Set? Oh yeah, deleted it when I got Leopard.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, 30 seconds recast is stupid.<br />
<br />
From now, we will be waiting for cani to refresh, waiting for avatar line to refresh, waiting for panther to refresh ... how entertaining !!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/agreed<br />
<br />
There were plenty of other ways to address whatever their perceived problems were ....<br />
<br />
If it was Raid DPS, then reduce the effect, reduce the proc rate, double the mana cost, increase the cast time, make it Group only, just don't give it a f%^king recast time ....<br />
<br />
If it was Group DPS, then reduce the effect, reduce the proc rate, double the mana cost, increase the cast time, etc .... Waiting for recasts is a waste of a fricken spell slot ... <br />
<br />
I am sick of Avatar / Can 4 recasts, I do not wish to waste another spell slot ....<br />
<br />
HELL if its DPS the problem, then GIVE all the other HYBRIDS their DD recast times back, but allow us to keep Panther ....<br />

<br />
Frost Rift up whoopr de do.<br />
<br />
Winters Roar &amp; Shock of the Tainted are same level, 33, so the effect is 42dps down to 38dps at that level.  <br />
<br />
Blast of Poison and Blizzard blast are same level, 44, so the increase at that level is 56 to 64 dps (although switching resists).  <br />
<br />
for DPS I take cast+recast delay to be a full cycle of casting<br />
<br />
In essence the effect of most of the changes is that shaman nuking is now a worse DPS than it used to be for most of the levels of a shaman's career</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">here's some more of that patch message:<br />
<br />
- NPC’s innate 20% resistance against rain spells has been removed.* <br />
<br />
- You will now receive messages in your chat window when you are healed by any heal-over-time spell. This includes both short term HOT spells as well as long term regen spells. You will receive the message if the spell actually gave you health back, so will not receive messages when at full health. These messages can be turned off through a new filter in the options window.*<br />
<br />
- Added a negative resistance mod to the Shaman AA Virulent Paralysis so it is more likely to land on NPCs now.*</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lets look at the top 10 from a casual players perspective:<br />
1.  Fix Shaman healing!  <br />
If i could get Breath of Trushar to go with Yoppa's, I'd be basically happy with my healing ability.<br />
<br />
2.  Improve shaman DPS and burst DPS.  <br />
Spirit of Leopard addressed this.<br />
<br />
3.  AE Malos or lose the insane recast delay on Malos. <br />
Would be nice, but if Balance of the Nihil was more reasonably obatinable, wouldn't be really necessary for my playstyle.<br />
<br />
4.  Make FA less of a hassle, 25 minute duration, 5 second recast. <br />
So they made SoL even more annoying than FA.  Doesn't look promising.<br />
<br />
5.  An upgrade or addition to Cannibalization.<br />
I don't have an issue with this at my play level<br />
 <br />
6.  Add direct combat effects to all of our level 60+ stat buffs. <br />
Hmm, SoL was a direct combat effect.  I'd take that over some gimp effect added to stat buffs.<br />
 <br />
7.  Reduce DoT aggro! <br />
Much less important with SoL<br />
 <br />
8.  Endurance regen buff. <br />
Nice idea I guess, but SoL will increase DPS, which is the main purpose of endurance for the &quot;melee&quot; classes.<br />
 <br />
9. Shaman Survivability, <br />
I group in guild mostly, and our tanks are competent.  Not a big issue at my play level.   There are several things listed here I'd like and this is probably the biggest area they need to focus on.<br />
  <br />
10. TGB &quot;Target Group Buff&quot; Group shrink spell <br />
I don't raid, not important to me.<br />
<br />
Basically with Spirit of Leopard the way it was (even with a reduced pet proc rate), if I could get the runes for BoT and BoN to actually drop off the sewer or Vxed named, i'd be basically happy with my power level.  The nerf of SoL brings 2, 4, 6, and 7 back to higher prominence.  Rain spells suck, we usually have mezzed mobs in camp(by bard mez, so they don't stand still).  VP change is nice, as is the HoT heal messages, but the nerf to SoL obliterates any minor happiness those changes might bring.<br />
<br />
At level 68, with less than 100 aa's, the only big issue I had after SoL was added, was the obtainablity of GoD spells.  Nerfing SoL brings a whole bunch of issues to higher importance and I have no confidence SOE can fix any of them right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>keltor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Hehehe very nice, Ten.<br />
<br />
One way to look at it.... they took care of some our issues on our top 10 list when they released SoL/P.<br />
<br />
Now they gonna mitigate it.<br />
<br />
It's like magic.... list here.... list partially gone... list here again.  Shazam !!!</div></div><hr />

It did take them way too long to admit that poison spells had extra aggro... and even then it was like <br />
<br />
&quot;its not our fault that it gives yu more aggro... we'll look into it, in the mean time... er... cast it less&quot;<br />
