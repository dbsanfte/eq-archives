<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I didn't have much time, due to the patch today, but I was able to start on a new project of mine. I've always been a firm believer in AC, thinking it makes a great deal of different to tanking. Shamam's parses in BoT showed there was actually very little difference, so I thought I'd try mobs in Nadox to see if there was any effect on mobs with a much lower ATK (and level).<br />
<br />
My target was a level 50 (so barely DB) troll guardian, which normally doubles for 135 at most. My combat AAs consist of LR5 and CS1; this had been the first time fighting these mobs since I had CS1, and eventually once I have CS3 I intend to repeat the experiment. My AGI in both cases was 255.<br />
<br />
I fought the mob, unslowed, for a shade over 10 minutes. When parsing, I used the data from the mob's first swing to exactly 10 minutes afterwards. I know it's a very small sample, but hopefully around 500 swings is enough to draw some sort of conclusion. I intend to complete tests for 1025 AC and 825 AC as well, with a 625 AC parse if I can stay alive long enough!  ;) <br />
<br />
(Edit: 625 was a pain to get to, literally. For the rest, Virtue, Bramblecoat and VotB were up, with the only changes in AC being due to raw AC changes.)<br />

1025 AC, 255 AGI<br />
Total damage: 23339, 38.9 DPS<br />
Attempted hits: 504<br />
Successful hits: 310, or 260 ex bash/kick<br />

Min hit: 38 (x56)<br />
Average hit: 82<br />
<br />
http://www.medvale.fsnet.co.uk/825.jpg <br />
825 AC, 255 AGI<br />
Total damage: 26765, 44.7 DPS<br />
Attempted hits: 526<br />
Successful hits: 321, or 272 ex bash/kick<br />
Misses: 194 (37%)<br />
Dodges: 11 (2%)<br />
Max hit: 135 (x52)<br />
Min hit: 38 (x33)<br />
Average hit: 91<br />
<br />
Note: I clicked off Virtue and Bramblecoat for this one, with the result that Q struggled to keep up. The test ran for only 5 minutes, as I had run out of mana by the end. The raw values are listed, then the doubled values to simulate a 10-minute test as with the rest.<br />
http://www.medvale.fsnet.co.uk/631.jpg <br />
631 AC, 247 AGI<br />
Total damage: 17049, 56.8 DPS<br />
Attempted hits: 265<br />
Successful hits: 173, or 150 ex bash/kick<br />
Misses: 87 (33%)<br />
Dodges: 5 (1.9%)<br />
Max hit: 135 (x79)<br />
Min hit: 38 (x2)<br />
Average hit: 114<br />
<br />
Assuming everything had stayed the same, the values for 10 minutes would have been:<br />
<br />
Total damage: 34098, 56.8 DPS<br />
Attempted hits: 530<br />
Successful hits: 346, or 300 ex bash/kick<br />
Misses: 174 (33%)<br />
Dodges: 10 (1.9%)<br />
Max hit: 135 (x158)<br />
Min hit: 76 (x2)<br />
Average hit: 114<br />
<br />
By and large, I'd expected the frequency of hits to be more skewed towards lower values at a higher AC:<br />

<br />
The source data is available here (http://www.medvale.fsnet.co.uk/log.zip) <br />
<br />
As a conclusion, 631 AC was... horrible. Even in 5 minutes, the number of max hits was greater than those in 10 minutes with 825 or more AC! There was a noticable difference between 631, 825 and 1025 AC, with a much smaller change above that. It looks like there is a point of diminishing returns above 1000 AC, at least as far as Nadox mobs go.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yes kinda sad that 200 ac doesnt make any difference:( this is why caster can if they have the same hp tank as well as us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">each armorclass has different &quot;modifiers&quot; to their ac<br />
1 ac is much more for a plate class than a chain class<br />
1 ac is much more for a chain class to a silk class<br />
<br />
so when you have both a shaman and a mage with same hp and ac, the shaman will live longer (cept the shaman gehts the quadding mob that is  :cool: )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, I've finished the parsing and updated my original post. It looks like those who said aim for 1000 AC and don't worry after that were right...  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">While I appreciate your efforts at compiling the data, I do not agree with your conclusions entirely.<br />
<br />
PoP mobs have a much higher attack value than your tested Nadox mob and I feel the AC threshold is dynamic, not fixed.  So that the AC value should be higher on higher mob attack values.  In short, while your conclusion is likely bang on for pre-pop and the mob you tested against, the numbers change for higher attack value mobs.  Against some PoP mobs ACs below 1400 show similar characteristics that you see in your test at the 1025 level, placing the &quot;cap&quot; for diminishing returns 400 AC higher than your test shows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Warrior parses have show that what is effective ac is definitely dependant on the mob. The mobs attack, for lack of anything better to call it, and probably level definitely effect how your ac effects things. Xegony for example has been parsed quite a bit since it's a 45+ minute fight anyway. The parses have show that for xegony the point where it really starts making a difference is around 1900ac and it shows a steady decrease in dps of about 10% for every 100 ac up to at least 2200ac.<br />
<br />
I've always felt that ac's effectiveness is a s curve. Relatively flat below a point where your just getting hammered ever which way and it doesn't really matter. You then reach a point where it really starts making a difference and starts making noticable shifts on average hits and dps. Then on the top end it flattens out. Things have skewed towards mostly lower hits and further ac doesn't decrease it signficantly more. For shaman we're typically an expansion or 2 behind as far as obtainable ac compaired to the cut off points. I figure by the end of GoD shaman will be able to get the 2k+ac to be able to tank PoP gods well =)<br />
<br />
Where that curve is depends on the mob. Thats one thing that pop did seem to change. Unlike SoL where all raid mobs seem to be so high attack that it was hard to get to the bottom of that curve, pop definitely allows tanks to get to the point where thier ac is effective and it is definitely a noticable difference.</div></div><hr />
