<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Contagion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was thinking about checking this zone out.<br />
I have read a little bit about it here on the existing posts that mention it, but I was wondering if anyone had any more information.<br />
Has anyone really spent much time here?  Or is it just a waste of time/effort?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lillad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I came here the first day it came out. I have been maybe 2 times since... Because I got the Ring of Firewarding within the first 4 minutes of the zone appearing, I have had really no desire to go (ring still on magelo. Fits in nicely with SCRM considering I said screw it to coldain shawl). I was lucky enough to get the named before anyone else. The zone, first off, is a bit of a pain to get to unless you fought in SolB a lot. The Lava into the zone will do less with Resist to Fire IIRC. Once in the zone I spose you can side with the kobolds or the goblins. There are 2 different ways out of the lava once zoned in. The Right side brings you to kobolds (killing them gives goblin faction) or the Left side brings you to fire goblins (killing them gives kobold faction). The AA exp isn't terrible but Hard LDoNs is better exp and loot most of the times. Also adventure points are nice to get. Some decent drops can come off the nameds though. Few people venture into it anymore so if you die you may eat a rez or take forever retrieving corpse. Easy to solo but as you get further in the pulls become more and more. Took 2 with ease, 3 drained all my mana, 4 I gated and haven't returned since. There are some minor traps where mobs spawn in puddles or whatever. That's about all I remember. Commence finding my mistakes....now....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Used to practically live in this zone when it first came out, now just a few trips for twinks/PL'ing.<br />
<br />
Hard LDoN does give more xp-wise, but this zone I find truely FUN and enjoyable. (nice self paced dungeon crawl)<br />
<br />
Names usually spawn at a decent repop rate.  Occasionally you won't have a named in a clearing or 2, but that is rare.  From SolB side (in upper bugs) you zone into the kobold side, from SolA you zone into gobbies.  Note: When zoning from SolB, if you stay above the lava you will zone into SolA.  Swim under to hit solc.  Also, succor takes you to the sola/gobbie side zoneline.<br />
<br />
As mentioned the most notable pice is the Ring of Firewarding<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=55233<br />
This drops from Spiritmaster Heili (kobold).  He's in the 1st room left of zone in (all the way back).  Room usually has 2 other kobolds in there with him.  He is a set 4 hour spawn.  Can also drop 2hs http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=55234<br />
and 1hs http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=55239  The ring is is rare drop, 2hs seems to be most common.<br />
<br />
Most of the names have certain areas that they spawn more often in, however, ANY model of that type can spawn the names.  Goo, Mephit, Imp, Fire Elem, Kobold, Goblin, Beetle.  Not sure about the fire giant (Typhoeus, or something like that - he may be a set PHer)<br />
<br />
Goo (Pulsating Pool of Magma) drops necklace of the mirage seeker (rare)  http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=55225 The good hide under the lava pools.  Can usually just barely see their 'eyes?' peeking out.  Otherwise, you don't know until they charge you.  The 1st pool just past the kobolds is a 3 spawn.  All 3 at once can be fun, and if one is the named, it's very interesting fight.  Usually, the spots under bridges are where the goos hide out.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mephit (Kurshara Perecaran) drops all/all sleeves http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=55218 and dagger http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=55228<br />
<br />
Kobold (Tybog Aladmond) drops BST/MNK 2hb (rare) http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=55262  and caster/priest shawl (common) http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=55216 Tybog is by far the most common pop in SolC.  Rarely a spawn set goes by w/o him.  Seen him pop 3+ times in one set (continuously clearing).<br />
<br />
Imp (Erpar Flamegar) drops all/all ring (common) http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=55214 and all/all mask (rare) http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=55232<br />
<br />
Fire Elem (servent of flames) drops CLR/PAL/SHD slield http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=55227<br />
<br />
Goblin (Xaon Bulzekle) drops all/all shoulders (rare) http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=55229 and caster belt (common) http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=55223 <br />
<br />
Beetle (Gigantic Ashwalker) drops plate boots (common) http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=55219 mask (all minus war, int caster) (rare) http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=55231<br />
<br />
Fire Giant (Typhoeus) drops cleric hammer (rare) http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=55230 and plate BP(common) http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=55217<br />
<br />
The Ring of Fire even is found just past (left) of the tenticle terror mobs.  It's 8 (?) fire elems standing in a circle around a large lava pool.  If ring is active, when last one dies, you get a message (if standing close enough, small range) about &quot;somethig stirring under the lava&quot;... Then there's a 4 pop (lvl 65), then a 2 pop (yellow con, 66-67) then the named, Protector of Fire (red con).  He mitigates slow, and can really hurt your tank if not really on the ball before it gets slowed.  One groupable.  Protector drops int caster bracer (common) http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=55250  all/all neck (very rare) http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=55251 <br />
<br />
<br />
Also, Quested, with a drop off most models (1 type each) is a 1hs http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=55234 IIRC from Kobolds (raise faction slaughtering gobbies, can be MQ'd)<br />
<br />
And a CoF clone haste cloak &quot;Flame etched cloak&quot; http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=61238 (dont recall which faction atm)<br />
<br />
(((still at work, almostb got caught goofin off, will update as I can)))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Contagion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wow, Thanks for all the info.<br />
Just how soloable is the zone? Avg Mob hits for how much?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wow, Thanks for all the info.<br />

<br />
It is soloable at 65, however I personally loath soloing, so I've never done it.  But duo'd with SK or Pally is quite easy.  Hardest part is the pulls.  The initial pull from zone in, and in spots like the 1st goo encounter, are very hard to single. Paci doesnt work on the goo, being they are under lava.  Resists aren't too bad, fully slowable (until the Ring of Fire event).  Hits seem to range 150-350 depending on mob.<br />
<br />
You should be able to get to Spiritmaster fairly easily if an experienced solo'er.  The kobolds come in 3 varieties.  War, Wiz, and shaman.  IIRC, the wizzies are the see invis ones (definately not a reliable travel method here).<br />
<br />
And as Lillad mentioned CR's here are just a pita.  But I cheat, I box with my SK =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Osrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Where is the ZI to Sol C located? I've looked around at various maps on the web but none of them have it listed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I cant access any map sites from work, stupid blocking software.  I'll try and post one soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Osrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I cant access any map sites from work, stupid blocking software.  I'll try and post one soon.<br />
<br />
I found the ZI last night. It was actually labeled on my in-game map. <br />
<br />
I managed to break the first 2 Kobolds and clear some others. I got 1% in 59 for every 2 mobs solo. Tybog was up near ZI but I couldn't clear quick enough to get him. Also he would have come w/ a shm mob and since he conned even I didn't bother pushing it.<br />
<br />
I'm gonna talk my 65 (300+AA) war buddy to come here sometime to see if Spiritmaster Heili is up. Would we be able to duo him? I'd imagine we could since we've duo'd in tactics, droga, gwurms...etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm assuming that I can dou here with my 65 ranger, With just our buffs I push 4k hps and 4k mana and hes around 5k hp's and 1150ish ac. Some semi decent loot here by the looks and I'm always looking for neat and interesting spots to dou/farm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My one trip to SolC was a mixed bag.<br />
<br />
Zoneing in was a freaking NIGHTMARE.  People would try to zone in from SolB and not make it through so end up in SolA...would then turn right around and try to zone in and would end up in SolC.  End result was people scattered in both parts of SolC, took us AN HOUR to get all three of us zoned in and in the right spot (Kobold side).<br />
<br />
If it sounds confusing try to explain it in game to people who've never been there.<br />
<br />
Once we got in and set up it was fun, party was just three of us: 65 Druid, 65 Shaman 65 Shaman and we did fine.  Crawled all the way back to Heili, took him down and Druid got the nice ring.<br />
<br />
Havent gone back, I still get a facial tic when I think of trying to get a full grp of 6 to zone in together. :)</div></div><hr />

Many entrances into SolC but they are UNDER LAVA.  Find one of the zonelines that take you from SolA to SolB or from SolB to SolA and if it requires you to swim thru lava, the zin to SolC is UNDER LAVA.<br />
<br />
Sorry, Im not playing right now so I cant give you a loc.  In SolB, it is on the way to Naggy's lair and right before you get to the first two turban headed fire giants facing each other.  As you stand on a rock bridge right before those two, if you turn 90 degrees to your left, you will see a lavafall.  Jump or lev to the top of it and then swim down UNDER LAVA until you zone.  You will find yourself in SolC.  If you are in SolA, you werent UNDER LAVA.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tehp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've recently been to Sol C to farm Rings of Firewarding.  I boxed my SK for the first one on a Saturday morning.  The pulls aren't a problem, pets can single pulls just make sure to stand far enough away so that the mob doesn't get you on the aggro list too soon.  For some reason they don't assist when it's just the pet attcking them.  Call the pet back with the /pet hold AA and you're golden, BAM one mob!  I would snare the mob when it got far enough away from his buddies to avoid their assist.  Been using this trick quite frequently.  When I spammed my brand new ring in guild, everyone else wanted one so I took a few more peeps down and got 2 more over the course of a couple days.  The ring dropped for me 33.3 percent of the time, as did each of the weapons that the Spiritmaster drops.  Since I was boxing, I bound at the zone in area, yes you can bind here, which made escaping easier.  Spiritmaster down, get loot, gate to zone, either camp or spiritstone out, then run SK through by flopping out or training.  I would kill fairly fast on the 22 minute respawn and only get 2 respawn at the beginning.  But there's the gate thing so you can avoid the fighting once it's all over  :D .  I am dubious to fire goblins now and I retire from Sol C.  Unless there's some other crazy lewt down there I could use, but I don't see much yet.  I am scared to click those links above because I do not want to go back.  Lots of nice words and runes drop here too if that interests you, :) rare ones.  Made some cash off those.</div></div><hr />
