I'm really leaning toward the Cloak of Scales for the HP/Mana, but the Lodi shield has better AC, EB and nice resists. Which one would you guys use?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm..depends on what your ac is now.<br />
<br />
If, you don't fall below one of the AC lines(1000/950/900) from taking the lodi shield off, I'd say go with the cloak..just for the hp/mana.<br />
<br />
*EDIT*<br />
<br />
Nm, just looked at your magelo profile.  keep the cloak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lodi shield by a long shot.  Better ac, has resists (the 3 most crucial ones imo), and eb effect.  Permanent eb can come in very useful sometimes, and most of the eb items out there has crap stats like fb earring, amulet of the grey wastes, and ancient fishing pole (I'd like to see a pallie with one of those).  So not only does lodi shield have great stats, but it's an extra plus in places where you need eb because you won't need to sacrifice any stats by otherwise using a pretty awful item stat-wise just for the eb effect.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there are a few other eb items with nice stats (like lodi ring for one), but I'd keep lodi shield at all costs.  Incredible stats for a back item with a combination of AC/wis/resists, all of which are vital for a high level shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Like most other equipment choices, it will likely completely depend on your gear situation and your goals.<br />
<br />
I made this same choice when we randomly killed Inny a few weeks ago.  I could have had the cloak of scales if I wanted it, he dropped 2.  Ended up giving these cloaks to a SK and a Necro (nice nice cloak for an iksar necro :) ).<br />
<br />
I kept the Lodi because the AC loss would have dropped me under 1000ac.  I already sacrifice a lot for HPs, but decided that 1000ac would be the lowest I would go.  That's my reason.<br />
<br />
Also, since I dedicate most of my other slots to HP/sta items, I don't have a ton of resist gear on... 20 FR/CR and 10MR on an item is awfully nice.  EB is just convenient.  One less piece of alternate gear I have to carry.<br />
<br />
..and, if I was going for pure HP, I guess I would probably look at the Hiero cloak.  It has 75hp/mana 4+ all stats and drops in the seb crypt, not off a God, as weakass as he might be.<br />
<br />
Hiero 10ac, ~87hp, ~99mana.<br />
Scales 15ac, ~50hp, ~110mana.<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">nice to see another iksar shaman :)<br />
<br />
i wear herio cloak usually, and have a lodizal in my resist gear for pvp or mobs with AE :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I do the same as Dann, btw where does that scale mesh gear come from Dann?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">think it was from that mob we call Rhag2 in Ssra, have to kill a Rhag on first floor then go up the ramp near entrance and up a tube to get to the 2nd one.    It might have been the first one, cantremember exactly..   one of those two guys :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">BTW, does anyone else but me think the races on Cloak of Scales is a DB error? (happened about the time Luclin came out and Vah Sir got added to a lot of stuff, coinkidink).  They didnt make the other race specific Inny drops wearable by all relevant races.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">50 hp for 50 points of resists.  <br />
<br />
If you REALLY want hp get a Heiro and either way, it comes down to whether you value/need resists.  If your resists are already pimped or you enjoy hauling bags of gear around go for the Heiro. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i think i'd go with the cloak over the lodizal shield.  shield would go in a bag and come out for EB or resists.<br />
<br />
but i don't need resists as much anymore :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Goodbrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i'm just happy i picked up an Acrylia Studded Cloak last night for 2k.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Heh...geez, I feel very un-uber right now!  My biggest cloak decision lately was whether to wear a shimmering terrorhide cloak, or a 13 ac 5 wis cloak that I saw.  I went with the terrorhide, just because Im a hp whore.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Browu Frostforge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Cloak of Truth (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7483)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">LOL, I have the same &quot; Uber &quot; cloak as Goodbrew. And he's 20 levels lower than me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Id wear the cloak of scales if i were you.  If you really need saves or are in the rare eb situation, then put the shield on.  Id dont care what your saves/ac is, if you walk around with 1500hp your going to die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Thanks for your input guys, really some interesting perspectives.  I think I will keep the Claok of Scales for most xping unless I need the resists or AC like you guys suggested. Sounds like I ought to check out a Hiero cloak or Net of the Deep Sea though. Thanks again for the input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">on sullon zek, everyone has a couple bags of resist gear, if they dont have insane resists in their standard set up anyway :)   <br />
<br />
not like weight is an issue.. i have mystic pouch, treasure hunter satchel, 2 tinker bags and a rallic pack :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Dont know about you but i sure as heck wouldnt give up 8 ac for a lousy 50hp 50 mana.  Lod shield gets my vote</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">i wish i could find a quest that converted my ac to hp :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">resists are overrated imo, just get some resist gear for dragons or mobs you really need them for. i'd go with the scale cloak, i'm a sucker for hp :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I like the lodi shield because I love being able to have bad things happen like going LD in the Grey or Kedge Keep and not having to worry that when I come back, my EB will be gone.  Sometimes I've been in the game dying underwater a LONG time before the game suddenly activates my character(ever seen two or three tells on you the INSTANT you get into the game, before people even should have had time to see you, much less type out a tell and send it?).  <br />
<br />
I remember when people were saying the shaman was all about wisdom, then some started saying AC, and there was a long war about which was better, and now finally it seems so many people don't care about anything but HP anymore.  Not me.<br />
<br />
I'll take all the AC I can until I get quite a bit more.  Lodi fills the bill on that nicely.  And the resists on it are uber(20 to fire and cold is really excellent, and magic can be hard to raise without wearing specific MR items).<br />
<br />
I'd probably take a heiro if I wasn't wearing a lodi.</div></div><hr />
