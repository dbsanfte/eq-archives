<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tiggly Stiggly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if you guys had any ideas where we could fight. We both are twinked, but are just running out of places to hunt. We currently are in DL right now, but it's really sloooow! Any ideas you guys throw out are greatly appreciated! Thanks! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you guys are twinked and arent too concerned about loot then I would suggest Kedge first floor. After you've cleared it try pulling the second. Good exp.<br />
<br />
There's also the kodiak caves in GD, you guys could hold both pretty easy. Easy kills mediocre exp, again no lewt.<br />
<br />
I would hit lower guk for some nostalgia and fun too.<br />
<br />
A really good spot would be the Mokon camp in Gunthaks too. Decents loots ok exp.<br />
<br />
Then again I dont know of anywhere with the exception of solo kills of the mobs on the second floor of kedge that will give you more than 1% per kill at level 40.<br />
<br />
Hows that for a couple suggestions?</div></div><hr />
