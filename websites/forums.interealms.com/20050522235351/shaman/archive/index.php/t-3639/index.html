<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">On my server like some others there seems to be this unwritten rule that clerics do all the looting and get all the gems.  Normally I never thought twice about it...either I never paid much attention to the drops or just assumed that the clerics were being fair on what dropped.  Items were usually rolled on but gems and platinum were usually not paid much attention to.<br />
<br />
The argument has always been one of clerics use peridots so this pays them for that.  Well last night for the first time in a long time I went to Seb with some guildies and did the looting for our group.  Within a couple hours at disco/library we had amassed some 15+ gems and 500+ in PP. Many of the gems were diamonds and 100pp rings. Our total haul was probably in the range of 2-3k of gems and platinum.<br />
<br />
I always wondered why clerics were among the first on my server to afford 100k horses and now I think I know why ;)<br />
<br />
How is this handled on your server?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Inside Seb the first 3 gems are given to Clerics to cover Dots, the rest are usually handed out in alphabetically order.  I'm told on other servers it's only 2 gems but my specific server was having a hard time getting clerics in there so they upped it to draw more clerics to the zone.   Plat we usually have on autosplit unless there's a monk in the group.<br />
<br />
Good question, I've been meaning to ask about this too.  Is what I've been told about other servers true?   I'm on Solusek Ro.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmmm I am on Vazaelle and I have rarely ever seen a cleric loot much of anything.  My main is a rogue so I am usually master looting... maybe thats why..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sure, clerics get lots of gem drops in OS, but what about zones where there isn't as much cash loot?  If they make some money in OS, that will help out when they go to the next dungeon where they are still expected to aego/symbol but there isn't a lot of cash loot to cover expenses.<br />
<br />
If everyone carried around their own stacks of dots, this wouldn't be an issue, but as long as the majority of us expect aego and symbol from the clerics we group with, it's only fair to expect them to recoup the expense.  If they make a bit more money, I don't have a problem with that.<br />
<br />
Generally, I only group with friends and they are good about covering costs with the first 2-3 gems and then doing alpha with the rest and splitting plat at the end of the night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I absolutely agree with your methods of first 2 to 3 gems go to cleric then alpha...no problems with that as it is only fair...<br />
<br />
What I am talking about is all gems automatically going to cleric as on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Completely random in nearly all groups i am in... is there is a ninja, then he gets told in /group to pack it in. I usually loot all and hand out evenly depending on performance, and always 2 biggest to the cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If a cleric is taking all the gems, I just shrug it off.  Most of the clerics I know are the opposite of rich, yet they always have dots to symbol/aego the schmoes that expect it, yet refuse to carry their own gems.<br />
<br />
gems in OS = funding for dots for ALL exp groups, even lousy outdoor ones with NO loot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The only problem I have with that, Gloriana, is that I don't think it's my responsibility to cover a Cleric's XP'ing costs for the week. For the time I'm with them, sure, I cover my own expenses but when they're on tomorrow or next Thursday? Not my problem. <br />
<br />
The few Sebilis groups I did on Stormhammer and Xev really depended on the make up of the groups. Some were completely /random for the gems, some were first 2 to the Cleric and the rest /random and some were alpha. The only constant throughout all of them was that the dots were covered, usually by me and my handy stack of 'em sitting in the 3rd bag down on the left in my inventory ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Cleric should get first 2 or 3 gems, then just split everything else evenly.  Anything is way out of whack.<br />
<br />
casting group symbol or aego takes 4 dots.  It lasts a damn long time.  Pretend that due to dispells, death, etc... they go through 5 dots an hour.  That means a stack will last them 4 hours (under bad circumstances).  A stack of dots costs me just over 200pp with CHA buffed (I always carry a stack for emergencies/unprepared clerics).<br />
<br />
3 gems usually comes out to about 400pp.  thats enough dots for 8 hours, which is much longer than most groups stay together.  Usually after 2-3 hours, the cleric will be in a new group getting a fresh set of gems.  This is fine, though, b/c there are plenty of times the clerics uses mountains of dots and gets nothing.<br />
<br />
Getting more than 3 gems or so, is silly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The nice thing about this is you don't need a cleric in Sebilis. Boot the cleric, keep the gems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sorry to stray off subject a bit but, why in the hell would anyone WANT to be a cleric ? I can't think of a more boring class to play. I played one to 7 and said no thanks ! Got bored and I was mildly twinked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah, maybe that's the reason I feel the way I do about gem loot.  It's like, &quot;ohmygod, thank you so much for playing that extremely boring class without ANY utility spells and rezzing me when I need it and paying cash out of your own pocket to buff me and making our raids successful and having the WORST EPIC QUEST EVER. Would you like a fire emerald?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">When in Seb (At guard and ikkie jail in particular, since these are the spots where the gem drops are heaviest), I usually am nominated to be ML...since there is usually an evaccer, when the group is done, we'll hit WC, I'll sell everything, give the cleric their out-of-pocket expenses for peridots directly, and split the rest among the whole group.<br />
<br />
Since these splits are usually 1-2k apiece, I've never gotten any complaints.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">What I like to do is have myself (56 Wizard) loot, not much to do between pulls anyway. Then at the end of the day we port to wc/fay I sell all the gems, pay the cleric for their dots (buy them if we go to fay) then do an even split of cash, roll for first pick of drops and diamond, bd, bs. Works great for me and is totally fair. Only problem is when peeps leave early, but usually not an issue in Seb as you don't go lfg in seb, you bring a group(server still only 2 months old :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Seb used to be a big scam insofar as that gem deal. Clerics were leaving with 10K worth of Gems and Jewelry for casting 1K worth of symbols.<br />
<br />
It's not my responsibility to fund their guild raids, or their groups outside of the time frame I am with them.<br />
<br />
A Cleric goes to Velks and whines about the gems?<br />
<br />
Tough. Don't cast symbol.<br />
<br />
On Xev it's 2-3 gems and that's IT. Then we alpha the remainder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">On Tarew it usually depends on the Cleric you're with. Some will bitch and scream if they don't get *all* gems. Others will take the first 5 or so, and they say they've got plenty to cover the Peris they'll cast during that group, and let everyone else take the rest. A lot depends on whether they're 60 or not, as Aego lasts a lot longer than a Symbol would, and therefore costs them less Peri-wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">On Veeshan at the end the main looter splits all plat, then gives the Cleric extra gems from the split depending on how many dropped \ how long you were there, like if in something like crypt and got maybe 5 gems total in a few hours...just give em all to cleric cause not enough to split really, but then if in necrosis and lets say in 5 hours you have 30 gems drop, give most of the group 4-5 each (5 if ya give em cheapies 4 for more expensive gems to even it out), and then whatever is left all go to cleric.  Of course that is excluding diamonds \ BDs.  Then again, I never worry about this anymore hehe, when I'm in seb I either solo or bring along a monk \ mage friend who will let me keep all BDs and they get all the others (working on getting 2 stacks of BDs to get a suit of rallos armor for my war).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I've only heard on Innoruuk that the cleric is the ML and from the stories I've heard, everyone else in the group gets like 3 gems, and the cleric gets the rest. Then splits the money, also taking a larger split. Not sure but a lot of people say how bad it is so I'm thinking *some* of it is true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kailyn of Povar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Seb on Povar...well 1) I can never imagine leaving the place to sell loots after every group broke up...I have turned over 20 people at guard in a hour. <br />
<br />
I usually give 1/2 the gems to clerics for a while, so they show a nice profit, as I am not the best about paying for dots as we go...adn cash the rest. Crowns and the like I keep and valuable gems, probably just BDs now, we rand for.</div></div><hr />

Simple.  If you really need that extra 600hp anyway, there's probably something wrong.  Hero or Glades is more than enough HP for most XP groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>eepjr24</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">First off, let me say that I don't do OS much, but I do other places that drop money gems. I have a cleric, and symbols cost money. I have been in groups where they give all gems to the cleric, but I usually just tell them to split after 2-3. I would like the extra money, sure, but I would rather have groups know I am fair and invite me back. I try to always keep symbol on those that need/want it. On raids, I usually ask leader how he plans to do symbol costs. If it is reasonable, fine. If not, I can always switch over to soloing my shaman. ;)<br />
<br />
As to the whole &quot;clerics are boring&quot; debate, I like them, but my cleric was my first EQ character. I am enjoying the shaman as well, being able to solo, canna, debuff, slow, and melee are nice. Mostly I end up playing the cleric when someone needs him or I need a group in a place where clerics get groups easy. I am guessing that I will end up playing the shaman more, but only time will tell.<br />

normally i dont like grouping with clerics.  they seem to just take up space and gems from the group IMO.  great for rezes tho.:)<br />
(except on raids of course)<br />
<br />
exp groups shouldn't need symbol in the first place.  focus+potg or somthing is just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>fnord</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I'm going to chalk up alot of what I'm seeing here to ignorance, sheer ignorance.<br />
<br />
One statement screams of ignorance, and thats the one about symbols being a waste in exp groups or not to cast symbol. That would be like shaman not slowing the mob or hasting the melees, how long would you remain in your group if you refused to do one of your jobs? <br />
<br />
How many of you have played a Cleric to 50+? You do realize that its not until 50+ that Clerics can have even a shred of hope that the people they're exp grinding with even know what ML is much less be willing to do it.<br />
<br />
The reason Clerics get more loot at the end of the group at 50+ is for these reasons:<br />
<br />
1) Symbol gems are expensive.<br />
2) Spells are expensive.<br />
3) SoW potions are expensive (or JB MQ).<br />
4) Its compensation for the previous forty levels where the Cleric got absolutely nothing but 5cp splits everytime the melees had ninja looting competitions, yet had to rely on said melees to see their exp bar move.<br />
<br />
My Cleric very, very rarely had more than 2k in the bank until I got 50+. You never get to loot, you spend most of your time sitting on your ass and you won't find excitement in your class until you start raiding (even that only lasts for so long). Of course on raids where you're almost garunteed a death, then the Cleric becomes your best friend, right?<br />
<br />
I can only assume (and hope!) that the posters here are of the mental caliber to not respond with &quot;just rez for plat&quot; as a rebuttal, heh. Jeez, feel like I'm on a druid forum or something. I normally find this forum very informative for working on my baby Shaman, but there are just some flat out dumb comments in this thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">&lt;--- has a stack of dots in bag for my aego when soloing<br />
<br />
<br />
for me :<br />
Hp = Mana<br />
Aego = a lot of HP<br />
so Aego = a lot of mana<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
Mana = experience<br />
so <br />
Aego = more experience (or faster)<br />
<br />
so<br />
<br />
I think it's normal that cleric get money to cover their dots in a pickup xp group..<br />
Like I gladly accept an emerald (no primal avatar) each time a melee want to have fun with Avatar in pickup xp group.<br />

<br />
Total bull**** pal.  99% of the XP grinds i do, my max HP is TOTALLY IRRELEVANT, because i'm never at it.  Whether my warrior has 4600hp or 5400hp makes ZERO difference in an XP group outside of CT.  Whether my shaman has 2800hp or 3400hp makes ZERO difference outside of CT.  Can you understand that?<br />
<br />
There is NO reason to cast a symbol in a gimp ass place like Seb or Chardok.  Once that mob is slowed, if it does more than a bubbles worth of damage to anyone in the group, he got lucky.  Wasting a friggin peridot for an extra buffer of HP is totally pointless if you never drop below about half life thanks to regen rate.<br />
<br />
You call me ignorant, I call me efficient with my money.  Maybe someone is a little too spoiled on the symbols, but they are definitely not required.</div></div><hr />

Your rebuttal relies on a slower being in every exp group. Play a Cleric, then tell me the best way to do it. <br />
<br />

You're a fool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Vaaxx:  considering the class that gives you 600hps from a symbol is the same one that can cast *Complete Heal* on you, I would think that 600 hps is a nice little boost to the mana pool. <br />
<br />
If they're gonna be in the group, I'd like the extra HPs.  Isn't that the one stat that everyone and their dogdog keeps obsessing over?  Does anyone think that their Shadel Bandit ring or their 6/65HP rings are totally irrelevant in a xp group?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Heh, what the hell is so difficult to understand here?<br />
<br />
When a cleric joins my normal duo to XP in say chardok, or seb or grey or akheva, he nukes.  It takes 10 mobs for my warrior to go from full life to 1 bubble when the mob is slowed.  I gain a full blue of XP on each character before i have to torpor once when I duo.  When i'm with a cleric, he has MORE than enough time to med back the 350ish mana a CH costs him.  If he doesn't have a nuke loaded, he's in for a damned boring nite.<br />
<br />
So if I get a symbol, I need a CH every 12 mobs instead of every 10 mobs?  I'm sorry, but for that amount of mana savings, save yourself the peridot.  Is the extra HP nice?  Sure, I guess, if you like seeing big numbers.  But since XP grind is all about regen rate, it's totally unneccessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Borkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">One of my best in game friends being a cleric, I've learned the value of symbol.  Many times in our little xp groups (normally cleric, shaman, warrior, monk)  we would end a LOT of fights with most all of use hovering around the 300hp barrier..   and if I hadn't had symbol.. poof, there goes that 300hp and a new lizard corpse appears on the ground...<br />
<br />
<br />
More hp means more time/hp to xp with, therefore faster xp.  I know I keep focus on myself constantly now, because I want the hp, why wouldn't I want the hp from a symbol when its available?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>fnord</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Heh, what the hell is so difficult to understand here?<br />
<br />
I believe its because someone who is obviously ignorant of the class is telling others how to play it. Perhaps my level 25 Shaman should tell you the best way to play your class. I bet I would look like a big horses ass if I tried that.<br />
<br />
/me sniffs - Vaaxx, whats that aroma of ass around you?<br />
<br />
You're obviously out of touch with anyone who doesn't have NToV gear or something comparable. How quickly you've forgotten how much a tank without incredible gear appreciates the HP/AC boost a Cleric brings.<br />
<br />
If you think a warrior not wanting symbol is representative of the majority of tanks out there, you are sorely out of touch with most players. <br />
<br />
My bank account proves it. Now please, stop trying to argue the point that extra AC and HP is a waste in exp groups, you look like a total fool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Dude...<br />
<br />
In raids...<br />
HP &gt; All<br />
<br />
I am not debating this with you.<br />
<br />
In XP grinds<br />
Regen &gt; all.<br />
<br />
I have a 47 ac, 10 stamina 90hp breastplate on my warrior, and I also have a fungi tunic.  Guess which one I wear when I XP.<br />
<br />
If you say &quot;the champions breastplate because it has more AC and HP&quot; you're a ****in moron.  The extra 26 ac and 150hp is totally irrelevent to the XP grind because I DON'T TAKE DAMAGE.  Mob slowed + regrowth + fungi +aa regen = No damage taken on low blue mobs.  If you are in CT, like I said, then that's an area where HP matters a little more.  If i'm fighting a dink transient in akheva who does &quot;maybe&quot; 800 damage in attacks over the course of a fight, and I regen 500 of it back during the fight, and another 150 while I go grab another mob, you wasting 10.5pp a symbol WILL NOT HELP ME KILL FASTER.<br />
<br />
Ever put group aegolism on a level 1 and let him go kill noob crap?  After an hour, is he at full life anymore? No.  Does he give a crap?  Probably not.  He doesn't sit down and heal to full after every mob, does he?  There are areas where you need an extra buffer of HP to survive.  I'm not debating that with you.  But if you NEED that extra buffer of HP to XP in akheva or the grey with a shaman slowing and a regrowth on (Like everyone on this board does), then you are doing something wrong.<br />
<br />
Is a symbol nice?  Sure.  Is it necessary?  Hardly.  Your bank account proves you group with wizards who can't control their aggro and NEED to be symboled.  If you're in an Xp group and you are CH'ing anyone but the main tank, your group is screwing up.  Tell them to learn to control their aggro.  Therefore, do you need a symbol on anyone but the main tank?   Max Hp only matters in situations where you use CH, and where you use it often.  You will not CH my warrior often with a shaman in the group in an XP group.  You will have more than enough time to med back the mana a CH costs you.  In that case, save yourself the plat.  I'm doing you a favor, you should be thanking me instead of insisting on wasting money.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hey Einstein, do you have any idea how much downtime there is after doing one rez? That extra HP has saved lives and downtime more often than I can count. If you were a Cleric, you might actually know this.<br />
<br />
Say anything you want, rationalize and split hairs all you want, it doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
You're still out of touch with most players if you think symbol isn't a necessity. You don't know what you're talking about because you haven't experienced it first hand.<br />
<br />
I can watch a show on TV and gain a basic understanding of whats going on, but experience first hand is always a better teacher. Its obvious by your posts that you haven't experienced it first hand, this is painfully obvious by the fact that you assume every group has someone to slow the mobs' attacks. Your initial arguement was almost solely based on that fact alone! /boggle<br />
<br />
Come down off that cloud sometime, I'm sure its nice up there and all but you're totally alienated from the average player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I have to agree that symbols are not really need an a luxury 90% of the time or more in exp camps. I mean the whole point of an EXP camp is to kill as many things as quickly as possible which naturally leads to killing the easiest things possible.<br />
<br />
Lets face it Sebilis or chardok or velks are not difficult dungeons where people normally hunt. Now if you where to head down to jugs for example instead of sitting up at necro/guard or d2/d1 there would be some call for symbols.<br />
<br />
Last time I was in sebilis with my enchanter we only had pinzarn for symbols because the cleric was out of reagents and I didn't feel giving the cleric dots since they weren't needed. We did fine with just pinzarn and I don't even think everyone had that even when we had as many as 5 or 6 mobs in camp at one time.<br />
<br />
Sure there are definitely people who ask for it no matter what but realistically symbols aren't really needed in most of sebilis or any other regular exp dungeon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>fnord</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">If you would like another example of symbols being a necessity, create a Cleric and try keeping an unbuffed Chanter alive in a dungeon before they reach the level of uberness that some people seem to be speaking from (regardless of the fact that those with uberness are a minority)<br />

<br />
You say symbol is worthless because it doesnt let you kill faster. Yet your warrior pulls?<br />
<br />
/laugh<br />
<br />
In chardok I pull. I also tend to take a ****load of damage over the course of a night. Sometimes slow is resisted. Sometimes I like to pull more than 1 mob. Sometimes I like to pull 5-6 mobs at once.<br />
<br />
Hell sometimes I get a little over my head and pull 8-10 at once. Ooops. (I warn em before I do this)<br />
<br />
Aego/Symbol will help keep me and my friends alive.  We don't have NtoV gear. We are not Uber. We never rode the coattails of other better players to get uber gear.  Yet we still have fun. <br />
<br />
You see some people don't grind out xp for the sole purpose of mix/maxing. Some of us actually go to places that are challanging for our equipment, and level and gear. some of us go places where death isnt from one person standing in the wrong spot, or missing a complete heal chain by a 3 second margin. Sometimes death is because we were pushing ourselves to Crawl through the mines of chardok with a level 48 ranger as the main tank.<br />
<br />
Amazing isn't it.  Us lesser beings actually get to breath the same air as you. Gosh, are we not blessed.<br />

Let clerics have most of the gems. Thiers is a thankless lot, where they spend thier time making sure YOU live. Where when **** hits the fan they go from 98% total boredom to OH SHUT! in the blink of an eye. And if something goes wrong, as it sometimes can, the cleric is the one that feels responsable. Even if it was not thier fault, a cleric that Chooses to play a cleric is probably also the type of person that watches out for and cares about thier fellow players a bit more than most.<br />
<br />
Maybe they get a few more plat for thier class choice, but they deserve it. Because they don't always play solely for themselves.<br />

and Play a lvl 57 clr I have to say that the MORE hps the better.<br />
More HPs allow u to cann more 600 hps more and thus making CH more mana efficent for both the shm and the clr. Not ever group Can have a Druid in it for their HP buffs. I mean why <br />
scrounge up for a clr or pester a clr and offer to &quot;DONATE&quot; for a rez when you can just group a clr and reassure that you have a rez after grinding and things go arye. I for one carry Jaspers to buf casters and DOTS to buff the MTs. Another reason for more HPs is for TRAINS. Always nice to have a few extra HPs for these in places that happen alot. Why not give the clr, and not being bias cause i dont need the PP, the gems for them to go and buy <br />
more DOTs so they can get into more groups and gain more exp and gain the coveted lvl of 56 and able to rez those that starve for this rez so darn much. In a whole ya have to be in a group that understand what an MT is and dont have other melee TAUNT and casters of all kinds that know how to manage ther aggro.<br />
It isnt a question of clrs can CH and give hps back its more a a question of the GREED that roams the game that wont allow PEOPLE in general to share the loots. Clrs always med and sit and dont have time to get up and do so. I know i dont and if something isd handed to me I accept it, BUT i dont group with groups that dont hand casters anything especially CLRS. I ws in a group on several occasions that near handed me every gem that dropped and groups that hand me gems here and there and in groups that split gems totally and groups that gave nothing.<br />
I was even in groups whn a group broke up each pl;ayer gave me one gem or enough gems to cover total gems used and this method is fine also. My clr being a twink was given everything by my shaman and my shm spent the PP or camping items etc etc <br />
and still deserve a small donation to compensate in the long run. its not easy being a clr and play a clr, ask any1 that has one post<br />
51+. And god forbid you arent lvl 56 and things hit the fan and they cant get a 96% rez and get a 90% rez ROFL. Clrs dont get to be a raiding clr of atleast lvl 46+ when they have to deal with PP, gem or item hording people that play the game. The game has become so filled with greed that people are rolling for items they cant use just cause their TWINK can and take away form the MAINS that would use such an item OR later find them auctioning them. Its sad how some classes/people struggle to get a nut and others are hand fed. Me I have earned everything I have gotten<br />
and my Twinks dotn deserve anything =) BUT I dont take away from another Clr in a group when I play my shm and something drops, and that something is useful to them and they would use it IE ODS. Ok thats enuff Babble laters.....<br />

Please remember that xp grinds with level 45 mobs do not do damage to level 60 warriors..or shaman for that matter.<br />
<br />
I didn't start this little bitch fest.  In my experience, symbols are fluff.  Of course, I was told I was incorrect.  Oh, how sorry I am.  I wasn't aware I was doing everything wrong up until now.  Thank you for showing me the light.  I shall continue the XP grind without symbols, just as I always have, and I shall be wrong.  boo hoo.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry that your groups can't control their aggro.  I'm sorry that you're grouping with level 45's instead of the thousands of 60's AA grinding.  I'm sorry that you feel that you need to waste money to compensate for some players lack of skill.  Some of us don't.  For us, Symbols are fluff, and that is just as valid of a statement as you saying they are *required* for the xp grind.<br />
<br />
Oh, and my warrior and my shaman have never set foot in NToV..hell, they're not even guilded.  But thanks for the compliment.  Apparantly intelligence and well played characters are in the minority these days...which is a big reason of why I don't do pickup groups with players that think everyone needs a symbol and they need to be compensated for it.  <br />
<br />
Its obvious by your posts that you haven't experienced it first hand, this is painfully obvious by the fact that you assume every group has someone to slow the mobs' attacks. <br />
<br />
You are aware this is the shaman board, right?  You're talking to people who probably cast turgurs insects more than any other spell. My initial argument is based on the fact that you're having this debate on the board of the best slower in the game, so yes, if my shaman is grouped with a cleric, all mobs ARE SLOWED.  Even if they are not, do you know how much damage an unslowed frog does with a 50+ rogue 50+ warrior and 50+ monk meleeing?  The answer is not a whole helluva lot.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry that you group with people that PL to 60 while wearing level 10 armor, but where I come from, tanks can tank, shamans can slow and clerics don't need to waste money on dots in an XP group fighting mobs that hit for less than 150.</div></div><hr />

Your rebuttal relies on a slower being in every exp group. Play a Cleric, then tell me the best way to do it. <br />

Hi, for some reason there is always a slower in my groups.  I can't seem to get rid of him, he always seems to be stealing all of my experience too.<br />
<br />
WAIT, oh ****, you're wondering why people who play shaman assume there's going to be a slower in every group they join?<br />
<br />
Everyone just ask the melee's if they want avatar next time you are in a group, then proceed to loot enough to pay for avatar, then  proceed to ask for 'my fair share' above that.<br />
<br />
We all know melee's HAVE to have avatar on at all times, since we get the spell. (Don't bring that primal avatar or primal weapons funk either, because you specifically mentioned players who have inferior gear)<br />
<br />
All your arguments are based on a non-shaman group, on a shaman board.  You've replied that the posters here are stupid because they assume that any group they are in will have a shaman.  The only time they don't is with a twink, and well, who really gives a damn about twinks anyway.<br />

Good question, considering the people trivializing them in this thread most likely have no problem begging one for a rez.<br />

90% of the time in pickup groups its a thankless job with a huge amount of responsibility. And if you think the person who screws up gets blamed when theres a wipe, I've got news for you, its the Cleric who takes the blame.<br />

I totally agree with everything you said regarding warrior and shaman and who should be pulling.  However, when you are playing 2 characters at once, one needs to become primary and one needs to become heavily reliant on hotkeys and be relatively stationary.  For me, it's easier that the main be my warrior.  I've been playing both for a really long time, and it's hard to change now.  If I could manage to pull with my shaman while chasing down the last of the runner on my warrior, I'd be more than happy to do so, but it's not gonna happen.<br />
<br />
I'll concede you are correct tho, it's just not an option in my situation.<br />
<br />
Secondly, I wouldn't call bank in chardok a normal XP grind.  I've done it before, and with a group of 4 you can barely get the **** cleared before repop.  Bank is an item camp, zone in is an XP camp.  In the bank, yes, I would use symbols.  At the zone in, I would not.  That's the distinction i'm trying to make. If you are raiding a particular spawn/item/etc, symbols can be useful.  If you are killing level 48 yard trash, they are not necessary. <br />

<br />
On this board, it should be understood that everyone who gives a crap about the topics at hand is a shaman, or cares to learn about one.  With mobs 75% slowed, like we all deal with on a day to day basis, they don't deal that much damage.  Regrowth and a fungi tunic compensate for the damage greatly....lessening the need to CH, therefore lessening the need for max HP.  You are talking to people who heal based upon spells other than CH.  Torpor still heals 1200 (or 1500 if I get the ticks right) whether I have my 3800 unbuffed or whether i have 5400.  I still take a minimal amount of damage per mob, and the regen rate makes up for a large portion of it.  CH is just not needed, therefore increasing my maximum HP by 600 isn't gonna change my life a significant amount either.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>fnord</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">This is pointless, I thought maybe I could help you non-Clerics understand why Clerics seem to get the gems at the end of the night.<br />
<br />
Its been explained that Clerics live in poverty until they get above 50 and you begin to group with people who know what MLing is. It is hard to have the cash to keep a stack of symbol gems on you as well as purchase spells until then, but that doesn't stop you from needing them. This is why Clerics seem overly compensated later, its to reward them for sitting and getting little more than nothing and sticking with a needed class that most people do not want to play.<br />
<br />
A good Cleric in a dungeon will symbol three people, all the time:<br />
<br />
1) Him/herself - If the Cleric dies, everyone dies or zones.<br />
2) The Chanter - If your responsibility has never been to keep these guys alive, you have no concept of how fast they die.<br />
3) The Tank - More HP means the tank lives longer, the less the Cleric has to stand up and down the more time s/he can spend staring at health bars.<br />
<br />
While it is true that my cleric is only in the 50s and I have only been to two of the planes, I understand how my class is played and I understand my role in groups. You on the other hand, despite all your knowledge of the game, don't.<br />
<br />
I don't care how uber you think you are or how experienced with the game you think you are, if you haven't played a class you don't really understand all the intricacies of how it is played.<br />
<br />
I'm done arguing with people who would most likely chew someone's ass off for trivializing the Shaman, or telling Shaman how they're supposed to play their class if the person doing the criticizing had obviously never played one. Deny that you would correct me if I came here spouting off about Shaman while I was obviously very ignorant of the class.<br />

Clerics and Gems<br />
Some servers have standard loot practices.<br />
Some zones have standard loot practices.<br />
Some guilds/groups have standard loot practices.<br />
Some people are greedy, regardless of class.<br />
Some people are generous, regardless of class.<br />
<br />
Most clerics agree that they take ONLY enough to pay for their peridot usage in the group, PLUS the fair amount that everyone else is getting in the group.  <br />
<br />
If you check out the cleric board you will read this topic occasionally.  Some groups let clerics take all gems, some groups give cleric no gems.   Frell, I have had greedy people try to NOT hand me super rare spells simply because I was a level or so away from scribing it.  Think your the shaman in the crypt and torpor drops but because your only 58 group members want to /random it with loot. Thankfully several of the group members stood with me and I got Group CH.<br />
<br />
Symbols:<br />
Naltron 1peridot, single target<br />
Naltrons Mark 1peridot, group buff ~ rare spell<br />
Marzin 1peridot, single target<br />
Marzins Mark ?peridot, group buff ~ uber rare spell, moreso then torpor.<br />
Aego 1peridot, single target 1100HP<br />
Group Aego 4peridot, group buff 1100HP<br />
<br />
Some zones require symbol but have no cash loots or people dont think to allow the cleric to take the junk for cash.  Places like Cazic Thule, Akheva, and Chardok, just to name a few.<br />
<br />
Perhaps clerics do not compliment shamans so much that they are invaluable to you all.  But they do add a nice insurance policy in those out of the way zones, like HS.   Just because some people are greedy doesnt make the class greedy.</div></div><hr />

The key to my amusement was the A as it indicates single mobs. You say that if people need that extra HP buff then they are doing something wrong. LOL! That is just funny. I say that if you are fighting single mobs like you apparently are that you are the one who is doing something wrong. <br />
<br />
Maybe after you move out of your gravytrain world of exp in places like the grey or whatever and you start doing some real groups with people keeping a relentless pace going non stop, then you can come in and give some useful input. Playing ultra-safe padded eq for your exp doesn't give me a lot of confidence in your opinion of what is and is not needed. <br />
<br />
As for gems in these camps i just give all the normal gems to the clerics and I don't worry about it one bit. I know lots of clerics, and every time that they get drug out across half the world to res someone for free, or they are drug into some dungeon or camp that has nothing to offer to recoup their costs just puts a bigger burden on them. If you want to keep all the gems from camps and distribute them between the group, then go ahead and you can bring stacks of peridots and have the cleric use those (or give them to the cleric as they use them) then distribute gems at the end. I find it too much of a hassle though and not worth it. If I want gems, I just go in and farm some for myself for a while and I am good to go.</div></div><hr />

I totally agree with vaaxx.  So i guess i'm another one of us clueless oracles.:)<br />
<br />
with a shaman in a group,  in regular exp places,  clerics are nukers/stunners/rooters...nothing more,  nothing less.<br />
most exp groups i'm in...the cleric is so bored they mellee.<br />
<br />
I am not uber...never been to NTOV...ST...VT...not even VP.<br />

i'm sure many of us here have had to log on sombody elses cleric from time to time to hit the CH button ones ever 4 seconds....<br />

Yeah, I know I was pushing it on that one, but I do have a reasoning.  My guild has 3 Oracles with Torpor, possibly a 4th one, dont know, she just joined.  We have NO clerics with MM.  <br />
<br />
Its one of those rare luclin uber boss mob itemized loot drops, that, because it can be exploited w/ MGB, doesnt drop much. 95% of clerics will never see it.  Where as 95% of the Oracles I know have Torpor and total server Oracles? 50% I would hazard a guess. <br />

How many of you have played a Cleric to 50+? You do realize that its not until 50+ that Clerics can have even a shred of hope that the people they're exp grinding with even know what ML is much less be willing to do it.<br />

PS I love exping in the Chardok bank.  Now that I've discovered that you're into safe, easy exping at the zone line, I can definitely agree with you, you don't need symbol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yah, go ahead and keep trash talking where I choose to XP.  Understand this.  I duo with my 2 computers a warrior and a shaman.  There is not 1 person dedicated to each character, there is not an enchanter/rogue/monk/High DPS class/Support class in the mix.<br />
<br />
How many mobs am I supposed to pull when I'm 2 boxing to be sufficient for you &quot;real shamans?&quot;  6? 12?  How about one whole floor? I'm sorry that I have 2 computers and 2 accounts and I use them to avoid grouping with morons, but it's what I do. <br />
<br />
I pull 2 at a time because it's fairly simple to CC 1 with a duo.  More than that, and i'm adding downtime to myself.  I pull 3, and I usually have to med after that to make up for the broken PE's and the short duration buffs that will wear off during the fight.  <br />
<br />
How far into chardok do you get with a warrior partner gloriana?  Observer maybe?  Don't ****in tell me you do bank duoing, because I'm not buying it.<br />
<br />
When i'm duoing, my XP rate is based upon my DPS rate...which is the DPS of my warrior, the DPS of the mutt, and the epic/jbb.  More HP won't help me kill faster.  In fact, before my characters hit 60, I didn't even bother using Kragg 99% of the time, because it wasn't necessary, and it was just a waste of mana.  Torpor heals 1200 HP whether I have 3900 or whether I have 5600.  <br />
<br />
You add a cleric to the mix, and not much changes.  What you can kill is still based upon how far you can pull single/double perhaps triples with a warrior.  You're still limited by the warrior DPS, the DPS of your mutt and the epic/JBB and whatever DPS a cleric can manage nuking.  The mobs are still slowed, you still take near the same amount of minimal damage, regen and a fungi still heals most of it, ergo more HP STILL means nothing.<br />
<br />
I have qualified my statements many times, people seem to be missing it.  In some situations in raids, etc, HP is important (&lt;------------READ THAT AGAIN).  In normal XP grinding, it doesn't carry nearly the weight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>buga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">I agree on the issue that we should reimburs clerics. However, some of the post (my assumption is you are a cleric) is totally bias. Here's what I like to say. <br />
<br />
Yes, there are clerics that are poor. But get this, most aren't.<br />
I have seen  fair clerics, and I've seen unfair clerics walking away with 3k or so gems. Yes we should pay for dots, but at what extend? Some said (parapharsing) &quot;we clerics need more loot to ..... 1.,cover cost of symbol, 2.,our spells , 3 sow are expensive, and 4., to cover zones that don't drop anything.&quot;<br />
I am a very calm person, but when I see clerics (in game) say this, it gets me going. My respond to<br />
1., I'll cover your dots, just keep a record of how many you use<br />
2., hmmm, every heard how much torpor cost these days?<br />
3., can i get a sow please?? &lt;----most of the time is free<br />
4., zone that don't give phat loot usually compensate with more xp...take your pick...xp or loot.<br />
<br />
Yes, clerics are needed...but some abuse it to the point where they give themselves a bad name. Clerics are fine at making cash on their own. There are always peep asking for rez....hmm, 350pp or so per? What about all the other classes that are grouped, they don't need pp? Well these are my 2 cents.<br />
<br />

P.S. If i catch you being greedy, I will spread your name. <br />

<br />
As evidence of how much cash Clerics USED to make at Guardian etc, I often volunteered to supply all the dots (when the Cleric ran out of 'dots themself) and be compensated as they were.<br />
<br />
The resulting tizzy was quite the sight to behold. Usually they spent 5 minutes running around getting resupplied by a fellow Cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>TalgurenXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Clerics are to rogues what politicians are to muggers.  One steals your money by force and the other steals it with fines.  Sure some are worse than others, but probably 80 percent of them are taking more than they deserve.  Peridots are not that expensive.  The spells that use them last a fairly long time.  So the solution is to allow the clerics to loot a few gems after each round of symbol/aego.  Then go back to looting as usual.  Either that or bring your own peridots and tell the cleric to stop being a loot hog.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">I give clerics all the gems in any exp grind. 90% of the time after the 5th or 6th they tell me to keep it or distribute it around. Just not worth the hassle to me, and I could count on one hand the number of times in an exp group a cleric has EVER asked for dots when people ask for buffs. I'd like to help them make a little money (or alot) to help hold back the tide of buff beggars. If FoS took a dot everytime, bet your ass I'd be asking for cash drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">Heh.  Just so everyone doesn't think i'm a total cleric nazi, i'm really not.

I'll be the first to tell ya to slap me a symbol when I think i need it.  When I think I need it is when my shaman is getting multiple slow resists after malo, which is pretty rare these days, but some times I get a bad RNG run.   When I think I need it is when i'm getting CH'd more than once a fight...if you can't med back the mana it costs to cast the CH before you have to cast another, I need more HP.  <br />

However, a warrior with 1250 ac and almost 4khp unbuffed can go AFK standing with a spider in velks for about a half an hour and not have any serious issues.

Sure, the last 15 or so posts have been people responding to 2% of the post of the last person, taking it pretty much outta context.<br />
<br />
I'm gonna agree that symbol has probably saved my furry butt a couple times.<br />
<br />
I'm also gonna agree that 99.999% of the time in Seb, symbol is completely, utterly worthless except on the MT.  <br />
<br />
Um, einstein cleric guy?  There ALWAYS ALWAYS is a slower in my group.  That's me.  Get it?  With me in the group, there's hardly any need for a cleric at all.  But if we have one to make folks happy, we don't need symbol.  Clerics in my groups nuke.  That's my job, to bore the living hell out of clerics.  <br />
<br />
If the cleric has too much mana, that means it really truly doesn't matter if that CH heals an extra few hundred hp's.  Having an oracle upstairs in Seb means you might want a chanter/bard, you might want a cleric, but having both means EVERYBODY is gonna be bored to tears.  And it's godawfully inefficient.<br />
<br />
What you're missing in your rabid defense of the sanctity of symbol is that in a shaman group, things are generally REALLY easy.<br />
<br />
A couple of you are steadfastly REFUSING to realize that the posts you're bashing were referring to EXP GRIND groups.  Not dungeon crawling thru places you're unfamiliar with.  Not for places where you're not severe overkill for the mobs.  Why don't you read the post before you flame it?  Not having symbol there when you have the option for it would be asinine, of course.  Playing your class well doesn't mean slapping on every possible buff in every possible situation.  It's about knowing what's necessary, and what's going to maximize effectiveness.<br />
<br />
I'm fine with the &quot;first 2 gems to cleric&quot; rule.  Fine, they make a bunch of extra cash, but at least they shut up.  What I want to hear is those same clerics backing ME up to get the second 2 gems to cover emerald costs for avatar.  Because I need to make my money in seb to cover those costs, since gems aren't as common in other dungeons....<br />
<br />
Uh huh, that'll happen.  Soon's giant purple pigs fly outta my furry butt.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">Problem 1. It seems that the people you have been playing with and for for the last 3 years don't much NEED you anymore. It seems that now that they have ganed in power they want you to go away so they can increase thier DPS.<br />
<br />
Problem 2. People resent the fact that clerics are the BEST at something. (Actually 3 things, healing, Pure HP buffs,and Xp return after death) So after 3 years of those same people NEEDING a cleric they just want to make them pay for that need.<br />
<br />
Problem 3. In the eyes of balance, being the best at 3 things means that in everything else that you do, you well and truly suck at the other things. (travel, DPS, Mana Regen, Crowd control, Attack ability, Conveniance, solo ability, moneymaking)<br />
<br />
Problem 4. By being the absolute best at a few things and poor at the others means that you are expected to have a single role. One that while Vitally important can, at times, be dreadfully dull and nerve wracking at the same time. This factor when added to just how important you have been over the last 3 years has lead to massive burn out, and stress to the cleric base.  You are expected to Only Sit down, Shut up, and heal by a large percentage of the population.<br />
<br />
Problem 5. Due to the absolute Need by the playerbase over the last few years people have accepted the shortcomings of the class in fun and conveniance to feel needed and wanted in a group. So people made clerics. Alot of them. Yet groups only want 1 per 6 people. Due to thier ability in an xp situation they do not stack well. That leads to alot of problems where clerics are competing for locations in a group.<br />
<br />
Now after all this time what would YOU do shaman, if Chanters got a 10% increase in thier slow ability. Or as a direct threat they had the ability to increase thier max Ac to 1000+ fairly easily.<br />
<br />
I know what the shaman comunity as a whole would be doing. Screaming our heads off. Yet, we have soloability. We have Group needs, We have raid purpose.  We have conveniance. <br />
<br />
So please forget for a second about the envy you have felt towards clerics and thier complete heal for a moment. They may have the best heal in the game but to be honest they have paid a terrible price for it.<br />
<br />
Invite a cleric into your group. Welcome them into a duo even if they are not horrably needed at that time. (You can pull more you know) If they are an ass then judge them on thier personality and ability to play thier chosen profession. Not because you want more xp, and you hate clerics over complete heal.<br />
<br />
Clerics have taken a whole lot of crap for a secure spot in a group. And now the security is going away. Do any of you really feel it is fair after so long of being denied many many things due to complete heal they dont have a little right to be upset?<br />
<br />
<br />
They have never been the quarterback, they never score the winning touchdown, they were always the lineman. Making sure the team wins. Play by play. Day in and Day out.<br />
<br />
Yet now people spit on them. For shame all of you. One of my best friends in game is a little dwarven cleric. Humble, kind in the extreme, selfless to a fault, always willing to do whatever crazy scheme I come up with next. It doesnt matter what I want to do, he will stand beside me and try his damndest to keep me and my friends alive, and if we fail, I can bet he is the first one to figure out what he can do better. He keeps me alive through stuff that I know many of the Ubers would never live through. <br />
<br />
He has never had it easy in the game, even with me beside him, he gets tells from people he has met once in passing, asking him to save them HOURS of real life time by giving them a res.  yet many times he cannot because he is somewhere knee deep in bodies with me. And he feels horrible everytime he has to say no.<br />
<br />
That is where a cleric is hard. They make the hard choices, they decide who lives and who dies when the **** hits the fan. At least the good ones do. <br />
<br />
So to any shaman out here that look down upon the clerics playing the game just because of them being a cleric, I say this.<br />
<br />
You are not worthy, of the youngest clerics time.  Piss off All of you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Wow, nothing like a discussion of Greed to bring out the jerks on all sides of an arguement. <br />
<br />
As someone who almost always does ML, I thin kI can safely say that there aren't many camps were you need symbol but don't get enough loot to cover it. Seahorses in SG (for CH efficiency) and 4-arms in ME are really the only two camps that spring to mind. Some places like Chardok you might not get much then the cost of dots but even that's rare. <br />
<br />
I do agree that in a lot of places you don't need symbol, and that includes Seb top floor if you're level 60. Otoh, remember back to the days when your group was around lvl 50 and a pull of 4 Krups had good chance of smooshing your enchanter or cleric before you got things under control? Before you start getting too condescending, did you turn down symbol back then? But yeah, if you're 2 boxing chardok entrance or FG you don't need symbol or a cleric but that's not exactly something to brag about anyway. <br />
<br />
To the clerics out there that think I should finance the symbols they cast in Velks last week or the stack of sow potions they just bought, I disagree. I'll ask at the end of a group how much they spent on Dots and then add maybe 50% on top of that. I don't do pickup groups much so that doesn't come up very often. When grouped with a friends' cleric, I'll ask how much thye spent on dots and whether they need any extra to replenish their Dot fund. The rest gets split equally.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I admit I was suprised at the amount of gems that tend to drop it was something that previously I never paid much attention to. That is how it tends to be done on our server so wanted to know if it was like that on others. <br />
<br />
 Apparently it varies greatly...just like the arguments hehe.</div></div><hr />

Who ever says that cleric's are poor until they reach level 50 is flat out wrong. Clerics (along with druids) can make thousands of platinum even before they reach level 40.  So please spare us the 'help me I'm poor' line because it doesnt fly anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dear god this is noobish. Give the cleric a few gems and kindly hush.<br />
<br />
What's needed and what's not depends on your gear, group makeup, zone, location, aggressiveness in pulling and your mad skills. No one can honestly say it's NEVER needed or ALWAYS needed, so why the fawk are we playing with these generalizations? You are in a 5 shaman-1 cleric group doing Toilers in ME? Godbless ya Erkel, you don't need it. You are trio-ing in HS where every third mob HT's? You do. <br />
<br />
Get it. It's situational.<br />
<br />
This is absolutely one of the worst threads I have ever seen on this board. /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">I think everyone is arguing cause some clerics want all the gems in camps like necro...or something with lots of gems, and freak out when they dont get it.  Though, if a cleric in my group ever freaked out over gems, I'd kick him.  I usually ML and I supply the gems to pay for their dots and split evenly as I said earlier. Or at least I did back when I grouped in seb :D .  Easier to just bring a monk friend or something or solo now.</div></div><hr />

But the concern, has been, by most I've spoken with, not that the Cleric is getting a couple extra gems to pay for Peridots for the buffs they cast for that group.  Most people agree with that.   But the Clerics who claim that they should get all the VT Gems and Jewelry while in a group.  Simply because they didn't get alot of loot in the past.<br />
<br />
I'm not responsible for what happened to you because of what someone else did in the past.  If the cleric did not speak up and say; &quot;Excuse me, the buffs you want cost me 11p (or whatever), would you guys mind pitching in to help pay for them?&quot;  Then that's their fault.   I don't think it's something they should expect other people to pay them back for.<br />
<br />
Of course, I'd happily make sure the Cleric got a bit more over cost for the Gems they used for our group.  I generally give out stacks of Peris when grouped and they only use maybe half of 'em.   But if they demand all the gems and expensive VT from the group, they can go take a leap off High Pass.<br />
<br />
Just like with a few obnoxious Quad Kiting Druids who train over you or charge 50+p a port, the few Greedy Clerics have made a bad rep for the others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">I'm very concientious that the cleric in the group be reimbursed for dots they spend.  Even if it's not a pp or gem camp, like say CT, I make sure they get enuf crap to sell to pay for the dots we NEED.  <br />
<br />
I also carry around my own stack of 20 dots.  If the loot really is non existent and I was the one who dragged the cleric there, I'll give them the number of dots they had to use on the non productive group.  Or I'll give them the dots ahead of time.  <br />
<br />
As for clerics coming into a NGE group and demanding all gems . . phfft . . ain't gonna happen.  I dont' give a rat's ass if you do camp your lousy butt in velkewhores most of the time.  You get what you deserve, not what you think you deserve.  If dots are actually being used I'll keep track and give them 150% of the costs in gems.  If not, I don't bother giving them a first cut.  Everything else gets split evenly.  Usually there are plenty of gems there tho, so the cleric will end up with about 2 or 3 besides the ones for the gems.  Plus any rare loot that dropped . . they have a chance at it.  I don't believe in NBG in old dungeons, so anyone who is along can roll for that lammy.  <br />
<br />
Actually . . usually I set the rules for the groups I am in.  Nobody disagrees.  Or at least I don't remember the last time someone did.  It might have been 6 months ago . . . yah . . some rangers wanted to do NGE and invited me to the group.  I asked what loot rules were and they said NBG at once.  I disagreed so I left the group.  Seen too many people abuse that loot system.  <br />
<br />
I have to admit that like Gloriana, I love aego.  I love it so much!  Those extra hps mean that I don't go below half life when I canni5.  That's important to me for aggro reasons.  With only a regular buff I am darn close to getting auto aggro once I press that suicide button.  If only self buffed, I'll guaranteed have auto aggro since I'm only at 2550 hps self buffed.  So yah I like aego.  I gladly pay the dot cost for it.</div></div><hr />
