<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone here wrestle as your main or secondary sport in high school? If so, do you have any tips for someone just starting, maybe a link or two to a site listing moves or positions I could take a look at.<br />
<br />
I know it's probably a long-shot, but hey, thanks in advance to any who post :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No matter how much your coach, your teammates, or your friends pressure you, don't starve yourself.  Don't spend all day spitting into a styrofoam cup.  Don't tape yourself into a garbage bag and run until you can't run anymore.<br />
<br />
Work hard and kick butt, but be smart about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wrestled from about 2nd grade until junior year of high school when I messed up my knee a bit.  After a couple years took up Judo in college for 6 years.   Thantu's got some good advice, your body needs water, dropping weight by getting water out of your system only hurts it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I wrestled in High School till I tore up me knee.  It's great fun.<br />
<br />
For more information about Greco-Roman style wrestling, consult your local library.  There's a ton of great books out there on the subject.  As far as websites...  when I was wraslin' the internet was just a twinkle in Al Gore's eye...  :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I wrestled in high school.  Winning was more a matter of force of will for me than anything else.  Even when I lost, the match wasn't over until I mentally gave up.  As long as you still have the spirit to win it isn't over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Also when you are in your singlet waiting to wrestle, don't look at the cheerleaders too much.  can be quite embarrassing hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I wrestle at Jesuit (Catholic school, some might know of it, I'm at the one in Tampa), and they take the sport seriously. <br />
<br />
Anyone know when the soreness will go away :)? (Serious question :))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&quot;When you're dead&quot;<br />
<br />
Get used to it, as you get older you'll feel like that just getting out of bed some days :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Anyone know when the soreness will go away  <br />
<br />
Go to the local major grocery chain and buy two things:<br />
<br />
1.  Bananas  (extra potassium)<br />
<br />
2.  Myoflex  (or some similar spelling).  Rocks for sore muscles and doesn't stink like Ben Gay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Canabull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Lift weights, and STRETCH!!!  I never pulled a muscle in HS Football (closest thing we had to wrestling), but my Senior year, at the behest of my coach, I stopped eating anything with fat content (to lose weight), including milk.  Separated my shoulder and almost hyperextended my knee.<br />
<br />
Stretch and eat right, and if you want to lose some extra weight, just do extra NORMAL cardio work.  Even a 1 hour jog once a week is better than cutting out important foods from your diet.<br />
<br />
If nothing else, try to get in touch with a local college coach and see if he/she will give you some advice (most will if they have the time, potential recruit 8 )<br />
<br />
BTW, good joint workout is heavy weights, short pulls.  REALLY strengthens those ligaments and keeps your bones together.<br />
<br />
Pain today, LOTS of pain tomorrow.</div></div><hr />

When the sore starts to go away, it's time to work harder. <br />
<br />
Lol, it does seem that way. Plus, this week was just the pre-season conditioning :). The REAL practices start Monday :).<br />
