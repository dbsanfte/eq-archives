<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thorhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry for the n00b type question but I really dont know the answer. I recently pulled my shaman from the beach in Oasis where he was fishing and sipping Halas Heaters. I was 35 the week before Xmas now ready to ding 55.<br />
<br />
I have been to the planes a few times (PoN, PoI)  I'm hearing you guys talk about flags. My question is, can someone explain how flags work and/or obtained?<br />
<br />
TIA,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well it depends on the zone. Almost all zone require you to kill a boss type mob in a certain zone to advance to another zone.<br />
<br />
For example to get to PoV and PoS you need to do 1 trial and pass it in PoJ. Then to get to HoH you  need to kill a dragon in PoV (Aerin'dar) and u get flagged for HoH. There is also a key quest available to do but I hear its a waste of time and it gives u problems later I think. <br />
<br />
To get to CoD you need to kill grummus, or do key quest etc.<br />
<br />
But to get to BoT I dont think you can kill any mob that gives u access but rather you have to do a key quest which is pretty easy if you have a descent guild.<br />
<br />
So to sum it up, for certain zones you need flags (not all) and they are gotten by killing a mob, hailing the projection thing that spawns after u kill the mob and zoning into the zone. Or do a key quest and then get flagged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for responding Divinator,<br />
<br />
Is this me soloing a mob and hailing the projection, or my group of 5 others taking down the mob and advancing?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">think you have to kill Vallon Zek and Tallon Zek to advance to Rallos Zek.  He flags you for PoEarth, PoWater, and PoAir. <br />
PoFire is accessed through killing Solusek Ro in his tower, which is accessed by . . . I forget . . . might be killing TZ and VZ will get you there.  Maybe you have to kill RZ as well, not sure.  I think there are alternate paths tho, like thru killing Saryn in PoTorment.  I'm pretty sure that gets you into Tower of SolRO.  Actually I'm positive.  <br />
My guild is pretty caught up with VT atm tho, working on gearing up before advancing to the elemental planes I guess.</div></div><hr />
