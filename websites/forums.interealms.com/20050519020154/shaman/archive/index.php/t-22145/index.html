<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For those of you who visit the SoE boards, they moved our shaman post out of the development section and stuck it back into the shaman forums.  Apparently it's no longer a priority, as they haven't bothered to have a dev post on it in over two months.<br />
<br />
Neither, of course, has anything actually been done.<br />

Either that or their CFO saw the cost of &quot;caring&quot; and decided to go back to not giving a damn.  Option 3 ... they stopped taking input and are actually doing something about it ... /waits for the crickets to stop chirping ...</div></div><hr />

With Blarg, sometimes it's hard to tell.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think this probably means &quot;We are dont with Shaman til OoW, they got a bump&quot;. <br />
<br />
Oh well, I will give them the chance to come of good with OoW. Thats where the REAL balanceing has to occur anyway. No sense puting in a bunch of changes, then changing them again.<br />
<br />
Would like some little things fixed though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">well they upped the hot quite abit the god one being 630 a tick, which i seem to rem was what poeple wanted up to, so that is good even if they did cleric too. and i would want an aa or heal aa to affect hots.<br />
they did up the direct heal but not enough, if they upped that to 1700 or 1800 i think i might actually be tempted to get god. oh that and made the aa abit better.<br />
<br />
but i still think how we do dps needs to be looked at, and our quick heals upped alittle bit more the 47% thing is way out of date.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">spending 10 aa for quickened curing 2 sucks =( 3 is probably 20 aa I'm going to die!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>beriah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Is anyone shocked that they forgot us again already?<br />
<br />
Basically they think that the HOT changes + pet shrink fix = fixed shammy's.<br />
<br />
I think if you stop yelling and screaming for even one minute and act like normal human beings, they think your happy and all is well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zacknaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yep, they're being honest.  We don't care what proof you bring to us, our minds are made up and you're staying the gimps that we have made you out to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Just stop playing.  They'll never listen; they'll never be convinced.  They'll always think buffing single-target AGI is what you were put on Norrath to do and you'll do it, dammit.  So......<br />
<br />
Just stop playing.  <br />
<br />
I was extremely frustrated by GoD.  (Which we all know was a huge screw-up on SOE's part.)  I knew I wasn't going to be playing OoW.  And a shaman's role in PoP at the EP lvl+ was that of group jester, because you weren't needed to contribute to the group.  If that's the way they want it, the only thing you can do is quit.  If the game isn't fun anymore, leave it.  It's a game.<br />
<br />
It was hard...I had been playing for 4 years, was an officer in a guild that I had a huge part in creating and developing over the last 18+ months that I was in it.  But at some point, my frustration with the game overcame my urge to log in and see friends.<br />
<br />
I'm EQ free for almost a week now!  Teehee!  My accounts have expired, and I did not renew my billing.  It's so liberating.  Take the high road.  If they don't want to listen to us after all the discussion, after all the &quot;proof&quot; that they requested, after all the years of complaints, etc., just save yourself some frustration....<br />
<br />
and quit.  I did.  It felt, and still feels, great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>beriah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I just wonder what other classes would do if their primary ability was nerf'd as bad as slow was.<br />
<br />
How about all mobs in Omens kill you and a cleric cannot rez you?<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
All mobs in omens are mitigate nukes? lol wiz does 15% of his dmg per nuke?<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
All mobs in omens have innate mitigation to range attacks from rangers.<br />
<br />
If any of these happened, the class would be bitching and yelling more than we are now.</div></div><hr />

Correction.  In Ikkinz raids, just about every trash mob is fully slowable while Golems and Nocs mitigate 20% of a rangers archery damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Lol... The &quot;no back&quot; thing was funny. A wizard once asked me what slow mitigation meant, I asked him if he would group in a place where every mob in the zone had 50% spell shield. That shut him up.</div></div><hr />
