<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, (boy do I hate this) it's donation time again Shaman.<br />
<br />
To those of you that haven't been here long, the Shaman's Curcible and its companion site, the Ranger's Glade, are entirely funded by user donations. Every six months, I have to beg, grovel and plead for everyone to send in some money to keep this site totally free and available at all times for everyone. Well, I don't have to beg that much ;)<br />
<br />
This will be our fourth donation drive. The first two went really well and I reached our goal in just about a week or two. However, the last drive really slowed down and it took me almost a month to get everything we needed. I can't complain, because we still reached the goal, but I'm hoping all goes well this time.<br />
<br />
The server and bandwidth cost $1950 dollars each 6 months of my contract. Last drive, I renewed my vBulletin membership for a year, so I don't need that covered. One thing I REALLY want to add this next six months though, is the new ColdFusion MX that just came out. It's a few hundred dollars for me to upgrade and I'll need it with some of the great new things I have planned for the site. Any and all donations go directly to the cost of the upkeep and nothing else.<br />
<br />
I plan to have dynamic guides coming up soon that will not only allow trusted people the ability to change/edit/delete, but will also link directly to the message boards where it can further be discussed, revised, etc.<br />
<br />
I also want to re-enable the Armor and Weapons sections with new search abilities and suggested upgrade paths. I'm not to sure what I'm going to do with the profile section yet. Magelo has cornered that market, but I may have some new things to try once I get going.<br />
<br />
One of the biggest upgrades will be as soon as vBulletin 3 comes out. When it does, I'll be able to use ColdFusion MX to tie into its database and create custom content such as tracking threads throughout the static site that you have posted in the boards, ability to check PM's from anywhere on the site, and things like showing the top 5 active threads. I'll also be able to FINALLY re-enable the contributor option we had for awhile. (It's a vBulletin 2 hack and won't work on version 3, so I haven't reinstalled it due to the impending upgrade.)<br />
<br />
So, I have lots I hope to be implementing over the next few months. All I need is your donation to keep everything going! This is a not for profit site and is entirely advertising free. There are no popups or annoying membership requests. I really, really want this place to stay that way. I don't want to ever see advertising here and your donations are what makes this possible.<br />
<br />
We also have Planes of Power coming out relatively soon, followed shortly by Everquest 2. I want to make sure this place is here for everyone for all of these new adventures to be shared and discussed.<br />
<br />
The Shaman's Crucible has been around for three years now, the last year and a half entirely funded by you all and your donations. Please, give what you can to keep this place as one of the best (if not the best) places to share information about Everquest. Once the donation amount is reached, as in the past, I'll heap tons of praise on you, pay the server bills and close the donation drive!<br />
<br />
As in the past, you can pay via PayPal with the logo below, or you can send me a personal check. For those wishing to donate with a personal check, please Private Message me for my mailing address. If you donate, please add your name to the Contributor Field sticky thread, so I can add you as a contributor once the boards are upgraded.<br />
<br />
Thank you all for not only helping keep us going, but for continuing to keep this place one of the best on the Net!<br />
<br />
My deepest appreciation,<br />
<br />
Sunmoon (Dave)<br />

Edit: Sun this thread looks the same as the one that was stuck to the top of the board before.  You may want to alter it in some way so that people will notice it is a new request.<br />
<br />
Maybe some color or a date in the thread title so peeps will notice and donate. <br />
<br />
You could also do a poll asking people if they know it is donation time or not ;)</div></div><hr />
