<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Talabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone. A group of friends and I ask rerolling some new toons just for fun. The high end game sometimes loses it's fun (I'm sure most of you know this by now) and I thought I'd roll a Shaman. I'm thinking about making a Froglok Shaman just for the fun effect but if another class is better I'll roll that.<br />
<br />
So how to my questions.<br />
Which class would you roll a Shaman if you made a new one today?<br />
RACE       STR STA AGI DEX WIS INT CHA BONUS <br />
Barbarian 103  100  82  70    80  60   60   30 <br />
Troll        108  114  83  75   70   52   42   30 <br />
Ogre       130  127  70  70    77  60   42   30 <br />
Iksar       70    75   90  85    90  75   60   30 <br />
Vah Shir  90    80   90   70   80   65   70   30 <br />
Froglok    70    85  100 100   85  75   55   30 <br />
<br />
Which Diety would you pick? Does it matter with Shamans?<br />
What gear would you recommend for around 2k or 3k?<br />
<br />
I'm not worried about faction too much since the PoP came out so and evil Shaman is fine with me.<br />
<br />
BTW Thanks for the great site. I'm looking forward to getting to know more about how to play the class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would make a Innoruuk worshipping Troll, too many *blip* frogs around now. <br />
You get Snare necklace by worshipping Inny, regen, high stamina, JBB, and Trolls are fun to roleplay.  <br />
Grab all the JB gear you can get, a good poker, and a shield (SBS) or something like that. That way you can get &quot;In teh face&quot; ! <br />
Check out some other Shammies magelos to get a good idea on what gear to scoop up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">class won't matter .. play whatever you think is fun<br />
<br />
frogloks do backflips when the cast .. and that is cool ;)<br />
<br />
and you can be a frog-bear :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well...my normal response to this question is use the search feature, but as we have just moved boards Im thinking some of the information didnt move with us. Soo..that in mind...<br />
<br />
I usually say that any race is sutible for a shaman.  I do somewhat ammend that because although Im not a troll myself (Barbarian here) I do have many troll shaman friends and I think that what the frogloks have done to Grobb is just disgusting.  SO I always recommend against the frog now.  They also have pretty wimpy stats that will take lots of equipment to make right....which is another strike against them.<br />
<br />
Barbs are good all around shaman.  5% exp penalty.  can slam to interupt casters.  no night vision.  good faction with most races, evil races KOS.<br />
<br />
Iksar and trolls innate regen which is pretty usefull to about 53 or so.  Hated everywhere.  Iksar cant use JBB and have special armor restrictions.  Better AC bonus though.  both carry 20% exp penalty..level pretty slow.  Iksar could level from 1 to 60 and never leave Kunark..although exp is much better in some places so you probably want to.<br />
<br />
Ogres highest STA of all....which means HP.  cant be stunned from front, and are just MONSTERS of soloing.  15% exp hit. hated by good races<br />
<br />
Cats no exp hit.  go through food and water like crazy.  safefall..good newbie areas and easy access to nexus and good exp areas.  <br />
<br />
<br />
If I had it to do over again I would probably roll an Ogre, just for the hiightened STA and unstunnability.  Maybe a cat..but I just dont like being furry....<br />
<br />
all in all though, as everyone else will tell you, it comes down to what you WANT to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">IMHO there really are only 2 choices.  Ogre for the no stun and Troll with the correct diety (I forget which one cause I am an ogre) for the snare necklace as well as regen.<br />
<br />
The non front stunable ability really is the only one that matters in the end game, but I really wish i had the snare necklace at times.<br />
<br />
Even though trolls have a 20% exp hit you will not notice it till the 50s.  You will notice the ogre 15% before that.  Regen helps a lot at lower levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Talabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Anyone know the name of the snare necklace?<br />
<br />
Also why is the non stun such a big deal at the end game? Most of the Shamans I know solo with the pet and don't get hit or group heal/slow/debuff/buff.. <br />
<br />
And thanks for the advise. I have narrowed it down to either a troll or ogre.. I like to solo alot (even though he will be built to group with friends) so the snare effect seems nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Snare necklace is called  Regent Symbol of Innoruuk  (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1254).<br />
<br />
Handy.  Dont know how the Quest has been affected by the frogs taking over Grobb.  Anyone gotten this thing since the Day that shall not be Forgotten?<br />
<br />
As for the unstunnablility bit, that is the one reason that I would reroll a shaman again.  I cant count the number of times I've died cause I got an add that I couldnt get a slow on because of interupts.</div></div><hr />
