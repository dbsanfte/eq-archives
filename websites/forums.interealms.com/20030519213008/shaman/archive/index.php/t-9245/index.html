<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone completed this quest since the Skyshrine revamp?  Is Ralgyn still in the same place, and does he still give out the quest?  I would explore myself, but was worried about getting jumped by Yelinak faction mobs, are there any on the way to him?<br />
<br />
Basically I have the 2 Kael pieces, and the fang from DN on my ranger.  My plan is to kill the giant in GD and loot the piece with my shaman, then MQ the other parts.  The only problem is the ranger is currently max-kos with CoV and Yelinak, and as guild is currently in NToV would have limited time to raise faction before the next raid.  <br />
<br />
Just wondering if anyone had any info as to whether the quest is the same as pre-revamp, before I waste the time to raise faction.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance   :cool:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks Grout, just what I needed to hear.  :D <br />
<br />
By big globe things, do you mean one of the rooms at the top of the tower, near the old quest armour room?  I assume it's still safe to get there without good Yeli faction?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its the room before the old armour room I believe. I am KoS to Yeli and had no trouble. Don't think anything is on his faction until you get past the old armor room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ganbor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you're going to try MQing the circlet, I *highly* recommend you get the shaman at least Staff Sargeant Drioc's head - when I tried this, one char turned in head, teachings, fang and ended up with the circlet... just a warning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mission Accomplished  :D <br />
<br />
Ganbor you were right, I took your advice and got another staff sgt. head for my shamy, and a good thing too.  I dont think you need the piece from taskmaster in GD at all anymore.  Handed in chipped fang and teachings of greakn with ranger, then logged shamy on, handed head of drioc and Rolandal depopped and gave me the imbued talisman.  Didnt have to show him the worn talisman from Kardakor at all.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help guys, much appreciated.  :cool:</div></div><hr />
