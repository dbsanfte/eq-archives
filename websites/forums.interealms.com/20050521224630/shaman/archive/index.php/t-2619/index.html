<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was looking through EQatlas and I can't seem to find Gorla Island on the Timberous Deep map. The only island that I see close to the coords is a floating iceberg. [-8840, -6080]. Any clue?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sentok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it's #12 on the eqatlas map, south of the elven outpost. It's a great place to hunt if you don't mind the extreme quiet, other than the hourly shouts of &quot;I fell off the boat, what do I do now?&quot; :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the information. I'm burnt out from leveling so I decided to kick back a little and quest for Canni2. Maybe it's just me, but I like to have every spell available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Always a good plan.<br />
<br />
Group cha, useful? Who would have thought it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oh yeah, I remember your story in how your guildmates sat you down, forced the quill in your hand and made you scribe it in your spellbook.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Whats the best way of getting to the island?<br />
<br />
I need to get there for canni2 ;(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Moonhaawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I went to Gorla Island from the EC tunnel.  I hopped the raft in the Oasis and got off in TD.  Lev and Invis up and headed SE to <br />
-8840 and -6080.  The Crushed Diamonds are lying on the ground.  No need to fight.  I was in Kanors Castle last weekend (at 39) and a monk was fighting the Warlord.  I asked him (nicely) if I could loot the bones..hey said &quot;Come ON!!&quot;  2 parts down, 2 to go...on my way to Can II<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The crushed diamonds are so easy, just leave them lying on the ground until you have your other 3 parts, rather than using up an inventory slot for a good while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Call me silly, but, Gloriana.. what is group cha useful for?   I've seen you mention it twice, but never figured out a use for it myself.<br />
<br />
Well, except the one time I busted off a Mass Group Charisma for giggles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">When fighting Roy in NTOV! (and I'm sure other mobs which I can't remember right this second).<br />
<br />
Roy has a very nasty dot that sucks all your mana and keeps you from regenning mana.  If you get the dot, it overwrites your c3 (to add insult to injury!).<br />
<br />
However, if you have cha above c3, it will still take your mana but it will overwrite cha NOT c3 so when the dot wears off, at least you can regen mana quicker.<br />
<br />
Most casters stay behind a wall to avoid Roy AOE, but shaman have to get near him to attempt to slow him, so we easily get dotted.  <br />
<br />
I would wait til a melee called AOE, run around malo, run back (hopefully not dotted), wait til a melee called AOE, run around, attempt to slow, repeat until slowed.  I rarely escape this experience without the dot, but by careful use of cha buffing, I don't lose c3.<br />
<br />
So, for this fight, I use cha buffs on all groups, first ensuring that they have stacked their buffs correctly to get cha above C3.  This will give all the casters at least one AOE where they won't lose c3.</div></div><hr />
