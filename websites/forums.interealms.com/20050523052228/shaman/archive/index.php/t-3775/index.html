MAGIC ITEM LORE <br />
Slot:PRIMARY<br />
Skill:2H Blunt   Atk Delay:95 <br />
DMG:74   AC:+2   <br />
STR:+15  STA:+15  HP:+100  <br />
Weight:16.0  <br />
Class:BST RNG SHM DRU CLE PAL SHD MNK WAR <br />
Race:ALL<br />

As a shaman, I solo like this: I pull with slow, I epic DoT, JBB and melee while it wails on me. I heal as necessary. In places that I can solo rather easily (HS, Chardok, FG), I only have to heal myself every 3 or 4 pulls. Well, I've been wanting this item for a while now, and I bought it from a guy in the bazaar for 30k and an Efreeti Ice Staff. He was askin for 40k and I really wanted this BAD. <br />
<br />
Now keep in mind JBB cast time is 8 secs(unchanneled) for 263 dmg max hit, and I chain cast it during fights. My epic is a 20/30 piercer, so I'd do max 80 dmg per hit with 200 skill Piercing. With this sucker, so far my max hit 264 with 166 skill 2HB, and with haste on I swing EVERY time between JBB landings. I don't hit for max every time, nor do I hit every time, and so far my average succesful hit is a little over 100.. <br />
<br />
Sooo.. lets do some math<br />
263 + 50(assuming I succesfully hit 50% of the time)= 313 per round (every 8 seconds)<br />
313/8= 39 dmg per second<br />
<br />
lets not forget my epic which is 1400 dmg over about 90 secs<br />
1400/90 = 15 DPS (its actually a splurt type dot.. small dmg first tick gradually increasing till the end)<br />
<br />
39+15= 54 DPS..... mana free<br />
<br />
Hope no developers read this when balancing classes.</div></div><hr />

You weren't supposed to buy that one!<br />
I was lurking around him all day yesterday... but I thought 40k was a bit high since I only wanted it for a toy (everyone who loves jousting must *drool* over this one) so was hoping he would realize that and lower his price...<br />
<br />
Grats to a supernice club with a very special graphics too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Taarne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Oh-my-god am I jealous now.. Jbb+that thing.. Heh, a shammy's dream maybe?<br />
<br />
Plus, you know, if you add up the hp plus sta, that thing gives you around 160hps at lvl 60.. (shakes head in disgust)<br />
<br />
Oh, and my warrior's darn jealous too. You know, they've critted for plus 2400 with that thing? <br />
<br />
..*sniff*..grats though..*sniff*..</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldnt worry about that - this weapon is balanced by the fact that it is a 2-handed weapon. And any shaman that can pay 40k pp for a weapon will be giving up a ton of stats in the secondary slot when using this.<br />
<br />
Lets hear how much faster you can actually kill a shroom or something like that with this :)</div></div><hr />

- Please nerf our ability to not even be able to barely hit light blue and barely blue mobs with weapons. Hell make it so that we can't even hit green ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Durnitol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shrooms go down noticeably faster.. my first attack after pull is epic. When epic wears off they are about 5-10% lower HP with this new wep than with just epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Can anyone tell me where this drops? =)</div></div><hr />

If you kill enough Shak Dators you will eventually get a Shak Dator Warlord to spawn... and he can drop it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naghite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Since you lose the mana from wis and + mana by switching the item, not sure i'd like use weapon....would only add a few hp over epic + shield and you lose all that mana/ac/resists with each switch, shrug.  Sounds like fun though.</div></div><hr />
