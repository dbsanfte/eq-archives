<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rustyspear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I havent see any discussion on affliction focus items and our 60+ spells.  To be specific, does anyone know if affliction 3 items effect our 60+ spells?  There is a lvl limit for affliction 1, 2, and 3 items, and if lvl 3 items are capped at lvl 60 or if they have pushed it to 60+.  Just wondering if the current afflication 3 items will become worthless when PoP comes out.  If they do not effect 60+ spells, the looks like a wasted some opportunities getting affliction items instead ac/hps/mana items. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If i am not mistaken, all normal class 3 focus items stop at 60. All high end items IE Vex Thal loot will cap a 63. This is all unfounded rumor so....I know my boots of the wind has a detremental spell mana reduction effect that per Lucy's is caped at lvl 63</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yathandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Your affliction 3 items will still be useful for your dots under level 60, ie when you land multiple dots on a target.  I don't see class 3 focus items losing value for a while.</div></div><hr />

Mages are getting more spells to summon focus items for use at 61+.  That kinda points to a class 4 and 5 (or more) series of focus items coming into play.  Mebe we will even get &quot;lucky&quot; and have a separate class of focus items for every expansion level!!  Seeing as how class 1, 2, and 3 items are good for more than 5 levels, it would kind of make sense to add just one more class, but that spits in the face of ubahness.<br />

On the bright side, that ODS you always wanted for your twink will be more reasonably priced. :)</div></div><hr />
