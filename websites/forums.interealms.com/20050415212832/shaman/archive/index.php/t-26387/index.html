<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ughbash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have noticed a lot of shamans don;t bother to crippel mobs for a group.  Is it generally considered that Cripple or Crippling Spasm is not worth the mana for non raid mobs?<br />
<br />
Do peopel consider it worth Crippling when Duoing?<br />
<br />
Generally I have been throwing Malos, Slow, Cripple, Dot on mobs for gruops and quinessence instead of the dot in Duo situations, was just wondering if I was wasting my time/mana with crippling spasm, and should instead stick a dot on mob?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">depends on where i'm at or whatnot, but generally unless I have a weak tank and we are fighting something that ramps hard or flurries a lot, then I won't bother with cripple.  Raid mobs.. yeah, it's a good idea to stick it on there, but in just normal groups I wouldn't bother.  Unless.. the above applies.<br />
<br />
The lightning guys in MPG I've seen tear through some weak tanks fast, so use it there if you are noticing that the flurry is eating up your tank fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ribeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">IMO, it is mostly useful for raid mobs.  A lot of raid mobs that are immune to slow can be crippled easily.<br />
<br />
Other than that, if I'm in a group with a weaker tank or lacking in dps, where keeping the tank up is either hard or becoming a mana burden for the healer, I'll use it.  I find it useful in Riftseekers when we don't have explosive dps mostly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gumurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I too whenever i'm in riftseekers use this spell.  Not many other places while exp'ing, mostly on raid encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I haven't used it in groups, but I use it when I root-rot... just in case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">my use of cripple/spasm is based on who is tanking.<br />
<br />
if the tank has a tough time holding agro i will not use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i don't have a TA so i like to keep this spell up in MPG and RS so i can grab agro if i need it.  some times on the stairs camp you get a 2 pull ect.  recast time on slow is kind of sucky so slow+cripple = agro + easier time tanking.  saved my cleric several times that way.<br />
<br />
i generally use to cripple everything unless there is a beafy tank in the group.  with panther, i find it hard to justify the mana cost of using cripple though.  panther is such a mana hog but it adds so much dps...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Has anyone actually parsed this as of yet?  I haven't seen a parse so far.  Would be very curious whether its truly worth it, especially on raid targets, secondly in groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Here is what I think about cripple(spasm).  If there is a chanter around, its thier job to cripple since we're slowing and doing other shaman things.  If the fight lasts for more than 30 secs or is a named and what not, there is no chanter, then yes...I cripple(spasm).  I havn't done or seen any parses to show its usefulness, but I figure it can only help...so if you have the mana and there isnt a chanter around, than cripple away and at least it can look like you're doing something useful :p  As for raid targets, again, if there is a chanter around ususaly its thier job to cripple(spasm) (at least on our raids).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Has anyone actually parsed this as of yet?  I haven't seen a parse so far.  Would be very curious whether its truly worth it, especially on raid targets, secondly in groups.<br />
No parse, sorry. But I never do it in groups and we rarely do on raids. While doing NToV, long time ago, I experimented with the effect of cripple on the flurries, and did not see a difference. Of course that is just the impression I had and we were actually beyond NToV as a guild at that time. If things look close, it may be the little thing that makes the the day. When one of our shamans thinks he wants to do cripple on raids, we usually have 6-8 shamans, than fine. Keeps em busy and maybe it helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You essentially notice it on mobs that tend to flurry and ramp a lot.  Like, do it on the Ixt named Txevu and you can see a big difference in how much they flurry (assuming that you have the flurry mob of course).  That mob flurries once every second and crippling it slows it done just a bit, but enough so that it makes the fight manageable.<br />
<br />
Rumblecrush would be another fight that I think crippling it makes a big difference.  Parse that fight with and without it once just to see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, since Enc's can cripple, we usually let them do it on raids anyways.  <br />
<br />
I've also noticed my cripple messages &quot;wearing off&quot; or &quot;would not take hold&quot;.  <br />
<br />
The enc cripple seems to be identical, but is there a necro dot, or other class crippling line that overwrites or won't stack?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grumblin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Debuffs not stacking could be because someone of a higher level having cast it? To my knowledge nothing blocks cripple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">/echo many.  Cripple on raids is an enchanter's job, and in exp groups, if a tank needs the help, they can't fight the agro.  So it rarely gets used.  I bust it out for named mobs in challenging zones, or for special cases.  It's very good in MPG &quot;Weaponry&quot; Trial, for instance.  Oh, and I cripple things when I'm tanking for lowbie raids :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think focus blocks cripple</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Scowls1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">i keep it memed alot, and use that gem to quick buff folks if i need.  i find it very useful on ramp mobs, like nocs, and high attk mobs, like RSS.  if the tank is taking a real beating from mobs, pop it on them and you should see a difference.  in Rss with cripple mobs hits drop from 1300ish to less than 1k, and there hits vary in dmg greatly, staying at the low end of scale more often..instead of a quad doing 1200 1000 1350 1100, the do more like 550, miss, 750, 980.  thats just a generality, not specific.  cripple isnt our most useful spell, but it has its uses.  i personally dont use it on every mob, just ones that need it, even in rss, its just to help out if tank takes a beating, since its time i cant dps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I don't really use it on normal mobs typically...the spell debuffs mobs attrbutes in a way that, 1. they don't hit for max as often, 2. they proc less (must for GoD+ mobs) and 3. melee does more damage.<br />
<br />
typically I'll use cripple for names, bosses, and mobs that proc alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">&quot;Debuffs not stacking could be because someone of a higher level having cast it? To my knowledge nothing blocks cripple.&quot;<br />
<br />
100% of our guild members are lvl 70, and someone is blocking my cripple attempts. I get consistent overwrites on raid mobs, or &quot;would not take hold&quot; messages from time to qvic, so some class out there has a spell that doesn't stack.  I was A) too lazy to look through all the class spells to check, and B) dubious about its value from the get go, so never bothered to resolve the stacking issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Fr0z3n</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">chanty cripple i would say :p ung</div></div><hr />

I think there is a bard song that blocks it, actually. The Chanter and Shaman cripple work just like our Turgurs and Balance, they overwrite each other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well, if he is actually using the real cripple, the 66 spells would probably overwrite/block it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I have also seen the will not take hold when useing crippling spasm, one of the few times I have used it.  Believe it was an Emoush hit and there were bored chanters there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>tangurena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The proc from the bard epic, Blade Dance, blocks cripple. So if you see noteblower around, may as well demem cripple</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Denorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Personally, I do cripple when in OoW zones where they proc chaos claws, which I guess it's supposed to make them proc less.  <br />
<br />
If there is a chanter in group, I let them cripple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I've also been finding myself letting the chanter slow in xp groups.  &gt;.&lt;  Leopard consumes so much mana...  and enchanters are typically pretty bored and just nuking anyway, so I let 'em slow.  That let's me focus on keeping leopard on people and throwing spam heals to help out the cleric.  Of course if there is no chanter, then I gotta also malos/slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Iynna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Relative to normal exp groups, my normal exp group of late is usually my 5600hp unbuffed two boxed monk tanking in WoS for me.  When I take on the named bazu, feran or chimera, I usually cripple it.  Normal spell order is slow, leopard dog and monk, cripple then dot.  No parses, but it seems to improve my survivability especially when conviction and KEI have both dropped.<br />
<br />
A year ago when I was PLing my 50 bst on a diet of velk's spiders, cripple seemed to increase the amount of dmg the bst did as well as limiting the damge he took.  Might be minor effects, but for a maginal tank/mana pool it's one extra advantage we can bring to the fight.<br />
<br />
Old school is to cripple any thing that is yellow or red conn or that hits like a truck and has a mountain of HP and I just blindly follow that.  At 225 base mana, spasm is just about half a canni to recover.   Other than pulling aggro if you try to land it too soon, no harm in doing it when a spell gem is available.<br />
