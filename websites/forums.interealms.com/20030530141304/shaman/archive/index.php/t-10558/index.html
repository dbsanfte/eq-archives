<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there anyway to buy velious online and get the cd key emailed to you? I want to do the coldain bracer quest and will be easier if my second acount is velious enabled.<br />
<br />
anyway anybody know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Prolly easiest to just go out... you know like, irlz(tm!), to the store and grab a copy.  Much faster too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you recieved one of those free trilogy account codes they mailed out severl months ago you could upgrade an account without kunark/velious to trilogy for free.<br />
<br />
A friend of mine did this on her account that only had luclin and basic. She just went to register expansion, put in the code from the email and clicked upgrade account. She did it a few months after the key was supposed to expire too, but I don't know if it'd still work now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Velious doesn't sell in stores anymore. So I would have to buy it online that takes time heh. Was hoping I could find a place that emailed the aoucnt key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No I don't think there is any way to purchase a CD Key online.</div></div><hr />
