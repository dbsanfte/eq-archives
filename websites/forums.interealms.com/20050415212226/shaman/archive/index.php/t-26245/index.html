Did I miss anything which ABSOLUTELY needs an extra level of preservation? If so, please link it. Many of the info and quests which were cutting-edge and e-penis-enhancing with lower level caps are just distractions nowadays, so I'm trying to get just the highest-order of importance. Of course our goal will be to keep everything that we have now, somehow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Assume you already have our best epic 1, 1.5, 2 guides?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">And the Shaman AA chart? Samanna has one on the Reference site, and I've been working on an update to the Crucible's version for some time now. I'm about halfway done — RL always seems to get in the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The original project alpha thread for a good laugh?</div></div><hr />

Was a good thread for stuff of that era.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ladikennoch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Maybe UgZug's alchemy chart?  It is obviously very not up to date since DoN era but it is still a really, really good reference guide for any beginning alchemists.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">imo, beginning alchemists need a liquor bottle more than any guide.  Poor bastards.<br />
<br />
More relevantly, EQTraders has infinitely more Alchemy resources than they did when UgZug made his wonderful contribution to the Crucible website.  It was that lack, I believe, that really motivated the guide.  At this point it doesn't have a lot of usefully unique information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">New ownership?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Assume you already have our best epic 1, 1.5, 2 guides?<br />
I have 1.5 and 2.0; 1.0 is on EQShaman.com, and I link to it.<br />
<br />
How about the Mob Slowability chart that has been missing for some time?<br />
I have GheffGutterbrains' storymod version; the best out-of-game resource that I have seen is at http://mov.blix.com/too.html and I will see if MoV minds if I reproduce it, otherwise I'll just link to it.<br />
<br />
And the Shaman AA chart? Samanna has one on the Reference site, and I've been working on an update to the Crucible's version for some time now. I'm about halfway done — RL always seems to get in the way.<br />
I will work on putting more detail into my guide; originally it was intended as a quick reference only.<br />
<br />
The original project alpha thread for a good laugh?<br />
Heh, too many threads for that, I think.<br />
<br />
How about the list of IP's and usernames that have been banned.<br />
I can save that list to hard drive, good thought.<br />
<br />
Stoicism quest as well.<br />

Will do, thanks.<br />
<br />
Alchemy - yes, I think EQTraders has really caught up on that front; no real need to duplicate their work.<br />
<br />
Any others?</div></div><hr />

Ok Sam, if you like I can put the Crucible's chart into your page's format and work on it that way instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you want to make a guide, I'll include that, and leave mine as a quick reference. Or take mine down if it's redundant. I don't want to discourage anyone from pitching in. :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have saved every one of the threads listed above (except, as indicated, the Alchemy one) to my hard drive now, just in case.<br />

Were any added since the 19th?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The information is very valid and should be seen at least once by all people who plan to post in a forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">It's not very pretty, but I've duplicated these threads (minus images) at http://samanna.net/CRUCIBLE_SAVES<br />
<br />
Note, all links on those pages actually link to the real crucible site, so if you reply there... you're really replying here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>eci_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I'm not sure if this was in the list or if you have this on your site, but what about all the alt activation codes for AA abilities?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">You know, I'd have sworn I had those listed, but I can't find them. I'll add them, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I think the alt activate codes are listed on Samanna's AA chart next to their respective AA ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">D'oh, there they are - only the categories that have them have the 'code' column, and only the abilities with an actual code have a number there. Thanks, Tordail. Going slowly crazy here... guild site is down now. =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Heheh I know what you mean ... I thought I was going to go nuts without the Crucible the other day. But I persevered! :p</div></div><hr />
