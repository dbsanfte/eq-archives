Please tell me I'm missing something vital or that my remaining options are not, in fact, trivial or useless.  It used to bring me lots of pleasure working and saving for a small improvement to my character, I'd hate to think those small pleasures are over with.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My thoughts:<br />
<br />
* Innate metabolism is surprisngly worthwhile for a cheap price of 3 AA. <br />
<br />
* You haven't done SCF/FoM yet? Crits are FUN!!!<br />
<br />
* Pet discipline --&gt; handy.<br />
<br />
* Suspend Minion 2 - very handy, especially for moving around dungeons. I usually zone into a place, summon/buff/arm pet and then pocket him until I need him. I use this one A LOT.<br />
<br />
* Spirit Call - I find this useful for offtanking multi-pulls. Puppy speedbumps is what I call 'em.</div></div><hr />

/agree. :cool: <br />
Check my Magelo - I'm almost at 400 now myself.  My Magelo is about 10 aa's short.  I can't even recall which GoD aa I invested in the second level of, which is sort of sad, but matches what I think you are feeling - our AA future isn't very bright. :o <br />
<br />
SCF3 &amp; FoM3 is a long haul aa'wise, but I have noticed a discernible difference in my nuke dps because of them.  This was probably most noticeable on Grummus raids (I went on at least a dozen of them pick-up before I was finally flagged) where DoTs weren't feasible and I could only rain situationally.  When chain casting Spear of Torment the crits really added up - even if all it really meant was that my damage went from being lousy to just mediocre. :p   <br />
<br />
When chain raining Tears/Torrent you can do some very nice burst dps with a string of crits.  I've seen 1300, 650, 1300, 540, 1080, 1080 before off of just 2 casts.  The triple crit has still evaded me though. :p  Of course the number of times you can do this for any period of time when raiding is pretty small, but it is fun nonetheless. ;)  <br />
<br />
Spirit Call is handy for many little things, though if you mostly raid in PoP/GoD it won't do much for you.  If you solo, I'd get this next.  It can and will save your life.<br />
<br />
Pet discipline is nice for grouping when you are the puller, or when you will be raiding a big mob w/ an AE (where push isn't an issue) to keep your pet held until the assist call is made.  Will enable you to use dogdog on raids where you otherwise might not bother for fear of inadvertant dog attacks.  This does require a bit of extra attention (as /pet hold isn't a persistent command - you have to hit it after every doggy combat) but I'm glad I got it.<br />
<br />
Innate Metabolism was worth the 3 aa just because I'm lazy.  Saves me from stopping every 2-3 days for food &amp; drink.  Instead I only worry about food once or twice every few weeks. <br />
<br />
Other than that, maybe a level of Quickened Curing or Secondary Forte (gimped as it is) might be worthwhile.<br />
<br />
Sadly, I don't see anything 'vital' for you (or myself) aa'wise.  I've purposely avoided Crit Aff 2&amp;3 since I already have aggro issues when I push hard in LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>FletcheraDebuffinMuffin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have 694 aa atm.. still finding useful ones. Check my magelo. I'd advise finishing up class AA &amp; then getting ALL god ones. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Depends what you are doing mostly. If you solo alot secondary fort might be intressting. In groups (as the other already pointed out) critt nukes can be nice. I like our swarm doggies in groups, when I solo and on raids too. For farming droga or inner AC suspended minon is _very_ handy. /pet hold is a nice_to_have thingy. With this command you can have a doggy up and play puller without spaming /pet backoff. For raiding or PvP quicken curing could be a life safer but in normal XP zones not that great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've found crit AA fully maxed to be VERY helpful, Frekkels.<br />
<br />
It works on your epic and every DOT you have.  It seems to help a lot when I'm soloing or duoing at Plane of Fire tables.  When I'm there I stack on epic, bane, blood of saryrn, ulthor, and pox and can get a possible 5 crits per tick.  Not that 5 crits per tick is going to happen, but you can see how with five minutes worth of dotting every mob, 5 chances per tick means 50 chances to crit per minute, or 250 per mob.  With some fudge factor involved on the time, of course, because everything varies, and I don't always keep every DOT on every mob the full way through.  Anyway, you can see how much extra damage that could do.  Heck, just a couple of crits with bane alone really adds up.  And those two-minute disease DOTs become more attractive when you think about how many chances to crit they're going to give you.<br />
<br />
It also helps when you're doing scarier mobs, like nameds.  There are some mobs in GoD, for instance, that will pop a pet out on you if you don't kill them quick enough -- a pet who is hard to root and hits really fast and hard enough to matter.  Or maybe you just need to kill something before a respawn or roamer gets in your face.  Every little bit of damage helps when you're on a timer.<br />
<br />
I don't DOT on raids, so it means nothing to me there, but solo or duo, exp or loot camping, I really think crit AA is a great one to max out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hail,<br />
I've found crit AA fully maxed to be VERY helpful, Frekkels.  I'm sure you do. :D  If I could turn it off/on, I'd grind and max it this week. ;)  It does have great potential for soloing. :) <br />
<br />
The major reason I don't have it maxed is because I can't control when it fires, which means if I'm tossing just a single dot (Bane usually) per mob in LDoN (with grunge groups where I'm typically the strongest player in terms of AA's &amp; gear) I might end up tanking any specific mob for virtually the entire fight if it crits early.  Crit Affliction I has already had this happen to me.  I love seeing the 800 odd tick, but because of DoT aggro it means I have to pay for it in spades when grouped.<br />
<br />
It would be really nice if we could toggle it on/off for solo/group situations.  My tanks have to struggle enough when I'm leading (I pull rather furiously, and I go full bore (if they can keep up) for almost the entire adventure. :D <br />
<br />
Lately I've been soloing or duoing alot, so I'll probably end up getting this after all. :cool:  <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You trained innate strength before you trained spirit call and spell casting fury.  This makes me question your sanity.<br />
<br />
Those AA's shouldn't be at the top of anyone's &quot;to get&quot; list, but by the time you have 400AA you should have picked up both of them.<br />
<br />
Rabid Bear, although technically useless, has definately given me 5aa's worth of amusement.<br />
<br />
I use bristlebane's party platters as my food, so having innate metab was a good buy for me.  Definately something you should buy if you are past the 400 mark.<br />
<br />
Pet discipline is nice for LDoN's (or any situation) where you are pulling, and suspended minion is great for any time you have to invis or if you are dueling.  I wouldn't put these high on my list, but again, you are past the 400 mark so there isn't much left.<br />
<br />
I basically retired a week after GoD came out, so I don't know much about those AA's.  However, I'd imagine that even in its nerfed form, secondary forte is worth buying if you're running out of other things.<br />
<br />
So, for you, I'd do this:<br />
<br />
SCF and FOM<br />
Spirit Call (at least up to level 3.  I don't know if the GoD SC sucks still or not)<br />
whatever you want from the above list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Seichan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I am primarily an elemental soloing/raiding Shaman.  Dogdog is of just about zero use or utility against anything I kill for exp, so I view suspend minion and pet discipline as desireable and useful as rabid bear.  I can see some utility in the pack-o-retarded dogs in speed bumping a double pull or quick escape and dueling as well.  <br />
<br />
Again due to where and what I solo, the only time I load a nuke is when Bane and BoS just both wore off my mob at 0% and I'd rather save myself the to Canni4's worth of mana between Spear of Torment and throwing a DoT on and waiting for the tick to roll over.  Though mostly useless to me, will definitly get crits before anything Dogdog related.<br />
<br />
Innate Metabolism is something I totally glossed over and should really get soon.  Even though I farm and make my own stacks of Crab Legs and Kaladim.. doing that less often sounds very appealing.  <br />
<br />
But I guess it is as I feared.. I'm no longer looking forward to that next huge tiny character improvement...and just grabbing whatever I see as less useless at the time.  At least I still have some tradeskills torture myself with ;&gt;  Thank you all who offered their advice, it is always much appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It looks like he skipped all the fun AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Seichan, if a EP mob is at 2 or 3% health you can use spirit call to finish the mob. ;) And on raids pets get used to position mobs or to eat the 1st rampages. And on raids are nukes &gt;&gt;&gt; dots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Another thumbs up for spell fury and spiritcall, especially seeing how many aa you have.<br />
<br />
Think of spiritcall3 as a 7500hp rune that has 5 chances to enrage ;)<br />
<br />
Also, with FoMM3 I crit a LOT, to the point where the top wizard in our alliance calls me Grogwiz ;)<br />
<br />
Anyway, both are fun aa's. Personally, I'm sitting about 360ish and have all the fun aa, really no clue what to do next........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Spirit Call.  For Sure.  <br />
<br />
5 dog's each of who can enrage - that's 12 seconds of survival while stupid_mob_001 beats on a riposting dogdog!  <br />
<br />
Great push for mob positioning sometimes (very situational).<br />
<br />
Good to pull with, no, GREAT to pull with, buys loads of time for Malos/Slow, even against elemental mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have the GoD aa spiritcall and while it would be better on a seperate timer from the original, they have indeed fixed it. The 3 new pups have good hps, each hitting in the  range of 24 - 114 or thereabouts.<br />
Glad I got it.</div></div><hr />
