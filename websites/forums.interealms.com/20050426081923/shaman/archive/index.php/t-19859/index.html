<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>NoobShaman05</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been retired from EQ for sometime and me and a friend are getting back into it and plan on just playing together.<br />
He is going to play a Necro and I, a shaman and I was wondering where some good exp spots are that we could hit up for 1-20. Any help is appreciated =) (I'm using my old main to twink us a little bit so a place with quest for equipment or anything else isn't neccesary just good exp ) :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>lugoj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Depending on your server, I've found Paludal Caverns to be an excellent way to swing from 5 to 20 depending on your luck and groups. Before that I just hit my home zone (Nek Forest) and then hooked up with my roomie's ranger and went to work. Just be sure to learn cure disease before progressing inwards to the Flarg Fiends, they have an annoying disease dot that lands pretty easily.</div></div><hr />

Once you guys get closer to 20 - shoot for Sol A.  Pal Caverns is a great place too, however sometimes crowded.  Sol A usually has one or two folks in it, otherwise it's empty.  After 20, nedaria's landing isn't bad at all either.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lanadena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The misty thicket walled area (goblins, orcs, spiders) should get you to 13 or so.  You can also hit Northern Karanas bandits, and the wildlife there (lions and beetles) from 12 to 20.  In the 12 to 25 range you can also go to Eastern Karanas for the gorge hounds, spiders and gnoll reavers.  The plus side to Eastern Karanas is that it's close to High Keep where you can do some banking.  <br />
<br />
None of these places are hunted regularly on Xegony so if it's the same on your server, then you don't have to fight for your pulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">kurns was lotsa fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Newbie Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/agree with junkilo. Kurn's will be a great spot for xp and for the necro to get lots and lots of bone chips. should be pretty fast, then hit paludal till ~23 or when the xp is really slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Draconis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you have GoD, the Fhalls expidition in Nedaria is good, It scales to your level and the mobs are non-kos and non-social till 50ish so you can just go from the bat room to the rat room back and forth clearing them. at 24 i was getting about 1.5% a kill solo and grouped it was a little over 1% a kill maybe 1.2% or something. just dont attacking anything other than the rats and bats or you will have the whole zone on you, I learned that the hard way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Medasinman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You could do Nek forest till about 11, then go to Kurns to 16. Often overlooked from 16-23 when PC is booked, is the low side of OT. You can sit at the book to PoK and not have to worry about the golem coming to you if one of you is not evil race, pull and fear kite Rhinos, Cacti, Sarnak etc to your hearts content, if you made a Troll or Ogre Shammy, bonus!<br />
<br />
PC is great for xp from 16 to 23, doining the Fhall exp is awesome xp, I solo that with my shammy alot, they have a ton of hp, so don't expect to pet tank them with the necro pet, it's gimp till 49.<br />
<br />
I soloed my necro all the way to 51, and I so wish I had two accounts to two-box my shammy, and may still do that one of these days....<br />
<br />
Hope it helps, good luck with what you doin. <br />

&quot;I lurk here....&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Crinic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I believe that GoD zones are now mostly KoS so going there and trying to kill at a low level is probably not a good idea anymore . . . a post was made about swinging from rat room to bat room - things have changed I understand.<br />
<br />
Secondly - as far as I can tell - unless you started your shaman TWINKED to the max - Paludal Caverns - even in a group would be a wipe. Paludal Caverns is teens to 25th (although at 25 XP is slow). If you enter there at anything under about 10th level your gonna not be able to hit or cast spells on anything - and they will ALL aggro to you and serve you up for lunch.<br />
<br />
Forget trying to solo it (laugh) at 1 - 10th.<br />
<br />
I cannot stand twinked people ie gone and Ebayed their toon or transfered HUGELY powerful items over to toon or bought $$ offline to twink their toon . . . reason is - your &quot;cheating&quot; the game pretty much and yourself. I get frustrated as hell sometimes being a lowlif- cough - level but I still suffer the grief and build from the bottom up . . . otherwise why play?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Meh I soloed PC with a iksar regen plate at about 10th level.  I believe most people twink because most of the people that twink have been through the lower levels several times and it gets tedious after a while.  Either way I will continue to make many more twinks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You can effectively level in PC at about lvl 4 and up.  Go in from the shadeweever thicket side and you will enter in on mobs the same lvl as you.  Stay there till 10ish, then move in to the tunnels some more. Nothing is kos to you until you see the phlargs.  Kill beetles and shrooms till you get to about 17.  Head back out to shadeweever and take off to the other ent. (the popular ent from bazaar -&gt; SH -&gt; PC).  Bandits till around 23.  After that you are gonna need to find a new zone, the exp in PC tapers out pretty drastically after that lvl.  I usually tend to take my chars. from PC to MM, but seeing as they revamped that, i cant do that anymore.  When i get home from Kuwait i will be able to start hunting again and find new zones.</div></div><hr />

I found Crushbone a good spot for quick 5-14 lvl and then moved to PC to lvl 20..from there it was on to Nerthubian Lair and Marsus Saru to 29.<br />
Dawnshroud Peaks was next stop and then Dreadlands and OT. Good Luck 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Oh forgot about Crushbone, that is still fun place till about 15 or so.</div></div><hr />
