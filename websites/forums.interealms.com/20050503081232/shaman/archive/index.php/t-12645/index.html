<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Isn't that Warcraft 3 ? What the hell, are they getting so lazy that they have to copy another game ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Why not use the Warcraft 3 engine. Its very sound. I mean think about how many games were built on the Age of Empires Engine? <br />
<br />
Age of Empires, Age of Mythology, Empire Earth, Star Wars (name escapes me), and at least 2 others I can't recall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I hope they have a &quot;custom game&quot; feature like WC3 does. That rules in WC3. :p <br />
<br />
I think this *could* be a step in the right direction, because if they have a campaign mode there would actually be a storyline you can be part of, instead of just reading a few pages of history.</div></div><hr />

You can't argue that the screenshot looks incredibly War3-esque. It seems kind of strange that they would be able to license a copy of the War3 engine from Blizzard, since they've never licensed out their engines before. Add in the fact that World of Warcraft seems to be targetted specifically at EverQuest's fanbase and it seems terribly unlikely that Sony and Blizzard would want to do business with each other. Stranger things have happened in the past, though.<br />
