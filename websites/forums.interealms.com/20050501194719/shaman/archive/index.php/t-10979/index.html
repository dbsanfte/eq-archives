<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I want to make note of how disappointed I am with the way EQ news services have declined in quality and services.<br />
<br />
The last update from castersrealm is from Tuesday, and the last from Everlore is Wed, except for a blurb that their picture upoloader is fixed.<br />
<br />
What about those of us who have to WORK for a living but want an EQ fix?  Who is asking SoE what the new patch-parts are? How come I have to learn about the map-system here on the crucible..shouldn't news reporting sites have that info up already?<br />
<br />
I dont mean to critisise these great sites whom have provided a great free service for so long, but reporting news is a responsibility not to be taken lightly.  If they can update their popup ads every day, they can at least INVENT something new to read on the site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Map system is supposed to be announced by Sony today.  What has been posted on it so far is conjecture based on one guy opening the XML file from test, and supposedly some NDA breakage from someone in beta.<br />
