<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Saldaora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We're both 62 now, and miss the days where we could just pop on and exp for an hour real quick and take off without having to find a group.<br />
<br />
We've being doing ldon's and PoP zones grouped of late, but wouldn't mind finding a nice spot where we can duo whenever we feel like it...<br />
<br />
Monk has maxed stats when buffed, epic, and 32% haste, around 4.5k hps with virtue.  Shammie has epic, JBB (tho mostly worthless now), MP4, and does not have canni 5 as of yet.<br />
<br />
Any ideas or suggestions?  It would have to be outside of PoP of course (I don't think the monk can tank there anymore).  And we're mostly looking for exp at this time.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Soloing / duoing improves a lot at level 61 - the new Dogdog really is a great improvement!<br />
<br />
Duo spots not already mentioned:<br />
Veksar (bring IVU potions)<br />
SolC (prolly only entrance, but good exp)<br />
CoD zone in area</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slavage909</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Try Plane of Nightmare mazes.<br />
<br />
4-6ish aa percent per kill solo.<br />
<br />
Takes 3ish banes 2 pox and a few epics and dog to kill them.  All single pulls. I go and solo sometimes when I can't get a group...monk will need a way to gate out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I duoed a lot with a monk friend while leveling up to 65. Some of the places we went to that haven't been listed:<br />
<br />
PoN - werewolves<br />
PoN - yard trash<br />
PoN - gargoyles<br />
<br />
PoD - flies, goos and other yard trash<br />
<br />
PoI - factory (this was awesome up to 64)<br />
<br />
LoY - Crypt of Nadox (very good cash)<br />
<br />
Umbral Plains - chance at some items from the wandering nameds</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">These 3 are very *FUN* zones, IMO.  When we finished these, a large part of our fun in EQ dried up.  They aren't your typical grind zones.<br />
<br />
Veksar - tons and tons of fun, raise cabilis faction, too! <br />
Chardok B - easier to get there with good chardok faction, but not necessary.  The run is so long you'll probably want to camp out there a while, but we didn't really mind it.  Great ZEM, good drops, good bazaar fodder, too.  Duo-able quest for a NICE range item.<br />
Droga - was already mentioned, but this zone is so much fun.  I think I just love those goblin models.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Krakur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was always partial to fungus grove myself, the shik'nar royal guards / warriors there are decent experience (at least they were) and you can make away with a good chunk of change selling the chitinous belts / brown chitin legs / arms, plus, if ya ever plan on joining a VT raiding guild, that would be one less shard to worry about.<br />
<br />
Sure, it may not be that exciting, but at least it's not crowded :b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If the Shaman is planning to work on his 8th Shawl at some point, you may want to visit Velks. Not the best XP in the world, but very easy, mostly single pullable, almost half the mobs should still be dark blue at 62 and you can kill them non-stop. Grab all the Velium that you can carry and seel it in the Bazaar, not to mention the nice NO DROP earring from the new named spider on the first floor and the Bazaar drops from various named spiders.<br />
<br />
Oh yes, and the PoJ jail area on the way to Mavuin. At 62 it's no longer the great XP it would have been for you in the 50s, but it's still decent, fairly easy if you camp in the safe spot in the main hall immediately on the right, and the diamonds/BDs/EPs plus VT drops worth 10-42-71-100pp do add up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Good points.  If I had it to do over again, I'd do more of those quests that I didn't do because &quot;I'll never see that part of the game&quot;... because farming all those VT shards at once was EVIL (tho seeing VT was worth it).  Seems that having SOME goal other than just grinding makes things 1000% better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Saldaora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We're on the 5th shawl for the shaman, and have half our lucid shards for VT :)<br />
<br />
I'll look into Fungus though, we don't have that one yet!  We might spend more time in Veksar as well, to bad it's out of the way though...  Droga we've been to and enjoy it, I'm guessing duo we'd have to go halfway into the dungeon or so (with full group we go all the way down).  Monk would probably just use a gate potion to get out though, shammie invis is soooooo unreliable :P<br />
<br />
Thanks for the input all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">inner acrylia was fairly good.  I duo'd there with a ranger.  Search on this forum for a writeup of where to find nameds and whatnot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Slavage909</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Fungus shard is a easy camp.  Any warriors or higher(i think) will drop it.  There are two warriors when you first enter the bug city tunnel.  As long as you keep them up on there little hill they won't argo the ones right below them.<br />
<br />
Kill the surrounding ones..monk fd pulls one ...kill it ...then jump on other one.   Just keep them rooted once you have the two killed.<br />
<br />
Done it solo at 62-63 vp/root one and tank and kill the other one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Veksar is a quicker run than FG, I'll wager (without a port to TS).  FV book brings almost on top of the LOIO zoneline, then a half zone  run into the lake.  It's very easy to navigate the dungeon, too, once you've crawled through it a handful of times.<br />
<br />
Droga - with a sow from outside, or RS3, getting to your choice named is pretty quick with invis.  I'd typically risk it (even tho my partner would greater invis down and CoH me) because <br />
1) the aggro range in droga is ridiculously small (unless they changed it).. it's truly tiny<br />
2) there are mob-free spots at very regular intervals to stop, double check your buff, and continue on<br />
3) there are very few spots along the way where you're likely to have more than 1 or 2 gobs to contend with.  A couple fast slows and you're safe (assuming they're not ice comet guys, those are dangerous)<br />
<br />
Fun fun drops to be had, and if I remember right the h2h we got out of the jail area is the best droppable h2h you can get.  Or 2nd best...  *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I duoed a bit with a Monk when we were both 65 (PoV).  Found it worked fairly well if I tanked (hehe - got aggro) and let monk do pulls and dps.  Between slows, heals, and dot's, I thened to get aggro anyway so just sat on drog, cast Q on self from time to time and kept DoT's on mob and cast Q on Monk from time to time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Don't forget SolC.  Good place.  Just need a way to snare or root the runners.<br />
<br />
Once you get to 65 with full spellbook and good gear.... couple hundred AAs (most of the defensive on both shaman and monk)... it's not a prob to duo where you'll normally find a full group.  I duo in CoD undead and rats, PoV, BoT, HoH, Tactics, etc...  any place weaker than that is a cakewalk.  Kunark, Velious, and Luclin zones are a joke.</div></div><hr />
