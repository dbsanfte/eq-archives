<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With this patch came a revamp to a number of powerful but far too long reuse cleric AAs, imho showing that VI still do care about luclin AA.<br />
<br />
<br />
How about fixing a weak shaman AA with a far too long reuse timer too? =(<br />
<br />
Discuss!<br />

<br />

Increase Overhaste by 10%<br />
Increase AC by 30<br />
Increase STR by 160 <br />

Increase Mana regen by 2<br />
+ 80dd proc (With a proc rate similar to 60 summoned cleric hammer)<br />
+ Double atk skill of 160<br />
+ Slam skill of 50<br />
<br />
*Changes = Full time +50 CR is likely unbalancing, so thats gone. The attack is lowered also, it won't make much of a difference but it cuts down on the 'omgs so much attack' whinge likelyhood. Double attack and haste element lowered to limit the potential dps against low ac mobs to a more reasonable level.<br />
<br />
The innate proc should be a disease based DD (NO dot element) with NO resist adjustment (IE it lands with the same frequency as BoUltor), this gives more use to Malicious decay/insid malady so we can get the most out of this ability. The reasoning for this is that if we can land poison fine, we are more likely to use BoSaryn/Nife, hence it would be an alternative source of damage when our poison dots and cold nukes simply get resisted too much.<br />
<br />
The slam skill level is quite low, but that is to prevent it from being too effective with such a large atk element. It appears to be possible to have a buff give the player a buttoned skill (Ogre/troll/barb illusion grants the player Slam, even if they don't have it in there normal form), although how flexible this is is unknown.<br />
<br />
It should stack in much the same way as Rabid bear, but also block voice of the berserker and form of the bear/greater bear/other illusions (To prevent getting around the size issue of being a bear, this would be a fair limitation of using the buff imho).<br />
<br />
Its base duration should mirror the mage elemental form line with a 36 min duration and 15 minute recast time on the ability.<br />
<br />
Visually 1 of 2 approaches is best, if global model load is an issue, simply replace the existing old bear model with the bear from PoStorms, the PoS bear is MORE complete than the old world bear as it also includes casting animations. Otherwise as suggested, if global model space is no longer an issue, perhaps using the Velious kodiak would be more fitting?<br />
<br />
All in all, the buff is basically a combination upgrade of Voice of the berserker, form of the great bear and Rabid bear all rolled into one and brought into line in a way that would actually make it worth casting in the pop environment without it being overpowering since it still has limitations (Size issues and buff slot issues).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it would be a great change, but i dont see them doing such an extensive overhaul on rabid bear...the skill itself i dont think is that broken..its just the reuse time that really kills it.  If they could do any one thing to improve the skill just lowering reuse time to ~50 minutes and keeping the hastened rabidity as is would go a long way to making the skill better.  They could even increase the length the ability stays active and would please just about everyone i think.<br />
<br />
The other thing i noticed is they made the cleric AA's into group abilities...what if they lowered reuse of rabid bear and made it affect the whole group? seems like it would be a pretty dang nice aa then, and obviously if they can make cleric aa's do this they can make ours as well :)</div></div><hr />

/nod<br />
<br />
I just want the bloody reuse time issue delt with, for this kinda AA there is no reason we cant have it up all the time or a very short reuse time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">- Purify Soul reuse time reduced from 72 minutes to 30 minutes. <br />
<br />
- Divine Resurrection reuse time reduced from 36 hours to 18 hours. <br />
<br />
- Celestial Regeneration reuse timer reduced from 72 minutes to 15 minutes. We have increased the duration from 24 seconds to 48 seconds, adjusted the amount healed, and made this a group effect. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
they change mage's illusion AA a while ago, now 2 more class; hopefully we are next for change rabid bear's reuse time and duration !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">wow, another rabid bear thread<br />

it's never going to get fixed, let it die</div></div><hr />

So at this rate.....October at the earliest?  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">At least make it the same duration/reuse as the mage AA forms.   If I could use it constantly like they can.. I would -at least in dungeons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Funny, I remember people saying that way back when, when alchemy was bugged and couldn't be trained at guildmaster, thus no shamans could use the skill, and look at it now.<br />
<br />
Quite frankly the squeaky wheel gets the grease, and I'd certainly be happy if it got changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Remember when we still had spectral turn ins for group dex and str that didnt stack with focus?  Maybe we should have let that issue die, after all, they never fixed it...Oh wait they did.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its very obvious if you use a nice big slow 2hander with rabid bear however.</div></div><hr />
