<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kunderu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I finally completed the Canni II quest, the last leg I did was the Shaman Powder from Trakanon's Teeth.. A 54 Druid friend and a 62 Epiced Necro buddy of his were getting my druid frien his Seb key so i went along for the ride and got the powder and my own Seb key as a bonus.. WOOT...</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's SO much easier then Canni I (less Canni's for more mana).<br />
<br />
With a KEI, Regen and Canni II, I&quot;m never below 80%Hp and 80%Mana - unless I have to rebuff (can't wait for HoS).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">gratz on that guys. I never did get canib 2 so when I went to 3 I was completely blown away.<br />
<br />
I just couldn't take the hell that is karnor's for long enough to get the drop there  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Congrats, I've been trying since lvl 34 to get all the components needed to complete that damn quest ! No one is in Karnor's hardly anymore, so it's hard for a 46 Shaman (me) to get a group to get the greyish bones. Plus getting the Shaman powder is quite the pain the rear ! <br />
<br />
Congrats anyway !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Urnti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just finished canni ii and my advice for the KC part..go durning prime time and ask if someone is camping warlord room (normally a monk is), invis up and run your butt to their camp (DON'T bring a train), they sit your but down in the corner and wait (all as long as they are cool with it).<br />
<br />
Took me about an hour and warlord poped, they killed and I looted.</div></div><hr />
