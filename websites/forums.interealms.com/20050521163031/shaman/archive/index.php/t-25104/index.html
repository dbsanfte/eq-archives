<br />
So, is it true that we can't get the quests for these until we hit level 20?<br />
<br />
I like to bank quests as much as possible, so I don't have to run back to town as often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Correct, you must have your subclass and L20 to even begin, and its not really quests . . . it's one progressive quest.<br />
<br />
Lots of travel involved, bring your SoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Horomen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Im still working on #1 as time allows....only have half of the ghosts and no luck on getting the Gnolls to spawn at all. Good thing is at level 20 the experience for our duo mowing thru waves of green and blue con mobs is pretty decent. I almost feel bad when we have 8 or 9 green skellies in camp and they cant kill us heeh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You won't get the gnolls on your own.  Grab 2 or 3 other melee DPS types, and you'll have a chance.<br />
<br />
We did the camp just past the Tower of Vhalen on Qeynos Highway.  I think there are 3 or 4 groups around the hill that need to be killed off.  Remember, all of the groups surrounding the tent must be dead AT THE SAME TIME.  If group 1 respawns while you are killing group 4 the Elders will never spawn.  Sometimes you have to keep killing off groups as they respawn for a while before the Elders spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Horomen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">How many elders spawn at a time? Hopefully more than one =P<br />
<br />
I missed the part about having all of em down at once when I read the big walkthrough...guess ill start lookin for some others to join.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Two, and two Tormentors.  Another class (crusader?) needs those Tormentors.  The Elders are Shaman incidentally . . . kill them first.</div></div><hr />

2 Elders and 2 Tormentors usually from what I saw.<br />
<br />
Good thing you do not need 20 of them like the Plaquebringer Acolytes for our AC2 :)<br />
<br />
edit: AC2, not 3, sorry.</div></div><hr />
