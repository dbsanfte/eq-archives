<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shokar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I attended a seminar once that had this message:<br />
<br />
&quot;Figure out what your time is worth, and don't do ANYTHING that does not pay you your hourly worth&quot;<br />
<br />
What this means is this:  If you are a IT Profession, and you make, say $100.00 an hour, and your company sends you off to fix someone's computer.  A Techie could have fixed that computer for say, $50.00 an hour.  So, the company just blew $50.00 an hour on you.<br />
<br />
If you are a physical therapist making $100.00 an hour, would you do a job for $50.00, thus losing $50.00 an hour?<br />
<br />
Let's take this into the EQ world.  I read another thread where someone stated they can make 5K a week selling bargain basement sow and shrink potions.  So I got to thinking.....<br />
<br />
Okay, maybe after selling 5K worth of potions, they start to recoup their developmental costs in building potions up to trivial levels.  Then after that, they are making a very small profit.<br />
<br />
But is it WORTH their time to do so?  So I priced out my time.  At level 57 with my Paladin, I can make 250 plat an hour, easily.  If I want experience too, and can get a camp in Ice Giants, I can make, say 175 plat an hour?  Or I can do OOT Seafluffies and make maybe 150 an hour.  Or I can group in UP and get one Blue Exp and 100 plat in say, three hours.  (with a chance at a sellable drop, or upgrade to my equipment.)<br />
<br />
So, that means to me that my time is roughly worth 200 plat an hour, and that one blue of exp is equal to 750 -1000 plat for me.<br />
<br />
So, with our friend that is MAKING 5K a week.  How much time does it take to make potions that net him a profit of 5K?  It is my guess that if he were to use my above examples, then he is LOSING money and experience by selling bargain basement potions.<br />
<br />
If the amount of time it takes to make 5K profits in potions were used on experience hunting or farming hunting, his profits would 10-15K.  SO, by him opening a bargain basement shop, and doing one of the most TEDIOUS and BORING aspects of EVERQUEST, he is LOSING 5-10K a week.<br />
<br />
That is a colossal loss of time and experience, and a colossal waste, because he could cut his potion building time in HALF by pricing his wares at a realistic market value.  SO, if he would spend half the time making his potions, and sell them at correct and reasonable prices, he could double his earnings and experience and reduce boredom by 50%.  <br />
<br />
It just makes good business and gaming sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You're assuming that he/she has blocks of time where he can spend time getting experience and plat.<br />
<br />
If he/she only has blocks of 15 minutes or so, its probably not worth the run out to the hunting area for one or two kills.  He CAN however spend 15 minutes making several sets of potions.   (now, can he do enough of those 15 minute sessions to make 5k in profit? maybe not, but its something to think about).<br />
<br />
<br />
Also this person might not want to gain experience without his friends around so they all stay the same level.  This means he has to do non-exp things.  In this case, if he's 50+ he might be better off camping for acrylia on greenies and can make more than 200p an hour doing that :-)  of course,  he/she better stay away from MY acrylia camp until I level all my alts up there making lots of money :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shokar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Two day ago I was in Freeport.<br />
<br />
Re: &quot;If he/she only has blocks of 15 minutes or so, its probably not worth the run out to the hunting area for one or two kills&quot;<br />
<br />
Friend of mine wanted me to help powerlevel someone in SOL B.  So off I went.  Ran in, and looked for him.  He did not know where he was.  I wandered for a little bit, and wound up at Vendor, then friend figured out where he was and I met him back at entrance.  I forgot to stock up on empty backpacks, so I was only able to loot about half of what I killed while wandering around for no more than 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
Then I hung around, buffed and healed, etc, but did not more looting than the 10 minutes of my searching time.  When I sold what I had looted (had room for) I discovered I made 46 plat in ten minutes.  So you can make a nice profit in 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
This morning before Work, I hopped to Everfrost.  I was hunting for 30 minutes before I had to go to work.  107 made on Momma Mammoths.<br />
<br />
So, a Vendor selling at the appropriate mark-ups:<br />
My Pricing Guide for Alchemy Potions (http://members.aol.com/shokaroffreeport/alchemy2.html) can easily make what I can farming, but I doubt the bargain basement player can even come close.<br />
The way I figured out my pricing, is that high cost items should have around a 20-30% mark-up and SOW and SHRINK type potions a 40% mark-up, based on their current widely accepted prices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The bazaar kinda throws that all out the window for a lot of people.  I can spend 30 minutes on potions, stick them on a second account vendor mule, and go off and gain more money + exp + loot on my main account.  At that point, the tradeskills are not your primary concern, for the most part you're just trying to recoup the costs, or get some money to advance further in the skill (or other skills).<br />
<br />
This is especially true with Alchemy.  I can make 100 sow potions, and sell for 15 pp over cost (70pp sell price), and stick them on a mule.  It's going to take at least a week to sell that many sow potions, whereas if you exp in a loot-dropping camp somewhere, you can nab an item worth anywhere from 1k to 100k pretty easily in a week (depending on level, obviously).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Or for those without a second account to use as a mule...<br />
<br />
Make some potions (buy components in shadowhaven), hit the bazaar, go /trader, go to bed/school/work, come home the next night put the plat in the bank, and go do your usual routine.  <br />
<br />
Essentialy you dont lose any time - all the selling is done while you are busy in RL.<br />
<br />
Of course this works at any pricepoint.  Its just that the low seller is virtualy guaranteed to sell out by the next evening when they get back.  I say charge whatever you want or think you can get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was about to flame you Shokar, I just can't bring myself to insult someone with Palladin in there sig.<br />
<br />
<br />
But personally I belive that if you can make 100p selling 10 10 shots insted of 50p selling 2 10 shots, more power to you, who cares if your screwing some shaman trying to gouge prices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">heh well no matter if you use a vendor while you sleep or tote them around and and sell em, you have to make the potions and that is time. Unless you somehow macro them and that is of course bannable. So instead of making potions you could be getting exp/money/loot. Getting loot being the most worthwhile because you can get exp at the same time and it costs you nothing to actually get the loot where potion making requires money to get money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xakiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">How much $ do you actually make by playing EQ? Now how much $ do you make by working? Ok so if I've done my math correctly you should spend all your time working and not playing EQ.<br />
<br />
Problem solved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">People who undercut prices and sell for cost or just above cost are losing money period.  What they are not taking into account is the number of failures that can occur when creating sow potions (or any other potion for that matter).  I find keeping a mark up at around 50% covers costs as well as makes a SMALL profit.  So when I see potions sold for super cheap in bazaar I figure they are either botted (read scripted therefore you suck) or are clueless and just want to undercut so they get the first sale or run everyone out of the market.<br />
<br />
Problem is you can never run anyone out of the market in EQ, so that is also a flawed assumption.  So basically I just chalk it up to people being clueless and greedy.  Either way they lose =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">if you sell a 10 dose for 70pp you make about 25pp profit. (failure rate is neglibable). so to make 5000pp in profit you need to make 200 10 Dose potions. I think that if you make that many then you honestly worked hard on it and deserve the profit. I personally only make them because people ask me once in a while for them..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Lol just saw those tags for posting.. pretty cool now I have to spam =]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dretch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I sell for no less than 100pp/10shot(sow).  Others are selling for 65pp at the same time, and I sell out nightly. So really I cant complain about people undercutting my price; they are only hurting themselves.  Sure they may sell their potions before I sell mine, but I have yet to check my computer in the morning, and not have 2000 new shiney plats looking at me from my inventory screen.  I still dont consider this profit, due to the fact that trying to keep my alchemy skill up takes everything I make from it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>shotzy inaglass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You think way to much. I make potions and sell em cheap cause I like to do skills. What You may find boring and tedious may not be to others.  What I find boring is grping for exp and loot all the time.  Then peeps like u fight over the drop EVEN IF U DONT NEED OR CAN'T USE IT u roll on it or want it.  Then in your i super intelect u forgot to take into account the time your LFG, waiting on members to arrive, the infamouse MT or cleric AFK, o ya then how much time do u waist getting all that great exp and loot when there is a death and the time it takes to get going again.  Ya and whos the gready ones now selling playable meats for illusions at a cost of 50 to 200pp I have seen.  So the way u play my not be as important to others.  I dont get alot of time to play so i do things like skills and farming greenies for items i need. relaxing not a business and I have to figure margins, cost, and bull like that Ill get in my car and go back to work. And make money where it really counts not in this silly game.  Cause unlike this GAME RL is not a dress rehersal</div></div><hr />

<br />
Apples and Oranges here, cuz EQ is a game and IT Profession is not.  I make potions when I'm done playing and will be chatting endlessly for hours before I log with all my friends.  Chat = no money but lots of fun.  Chat + Potions = lots of money and lots of fun.<br />
<br />
I put give the potions to my mule, on my other account running on my other computer, and they sell while I'm playing.  Making money in two places &gt; making money in only one place.<br />

<br />
I buy my supplies in Shadowhaven.  Max ally with max charisma, and allowing for the negligible failure rate, my cost is about 45pp a dose.  It doesn't really take that long to make a lot of potions, and I make 25 to 30pp a dose depending on the prevailing low price point in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
I can understand that people would *rather* sell them for 100pp a dose.  I wish I could sell rusty daggers for 100pp each.<br />
<br />
Alas, free market forces &gt; all :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Max ally with max charisma?  ANd how much time did you spend getting THAT?  Wow.  I personally can't get better than 50pp cost for a 10dose SOW, and I STILL fail about 5% of the time.  My alchemy is at 145.  I don't know about you, but I don't think I'm ripping people off at 90pp per 10 dose.  I am still trying to recoup the money I spent on alechemy thus far!  And I don't think, once you count in the cash I've spent getting my alchemy up high enough to have a low failure rate, that I am making 25pp even on that 90pp 10 dose.<br />
<br />
BTW, I found the rusty dagger thing totally insulting.  An item I can get for a few copper versus one it takes a skilled tradeskiller 45-55pp to make - ONCE they have spent the time/pp to get the skill to do so! - is very much apples and oranges, to borrow your phrase.  <br />
<br />
It makes no sense whatsoever to charge 70pp for a 10 dose sow potion.  You are totally screwing the young shaman who have barely trivialed them, and cannot make even enough money to continue alchemy because of failures!  You could be making more money yourself, and you wouldn't piss off all the other shamans who are doing alchemy and aren't as lucky to be buying supplies as cheaply as you.<br />
<br />
Sow potions are NOT like other items.  I ALWAYS underprice dropped items.  Sow potions are expendable, which means there is ALWAYS a market for them... they keep getting used up!  So why worry about undercutting your competition?  Frankly, just sell at a standard price.  70pp is too low.  110pp is too high.  Se what the average is they sell for in the bazaar and sell it for that.  It's just fair.  <br />
<br />
And if you think it's because I want to charge more, it is not... I frankly have no trouble selling sow potions on the very rare occasions I bother to make them.  However, I remember being a young shaman trying to do alchemy, and it blows.  A low 30s shammy WILL fail a lot and might just actually need the PP so give them a break, why don't you?  You're making the customer thing the poor kid is trying to rip them off!  I remember selling 10 dose sow potion when I was level 34 for 120pp or better, and still bleeding money on alchemy!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wonder how you think other shamans got to where they are now?<br />
I started my alchemy because it was part of my character as a shaman. I hunted in the different zones, and saved up my plat, and made potions as I had the money. I never expected to make any HUGE amounts of profit, but enough to keep me happy.<br />
<br />
Some sold. Some didn't. This includes SoWs. I sold SoWs to my friend at cost just to recuperate the cost of making them.<br />
<br />
But since the bazaar has opened, people EXPECT to make pp just by tradeskilling. Before the Bazaar opened, you had several choices:<br />
<br />
1) Carry 10-dose SoW potions (or whatever potions) in your backback on the off-chance someone wants to buy them<br />
<br />
2) Spend several hours in the market channel hawking your wares.<br />
<br />
3) (In the case of Innoruuk server), Spend severa hours in the EC tunnel haggling with people to buy your stuff.<br />
<br />
Prior to bazaar, we BARELY had a market for our stuff. Sure, we could charge that 100 pp we wanted, but it wasn't making us hand-over-fist plat.<br />
<br />
Now, the bazaar opens, and the people begin to see the pp possibilities as &quot;endless&quot; (yeah. right. LOL) But however, the Bazaar introduces a new concept: the buyer's market. NOT a seller's market like the EC tunnel of Innoruuk or selling them out in the zones.<br />
<br />
In a buyer's market -- Someone will ALWAYS undersell you to make a profit. Some will be happy with a lower cost-to-profit ratio than others. This is the BASIS of the Free Market Economy.<br />
<br />
How many times in RL do you wait for that &quot;Sale Sign&quot; to go up, telling you &quot;50 % off!! Lowest Price. We'll beat our competitors prices!!!&quot;<br />
Guess what? People in EQ will also wait for that little bit lower price, or go buy from someone else who is selling for cheaper.<br />
<br />
You'll never get the whole of EQ to FIX prices. It has never worked. It will never work, because you'll never get the entirety of the community to agree to it.<br />
<br />
Do what other shamans in the past have done before. Get your skill up, save your pp, and when you're in a place where you are happy with your cost-to-profit ratio, start selling the bazaar.<br />
<br />
In real life, you never hear the jr. engineer bitch because s/he has to learn all this stuff while on the job and not making enough $$, while the more established engineer is making a ton of $$ because they are more experienced. You still have to do the grunt work in order to reap the rewards.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm happy that I can just sell stuff now each night, and not have to worry about carrying several 10-dose SoWs in my backpack just on the &quot;off-chance&quot; someone will buy them from me while running around in the zones. Nor will I have to spend hours in the EC market tunnel trying to sell goods. <br />
<br />
Now, I can freely XP, make potions, and sell them off. It only takes me a couple hours a week to make potions, then I swap out backpacks for trader satchels, and I'm good to go. Even with the lowered SoW potion prices, I still make a decent living through the bazaar. I sell off not only potions, but drops I've gotten, and the other tradeskilling items I make.</div></div><hr />

Hehe many of the junior engineers I have seen seem to think they should be making my salary without the grunt work, so not sure what world you're living in... and frankly, you're speaking to me as if I were one of those junior engineers or junior shaman, which I am not.  I was just saying I try to be nicer to those lower than I am, by not undercutting the price ridiculously, as well as trying to make back some of the enormous sums of plat I wasted on this lame skill.  I also try to strike a balance of not charging too much, but hey, undercutting too much is screwing all shamans and yourself.<br />
<br />
But hey, you wanna be a dick and spend more time making more potions for less profit AND screw your fellow shamans in the process?  Be my guest.  Like I said, I don't make potions very often.  But do me  the courtesy of not acting like I'm a greedy bitch because I don't do the same.</div></div><hr />

I totally agree, when I was a young shaman and just starting alchemy I made a bunch of sow potions to skill up .. thinking that I might actually make back all the money I had just spent by selling the pots at around 90-100p.  Well guess what some alt is sitting there selling 3x the meager inventory I had scraped together for 70p each.   Talk about a slap in the face, I almost quit alchemy right there ...  No way I could make my money back in bazaar so I hiked it over to DL and sold them for 100p ea.  <br />
<br />
To this day I will not buy anything from that vendor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bah. Stop putting words into other people's mouths.<br />
I did not say to completely undercut every other shaman out there in order to make the measly 5 pp. Nor did I accuse you of being a greedy bitch. What I am saying is that young shamans need to put in the grunt work. Your post made you seem like a younger shaman bitching about yet another price-fixing effort. So, take the offense where ever you find it, coz it wasn't in my post.<br />
<br />
Hehe many of the junior engineers I have seen seem to think they should be making my salary without the grunt work, so not sure what world you're living in <br />
<br />
This is my point EXACTLY. Whether or not a junior engineer expects to get paid the BIG BUCKs is different from the REALITY of what the employer is GOING to pay. You only got one year experience being an engineer? You're not going to get the same salary as someone who has been an engineer for 10 years.<br />
<br />
So, if young shamans want to compete in the market place -- Guess what? they are going to have to do the same grunt work that other shamans have put into it. Just like any other tradeskill they are going to have to put the time, effort, and pp in order to get up to a trivial where you're not losing as much pp as you're putting in.<br />

This is one of the few tradeskills that I hear people bitch too much about undercutting each other and trying to set prices. When I put my trader up, the ONLY people complaining to me about my prices being too low are SHAMANS -- &quot;You're not selling your illusion potions for 400 pp per single dose! You're undercutting us by selling for 300-350!! OMG You're not selling your ANTS potions for 250 pp! OMG You're not selling your SoW potions for 100pp OMG!&quot;<br />
<br />
I have other things I sell, and I never hear another brewer, smith, or jewelcrafter telling me I'm selling my stuff for too low a cost.<br />
<br />
And FYI: I sell my potions for whatever the market is charging. I neither undercut nor oversell my potions. I'll sell for a fair price for both my effort and for my repeated customers.  I'll never charge 75 pp or lower for 10 dose sow potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Talthos_</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">here is how i do vendor alchemy: <br />
<br />
i make potions all at once for guildmates. throw them on a vendor alt at 100% markup. if it sells good if not o well..... they are stock for guildies. not trying to compete.<br />
<br />
if a guildie needs one i charge cost. if they did me a favor or something recently or been helping guild alot i dont charge. either cast i just tell them to meet my alt in bazaar for a trade. this saves me MUCH time so i can have potions ready fast for guildies.<br />
<br />
being on a pvp server the greater Damage shield potions are my #1 selling potion. i dont bother with SoW, ppl in bazaar sell for near cost... just exploit them for it.</div></div><hr />

You arent making enough to make it worth it in the first place. Once you can solo HG's 39+ for shamans unless you twinked then lot lower you can make more money killing them.<br />
You can argue what you will but a fact is a fact. Only reason I'll continue alchemy is for myself guild and friends.</div></div><hr />
