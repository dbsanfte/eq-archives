However since demons are usually confined to like one camp per zone, you aren't going to find huge amounts of it like you would other herbs like plaguebloom, icecap or blindweed.</div></div><hr />

is that the Felfire Hill area?  I have seen Gromsblood there, but not very much of it.  <br />
<br />
I used to swing by there to pick up Stranglekelp from the ponds.  Never saw more than one Gromsblood.<br />
<br />
If the tomb is elsewhere, please point me in that direction!</div></div><hr />

Yes its up in the mountains in that area.  I wasn't on my herbalist, so I couldn't check on the minimap for spawns. But I ran across it twice.  I was surprised to see a higher lvl herb in a low lvl area.</div></div><hr />

I have seen it out in the open, between the Felfie pond and the road to Warson Lumber Camp.  I did not see it the one time I roamed up in to the mountains there, but lots of demons, so it seems  likely to spawn there.</div></div><hr />
