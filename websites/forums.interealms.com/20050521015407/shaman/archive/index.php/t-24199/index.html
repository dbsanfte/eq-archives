<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I seem having trouble getting runes to drop.  Have killed 25-30 named in the past 3 days at the hill camp( nameless server name) a named Kyv and Noc with the occasional uktan from bottom of hill.  In that time only had 3 runes drop.  We did have three of the mage only FT2 rings and other misc drops.  Is that what others are seeing.<br />
<br />
Also tried camping the named in murkglider hive today.  In three hours of steady killing the PH'ers as fast as they poped, not a single named.<br />
<br />
Is this just bad luck?  Or do I have to find a different camp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Have seen 3 rune drops in about 15 name kills (all in murkglider hive and lost city of dranik) in past 3 days, been really slow for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is no question in my mind that they drop rate on runes has been lowered. This sucks, but its understandable at teh same time. No one except the ULTRA hardcore should be able to fill their spell  book within a month of 2 of release, IMHO. Find some camps, and go. Some days you get spells, some you dont. I recently scored 2 lvl 70 runes on back-back days in one camp in PG. Total time in camp = 12 hours between 2 days. Total named = 10. Total runes = 4. 2 @ 70, 1 @ 69, 1 @ 68. A kind warrior guildmate passed a 70 to me in an effort to help the guild get Talisman of Wunshi. Thats the kind of people I play with though, makes the game a lot more enjoyable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They are too rare really, a few people will be able to fill their spell books quick but the vast majority are going to be missing spells for a long time. There are way too many people that need spells and not nearly enough to go around. 2 runes in a 5 hour period for an entire group that all need 15 or so of them is not acceptable in my opinion. Everyone in that group should have walked away with at least one spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I think this too...but I have 4 OOW spells so far, and 3 banked runes for when I ding. I NEVER got a GoD spell, so I'm just thankful that I got as many as I have.<br />
<br />
Speaking of that, once I have my new spells, I'll go back and get the GoD slow.  It SHOULD be easier for me once I get my spells shouldn't it?b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No scientific evidence, but yes, in my unqualified opinion, yes, drop rates have slowed. <br />
<br />
That drop rates would slow was entirely predictable. This is  a pattern that has been repeated on most major expansions. It is frustrating, but seems to be a fact of (EQ)life.<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't have a problem with reduced drop rate...it should feel like a special achievment to get a spell upgrade. I understand that this can also be very frustrating, and that some people will feel put out that it is gonna be hard or expensive or time consuming to fill the spell book. You have my sympathy.<br />
<br />
I have got a total of 4 runes so far. 2 x 66, 1 x 67, 1 x 68. I sold 1 x 66 for 100k and bought 3 upgrades for my gear haha. Maybe I will regret that decision...but so far, so good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, I went from 66 to where I currently stand in 67, stopping to earn a few AA as well (Crit heal upgrade, Ancestral Aid AA, may bang out a few more) and have seen a whopping 3 runes drop, none of which I have won.<br />
Have hunted in WoS, tried &quot;rune farming&quot; in Murkgliders for 4 hrs with two whopping named pops, Ruined City named havent couged anything up either...in fact I am prety disgusted.<br />
Its so bad that a friend of mine GAVE me a 67 rune as my birthday present...woot go Angelicaa.<br />
Level 66 runes should be no drop and on yard trash as common as a diamond or blue diamond is. Level 67+ should be on named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Personally, I don't have a problem with reduced drop rate...it should feel like a special achievment to get a spell upgrade. <br />
<br />
Have to disagree.<br />
<br />
One main argument for the focus nerf was, how easy it was (in SOEs mind ...) for casters to achieve power upgrades via gear, spells and focii - not that this argument was valid to begin with. So now after the nerf is through and somehow accepted, the difficulty should increase? Nope.<br />
<br />
A second argument would be, that SOE included several changes like overbuffs or actual melee buffs or a readily available bigger canni into OoWs spell design for shaman. It's ****ty enough, that i have to buy a new expansion to get my class issues adressed - making it harder on top of that is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
I can only tell from my personal experience as a casual raiding player since OOW started, and that is like 1 spell drop (for me) in the 66 - 68 range per 4-5 hour session in WoS, Dranik was even worse in my opinion. And that rate only happened with competent groups, that looked intensively after nameds and was quick in pulling them ;). Like one third of all sessions was no rune for me at all.<br />
<br />
I don't think that 1 minor rune per 6-7 hours intensive farming on average is too much. Getting an ancient should be a 'special achievment'. Getting the every days spells, you actually need to play effectively in the new content, should be just a part of your normal progression /shrug. Not on a silver platter, but not too hard aswell.<br />
<br />
But that discussion is moot anyway. SOE will continue their nice little tricks and baiting - and we will continue to whine about it  :D .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i liked it better when new spells were vendor purchased and dropped by mobs and quested. i'd prefer a mixture of all 3.<br />
<br />
i do like how the turn in spells are dealt out though...no more dupes!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Personally, I don't have a problem with reduced drop rate...it should feel like a special achievment to get a spell upgrade. I understand that this can also be very frustrating, and that some people will feel put out that it is gonna be hard or expensive or time consuming to fill the spell book. You have my sympathy.<br />
<br />
<br />
But why is it a special achievment to camp the same spot in the same zone for XX days in a row?<br />
<br />
In my view there is nothing special about it and it in no way makes people &quot;worthy&quot; of recieving anything. I realize that in the good (?) old days that was more or less the only thing SOE/Verant could do if they wanted to do something else besides having spells vendorbought. Now they have the ability to make instanced zones so it shouldnt be that hard to come up with a much better way of letting people earn their spells instead of just spending XY days camping random named mobs. Spells shouldnt be nearly as rare as they are now. It only causes problems balancing content because either they risk making the content too hard for people until they get the spells or the content is trivialized once they do get them.<br />
<br />
I think the last expansions would generally have been much more enjoyable for a large number of people if the majority of the spells - not ancients - had been available by completing one or two specific instances (Note to Blazz: Not easy instances, I dont want things made easier, these should be challenging for the group that does them. I just want the game less boring). They could make them so that there would be a spell vendor at the end of the instance. It would give a sense of accomplishment and you would have had to use atleast some skill to get there yet it wouldnt be some mindnumbing camp-fest as it is now. Then SOE could concentrate on making interesting encounters in the rest of the expansion based/balanced on the fact that people have certain spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Its going to be hard to please all the people with a specific drop rate. Some want more, some less, etc etc. There is one nice thing though, and thats the tradability of 66-68 runes. It allows people to trade some of the drop they are getting from the named for spells or pp to buy spells. <br />
<br />
Last night on my server, I went to bazaar to buy some toys for pet. For kicks, I checked the pricing of runes. There were at least 10 for sale, at prices ranging from 50K all the way up to some joker trying to get 300K for a 66 rune. If they are this plentiful already, only a month after release, then I am betting the price will drop to the 20-30-40K area for 66-67-68 spells soon. After all, they ARE farmable, even if a bit rarer, in instances. This offers a potentially unlimited supply of them, since the number coming into the market isnt limited to the number or nameds that pop in general static zones. Much better than the PoP system too, since the runes are player-specific, unlike the spells in poP where you could get some real duds</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I agree that in a few months the dropable runes will start coming down in price, but I doubt they will very fast. I bet the people selling them are people who won't need what they selling for a while due to slow leveling or have got what they want due to lots of farming.<br />
<br />
When you consider ever class needs these to some extent, how many people they are and how the greater majority of 65's ding 66 shortly after getting OOW, the 66 and maybe the 67 runes should have been dropping alot for for a while to help combat the huge demand.<br />
<br />
Personally I feel a good drop rate would allow someone to get at least half the spells for that level while XPing through that level if XPing in the zone that drops them for all the XP. At the current drop rate I could see lots of people ending up getting higher versions of spells before they get the lower one.<br />
<br />
Also think about the classes that have mob level limits on there spells, not getting they upgrades is really going to hurt them if they level 70 before they get the spells required for them to be able to help fight mobs giving decent XP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have Hmm. <br />
<br />
2 Level 66 spells<br />
1 Level 67 spells<br />
5 Level 68 spells<br />
0 Level 69 Spells<br />
0 Level 70 spells <br />
0 Ancient spells (From Any damn expansion)<br />
<br />
So I will level to 68. Then stop till I get some 69 spells. (Or 70's)<br />
<br />
Unless I fill up the aa I want and I am at the level limited spots. <br />
<br />
The best distrabution method would allow for folks to have 1 maybe 2 spells over the course of leveling up as normal. So that when I hit 66 I have 1-2 spells rapidly. Then get a couple over time. Same with 67... Woo Ding 67. Got a couple to mem... Will get a couple more over time.. Cool here comes 68... Got one to mem.. but I know where I can get more...<br />
<br />
Then With the instance ability You should be able to do flaggable adventures to get the no drop/ aincent stuff. A perfect place to get into real adventure with story arcs. <br />
<br />
Here is a little scenario. Starring me.. of course since it is my story.<br />
<br />
(Enter Snoww...)<br />
<br />
Hail Old Dragorn guy that wants to beat me up.<br />
<br />
He looks at me with distaste. Ashamed that he has to request a boon from someone without wings... But beggers cannot be choosers..And Snoww is Free to go where he cannot. <br />
<br />
(Insert quest dialog tree here. Check class check level. Check race. ) Spawn Dranik scar instance C Instance version 0011 Give temp flag for step one of 5.  In the quest dialog Spell out how Dragorns Eggs have been stolen. And Since the dragorn wife is unhappy Old dragorn guy is unhappy. Bring back the two eggs. <br />
<br />
Adventure into the instance. Standard kill the named guys. Set it up so once the placeholder is killed once the named instant spawns in another location and stays up. Zone wide Emote of how they killed his Baby so he will kill The dragorns eggs unless You defeat him in honarable combat. <br />
<br />
Whack him and get egg. When he is properly whacked Spawn Second named in different location. Whack second named Get Second egg. <br />
<br />
Have a  teaser Egg drop that is labeled something else. Like destroyed Egg. When you hand this back to the Dragorn you got the instance from he gives you dialoge to follow to get another adventure. You are now flagged as Completing Rescue one. And get an AA as well as The loot that has dropped. Complete the next three instances and get a bonus of like 4 aa plus a spell rune pickable from the list. (But nodrop) To fill in the gaps of what you are missing. <br />
<br />
We need story as well as loot. We need a reason to care about the game. We need Random Location spawns With clues to where they are and when they spawn. So trackers are useful but not required. <br />
<br />
We need monsters with charecter. That we don't just slaughter. Encounters that will make us play with wonder rather than one eye on the tv.<br />
<br />
Take say The second story instance. Take to dragorn that Old dragorn guy tells you about and hand him the shattered egg. He wants revenge. He knows who did this. And wants him dead.  He hires you to do the deed if you have the will. And hands someone an artifact that will help. <br />
<br />
Well you zone into place that the artifact leads you too. (Instance in sewers In dranik city.) And as you are invising up a Discordling assasian attacks saying his master knows you are here.... The assasian beats down the cleric to half life before getting taunted off and beat up some. Well at 50% The assassian Takes off running. (Immune to snares BTW.) Well it doesnt aggro any other mobs. But shouts out that you will be soon dealt with... (Depops) As you are moving through the zone invis. Because of course thats what people do now adays. The assassian spawns again non aggro (He cant see you...) But you can see him.. And you plot to kill him as he is running through the zone full speed. Why do you want to kill him so much.. well He thwarted you a few minutes ago and got away.. and that of course will not do...<br />
<br />
So you chase after him.. and he leads you into an ambush. He goes into an empty room.. and you follow. Then Boom. Door shuts and He laughs at you. Emoting something along the lines of suprise..... Combat. Him and his minions.. Well at 50% life he Once again Bolts. Tearing through the door. Non aggroing others of course Maybe you kill him maybe not. But now he has pissed you off. <br />
<br />
Well you kill all the minions. and start to look around again. But then you notice that during the combat the assassian did something. Some of you cannot invis... (Muhaha) Every time you try An emote comes over saying that some dust you have upon you disrupts the invisability spells.<br />
<br />
Well now that assassian is dead.. Period No matter what.  Yall are going to kill him.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden.. you hear a zone wide emote. Something stirs. Something large... Something menacing.... Something hungry....<br />
<br />
And here comes the assassian.. training something behind him. Something named Bob. (Grins) Enter combat.  Bob breaks free and goes beserk. Kill bob.  Enjoy it. Get loots. Yay you.. But you still have not gotten to the boss guy yet. And while scouring the place you think you see that damned assassian scampering about the place but he fades as he turns a corner..  Only two places left to look and one looks promising.. Big room. Large pentagram on the Floor carved in rock..  But no Big baddy... Little room off to the side.. Send the thief to check it out.. Thief sees a note Sitting on the end table..  Addressed to the party... <br />
<br />
Master decided that descretion is the better part of valor. If you are strong enough to kill bob then Master does not want to fight you.. I enjoyed our time together... and you will be seeing me soon... When you least expect it.... <br />
<br />
Party gets pissed. All this way for nothing. Barely any loot. Bastards. Then the thief spots in the corner. (Or shaman Whatever) a chest. Inside are a couple decent items Well as you are getting happy about the chest. The assassian attacks. You finally kill the little twitchy bastard. And he drops a key.... As well as some loot. REVENGE!<br />
<br />
Well the artifact glows  when you hold the key and points to a small thingy off on one wall. Click on it and opens into a room... Aha a secret door... <br />
<br />
Boss guy inside. Hiding. But cornered now. Start theme music...<br />
<br />
Get back to the Other dragorn.. Revenge complete. Get aa bonus as well as a pick off rune list.  Flagged complete. <br />
<br />
Well as you are getting ready to leave...  Splat.. Dragorn dies... Discordling assassian standing there.. Gloating... Masters Wife never like master much... But she like me enough to ressurect me... I will be seeing you..... (Fade)   Soon....<br />
<br />
<br />
Many more ideas could come from this. But oh well. I don't work for them<br />

<br />
I have not seen a single rune drop in about 25 hours of play in OOW.  I've mainly stuck to DS instanced zones, WoS and Proving Grounds.  Nada. Zilch, Zip, Zero.<br />
<br />
Not a damn thing has dropped.  Can't win anything if a named never pops and when it does, it doesn't drop a rune.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Shrug I don't know if it has changed or not but either way I think it's fine. Of corse the demand is going to be higher right after an expansion is released than the supply is. People don't know where runes drop and don't drop. Haven't figured out the best ways to farm them and everyone and their brother needs all thier spells. Look back at PoP. Everyone was complaining how rare spells where. So sony broke down and increased the drop rate on spells. Look at it now Ethereal parchments might as well be Toilet paper for all the use they have. Spectrals even aren't much better.<br />
<br />
Give it a couple months for the demand to drop because less people need the spells and supply to increase as more people hunt more and better areas for spells to drop and they will be common enough and since tradable will probably be cheap enough by then too.<br />
<br />
Personally I mostly stayed out of OoW zones until I was level 69. Did most of my leveling in old world zones. Yet I've still got 5 spells now. Sooner rather than later I'll get all my spells I'm sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">DH instances seem to be the same last weekend as the weekends before.  That is, runes are highly RNG dependent.  I went through periods where we got named with runes back to back to back, followed by 3 h of nada.  On average I've seen a rune every 2 h, in probably 30 h in DH.  In instances created by lvl 69/70 minor and regular runes dominated, an instance created by a levle 67 produced exclusively lesser.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Oks Snoww Silverhammer maybe you should :). that would put back in some of the story that has been left to not. I like the idea of one time use areas (since it is a one time uses then thay should beable to tailor the content to one group and make the rewards go up from standered areas since thay will be non farmable like have it check the party and spawn one item per class that is class restricted that goes in, so you will be garented at lest somethign fro going in instead of a dam camp that you have the possableility of camping for 6+ hours with just one item dropping that you might not even beable to use.) but then again like you I dont worrk for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>GrishMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I know for certain named pops in some of the rune soloable areas have decreased a lot since two weeks ago.  They do this every expansion.  You all remember when windblades dropped like candy when PoP came out?  The first 5 days of OoW, I could take one camp in nobles and get the 2 named to pop about every other time, now they pop like 1 in 7-8 times.  Same camp, they dropped a trune about 2 in 5 times, now they rarely drop at all.<br />
<br />
Same deal in Dranki Exps.  Named pop much less often.  I'm glad I famed all the low level spells while they were common.<br />
<br />
Lately I've been grouping in MPG whenever possible, named pop less but the rune drop rate is decent and you can knock off a 69 or 70 spell every once in a while.  Was grouped there for about 4 hours last night and we got 3 along with the typical earring or ring that are so common there from maybe 10 named?  It was about 10 named between the two camps in 4 hours.  Not too bad really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Once again the people that had time to farm early will have all their stuff and people that actually have things like jobs take it in the rear. There are many many more people that were 65 when omens came out then there were at 60 when pop came out, yet spells are even a bigger bitch. At least in pop all clases could buy one useful spell at a vendor, chanters got a new mez, clerics got a new heal, shamans and druids only got regen but it was something. <br />
<br />
This expansion is better then GoD drops, but still f'ugn ridiculous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've been doing well getting groups in the North West caves of Walls of Slaughter. Named NPCs pop like crazy there and I get a rune every time I get a group there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">For those who disagree with my post above, I understand that the reduced drop rate is going to annoy the majority of players. I understand the reasons why people want higher drop rates. Yes, it would be really nice if there were a series of quests, but there aren't. So drop rate is what we have.<br />
<br />
Lets face it, how many of us here actually camped all our droppable spells pre 60? Torpor, Malo, VotB Pox, Bane of Nife? Most of us probably farmed Ice Giants (or equivalent) and whined about bazaar gougers (I know I did). At least now, the spells are do-able with a single group (and don't talk to me about camping shardwurms outside VP - thats like pulling hairs out of your nostrils, one at a time, for hours or days).<br />
<br />
I am guessing that once the more uber and members of the more uber guilds fill their spellbooks, the price of runes will drop and drop hard. Sure, they are never going to be dirt cheap, but look at the price of ethereal parchment multi-quests when they first came out; now you cant give 'em away. So, in a month or two or three, you will have the option of farming runes with a group, or farming whatever you want and buying runes in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Lets face it, things could be worse. Hell, I am making nearly 2 blue bubbles of AA per kill at the moment, soloing, with my ghetto gear and my half empty spellbook. Its can't be all bad ;)</div></div><hr />

If it wasn't for the fact that I have actually seen torpor drop off a guardian worm, I would have said it was all a cruel evil myth! And lets face it, back a year or 2 ago, when we were early to mid 50's, trying to save for malo and torpor, the 30k each (your mileage may vary depending on your server) was a huge amount of money, with mudflation 30k then has to be at least 100k now, I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I play in the Hollow's instanced (Hive) for the runes.  I spend 3 hours a night there with my regular group of friends, and so far, we've got 1 rune a night.   Yep. 1 rune every 3 hours.  <br />
<br />
There are 16 level 66 to 68 spells for shamans.  At this rate, I need to be in that dungeon for another 42 hours (3 x 14hours, as I already have 2 runes).  <br />
<br />
But I am not farming for myself.  We do it as a group.  So that's another 5 others I have to consider... for us to get all our runes for levels 66 to 68, we'll be there for about 16 runes x 6 members x 3 hours (if drop rates remain the same, and if the other classes require 16 runes for 66 to 68 too) = 288 total hours for my friends and I to farm these runes.<br />
<br />
288 hours = 12 straight days of playing, or 96 nights of 3 hour stints.<br />
<br />
I guess I know what I will be doing for the next 4 months.<br />
<br />
The whole irony of this rune farming is that I'll be level 70 before I can complete farming for my level 66 runes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Just dinged 70 this morning. Did all my XP from 66-70 almost exclusively in OoW zones. Tried it all, instances, Nobles soloing, WoS, both left wall and 2nd field, half a dozen different camps in PG, a little time in Riftseekers, couple hours in Ruined City, etc. Through it all I have to say that I think the drop rate for spells and the spawn rate for nameds is pretty decent. <br />
<br />
I use this analogy a lot, but this isnt Diablo 2 folks. You dont log in, run to camp, pop a few nameds in an hour, everyone gets a spell, and log out. I have 10ish spells, and even a couple lvl 70 ones. Most I won in groups, both guild-only groups and pick-up groups. A couple I traded items that I won in those same groups for. <br />
<br />
What I am trying to say is that if you want spells, hunt where the spells drop. Some people in my guild were complaining that they were levlel 70 and still had no spells. I asked them where the leveld, and the inevitible replay was &quot;Tables in Fire&quot;. Well DUH.<br />
<br />
Some days are better than others. One morning in about 3 hours, we got 8 WoS nameds. 6 dropped runes, one for each member of the group. Then another time, 2 hour produced 2 named, neither of which had a rune. I recently started camping the Neuromancer-Projection of Tactics area in PG. Both the nameds there can produce lvl 70 runes and items that easily trade for a rune. Yesterday,  4 named in less than 3 hours between the 2 phs, and only 1 had a rune. Today, 1 named in about 5 hours, then the 2nd popped on the final mob as I was logging, both had runes. <br />
<br />
The Gates spell distribution model sucks pretty baddly, I will be the first to admit it. But I think OoWs method is the best BY FAR. Enough are dropping that a person should have a reasonable chance of getting a couple spells a week. More if you play more in the higher volume areas like the 2nd field camps in WoS, less of you choose to pick a spot with a bit better XP, but only 1 named like a couple of the PG camps. But overall, there are spells all over the place here. Great items too. <br />
<br />
And for the record, I completely disagree with the theory of not leveling until you get a couple spells to mem. Levels &gt; all in EQ. Higher level means you resist better, dont get hit as much, your spells are resisted less, you have a smaller agggro radius, and overall you are just plain stronger, even without the spells of THAT particular level. 69 and 70 runes are dropping in some areas where its just a TON easier to hunt if you are already 69 or 70. Heck thats the whole theory behind XPing in Fire, then going out to farm your spells once you are a much more powerful character. I am not condoning this, but it has some truth to it. I did my leveling in places where spells drop, and I got spells while doing it. Its not real complicated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Back in the day, I would make about 250 plat per hour solo farming Ice giants. More, in fact, but once you factor in runs to sell, and runs to bank (PvP server, cash loot), shared spawns, etc, 250 plat per hour would be pretty close to the mark.<br />
<br />
That would equate to 120 hours of farming just to buy Torpor. 1 spell. Another 120 for Malos. Another 60 for Bane of Nife. 60 for Pox.<br />
<br />
What has changed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">You should have been one of the early birds.  It was easy to nab a Murkglider's Hive instance 2 weeks ago and just sit in there solo indefinitely killing 2 mobs over and over.  I got a lot of stuff done around the house during that farming time.  A rune dropped every 60-90 minutes that way as well as sellable loot, much of which rotted because it was lore.  I spent 20 hours over 4 days and I don't have to worry about spells anymore except for greater and glowing runes, which drop in PG now and then. I've grouped in PG and WoS after the alleged nerfing and we got runes about every 2-3 named kills, which averages one every 2 hours.  So maybe their rate has been reduced, but not by a huge amount.<br />
<br />
When someone posts a guide on how to solo all your spells, you might want to read it and maybe take action.  When someone posts anything that will give you an edge on obtaining something (loot, plat, AA, spells, etc), go out and do it right away, because once it hits these boards, the devs certainly know about it, then they decide whether it should be &quot;fixed.&quot;  If I find something that gives a big return for a small amount of effort, I share it with a few tight-lipped friends first, then I will tell others.<br />
<br />
This board is here to help you in the game.  If you're not using it properly, then you don't have any right to complain.  At worst, you have to do the same thing every other non-soloing class in the game has to do: group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Thats what I'm talking about Snoww. If it wasn't for the fact that I have actually seen torpor drop off a guardian worm, I would have said it was all a cruel evil myth! And lets face it, back a year or 2 ago, when we were early to mid 50's, trying to save for malo and torpor, the 30k each (your mileage may vary depending on your server) was a huge amount of money, with mudflation 30k then has to be at least 100k now, I think.<br />
<br />
I had all of my 60 spells banked by the time I was 54 and that was 6 months before pop even came out and long before they could be researched. At the time both torpor an malos were still 50k+ but I got both by working hard at making plat and buying them at good prices. I had all of my 65 spells 2 days after dinging 65 by buying them at 50k or so each. I never knew what the issue was with making plat really. <br />
<br />
Camping slow ass drops for hours and hours on end is pointless though, especially when people need hundreds of spells. And I love their crap ass analogy to weapons considering that pretty much any class can finish their epic 1.5's long before a caster is going to have all the non ancients or even all of the tradeable ones.</div></div><hr />

The question is, though, how did you get that 100k+ to buy topror and malos? Wasn't it, buy any chance, thorough camping slow ass drops for hours and hours - either for plat loot or for items to sell in the bazaar.<br />

He got malo by spotting it for 5k in the bazaar, cheap, and grabbing it.  Torpor, he spent like 30k on it, considered it cheap, but that money doesn't really take too long to farm up even pre-pop.<br />
<br />
Money takes far less time then the spells take to farm up.<br />
<br />
In the time that we got like 5 spell drops total, we amassed a small fortune in plat from selling items, close to 1 million.<br />
<br />
Hell, our pally tank gained like 1k hp and a few hundred AC from the new omens items and as an overal upgrade would be comparable to spells really, not to mention weapons and focus effects for everyone that were an actual upgrade.<br />
<br />
In effect this expansion is much nicer to melee's with how common the loot is, then it is to casters, who gain little other then better resists from higher level loot.<br />

Never ever went out of my way to camp anything that didn't also give good exp. Everything I ever got was from exp camps or tradeskills. Farming for the sake of farming is something I never do (never could complete something like the shawl quest because of this). <br />
<br />
Had my first 1k before I even hit lvl 10 for the first time by selling shadeling silks I got leveling up in shadeweavers to people right after luclin came out. By the time I was 44 I'd already earned enough to buy my a jbb off luclin drops, ralic packs (went from 27 to 44 in various parts of tenborous mnts), and tradeskill items (acrylia) that dropped in zones I was exp'n in. Its really not hard to earn plat without going out of the way for it, camping greenies for hours on end always was a lousy way to make money. Early investments in tradeskills (namely smithing right after cultural went in) really paid off in the early 50's.<br />
<br />
Really off topic, but theres much better way to do things then just camping the same spot over and over and over hoping for it to drop. When you need 75 tradeable spells for one group only (consiting of 4 casters, a hybrid, and a melee), a rune every 3-4 hours is not acceptable. Ethereals drop at a rate of about 2-3 an hour in storms desert, specs at about 1 an hour in tactics. Whats wrong with similar drop rates for the 66-68 spells?</div></div><hr />

I think that we are just gonna have to agree to disagree on this one, brother. I understand your point of view, I just don't entirely agree, is all. Nothing wrong with that though, would be a boring world if everyone agreed on everything all the time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Got my last 68 rune tonight. <br />
<br />
Still only have one 67 Spell. Mutt of splattage. Only have 2 66 spells.<br />
<br />
But overall in the last week and a half prolly gotten 25 spells total. Maybe 35. for various folks in my guild. All through the instances. At regular level xping and learning them.<br />
<br />
Also gotten 8 AA and Up to 12% into 67. (Gettign first rank of Ancestral Healing Group Hot AA thingy. ) 45% of aa to go. Then on to 68.<br />
<br />
Now any 68 runes I get will go to my hotbox SK. Who will prolly hit 68 before I will. Meele get better benifit to level than I do I feel. At least in the zones we fighting at the moment. But he has Zero spells as benifits a hotbox. I wont take a single spell with him over a main. Except for my fair share Once I get mine filled. (as In I can only win one rune a night till all in group have won one that need one.)<br />
<br />
Now when i duo in instances He is fair game for all loot. Cause well. it is just me. But I dont get much alone time. I swear guildys have a buzzer that rings when i get one. As Soon as I get on like 4 people log on to go do something. I kill em alot. but we always tend to go someplace and do something. <br />
<br />
Ahh well. Had 2 spells drop tonight in 4 hours time. But we only had a single named camp fr a bit in watering hole. Still trying to figure out where the other named spawns in the Mob level 61 instance. I think I got it figured but only killed that one twice And both times was a placeholder.. Or could ahev been reg mob.. wont know till next time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Of greater note... Finally!  a DISCORDANT SCORIAE  Dropped. They really do exist.... I was so damn happy. it was almost comical. Then of course I had to hand it over to the paladin who got the first augment I etched. So he can get a 40% haste item if all goes well. <br />
<br />
They are way way way WAY too damn rare. Slugworms too. They seriously need to up the drop rate.<br />

I do think this is something we ALL can agree on though. Good luck with the combine, lost the only scoriae I've ever seen to the smithing combine. Not even trying another one till smithing aa is maxed and maybe even salvage too if they don't up the drop rate on them first.</div></div><hr />
