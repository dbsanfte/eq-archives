<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kintai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">3 times this evening we tried to do tear turn ins for one of our slackers.  Found a few things out that need /feedbacked unless i'm missing something.  <br />
a)  weeeeee reavers can be slowed<br />
b)  Neh Ashiir is no longer non agro on spawn, she agro'd on our tank at spawn<br />
c)  Rak Ashiir is the same way, /cons scowls.  <br />
<br />
We initially thought Rak was bugged, so we killed the existing one, pulled reavers till we got another, nope.. scowling.. <br />
<br />
Anyone have any clue as to the reasoning? If this was intended, has anyone found out the answer? We're all kind of boggled at this point, all our shm wants to do is complete his epic.<br />

<br />
We fixed it so you're not dependent on rogues anymore to finish your epic... instead you are now dependent on chanters...<br />
<br />
good luck!<br />
<br />
No really.. don't even try a chanter. Need proper faction and all. It has to be a bug.</div></div><hr />

If there's no key, you still need a rogue.</div></div><hr />

If what the first poster says is true, this change means it's impossible to do the hand in with either Neh'Ashiir or Rak'Ashiir, so the shaman epic is currently undoable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ah thank you, much closer and easier to get to then. ill go look today.<br />
did you hear if he also was KoS now? and are there mobs around him with a higher potentioal level?<br />
<br />
And regarding Neh and Rak, didnt someone here say they were able to hand in while they were fighting?  I dont see how that could work.. but if it does, need to confirm it :p cause id hate to go back to hole once again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hrothgar said, &quot;When I did my epic awhile back I was able to hand in to Neh after a tank agro'd her when she spawned.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is different to her being agro on all - when she's agro on a tank, she'd still be indifferent on everyone else unless they assisted that tank, so I assume that's why the hand in worked.<br />
<br />
If she's now agro on all, you wouldn't be able to do the hand in without using some invis trick, and probably not even then.</div></div><hr />

It really feels like they are dumbening down the game... So what if you need a rogue to get in CoM? the game is not all about soloing! Make a rogue friend... PAY one if needed.<br />
<br />
I'm sure the newer players are just as smart and inventive as we used to be back then!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you are missing the point.  The point is that when they revamped the zone they changed the way some very necessary npc's react to the presence of PC's.  Still not certain if it is faction based yet.  <br />
<br />
The sad thing is that situations like this are really par for the course with SoE.  Im sure they will introduce a fix to it, but it's going to take a few weeks before they can dig through thier mess to find out what happened.  Once we get confirmation about it I say that we /feedback and /bug it every day untill its fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Berusa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Allready sendt a Quest Bug report explaining the situation,</div></div><hr />

Hope they get this straightened out soon, as I've been sitting on the tear and the ring for awhile now, waiting til I had couple folks together to lend a hand and return the favors long owed me :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">*cry* you got to be kidding me!!! I finally get my tear and going to do hand in this weekend and its bugged? *sigh* Seems alot like my luck. So are you saying that Rak is KoS to everyone (including the shaman with max true spirit faction) or just everyone but the shaman? If hes kos to all but true spirited faction shamans thats fine, you'll just have to keep people away until hand in, but if he is kos to the shaman then theres no way to do the quest i think....If anyone has any advice on how i could do it plz tell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sangori Sanspeur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">a) weeeeee reavers can be slowed <br />
<br />
I was pretty sure Reavers could always be slowed, but their resists were just very high.  Seems like the last time we did a breeze through CoM I was able to slow a reaver with a good set of debuffs on.  Either way I don't recall them giving an &quot;immune to changes in attack speed&quot; message when I tried to slow them in my younger days.<br />
<br />
Its really a shame that they messed up the epic.  It was such a fun quest for me.  Its seems a cake walk now, but at the time it seemed fun and challenging.  Count me in to send bug reports until we can get it fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">So are you saying that Rak has to be charmed to turn in the Tear?<br />
<br />
I can tell you that there are some BAD possibilities with that.  If Rak breaks while you are turning in your Tear - it just got eaten.<br />
<br />
Monks have had this crap shoot with Brother B in the Dreadlands where they need to turn in an item or two for their second Robe. (The Tan one).<br />
<br />
Now Ol Brother B ain't that hard to charm. But he DID have an annoying habit of breaking charm unusually quick for a green con.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Can't be charm.  Charmed mobs are indifferent to all but the charmer, to whom they are amiable.<br />
<br />
Rak requires ally for the quest.<br />
<br />
So I don't think this was intentional - they'll probably fix it soon enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Went today and he was KoS to me, Some people said maybe we should mez him and hand in tear but i didnt want to risk it, can anyone comfirm that this will or will not work? i don't want to hear reason it will or wont i want someone that acually tryed it and succeeded or failed please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It shouldn't work because as stated you need ally faction for it to work.<br />
<br />
Unless some wierd bug let's ya get away with it. In that case any non-epic shaman would just need to go to Fear, grab the tear and hand it in to a Charmed rak. No need to do the rest of the epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yeah the wizard mob in fear was popping kos to the rest of fear for a long time before they got around to fixing it.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Captain of the Guard now drops &quot;A Stone Key&quot; -- it is no drop, it opens the front door of the palace, and it goes on your keyring.  The locked doors at the middle and final huts on the skyway still need a rogue to unlock (unless there is some other secret key no one knows about). The palace elevator still needs a rogue to operate, or the no rent key from Neh.<br />
<br />
The black reavers and the named ghosts no longer have insane resists, so they can be slowed and dotted. The reavers still proc Blinding Fear.<br />
<br />
There are a lot more spawn points around CoM; all the old rest spots and open spaces are filled in :( That's one thing I used to love about the zone.<br />
<br />
Ghiosk still drops his 3 books. But Rak and Neh spawn KoS now so there is no possibility of doing those epic hand-ins until they're fixed. They have some new drops in their loot table though, like Ghostly Leggings of Terror for DRU/MNK/BST.</div></div><hr />

First try we wiped due to guild getting all spread out and a few other things. Last trip in, which was just before the zone revamp, Rak conned Ally when I did the Tear turn in and he did not attack anyone. He was indifferent to the rest of the guild. <br />
<br />
This trip in, Reavers were slowable and Rak scowled at me. We killed Rak and he dropped a Warrior Breastplate but did nothing for my epic. I petitioned the head GM Kahil, and all he said was he was not aware of a bug and he would submit a bug report. WOW! THAT is going to get things done =P<br />

I pulled CoM reavers way back in the day and always tried clicking up the elevator and I got the &quot;you are unable to open this&quot; message in red.  How then sir can you do it without a rogue with lockpick?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>gothyc meyhem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I went in to scout the area after hearing about a possible bug in the epic mobs.  I fought my way there hoping for some new loot to drop on the way.  When i got to the front of the palace, Rak was in front.  I conned him and he indeed scowled at me.  I hailed him for kicks and he agroed on me like that was an insult.  I made it to zone with about 50 hp left.  <br />
<br />
There is definately a major bug or they changed the epic quest somehow.  I submitted a bug report and feedback. I didn't think a petition would be a fix for it.</div></div><hr />

The shaman had max TS faction but was still KOS to Rak.  I thought of trying the Charm and hand in trick you have to do in other parts of CoM but the shammy was unwilling to part with his tear (and to tell the truth no one was willing to head back into Fear to get him another.)<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if Charm or Mez will work for turning in the tear?  Lord knows Sony messed up the Wizard epic long enough.  Maybe they thought shammies were a good target this time around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for Rak, it's been well discussed and the concensus is that charming him will only get you to indiff and you need to be ally to do the hand-in. We killed Rak to see what he dropped, nothing. And we killed him with 5 of us and only got 1 AE, so either we were lucky or your guild needs to drop him faster Sev.  ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Oh and some of the confusion about the elevator might be due to the fact that you need to pick the lock to send it UP but anyone can send it DOWN. As far as I remember anyway.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Maxelh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Although initially scowls having a cleric passify Lord Rak modifies his aggro to that of non kos. Being a monk I do not have much of any truespirit faction and I could not test it with my epic'd shaman at the time due to time constraints. I did notice however that my faction changed from Scowls to Apprehensive. I don't recall pacify ever changing my faction before though just making mobs less aggressive. This lends me to the belief that once pacified the shaman would have been ally. Found this out today btw trying to pull the reavers around him. <br />
<br />
**SPOILER**<br />
We have explored CoM quite extensively in the last couple of days. A few things we have found. Reavers have had their magic resistance almost cut in half. Some of the higher level ones (the ones on the skywalk) are slightly more resistant than their lower counterparts. Ghiosk drops some new monk dru bst pants now of which the name escapes me. AC 15 5 sta 35 hps or something. Similar to golden star but more ac and a little less sta. Neh'Asshir or however you spell that name, is now kos as soon as he spawns. He dropped a Woodsmens staff or something that was a ranger only 2hb 33/36 or something allong those lines. The reavers also still chain and I have heard rumor that the jade reavers drop more frequently although from killing approximately 30 reavers so far I have not seen an increase. There are alot of other very nice blue loots in there. Blue meaning not great at 65 but nice for a 55+ shaman until he gets raid capable for some of the nicer stuff. Also so far no level requirements on the loot but you didnt hear that from me. Finally, each type of mob save the human looking mobs has a chance of spawning a higher level counterpart. For example haze and vapor golems can be killed to spawn A Mighty Golem which drops a nice 10 wis mask. So the goal is clearing as many spawns as possible to increase your chances. Anyways some info we've picked up since we've been exploring hope you've found it helpful. Have a good one.<br />

<br />
That is such a great idea. Have every spawn have a chance to spawn a &quot;named&quot;. They definitly should do this for more zones. Lets alot more places you can camp and still get nice loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>gothyc meyhem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">A fellow shaman in my guild was in CoM a couple days ago and noted that when their group encountered Rak he scowled, but when pacified he went to allied.  After hearing this I began to hope that I could finish the quest but became concerned if the allied status is high enough, not maxed.  I think I'll wait a little bit still before I turn in the tear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you may or not know of an easy way to check your allied status relatively painlessly. PoK -&gt; BB mtns and kill peg leg. Hail the lesser spirit get stone. Gate back to PoK -&gt; FP then use the secret tunnels to get to bandel (sp?) hand him the stone and you get an instant faction increase. Total time spent is like 15 mins if your quick ;) Hope this helps<br />
