<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jebuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I heard that Sebilis is good for money, but is it doable for a 58 shaman with a 58 monk?  We both have standard gear, but no epics, no fungi's, and no JBB for me.<br />
<br />
Are there any other places that would be doable for us?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As far as Sebilis is concerned, then I think you're going to need more.  It is indeed good loot, BUT it comes at a cost. I think you're definitely going to need an enchanter here, as the adds can kill you in a couple of seconds.<br />
<br />
If you could get a chanter, maybe another tank and even a cleric, then you'll be ok. But otherwise prepare to die frequently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Redeemed Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I must say that Seb while being filling with nice drops isn't a good loot zone. For some reason Clerics have become the new rogues of EQ they master loot everything then everyone roles on the rare stuff. Now I am no idoit I sold for a friend in a guild and he made almost 2k in 4hours there.  I don't know if you have timed it but a symbol cast is as long as a HoS.  I am going to start charging or something.  Look at the facts....if the cleric even Symbols US (being shaman and not Tanks) he does this what ? 3times max in a 2hour group we will say ....so 6 (if he does all 6) X12 is what ? 72pp or so ....now a Ruby crown (uncommon from Scarabs in guard camp ) sells for 119pp with my charsima stuff on..... now when a cleric is getting 4 to 8 peices of vendor loot and I get to lose a roll on one lousy Blue diamond I get pissed.  <br />
                  ok there was the rant ...now the solution. I have found the best place to cash build at 51-52 is Karnors...... you solo it .... I have gotten 4 peices of Kunark class armor and sold them  I also have found that sentrys can drop up to 6pp and change .  Along with good exp nice loot. Not great...but hey It is solo.  Giants are a circus , seb is a ripoff, and geos are just too slow.  Any other advice on quick cash let me know ... other wise I will just continue to go to seb with my rogue and steal those gems.... Hate to do it but someone gots to feed me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ng is a great source of cash, espacally the Bugs there. Sebi is very easy, Mobs dont hit hard and nearly never resist. Monk should be able to single pull nearly everything in there! Just make sure you know how to root CC or adds might get you killed.</div></div><hr />
