<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drylar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've spoken with several in the shaman community on Xev, not sure about others elsewhere. It's become the consensus that since most classes get a custom class aa title, IE Exarch for clerics... we should start a grassroots effort to do /feedback and emails and try to get us set apart from the druids. The pretitle that so many have come to agree on is Avatar. It's right in line with our spellline for the top end, doesn't involve pretitles using the who list, and just seems to make good sense. In game, make use of the /feedback form to request that shamans aren't druids, and after al the effort we go through to finally achieve our class pretitles, we shouldn't have to be mistaken for druids. we are shaman. Lets see how many we can get to go the distance, and if enough of us can get the word out we aren't druids, sony might bow down, and change a few strings of code, to make all those customers happy. A few people can't do it alone, we need the help of as much of the shaman community as we can. If you want to also send email to sony, the email address is eqfeedback@soe.sony.com Please join the effort and help. Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Actually if anything the Shaman class should retain the elder title.<br />
<br />
Druids are the ones that need the change.  What are they elder of?  Nothing really.  We're an elder spirit summoner, manipulator of time etc.<br />
<br />
Make Druids class AA title Guardian or Protector or something... Dryad.. something.  Elder makes sense for us.<br />
<br />
Of course this will also raise up a rallying cry from the Beastlords for an AA title change.  Elder Animist makes sense for them. Their trainer/class leader in Shar Vahl is Elder Animist Dumul and Elder Animist something or other.<br />
<br />
Don't think you're going to get much tread with this, although I agree making the same Class AA title for druids, shaman and Beastlords doesn't make much sense.<br />
<br />
Also if this goes through expect some sort of outcry from the pure caster community.<br />
<br />
If you can get EQ necros, wizzies, mages and enchanters, as well as druids, shaman, and beastlords crying out for unique class AA titles simultaneously, then you might be able to put a dog in the fight.<br />
<br />
Before all you guys start saying that you'd rather them fix melee balance, etc., before doing this, keep in mind all this would take more than likely is to edit one field in a database to enable a global change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Far as I know, only necro's and clerics get unquie titles for casters. <br />
<br />
It wouldn't bother me so much if the stinky druids didn't have the same title. Definately don't mind sharing it with a BL though. Would be nice, but theres definately more important things to be fixed. This ranks right up there with doors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I sort of like Elder for the shaman class.  Can you imagine how bitter you would be if you got stuck with &quot;Exarch&quot;?  Now THAT is a bad title to live with.  Exarch Archon Soandso.  <br />
<br />
As for beastlords....  Elder does sort of seem lame for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I apologize if this is a bit of a derailment, but I think that as long as we're getting together a mass petition, we should also see what we can do about bear-form.  The fact that skeletons have gone through three revisions and wolves through two while old school bear-form remains is boggling.  They don't even have to design new bears for gods sake, just put the Plane of Storms or Rujikan Hills (sic) bears into the global cache.  It's just plain old laziness as far as I can tell.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I love the title Exarch.  While I know the word refers to a position in the Eastern Orthidox church, I've got this unshakable association with Eldar Exarchs in Warhammer 40k (a miniture based science fiction tabletop wargame.)  They were warrior-priests who were absolutely unstoppable on the tabletop and had amazing minitures that were great fun to paint.  Anywho, I'm really getting off topic...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Its pretty much a given that IF soe does something with this that they would have to make everyone's unique, as it would probably cause bedlam to grant us Avatar or Exarch or whatever. Actually a choice in a title we be groovy also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">new titles for aa might be kinda fun i suppose..instead of changing existing titles they could add a new one for X amount of PoP AA points.  A different one for each class would be great, and really wouldnt be THAT much work for them..<br />
<br />
i couldnt care less about bear form models..the last time i was in bear form (for any reason other than: &quot;i'm bored..LOOK i'm a bear) was nearly 1 year ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Avatar would be ok, but I do like Elder. I think that suggesting a name is worthless however, as they will just come up with seperate ones for everyone on their own.<br />
<br />
If you try to specify, no one will be able to agree on just one. If they choose, some people can bitch, some people can rejoice, but in the end we'll have our own title.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I like elder and think it makes sense. Shaman are the wisemen of the tribe and an elder is respected and wise beyond all. <br />
  Druids should be something else and Beasts too. Though dont mind me i dont mind sharing the title or anything just think it would more sense if they were changed that the others would be given something that made sense.</div></div><hr />

Imho every class should have a unique title.  If I recall correctly, monks are the only class to have unique titles for both archetype and class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think it would be a great idea for every class to have its own AA title. If that were to happen, I would suggest giving us the option to take our title down if we want to. Hard enough running around PoK just looking like a Shaman, class only AA title would give it away for sure.<br />
Also, I like the title &quot;Elder&quot; it does seem appropriate for us, just not so much so for the other 2 classes who share it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I dont think Avatar makes sense for us really. Yeah, we have a spell called Avatar, but we're not embodiments of the gods - that'd be more a cleric thing. We're manipulators of the spirits and bringers/takers of disease and poison. Witch doctors, shamans, dreamwalkers, etc...hey, that'd be a nice title - Dreamwalker.<br />
<br />
I liked how they did pretitles in the game I played before EQ. At specific levels, each class had 1 or more unique titles. At lower levels, it'd be just one title, as they got higher in level there would be 2 or 3 titles at a given level. You picked which title you wanted to display, or you could chose not to display a title at all. You just toggled them on or off with a simple text command.<br />
<br />
For example; I played a ranger in that game and they got (to my best recollection) these titles:<br />
<br />
Level 10: Scout<br />
Level 20: Tracker<br />
Level 30: Ranger, Trailmaster, Pathfinder<br />
Level 50: Hunter/Huntress<br />
Level 70: Warden<br />
<br />
There was another title at 20th and 50th, but I just cant recall what they were right now. But you get the idea. Each class had it's own set of unique titles like this, and every class at level 30 had their class name as one of the titles (i.e. Ranger).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Good idea and easy to program, i guess.<br />
<br />
But maybe it would be better to petition for a poll to determine AA titles for all classes, that haven't got unique titles or are unhappy with their current titles. They recently polled for everything including the color of our underwear, so why not have some kind of 'fun poll' to get as much opinions as possible? Take let's say the 3 most popular suggestions per class and rank and let the players pick their favorites for a few weeks.<br />

Do you think you're ever mistaken for a druid?   Does this impact your game play at all?    Then  don't waste sony's time reading a petition imo!   Far better things could be put in a mass-petition.  <br />
<br />
if it bothers you that much, just do /showtitle 1, it all goes away =)</div></div><hr />

Nice idea, though.  I think all classes should each have their own title line, instead of mixing certain classes together.  Just my opinion, though... Doesn't change the game, but just makes it seem nicer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If you leave it up to Sony, the titles will be<br />

I can't remember if it's a warrior, druid, or <br />
ranger. We have 12 classes and 3 or 4 titles for <br />
each class. Yech. Let's just go back to the orginal<br />
class names.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a paladin, and I think its actually a very fitting title.  The worst in my estimation is Forest Stalker.  That doesn't sound like something you want aspire to...  Dreadlord is pretty bad too, why not just call it WarcraftHero.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hah, Of all the things to feedback, AA title is not gonna be one of them, sorry!<br />
<br />
Speak for yourself /feedbacks there for &quot;FEEDBACK&quot; and I'm not afraid to put forth my 2cp.  I'd love to see more unique class titles personaly though who knows if it will ever come to pass.<br />
<br />
Do you think you're ever mistaken for a druid? Does this impact your game play at all?<br />
<br />
First I doubt the reasoning behind most folks wishing for unique class titles is because they ever get mistaken for another class lol.<br />
<br />
Second ever heard of flavor and variety, whats wrong with that.  Or do you find that a frightening concept =p<br />
<br />
Then don't waste sony's time reading a petition imo! Far better things could be put in a mass-petition. <br />
<br />
Think your confusing /feedback and /petitions, granted both amount to about the same level of service =p  The original poster clearly stated /feedback not /petition.<br />
<br />
Also last I checked we pay for the services Sony provides so why would I concern myself in &quot;wasting their time&quot; when I help pay their paychecks as do everyone else who uses their products/services =p</div></div><hr />
