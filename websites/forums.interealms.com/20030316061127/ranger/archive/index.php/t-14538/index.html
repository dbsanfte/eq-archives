<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dsmfour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi everyone,<br />
<br />
I'm a 24 half-elf ranger and I'm currently hunting avaiks in South Karana.  The money  isn't bad (although even getting 1 pp impresses me) but sometimes it's a little boring.  especially when the only d blue avaiks are the ones in the actual birdhouse and I couldn't pull them without getting the whole flock...blah...blah...and my whining continues.... :o<br />
<br />
Anyways, the point to this is wondering if anyone knows a good area where I can solo as long as possible.  I'm not too keen on groups as I've had way too many idiot-encounters and the majority of the time, I'm just in one of those loner moods.  Not to mention, the only &quot;group&quot; zone I know is Nro.....I can tell which is derv 1, 2, or 3 :D <br />
<br />
Perhaps this is asking too much, but I've lost my lvl 24 far too many times to recall, but is there such a zone where I can hunt comfortably, without having to run for my life every few moments?  I like the Karanas but the griffs scare the **** out of me!<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">EverFrost Mammoths are good to fear kite, and they drop up to 2 tusks that sell for 8-10pp per, easily make a few kpp here if you stay 24-34, then 34-40 go to Stoneburnt Mountains.<br />
<br />
If you have Shadows of luclin go to Pauldal Caverns and melee solo the Bandits until 27 then go to Dawnshroud Peaks and fear-kite until 45 (54 is possible) if you want to</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>dsmfour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok thanks for the info!  Just one quick question though - are mammoths social?<br />
<br />
Thanks again!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dirus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you want to stay in SK, you can use harmony to split the birds in the birdhouse....at least I think you can . Not sure how the harmony nerf really worked. <br />
<br />
At 24, I would try Mistmoor, Runnyeye, Nejena, or Permafrost. All are very underpopulated and tons of fun. If you can bring along a few friends it would help out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes, Mammoths are social. I've been there since 22, and discovered that there will also be some competition for them.  Even on Sullon, which is very underpopulated.  Pull one to the northern zone line and you should be OK - it's a good place to learn how to control a pull, actually.  <br />
<br />
I feel your pain on learning to use Harmony -- I still don't quite have the knack yet.  Something about the range, I dunno.  But Harmony should allow you to pull a lot of things in singles. Also, do a search on my user name, and you can find a post about sneak-pulling that might help you solo a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>dsmfour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thank you very much everyone!  It's been very helpful.  I appreciate all the posts.  I've got a few ideas now.<br />
<br />
Thanks again<br />
