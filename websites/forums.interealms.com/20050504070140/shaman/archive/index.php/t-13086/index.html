<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Surly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was thinkin the other day about the constant evolutions of characters and thier abilities in EQ, and I turned to that of the Shaman. Since I have been playin EQ, there has been a considerable amount of significant changes to our class and our ablilities (a few EX out of MANY: alchemy updates to include illusions, the much improved heal spell and grp haste spells, and even a non snarable heal over time). These changes have come from SoE's developers, but also from a significant input via player feedback in both the test and live servers. <br />
     So, where am I goin with this you might be askin? Well, what better place to see what is grinding in the heads of the Shamans of Norrath than a forum that crosses all the servers. What I am going to do is list a couple of what I feel could be positive changes to the shaman class. Feel free to opine, and also to propose other ideas that you feel would make the shaman class better/more fun. In addition, if you feel strongly enough about any suggestion, feel free to send feedback ingame or online to SoE with the offchance that these changes could happen. LET THE MASSES SPEAK......<br />
<br />
- Froglok illusion potions as well as NPC type illusions (I know that LoY is recent, so they prob want to keep the Froglok potion away for a while. they may have something in theworks... who knows)<br />
<br />
- Some sort of Pacification spell. Seem that SoE has given casters the ability to single pull while leaving us out (yes I am aware of the root method) clerics, dru, rangers all have a spell which could make solo pulling a breeze.  Some of those who dont have pacification can snare and/or FD, which we can't do. I say give shamans the oppotunity like the Rangers or Druids also.<br />
<br />
- Some type of rez spell. Hmm, Shamans are priests, but dont have the ability to res.(yes, druids are also) I know this is a stretch, but this has bothered me ever since I became a shaman. When I think of a shaman, I think of the 'witch doctor' who could conjure heals and remedies. Also, however, I thought of shamans as the perfect class for the ability to resurrect a corpse. It seems the perfect fit. I say give us somethin similar to the necros rez.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just a couple ideas floating round my head...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">most of this has been beat to death. if you do a search you will find at least 3 threads already tabulated/colated/indexed with our wishlists.<br />
 as a side note they went mostly unanswered as well.good luck though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the only one that IMO is even a viable point is froglok potions, which personally, i care little about, and would rather see more important issues fixed first.<br />
please don't further blur class lines.<br />
i don't want rez, and i don't want clerics to get slow or canni, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I can hear enchanters screaming already just thinking about us being able to make froglok potions. The enchanter froglok illusion spell is a  level 65. Being able to have the same effect via a low level shaman made alchemy potion would cause them to have fits.<br />
<br />
I don't see us needing a sort of pacify or rez ability. Sure it would be nice to have tons of abilities that other classes have (mmmm.... snare, track, rez, charm, mez) but then what would the point be of having different classes? They would all end up pretty much the same. <br />
<br />
The only thing I would like to see that I don't think is too much is a invis spell with a set duration instead of a random one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">heh yeah about the chanters.<br />
i dont have a chanter..but if it was me, i'd be pretty pissed to turn in a rune and get an illusion frog spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Redspeed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">sorry, but these ideas are stupid. wont happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">WOW!!! Everyone here is so positive and Glowing!!!<br />
<br />
I CAN FEEL THE LOVE!!!   I CAN FEEL THE LOVE!!!<br />
<br />
but its the hope I don't feel<br />
<br />
Personally, I would love a rez potion, make it require an essence emerald boom instant balance.  Would love charm animal back, and have it bumped up to being able to be used at higher lvl's again.  Froglok illusion not going in seems like a goof to me rather than anything purposeful, when was the last time devs actually thought about not ****ting on a class?  I don't see a RP or gameplay reason to give us a pacify line.  I believe our cures should be second to none, and our DoT's second to only Necro's.</div></div><hr />

this is a post in general discussion to discuss something as a fun thing, not to critisize th devs or to 'cross class' discuss.<br />
<br />
Some people live just to shoot down a little creative or fun thought.<br />
Then again I am used to these type of people in game, so I shoulnt be surprised it is here to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sorry Surly, we've just endlessly debated stuff like &quot;should shaman get rez.&quot;  The answer was pretty much a resounding no the last 10 times it was brought up.  I totally agree with Mamutoi though, I would love a fixed duration invis :)<br />
<br />
PS Bring back winged courier!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">the game is ment to need the help of others <br />

you just listed things that would isolate yourself</div></div><hr />

<br />
ok, if ya say so.<br />
<br />
If the rez issue was debated, my error for not searching.....<br />
but this thread was not supposed to be a debate. <br />
As far as I am concerned, I this thread lost all what I thought it was supposed to do. So be it..</div></div><hr />

If you don't want a debate, <br />
(1) don't post something like that<br />
(2) don't post anything here.  We'll argue anything &amp; everything.<br />
<br />
I'd love to see us finally get improved invisibility.  I'd also like to see non-PC race illusions give the old faction modifiers they had.  I've had a couple lower-level enchanter friends splatted trying to buy from the brownies.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">*shrug* internet communities are what they are.  some people respond in more positive ways, some in more negative.  Once you post something however your words become part of the public domain and are open to whatever comes - I forget who said it, but there is a saying that goes something like, an author ceases to own his work the day he shows it.   thats horribly misquoted, but you get the idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Avangion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If its not supposed to be a debate, what is it supposed to be?<br />
<br />
I'd go further than calling those ideas stupid, i'd call them annoying as well (aside from the froglok illusion seeing as how we can make one for everyone else). Maybe you haven't realized it yet but when they (SOE) do class balance changes they DO listen to what players say. With that in mind, the community (thats us the players) need to collectively say &quot;This is what we would like to see&quot; while being reasonable as well.<br />
<br />
It gets tiresome to have to shout over people who ask for completely new and stupid things like res/mez/forage when way more reasonable things could be modified for us. Look at our PoP spell list. A good percentage of that probably had to do with the players making reasonable suggestions ie, A noticeable negative mr check to root to make it more worthwhile, Dots with no dd component.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let the masses speak out&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dimdim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Okies, lemme give a reply as a non reader of the Crucible for a long while. I am also going back to pre-PoP, if any assumptions are incorrect due to PoP then I'll need a re-think.<br />
<br />
Froglock pots : I'm a troll, froglocks grrr, I live somewhere odd now, apparently outdoors, and have never returned home; once Kelethin is given to the Gnomes I'll understand better!<br />
 But, more seriously...I tend to think of illusions as a chanter thing, having played one I never used them a lot except for a few quests (Tashania springs to mind), and mostly for comedy value when I got bored. Not really an issue to me as a shammy to be honest.<br />
<br />
Pacification : No way, shammies are very powerful as they are, it isn't anywhere near what we have had before and would seriously unbalance the class. As is, I can pull a lot of camps that are blue, and deal with them in a (obviously difficult sometimes) shammy way. Bear in mind I am only 54, but it seems in the 50's we significantly out-power most of the classes, and will have done from 49 onwards, if not before (I appreciate this is at the expense of a lot less relative power early on).<br />
The key, to my mind, is that we are effective indoors or out. We also have a controllable pet, most classes with a form of pacify don't get them (lvl 59+ chanters with dire as it was (pre-nerf) being a bit ott admittedly, despite the fact I play one), and whilst they may not be the best tanks in the game they very significantly add to our DPS. Equally important, we have excellent mana regen despite the fact we happily wear decent armour. We also get root, SoW, gate, etc etc.<br />
<br />
We don't need easier ways to go where we wish and have a good chance of surviving. We don't need pacify, shamans are that good. At least pre-61, after that, I have no idea.<br />
<br />
Rez: Sorry, again, no way, it was an enormous step to give pally's a decent rez, and has helped to improve the game, but, as someone said before, to add it to the shaman's inventory would be like adding a decent slow to other classes. Enchanters aren't far behind shammies post 57 on that front, but they serve a different role, much as pally's serve a different role to clerics. <br />
Nec's rez seems a bit of a mistake to me, when it was released it was a fairly big deal to be killed at 51+ (for the majority of the player base), now it is meaningless. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ultimately, I don't feel the shaman class needs that many changes, except this - if you wish to enrage me enough to petition SoE over something it is the following:<br />
<br />
 Durations on spells should be reflected by the level they are acquired, not the level other classes acquire them. Haste spells are my number one irritation when buffing a tank heavy group. Mana cost for alacrity is insignificant by 51+, and yet it significantly effects my gameplay. I don't want more haste, I want the ones I am given to last a lot longer. The next spell to increase it is at 56 and thats a long way from when I feverishly inscribed Alacrity. Extend items help, but Extend III aa is only available at 55.<br />
The same durations apply to hybrids, it isn't fun, it wouldn't unbalance anyone to change it, and would make the game a lot more enjoyable for a lot of people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'd say fix our charm spell.  I have one sittin in my book that is shoved so far back because it is not any good.<br />
<br />
A fixed duration invis spell would be good.  Tho the rush of running thru someplace KoS and seeing invis wearing off is kinda fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
Each class is supposed to be different, yet we all know that we are alike in alot of areas.  To individualize each of us, we have a Trade skill that no one else can do.  Alchemy has been improved greatly recently...it could still use some work tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">We already did this fight.  And it was war that we waged.  And we won battles, here and there.  But we lost others as well.  In the end, those of us who chose to fight about poorly thought-out PoP spells really made life a lot better for all shamans concerned.  <br />
- We were given group Replenishment<br />
- DD component removed from our PoP DoTs.<br />
- group shrink added<br />
- group haste added<br />
- Malos resist debuffage increased from -45 to -55.  <br />
- A new, fast-casting heal was added (Tnargs) at our request.<br />
- worthless stat buffs were replaced with more worthy spells.<br />
- lvl 62 necro spell Paralyzing Earth was removed from our spectal turn-in list (I got 3 of those damn things grr!!)<br />
<br />
And all that is just off the top of my head.  You're a bit late for the whole &quot;Improve the shaman class&quot; movement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">To be honest I only want 2 things out of the shaman class.<br />
<br />
1. Alchemy components cheaper so it is a useful and even sometimes lucrative tradeskill.<br />
2. Stats made at least slightly more meaningful, as every stat except for Dex and Sta are useless.<br />
<br />
#2 is highly unlikely because of the changes it would force on the game... but its still on my wishlist. Shamans are supposed to be master buffers, 2nd to clerics. But our buffs are SO focused on stat bonuses that are useless and do nothing. Its quite frustrating. And really those are my only two wishes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shammann65</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I want a New Epic Quest!!!<br />
the DoT at level 65 is worthless. Little damage to lvl65 Mobs and Long ass cast time. I  hold a better stats weapon than SoFate.... Its out-dated and in need of an upgrade. Most PoP high end gods Own any epic weapons. Oh the Invis on set timer wouldn't be too bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I met a true Newb the other day in PoK, while I was playing one of my lower characters.   A friend had talked them into giving EQ a try.  They made a Barb Shaman.  So, amazingly enough, there are still &quot;new&quot; people to the game, and new to the boards, that might not know what exactly to search for.  <br />
<br />
Some of the replies I see on the boards here are so totally jaded, that I think that when I get that jaded, I'll retire my Shaman.  I know where I'd like to see improvements.  I know what we've been given.  And I just continue to play my Shaman as best as I can in any given situation.  And when asked for an opinion, or for some advice on the Shaman's, I try to give it BASED on my own experiences.<br />
<br />
I know that this board is game wide, but there are still people that have not been here before.  They come here for advice, for help in any way, and when they get a bad reply, they may not come back here again.  <br />
<br />
I know I'm most always a lurker, I come here every day, sometimes  three and four times a day to see what's going on in the Shaman community.  When I see someone ask a good question, or just post an observation, and then see the jaded reply, I just sigh, and wonder why that shaman is still playing a shaman.  If it's that bad, take a break and find out why Shaman's are the way they are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Dimdim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Gildanni, I agree, sad to say, been reading the board for a long old time and good to see someone say what I was thinking. Crucible seems a lot less friendly than it once was. The games changed but there's still a ton of people that gain fantastic advice from it every day, me being one of them. The shaman community was always incredibly strong, any suggestions as to how to improve it now? Shaman's?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Just wait for the new expansion, we'll get str and dex spells that will increase by 8 freaking whole points.   And we'll like it.   Or, we'll be told we like it at least.  Until a) Sony gets creative or b) they totally revamp the stat system we're gimps.  King of Buffs, joy.  A full 75% of our spells are predominatly useless, or at least highly inefficient compared to everything else in the game.  This is the cost of Slow, and that's getting nerfed with mitigation.<br />
<br />
Any bets on whether A) or B) will ever come true?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Hildaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I would not mind a Rez spell, but I see a Shammy Rez spell being like the Necro one. Getting it only at high level (50 something 55 maybe), and needing a component (a 2 to 300pp potion needed to cast it) that way we can do it if needed, but it will never be considered in place of a Cleric rez, also limit it to 90% xp. Many Shaman say they do not want a rez, cause they do not want to be bothered. But I play a mostly Soloing Shaman, on off peak hours, and I like to hunt out of the way places. but a mistake, or bad lag spike can find me trying (and failing )to get a cleric to come rez me where I died, I have many times just eaten the XP loss because I can not get one to come, it would be nice if I could just do it myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Ok, <br />
<br />
I am going to let a cat outta the bag .....<br />
<br />
You want a single pull spell?  We have one .....<br />
<br />
I have used this particular spell to single pull the Kromzek Captain for the BoB quest, to single pull RumbleCrush and Doomshade, to single pull the Rockgolem boss in Akheva, to single pull Skellies in the SSra mine basement, etc ....<br />
<br />
Play with your level 60 (and the 65 version) spells as a method of pulling and you will quickly realise which is good for single pulling :)<br />
<br />
Happy hunting,<br />
Tek</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Phinger Bang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Surly, your original post points out suggested ideas to improve the class but, IMHO Shamans are plenty capable as it is.  Adding rez or pac would simply dilute things even more until we end up with an adventerur class ala asherons call.  <br />
<br />
If you want to improve the class, improve how people play their shamans :)<br />
<br />
Landragoran Heronwing hit it perfect.  We've (I watched from the wings) fought a war and got some really good changes put into place.  There we're some flat out mistakes that were definately improved.  Are there things still wrong with the class? Probably so, but they aren't very dramatic problems.  I could see improving a line of spells here or there, but no way would I add a whole new realm of spells and somehow think it's justified.  There isn't a PoP exp group out there that doesn't sigh in relief when they see '65 Shaman LFG'.  They aren't sighing in relief because we can single pull, or rez, or can make a froglok potion :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Getting a rez is a big nono.. It sounds like we are mages now  :eek: <br />
Serious though, keep suggesting things. Absor probably glimpse from time to time to see what we are talking bout and no conversation is dumb anyway. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I don't think, Froglok potions would be out of line, as we got Iksar illusion potions and that is  already a high lvl chanter spell, lvl 60 i think. So just have frog parts semi-rare or rare and  there shoud be no problem.<br />
<br />
Would have to disagree with any form of pacification balance-wise. From all the casters we are already one of the best equipped classes for 'melee' (kinda) and long time fights, if not the best. So what, that we have to pull a bit more careful and won't be able to pull from several mobs? I see that as OK balance.<br />
<br />
If there would be something like a rez potion (?) it should have to be seriously restricted  (expensive as hell and MAX 40/50 % effect) so you use it only for rare emergencies (like the port potions). But no, scratch that, i really see no actual need for it /shrug.<br />
<br />
But i have to agree with others here, we should concentrate on giving /feedback to tweak or fix current minor problems. SOE finally got off their ..... and did some decent changes to shaman (even if it needed a months/years long moaning and bitching from several hundred shaman  :rolleyes: ),  but things like the POP spells still need looking at (i haven't checked everything post 60, but i estimate half of the spells, especially buffs,debuffs got LESS mana effective than the pre 60 ones  :mad: ) - thanks again for the stealth nerf.<br />
<br />
I can understand, when some are a bit grumpy here (except those, that are always grumpy  :D ). When you do a search, you will find, that at least rez and froglok potions have been discussed several times. Not wanting to flame you, but you shouldn't get too upset about a few snotty remarks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">why stop with res and pacification?<br />
<br />
what we need is a better pet, one that will keep agro off us when we are melee'ing.. also backstab, and double attack.. hell throw in dual wield as well.<br />
<br />
We need more spells, aego at 62 would be nice, that way cleric's are still the masters, 96% rez is a must.<br />
<br />
FD spell or skill either or, and snare have to have snare.<br />
<br />
What good is all this stuff if we can't get around... give us all port spells also... can make them take a bat wing as a component, to even things out, then the druids and wizards can't complain.<br />
<br />
I think we also need DS&quot;s in line with mages.. I mean come on they are just mages and they can make a big ds! we are SHAMENZ!! We should be the masters of DS, maybe a spirit based DS.<br />
<br />
Honestly, as a shaman, I believe we should have a guardian spirit, so a skill in line with LoH, but instead of a god healing, it's y our guardian spirit, we could also get a HT type spirit, one that protects you offensively.. but does more dmg than HT&lt; cause HT sux lol!<br />
<br />
And an aa ability in our general (read 51) that is Protection of --(your diety here)--   that puts you invuln, full hp endless mana for half hour, cause that we can be teh winners!<br />
<br />
NOw that is what the shamans need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Sharok, Illusion: Iksar is a level 24 enchanter spell. I think you might be thinking of Illusion: Vah Shir, which is a level 54 enchanter spell, and pretty rare. (Drops off a rare mob in Ssra).<br />
<br />
Another point to note is that the enchanter spell Illusion: Froglok is a different froglok model to the new player race, so it's a level 65 rune spell, and distinctive. I can understand why we'd not get it as a potion.<br />
<br />
I do like the idea of a rez potion requiring an Essence Emerald though. It would be nice for emergencies, and would give alchemy a boost. If it requires an Essence Emerald, that still means it costs a life to make, so that would be the balance.... Only clerics and paladins would still be able to rez without cost.</div></div><hr />

An other shaman need rezz thread...<br />
I don't want rezz. Do you have so little friends that you can't get a rezz when you are dead ?<br />
Pacification ? and why not mezz, Crack and uber haste ? If you can't single pull your mob, or can't handle two of them, go solo somewhere else !<br />
To me those requests looks like beeing made by a soloing guildless shaman without friends.. Yes if EQ was a single player game that would be great to have a shamadruidenteric class to play...<br />
<br />
For the illusion potion .. No opinion but I don't think it's fair to give us that potion considering that the chanter spell is lvl 65 and you need to waste a rune for it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Hail,<br />
<br />
Things I'd like:<br />
<br />
CHANGE slow mitigation.  Make mobs MR slowable, Disease Slowable, Curse slowable, or client-flagged Immune.  Reduce the # of immune-flagged mobs.<br />
<br />
INCREASE the duration of our upper level spells.  Rather sad that some of our 50-60 spells last longer than our 61+ spells.  This isn't a major deal for me, but it would be easy to fix.<br />
<br />
Let shaman use a combination of alchemy with another tradeskill (pottery?) to be able to MAKE tradeable CHARMS for players.  The high end pottery items that already exist (Ceramic Shield, etc) could possibly be made into a charm by combining them with some alchemy reagents in a medicine bag.  These have lousy stats already, but very nifty focus effects.<br />
<br />
Fixed duration self-only invisibility spell.  Make it only last 5 minutes instead of 10 if the length of the Improved Invisibility spell in a shaman spellbook bothers the developers that much.  (This was also addressed at multiple fanfaires and rejected.)<br />
<br />
Give Tiny Terror an acceptance box (like w/ TL's) when cast out of group, or let us spend 2 or 3 AA points to allow us to MGB Shrink (w/ a box).<br />
<br />
The ability to combine the store-bought one shot invisibility potions into a 5 or 10-shot potion.  (Note:  This is also a pipe dream, as it has been SOLIDLY rebuffed by developers &amp; coders for multiple reasons several times at various fanfaires.)<br />
<br />
An 18 second duration (-30 resist) SNARE potion made w/ alchemy (maybe disease or curse based?).<br />
<br />
Mid-high level Cold-based AE rain spells &amp;/or DoT's.<br />
<br />
A mid-high level unlimited target # AE spell.  Keep the damage down to something along the lines of Torrent, but give us something so we can farm greenies en masse for tradeskill junk.<br />
<br />
Curse-based spells.  A curse based slow for instance would be neat, and could be added to make slow mitigation go away as it exists right now.<br />
<br />
A new epic quest to upgrade the ole' Spear of Fate. :)<br />
<br />
I can probably think of some others, but those are some I just thought of that I don't think would be too out of line.<br />
<br />
Out of what's already been said, I wouldn't be against a froggy potion, but it isn't worth fighting for.  <br />
<br />
A rez potion using an essence emerald wouldn't be so horrible, but I'm generally extremely leery of blurring class lines any more than they already are.  We don't need it, and shouldn't be asking for it in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

I mean c'mon at level 65 you'll still be using your level 51 slow. We need an upgrade to Turgur's (faster cast maybe...without the 3 second recast delay, perhaps a bit less resistant, or maybe add a small 10% run speed snare to it). It doesn't really need to slow more than the current of 70%, but some improvements would be useful.</div></div><hr />

Now look at what a dictionary says about the Cleric....<br />
<br />
Word History: Cleric, clerk, and clark all come from Latin clricus, &quot;a man in a religious order, a man in holy orders.&quot; Cleric appears in Old English about 975 and lasts into the 13th century. Clerc appears in late Old English, around 1129, and was identical in spelling and pronunciation with Old French clerc, &quot;belonging to the (Christian) clergy.&quot; In the Middle Ages the clergy were the only literate class and were often employed as scribes, secretaries, or notaries. By about 1200 clerc had acquired the meaning &quot;pupil, scholar,&quot; as we see in Chaucer's &quot;clerk of Oxenford&quot; in The Canterbury Tales (around 1386). Clerks were also of necessity employed in keeping accounts and recording business transactions; this is the source of the modern sense of clerk. By the early 17th century, the word clerk had become completely ambiguous; it could refer equally to a clergyman or to an accountant. For this reason cleric (spelled Clericke and with its modern pronunciation) was introduced or reintroduced from Latin or Greek as both a noun and an adjective to refer specifically to a member of the clergy. The pronunciation (klärk), spelled clark and clerk, arose in the south of England during the 15th century and is today the Received Pronunciation of clerk in the United Kingdom. The modern American pronunciation (klûrk) more closely represents the older pronunciation. The pronunciation (klärk) is used in the United States only in the proper name Clark. The south England sound change responsible for the pronunciation (klärk) also gave rise to parson (beside person), varsity (beside university), and even varmint (beside vermin). <br />

Seems to me that the lines between Shaman and Cleric got blurred, by quite a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">This isn't related to the shaman class but it is a wish I have had for a long time.  I just want the ability to go completely invis in the game.  I.E, no '/who name all' will say I am online.  If your in the same zone as me then yes it would show up on the who list, but since they removed the ability to block tells some time ago it just gets frustrating that I can't be left alone to solo when I want to.<br />
<br />
People will argue that you can just ignore tells or filter them out but it's not the same.  I just want peace and quiet without the guilt trip of not helping my guild or friend on something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Some kind of pacify spell would take all the fun out of breaking a spawn.  A shaman res would just blur class lines and if you want another class to get res for truly abusive power, just give it to monks. :p<br />
<br />
The only improvement I really want to see is a change to Shrink/Tiny Terror so that it effects any group in /raid.  Any sustained raid with multiple deaths requires annoying work-arounds just to keep everyone shrunk.<br />
<br />
It would be nice to get some +attk spells that provide a decent boost and last a bit longer than 6 min.  I'm still surprised SOE never dropped in an upgrade for PE with PoP.  It seemed like an obvious choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Kunderu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">To be honest I only want 2 things out of the shaman class.<br />
<br />
1. Alchemy components cheaper so it is a useful and even sometimes lucrative tradeskill.<br />
2. Stats made at least slightly more meaningful, as every stat except for Dex and Sta are useless.<br />
<br />
#2 is highly unlikely because of the changes it would force on the game... but its still on my wishlist. Shamans are supposed to be master buffers, 2nd to clerics. But our buffs are SO focused on stat bonuses that are useless and do nothing. Its quite frustrating. And really those are my only two wishes.<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree make the componets cheeper and the stats more meaningfull..<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind a rez potion. it can even cost alot to make and only do say a 60% rez and be non combineable ie.. 5 dose and 10 dose. also what they could do is simular to what the necro does sacafice some one for a gem simular to what the necro's use and make it a component to be used in the potion making process..<br />
<br />
rez potion would be nice to have around when one can't get a rez from a cleric or necro.</div></div><hr />

You mean the bonuses to my strength that raise my ATK and carrying capacity are useless? And the increased money I get from a higher Charisma when selling are pointless? <br />
<br />
I will agree with you on Agi only because I have no clue what that number affects.<br />
<br />
I may not have played the game as long as you but those are two very notable effects that I can document. So the stats are not totally useless but I will agree that they could be made more meaningful or at least the effects more noticeable.<br />
<br />
I totally agree with you that the cost of alchemy makes the skill next to useless. The prices of the components are way out of line with the benefits the potions provide.</div></div><hr />

God, I guess I need a postcount on the 1000s to have valid points.<br />
<br />
I have not had the opportunity to peruse this boards extensively as to what was debated, argued, and fought for. So what. I have seen some good replys here, and some with the 'holier than thou' attitude. I agree that this is an open forum to express ideas, but it is not right to express your opinions as if mine were pieces of crap. Let me tell you I have played a shaman for a long time, and I know how it is played. My suggestions were (besides the debating and flaming) really an attempt to foster other ideas as well, not like a reply that said 'not another shamans need a rez thread' I saw.  <br />
<br />
Some have simply said 'no' in this post, and even added a hahah. Very insightful. I agree that Paci and rez were a stretch, but they came to mind as to abilities that could be useful, NOT NECESSARY. I dont see, however, how these uber shaman state outright that froglok potions are a distinctive 'NO'. As a matter of fact, I do see this as happening once the allure of making a froglok character dies down. But this is my opinion, and once again, everyone is entitled to their opinion.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of existing things that could be changed for the better of the shaman class, and some were discussed here. Kudos for those thoughts, and I hope some of them make it into the ears of SoE. One that certainly comes to mind is the invis issue.<br />
<br />
I dont mind debate, Shandy, but it is the rudeness that Gricck refers to that bothers me. In addition, Avangion, sorry you found these things annoying, but I really dont give a crap. At least in you wisdom you gave me a little benefit on the froglok illusions. Thanks. I dont see the annoyance in askin for opinions. I guees accepting all of the condecending, know it all opinions are also necessary.<br />
<br />
I agree with Dimdim and Gildanni that this board is not all that friendly. <br />
<br />
'Let the masses speak,' I said it so I guess I asked for it.</div></div><hr />

Pay attention to those who are giving suggestions.<br />
<br />
So far, yes there is debate on rez potion still, and trust me a 93% rez potion that is not trivial that uses an essence emerald is pretty well balanced and YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE TELLS ASKING FOR IT WHILE YOU ARE SOLO'ING *******S. :)  Potion = available to all at all times, I'm sure clerics will love this, just like druids love PoK.<br />
<br />
The fact that we did not recieve an Improved Inivs appears to be an oversight to me, you think its fun haveing random duration, don't use it.<br />
<br />
Our DPS outright sucks, our DoT's need massive improvement.  I think Everyone can agree on this amazingly.<br />
<br />
Kraggs needs some upgrading atad, just about to the druids lvl, but at least higher than what we're at.<br />
<br />
An upgrade to Spirit of Cheetah that has no recast time.  Also a potion of it with a triv of bout 120.<br />
<br />
An indoor atk buff, also more dungeons.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>CaradocBertoxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I want a New Epic Quest!!!<br />
the DoT at level 65 is worthless. Little damage to lvl65 Mobs and Long ass cast time. I  hold a better stats weapon than SoFate.... Its out-dated and in need of an upgrade. Most PoP high end gods Own any epic weapons. Oh the Invis on set timer wouldn't be too bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
Look at almost every epic in the game... all of them have been replaced with better items.  Epic's are never going to be revamped.<br />
<br />
monk epic's seem to be the one epic that outlasts everything mainly because it's Spell class haste( yeah canceld by any good haste ) AND ATK added in.    and there is a glove slot with similar stats, elemental quest armor - with Celestial tranquility, but doesn't have the gimped hand damage added in so that monks can get the 15/20 hands at lvl 65.<br />
<br />
I just don't think SoE is going to relook at epic's ( considering they were released as particle weapons - not epic,  considering they arn't very epic anymore )<br />
<br />
just my 2 cent's, they're just good weapons from 50 to what ever lvl you upgrade em at. ehhe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2 things Shamans should be given...<br />
<br />
1:  A more reasonable implementation of Alchemy...   Components for a Potion Costing 60-100PP and reselling to a Vendor for 2 PP is silly.<br />
<br />
2:  Melee - Our melee is now inferior to a Cleric's, considering our Class is meant to be a &quot;Battle-priest&quot;  I actively melee in all XP groups I am in, and I enjoy it.   I feel that once Clerics were given Bash and they're silly Proc Hammer the Cleric/Shaman balance was ruined.  I would be happy to see either our Melee skills get pushed to 220 or 225, or, not unlike Beastlords and Bards, be able to Purchase the Ability to Double Attack, at a Reduced cap from Melees of course, but Double Attack none the less.   Say at a skill of 100.<br />
Bashing I would take, but don't much care about either way.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I don't like the idea of a rez potion... not in the traditional sense... what I would like is a self only port to corpse.<br />
<br />
It would only port you to your last corpse, and cost more than a coffin does to make.  Make them Alchemy, non-combineable.  If you want to further restrict them coming into the game, require a dropped component, or a new medicine bag that requires a minimum skill to get (ie the new research stuff)  You might wanna make a few, that also return a small bit of experience, but I would suggest no rez effects.  Make the most amount of xp returned 50%  Pricing could be like 100 for cheapest... up to 600 for the 50% return.  That way it would be good for soloers to pick them up, and you could just keep them in a bank.  Maybe even have the potion have a new rez effect, which is similar to Rogue sneak... for 1 min or something, but you can't attack, or cast a spell (like DA) so you could port in and drag out your body... but its still only really safe to use when you die in a safe place.<br />
<br />
other thing I want is a /drag command to pull corpses... target corpse, type /drag or /dragoff to have corpse follow you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Res items are super-rare and sell for ridiculous amounts of cash for a good reason.  While I think an Essence Emerald based res potion would be neat, it would enable people to do things en mass that were not viable before.  Just think, you could have a monk or rogue skip zone &quot;elements&quot; up to some nook or cranny out of aggro and pathing then res in a mage for CoH or a cleric for res where CoH does not work.  The only control for such a potion would be to make components beyond rare and extremely pricy.</div></div><hr />

(3)  Quaaludes.<br />
(4)  Enemas.<br />
<br />
Seriously, though, as long as we're wishing:<br />
<br />
I wholly endorse the raised skill caps on our melee skills (220?  a real bash?  oooh!), and the class AA ability to purchase Double Attack (75 at lev1, 125 at lev2, 175 at level 3).  <br />
<br />
It wouldn't take anything away from anybody, wouldn't blur class lines, and would make rabid bear that much more useful.<br />
<br />
Frankly, getting this skill during regular leveling would be awesome -- we would have to balance our desire to melee against our need for mana regen.  When you cann, you don't swing :)</div></div><hr />

Same reason why I only proposed a 100 Double attack.     If a 65 Shaman were suddenly able to wade into Combat with a 1 to 1 Ratio or better 2 hander with 235 2hb and 175 Double Attack, he'd be parsing close to a Knight's DPS, and that's not exactly fair to the knights.

Overnerfed in response........theres nerfs that take place before something goes in, and theres the nerf that takes place making it so it never goes in in the first place, or extremellly gimped.  Might I mention Avatar is well useless (cept primal avatar and ferine avatar, both put in after it was relized the component and recast was a mistake), and that the uber lvl 65 spell Q was how Torpor was originally.  In the case of stuff not going in, or going in crippled to uselessness we are the most nerfed class there is.</div></div><hr />

I still like the PB-AoE slow idea.  Hell, make it a poison-based noxious cloud and give it a standard check.  I just think it would be damn cool.  <br />
<br />
Also, and I really don't wanna step on other classes toes here, but I think we should have some type of mind-style debuff, which is detremental to casters like the Cripple line is to melee's.  Something like a confusion-type spell which reduces the effects of a casters' spells, whether they be heals or nukes or whatever.  Would really add to the whole buff-debuff specialization concept that we have, although the enchanters may feel like it's too similar to their &quot;mental style&quot; of buff-debuff lines.  <br />

And finally, if you wanna be really fancy, throw a couple rage-type spells that are group buffs.  Like a 3-4 tick massive attack boost that you can use cast every 4 minutes or something.  Nothing would be more awesome than hitting your raid with an MGB &quot;Charge!&quot; when the mob's down to 4 percent and you've only got one cleric left standing.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for listening  :)</div></div><hr />

I think a res in any form is BS. Like i wanna be the one running around trying to rez guildmates.<br />
<br />
And any other of the crazy stuff ppl talk about Damage shield? go make one it gets better with lvls.<br />
<br />
Do you really wanna run around with a charmed pet? no snare no boggle? just root and zone?  <br />
<br />
Lvl 61 pet does dual wield and will even quad when give weps. <br />

Post PoP a shaman has a job, it is debufffing, wether it is slowing and crippling or others.  <br />
<br />
Alchemy component pricing could be a little better, illusion potions? who cares!!<br />
<br />
The only thing you'd find on my wish list for shamans is some form of ability to control aggro, wether it is aa ability or whatever, then again if we could FD then we would be nothing more than necros with buffs.<br />
However in PoP raid situations and rampaging mobs are a way of life now, after slow and crip, i dare you to throw a poison DoT on a raid class mob.<br />
<br />
Necro's rule the DoT's because they can FD, if they could not they would die very quick. As far as Duo's go Shaman Necro all the way!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reasons why my post were sort of hostile were a combination of things you posted. Post ideas I would find dumb? I'd leave it alone most likely. To then say this isn't a debate ticked me off. People can't say your ideas are stupid? Retract that statement and everything is fine and dandy. Anyway, I apologize if you felt it was a personal attack. I was trying to attack your ideas. Whether or not you draw that distinction is up to you.<br />
<br />
Yep, I agree with you that a froglok illusion should be added since it'd fall in line with what we currently have. Even some form of res potion would be possible. The problem lies in how they (SOE) would attempt to balance it. From an RP standpoint, toss in the idea of the shaman witch doctor requiring his magical fetishes needed to revive a corpse.<br />
<br />
My take on it is SOE has been very careful when it comes to alchemy so you can't do certain things by &quot;buying&quot; your way through it via potions. It's pretty easy to see how it would be possible. Res potions would have to be given major drawbacks (ie HUGE cast time, really high cost) in order to keep it balanced. Otherwise, you'd be having monks ressing in a raid or anything else creative players can come up with.<br />
<br />
Considering how people pay 50pp for a KEI and go grind for hours, it'd be nice to see a potion with it's effect. Again, since alchemy has its checks and balances it'd have to have some major drawback (very high skill to make/cost).<br />
<br />
Its possible to suggest any of the spells in EQ to be tossed into a potion. Its just a matter of answering tons of questions like how much, cast time, skill check, the components and their availability while keeping in mind all the possible ways us players could possibly use them.<br />
<br />
Having said all that, yea it'd be all great but I'll be just as ok with SOE working on some of the other issues players have addressed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Wyldin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">our high level ac spell is worthless...how about making it stack with more spells. Up the mana costs i dont care just make it stack...<br />
<br />
Fix the focus on the shaman ornate/elemental, the nuke is still not enticing enough to use and will never be to me due to the crappy mana to dmg ratio.<br />
<br />
I hope they do someday implement the patch where other stats mean something. I rarely ever get asked for anything other then focus/sta except for a few anal MTs asking for the agi or str for that 1 or 2 ac it would give them.<br />
<br />
Would like to see something else for shamans to do on raids. I mean if you have a few shamans stuff always gets slowed so that's not an issue but I find my heals are just ok but usually not enough to deem myself a healer and my dps is ok but usually by the time i get a dd off the mob is already dead unless its a bossish mob :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">If I was wishing ...<br />
<br />
1.   First - Charms found OUTSIDE of LoY.   Charm items that were based on both class and even in some cases race while not solely based on stat's.   Say a Shaman based charm that improves bash/slam abilities.   Or a Troll (all classes) charm that improves fire resists and AGI  (Troll fire resists natural is 5 starting out - AGI low as well).   OR for something completely wild ... a Charm that improves Rabid Bear reset timer.<br />
<br />
2.   More gear based on races instead of armor classes.    There is room for more quested and skill based gear built around higher levels of each race.  Yes it requires someone to think about designing each per each quest.   If you check my sig ... I'm wearing a Troll only belt that drops off Inny.   No it's not just Shaman only but from a RP sense it works.  Plus there is room within the game to have items that either one race or class can wear.   I'm getting tired of seeing RNG ROG SHM or Dru Clr Shm listed on some of these drops with few Shm only.<br />
<br />
3.  More quest/trade skills that use Alchemy items.  The QoK potion is a good start but I would like to see another quests built like Druid Cabbage/Earring which requires high-end Alchemy products.   Something that would provide a reason to bother with AA Alchemy points instead of them being the TOTAL waste it is today.<br />
<br />
In essense, I'm looking for things from the Dev group that would improve the usefulness of things we already have in place ... AA's, Alchemy Skills, Gear/Loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Shaman already got good utility by Alchemy<br />
<br />
Invis vs undead(Cle, Pal, Sk, Nec ability)<br />
Illusion potion(Enc ability, save lots of faction work)<br />
Port/Gate Potion(limited spot, but still useful)<br />
Dmg shield potion(Mag/Dru ability)<br />
the herb cost is expansive, but acceptable.<br />
<br />
But Rez?  How a dead corpse drink a Rez potion?<br />
(roleplay reason)<br />
Take a example:Rez item: <br />
Staff of Forbidden Rites(?) with 90% Rez effect<br />
The Buy/Sell back price is nerfed by Verant.<br />
<br />
If Shaman really get Rez potion, the herb cost will be very expansive like 10000 pp and effect will much worse like 0~75% rez.  Totally useless for casual ppl.</div></div><hr />

Yes, a dead corpse can't drink a potion... but are all potions meant to be imbibed? I'll answer that for you. From a RP standpoint, smearing a recently dead person with a potion as a balm to then begin whatever shaman ritual sounds appropriate to me.<br />
<br />
Edit: To prevent the anal argument.. Yes, by definition, a potion is meant as a drink but it doesn't sound like too much of a stretch to me</div></div><hr />

I was thinking more along the lines of Police Academy, when Bubba Smith played the voodoo priest. But hey, whatever floats yer shammy boat. <br />

Its wishful thinking and would float my shaman boat.. only its not my boat  ;)  I'm just trying to add some reasoning to other people's ideas. I'm not offering any suggestions since I don't have any oustanding issues with the shaman class. Although, I do get a bit jealous of my cleric friend when we're farming. She's beating the hell outta greenies with her hammer while im relying more on my puppy to kill than my spear  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">O I dunno that the Cleric/shaman balance is ruined.  A truly GOOD shaman (like me /snicker) can replace a cleric in a PoP group, indefinitely.  I was sole caster (exception of a ranger in the group) for 2 hours the other day in BoT at the beez.  I was pulling, slowing, healing, and tossing a DoT or nuke now and then.  For a group of melees.  Can a cleric do all that?  Last I heard, they couldn't slow, tho they do make better pullers most likely due to Pacify.  All they can do is heal much better and whack **** with a hammer that procs insanely, stun lvl 65 mobs, nuke, and Rez.  So yah, clerics are da bomb, but shamans can replace em too, so *** you want anyway?  Seems balanced to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>dcfix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">I want a new PoP AA called Mass Production. Here's how it would work. put a stack of items into the combine container, and they're combined for ya. Bump the fail rate from 5% to 10% for trivials. No skill bumps can result from this AA, so it's only good for doing trivials...<br />
<br />
Now, instead of sitting there making Blood of Wolf after Blood of Wolf for guildies, just throw in a stack wolf blood, birthwart and fenugreek. Bang, out comes 15-20 sow potions. Or throw in 10 at a time, bang, out comes 8-10 (or 0, depending on your luck)<br />
<br />
Best of all, this wouldn't upset the precious class balance. And I don't wanna hear about the unbalancing of bazaar prices... It's always unbalanced when comparing a person that's mastered something compared to someone that hasn't.<br />

Potions that allow you to take an entire line of enchanter spells, like different race illusion potions would do.. is a very bad idea. Its bad enough that clerics, druids, rangers, paladin all stold the enchanter Lull spell. Enchanters are crowd control, and only they should have a Lull type spell.. other then that use a monk, it would give them something to do.<br />
<br />
Shamans already have far to many abilities.. unresistable all resists down Malo.. pet (clerics would love this btw), nukes, uber dots, heals, torpor line, regen, sow, uber stat/hp/ac/attack/resist buffs, haste, slow, canni, root, etc.. + alchemy and a port to their home town stone aswell. Clerics get Healing, nuke, stun, rez, root... ooo :P<br />
<br />
Shamans are good in PVP, groups, solo, and ok in guilds. an all around best choice really. Which is why i picked them so many times, but i knew it was because they were over powered compared to a lot of other classes. yet monks and enchanters etc.. get nerfed, its almost like sony hasnt been keeping an eye on shamans :P<br />
<br />
Shamans can tank PoP mobs and defeat them since their dots put out a decent amount of damage. If they kept Shamans the same as they are now for another 3 expansions im sure they would still be on par with that content :P<br />

And of course if your a troll shaman you can get snare spell too, what a wonderful idea lmao... why dont they give a druid or ranger a right clickable slow spell on an item?</div></div><hr />

Lets see why dont you give examples of why shaman are overpowered or just ****.<br />
<br />
Dots arnt uber at all,, on our pop dots  blood should be same damage at 4-5 ticks and breath same damage at 8-10 ticks. All preists get port to home. Our port potions are overpriced and porting is very ez. Avatar was put on weapons 2 xpansions ago,, There went one of our Uber buffs and pot9 is more hp then focus.<br />
<br />
Please give druids and clerics slow ,, give mages and wizards slow for all i care.. that is only thing people say is shaman overpowering. s<br />
<br />
Shaman in PVP suck if people have resists.. so **** up there. PVP should have no basis at all on balance of classes this game wasnt made for PVP.<br />
<br />
Solo'ing, others solo better please do not speak of solo'ing we are by far not the most efficient solo class.<br />
<br />
Sony hasn't been keeping an eye on shaman? They have been keeping an eye since kunark. We recieve no new damage since POP. Also look at the slow mitigation, it only makes our slows less effective and everyone elses slows more effective.<br />
<br />
Yes i can tank a pop mob but so can others,, its freaking retarded to tank mobs, Alot of pop stuff doesnt summon thats why  we can kill it. Guess what if it summons we couldnt kill it without much heart ache.<br />
<br />
Also What kind of newb are you? There is a quest for innoruk druids to get a slow clicky neck. Freaking  do some research newbie.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Hildaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">I was not advocating a Rez Potion, but rather using a potion as a component in a Rez spell, with the cost of the potion to be a coupla hundred PP, I do not want a potion anyone can use. I want a rez spell equal to the Necro Rez spell, but useing a potion instead of an Essence Emerald, this potions sould be expensive to make, and have a fairly High Triv, maybe the triv sould be arounf max alchemly for the level we get the spell. A shaman haveing such a rez spell would not blur the class line any more than a Necro having one. I would like it to be a worth while spell though, say 90 to 93% xp, what ever the necro is capable of. Such a spell would be handy in a bad spot, but would never be prefered over a cleric Rez, for the simple matter of the cost of the potion, just as no one prefers a Necro rez, because of the cost of the essence emerald. I am against any Rez potion that we could hand out, because that really would be bluring the class lines</div></div><hr />
