Myfistow mentions that you can't raise defense on PC pets (assuming blue con or higher). I had read in lots of places that you can. Haven't actually tried this myself, but is the pet thing just an urban legend?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Raise defense?  Confused what you mean, as in dueling a PC and fighting the pet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BryeLLe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep. I know that you can't raise skills by dueling with another PC, but heard that you could with their pets because pets are considered NPCs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hrm I have no idea then.  My best guess would be no as it would probably be considered an exploit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Duffe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">since pets are considered npc's, yes you can gain offence and defence dueling a pet class and fighting there pet. helped several friends dothis while playing my mage way back when.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Myfistow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok, I could be wrong.  I know you &quot;used&quot; to able to duel anothers pet and get the skill increases (Off/Def or whatever), but I really thought VI had &quot;fixed&quot; it a while back so that you can't do that anymore.  Oh well, I have never tried it myself, so it was really a guess (and one that me hoped was an &quot;edumacated&quot; one ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BryeLLe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">okies, thanks everyone. it could be that it used to work but not anymore. :\ i have access to a 2nd puter this weekend, so i'll try it out and post what i find... unless someone else beats me to it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">as of two months ago, defense most certainly still went up dueling a necromancer pet.  He were goofing around, trying to see how bad the monk pet was, and I was it's target :)  Big joke when we were all done was that at least I got a few defense points for all my bruises.  So at least I know defense can still go up - unless it's been changed in the last few patches.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>BryeLLe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">as of saturday (5/25), necro pets were still working. got defense up from 157 to 165 in about 20 minutes. yeah, yeah, i know, that's why i'm working on my defense! offense skills never went up tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>F15E0476</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">One day i went to arena with my mage lv 16 and thought would be cool to attack my pet then back him off.   Well i got a suprise so don't do this in the arena if its still the way it used to be.  I hit my pet and he gave me a little schooling.  I got killed of vourse could not back my pet off me like he wasn't my pet anymore.  To top it off i came back to get my corpse, and he killed me again.  When i came back to my corpse the third time i conned him and he was scowls ready to attack.   And i had managed to train him out of arena out in front of it the 2nd death, to a guard which did not assist me.  I eveutalluy got a high lv player to kill my pet that had gone ape crap.  I think it would be cool to do it to a 50+ pet and somone train it to the newbie area and have a lv 54 mage pet killing the newbies lol.   Just to let u guys know about that what pets do in the arena's even though we would have no problems if our pets turned on us they are easy kills.</div></div><hr />
