<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>iamagator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In 1 ½ years of playing EQ I have never dueled.  I’m hoping someone can explain some details about dueling.  Here is what I would like to know:<br />
<br />
1. When you die during a duel, do you lose experience?<br />
<br />
2. If you win a duel, do you gain experience?<br />
<br />
3. When you die during a duel, do you return to your bind point or respawn at the area in which you were fighting?<br />
<br />
4. When you die during a duel, do you respawn with all your gear or do you have to go back and loot everything from your corpse?<br />
<br />
5. Is there any difference in dueling in an arena or PVP area versus dueling in any other given zone/area?<br />
<br />
If there are any other points one might want to know about dueling please feel free to let me know what they are.  I have some friends who have been suggesting we have some friendly duels but I like to know what I’m getting into first.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">no, dueling on a regular sever has no loss or gain of exp.<br />
<br />
you pop at bind point<br />
<br />
you have to do CR<br />
<br />
difference is that arena is free for all.  the second you enter, anyone there can hit you.<br />
<br />
major spell changes used in pvp/dueling.  after Malo, it is often possible to blind a player on a regular server, because they more than often do not have enough MR.<br />
<br />
PUMICE is a store bought clickable MR debuff.  if you are against a non sow class, unless they have a ton of potions, you can lower their run speed.<br />
<br />
same with incapacitate,  if it is a geared SK/Tank, it is possible to lower their run speed by encumbering them.<br />
<br />
spell stacking/buff is really really important.  if they have pumice or cancel magic line; make sure your top spell slots are worthless junk (inner fire, ultravision, ect)  make the most important spells the last ones you cast, so they will be the last ones canceled.<br />
<br />
if against a DRUID, click off the top spell so that Sting goes into that slot them pumice it off yourself.<br />
<br />
if against a ranger, keep your pet (now snared) in between you and him.  archery will hit the pet and not you.<br />
<br />
if against someone really not prepared, have invis up.  you go off target when you go invis if they cannot see you.<br />
<br />
if a duel, pick a place that is best suited to fight against your opponent.  casters in a really really small place (fav is the goblin alchemist room in perma, but get the bets in before you tell them loc)  and against melee, the biggest place you can find for kiting them.  <br />
<br />
most likely lose the cold based and go to PR/DIS, those resists are harder to raise and defend against.<br />
<br />
at the start, be as close as you can to a caster, and as far away from a melee as you can.<br />
<br />
shock of lighting has an interupt component to it, if against a wiz, mem the regular heal instead of superior.  the cast time is less for reg heal and you can just run him OOM.<br />
<br />
against a melee, be Lev for sure.  harder to hit.  pumice off lev from any caster.  <br />
<br />
never get in HT health range for a SK.  Heal yourself, or be prepared for CR.<br />
<br />
watch where you fight for faction.  not sure on reg servers, but on pvp servers mobs/guards will jump in on the side of the person they like more.<br />
<br />
swap gear for the individual class you are fighting.  AC for melee, HP/Sta for casters.  <br />
<br />
jousting.  (hard to explain) run to target, press attack, swing weapon, press UN-attack, get out of range, let weapon 'recycle' delay time, rinse, repeat.  works best with a big delay/dam weapon.  do not stand toe to toe with any melee, only be in melee range when you are swingin' da hammer.<br />
<br />
free up a bunch of gen inventory slots for pumice, potions.  you can hot key them from there.<br />
<br />
hot key assist , so that if you have to target yourself for heals, ect; you can assist pet to get target back.<br />
<br />
treat a necro like a melee, get far away and instill or a long lasting root on pet.  but also pumice off the dots that will be incoming to your top slot.<br />
<br />
chances are you cannot kill a bard of the same level in a wide open zone.  they just sing cancel, and run off and heal.<br />
<br />
mage epic pets are the death.<br />
<br />
root casters and keep the dog on them for spell interupts.  <br />
<br />
everytime a melee gets frustrated and turns around to hit your pet, cast on him.<br />
<br />
wizards with manaburn are the death.<br />
<br />
necros with lifeburn are the death.<br />
<br />
keep moving.  it is possible to make it where they can not cast because they cannot see you.  use the terrain.<br />
<br />
heal yourself, heal yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>iamagator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wow!  What a great response.  Thanks so much for the advice/strategy.  The person I am most likely to duel is a RL friend who is a heavily twinked 53 SK with Fungi.  I am a heavily twinked 54 Shammy with Epic, Fungi (no JBB).  <br />
<br />
Last night he (53 SK) went up against another RL friend who is a 60 Mage w/epic.  As you indicated, epic pet = death.  The pet killed the SK in about 30 seconds.  Mage never did nuke.<br />
