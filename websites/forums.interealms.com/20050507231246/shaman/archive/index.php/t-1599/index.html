<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ssik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering what the price would be on one of these. I've never seen one for sale, perhaps because the ones that have been quested for are in use, and not being sold. Any ideers? <br />
<br />
Yer pal, <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gazkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This better not be true, I'm just about to hit dubious faction in Katta to do the quest, went from scowls to threatening about 200 vamps ago.  The only reason I decided to work on this faction is to do this quest, the quest is incredibly hard, not like the LSOEE quest was, I can't see why Verant would take it of the game.. my guess is that you were misinformed.. could someone with the faction to do the quest tell us if it is still given?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Maboun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Quest is not really that hard just time consuming. And now camped. Tormented vah shir and burning priest are both usually camped when I poke around in SD or TM these days. I finished the quest prior to moving servers and sold it for 25k. <br />
<br />
In my opinion given the stats it should sell for around whatever the emerald dragonscale tunic sells for (I am guessing with similar stats and 3-4 of each of these maybe entering game a week?). It is nice for the ac and if you are wisdom poor but would you want to pay 20-30k for a kitty shield or 3k on a Sarnak Shield or Crystal Chitin. Up to you but a lot of the price is the novelty, I see this as ending up being a dr00d shield of choice for the long haul.</div></div><hr />

Last I heard they were nerfed out of the game with the last patch! AND I JUST SPENT 20K ON MINE! <br />
<br />
<br />
If you just bought one, wouldn't you know first hand it was gone, and not 'heard' it was...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Umgrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They are definately still in the game as of early this morning.<br />
I had mine still.<br />
I didn't check to see if the quest mob was still there, but I'm fairly certain it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>gazkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I know for a fact a guild on my server obtained the shield for one of its members the night after the initial &quot;big&quot; patch, but just wanted to make sure... killed about 150 or so more vamps yesterday, still threatening :(  Had that damn grimling runners pack for 4 months now.  Maybe tonight I'll be able to finally get dubious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's good for shamans too, because the wisdom is so high you can drop a lot of items that you're keeping on you mostly for wisdom.  There are not many alternatives out there for a shaman that come close to this shield in terms of AC and wisdom unless you are looking at stuff from NTOV or off a few highly-contested mobs.<br />
<br />
AC 25 and 20 wisdom is a very nice combination, and it even has 12 sv magic on it.  Unless you're going against fire and cold casting mobs, it's often superior to the SBS even though it has no hitpoints on it, and the crystal chitin shield isn't even close -- that shield has an AC only of what, 19?  And a wisdom of 8 or 9, which can't compare to a wisdom score of 20 at all.<br />
<br />
Not to mention it looks about 1000 times better than either one. ;)  My ogre shaman looks ridiculous with most shields on; they look like overgrown cufflinks.<br />
<br />
I sold one shield for 35k and the other traded for a value of about 30k.  <br />
<br />
It may be hard to do so consistently, though.  There are a lot of people who think that's way too much money, but they wouldn't want to have to camp the thing, either.  So you have a market which can't make up its mind on what the shield is really worth.</div></div><hr />
