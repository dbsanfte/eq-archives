<br />
Greetings to those diehards still here and the new faces...<br />
I take six months off after +3 years and nothing changes around here...<br />
<br />
Anyone remember that Top10 list from long ago<br />
that had to do with EverCrack addicts and real life?<br />
Well, I walk away and I end up finding real life...<br />
I'm tanned, weigh 60 pounds less, and riding the hell out<br />
of a steel horse that's a lot less expensive than Verant's.<br />
(Hell, a Harley costs about the same as a CrackerJack toy compared to Verant's horses.)<br />
<br />
Just wanted to stop by and say hi to some old friends...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hi Bjarni, long time no see! I remember you posting a couple years ago. Good to hear you've managed to kick the habit and are back in the real world. I'm still hooked on the game, but I've cut back on playtime a lot recently. Every new expansion gets me back into playing a lot, and I gradually lose interest until the next expansion comes out and gets me hooked all over again /sigh. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A Harley? Prefer japanese iron myself ... the sound of a 4 cylinder engine hitting 12,000 rpm - well, it's better than potato potato :)<br />
<br />
Although I must say some of Buell's recent offerings look pretty damn tasty.<br />
<br />
I find time for biking and EQ, although living in the UK, the weather quite often dictates what I do :)</div></div><hr />
