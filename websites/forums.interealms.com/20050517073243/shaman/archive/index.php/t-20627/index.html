<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">On the Drinal server warsliks wood has been trashed by horrible lag on Sony's end.  Are there any other servers having problems with the warsliks wood zone?  When I say trash I mean 3 to 5 second delays of casting spells, foraging, archery, tracking and many other skills.  Pulling a mob in this zone takes forever because they seem to run in place.  Respawn times are on the 30 minute side.  Emails, petitions and feedbacks have resulted in nothing being done.  This started happening about 5 days ago and the patch did nothing to fix it.</div></div><hr />

On Tribunal here. I haven't been in WW lately, but hate has exactly the same problem. We were up helping a friend work on her epic and finally gave up because of the problems you described. <br />
<br />
Not really an answer to your question, but it doesn't sound like an isolated incident.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">heh, actually I was in WW to help a friend with a BER twink epic and it was the same way, laggy as hell and the NPC for the epic didn't stop at his check points, just spawned his mobs and ran on.<br />
<br />
On Terris Thule, btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ditto exactly what Henora said...<br />
<br />
On Fennin Ro, btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Feerot was the same way earlier this week when I was there.  Haven't been back since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eci_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm not sure about WW here...<br />
<br />
But on the E'Ci server, the Everfrost zone is lagging about 3 seconds behind (all on Sony's end as well)....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Feerott, Everfrost, West Commons are my current avoid list, if I stay there for 15+ seconds my graphics begin to 'slur', for want of a better word, and the frame rate drops to about 1 every 4/5 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Been to Feerrott Tue night an hr after the emergency patch.<br />
Been to EC / WC Mon night.<br />
Those 3 zones seem fine to me.  Didnt notice anything different.  Think the problem is on your end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">EQDirectX9.dll working as intended!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Best theory I've heard so far is that this only happens in zones with low population.  So your BoT's and your Paludals will be just fine, while zones where people go to get away from it all are hosed to the point of being useless.<br />
<br />
I'm so glad they're making optimal use of processor time, but... um... this is retarded.  I wish they'd do some testing on someone OTHER than their monthly subscribers.  :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have spell lag of about 1 second in certain zones like Warsliks Woods, FoB, Trakanon's Teeth. Other zones, no problem.<br />
<br />
No spell lag problems before dx9 patches.</div></div><hr />

I'd probably agree with you if it was just my system. We had a group of 6 in the zone and everyone reported the same type of problems. While my wife and I share the same connection, the other 4 are spread across 4 different time zones, 2 continents and I'm sure at least 2 -3 isp's. Gotta think the problem is server side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zilansis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">had this happen last night in everfrost on sol ro.  everyone in the group was complaining about it.  there was 2-3 sec delay for doing anything in the zone,  everything was back to normal when we zoned into our adventure.</div></div><hr />
