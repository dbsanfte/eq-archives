Would a rusty dagger make any difference?  I mean, if I was gonna get some weapons, i would go and get pet some FS weapons.  But I dont since I thought it was a waste of time.  All info appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">use search....there are a ton of threads about this. Quickly though, giving your pet 2 weapons will improve his dps. Must be both primary/secondary equippable, and it will allow him to dual wield. FS or rusty, it don't matter what you give him really....the only thing that will help with dps would be any weapons that proc ie summoned mage weapons.</div></div><hr />

*waves his hand* This is not the thread you seek.  There is no pet dual wield.<br />

*waves his hand again and dissapears*<br />

<br />
actually.. if i remember correctly grizlor gave his dog a broken blam stick (whatever its called.. the super high dmg wep from mischief that has no class or race listed.. i think, its been awhile) and it increased his damage output</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">dmg/dly doesn't matter but procs do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">dmg matters only if the base damange on the wep is higher than the mac hit of our pets, which is 60. That means any items with 61+ damage increases how hard our pet can hit for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">btw, imaking a level 1 mage gives you an unlimited supply of daggers via the shared bank slot, or a second account ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">are the daggers no rent?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">yes, but norent items stay around for 15-20 minutes on a character who's logged out... they might do the same in the shared slot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't think you could put no rent items in the shared bank slot??  (got a friend with a mage and I'm pretty sure he tried this to get them on his trader)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You cannot place no drop or no rent items in the shared bank slot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>zimgrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Now....do you think giving him 2 1hs fine steel as good as 2 1hb?<br />
<br />
Zim</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">1hs 1hb 1hp 1h2h work equally well. Rusty is cheaper than fine steel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>atana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">At least give the poor things mage summoned weapons. The procs are nice. Shaman pets need all the love and help they can get :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
30 damage not 61, give dog dog some uber paly/sk 1 hander with 31+base damage and he will hit for over 60 with it.<br />
<br />
try it with a lvl1 mage/necro and some of the cheap 2 handers in the bazaar, I was loling while lvling a mage, lvl 4 mage pet hittin for 60 was sick and wrong.</div></div><hr />
