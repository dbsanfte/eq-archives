Blue to 61!!<br />
<br />
:)&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes 61 pet is nice alright.<br />
<br />
Especially with two mage summoned proc weaps/muzzle of mardu + haste/focus/PE.<br />
(and/or Avatar if the group is full Primal weaps $$).<br />
<br />
Shame lots of tanks cant position themselves so doggie doesn't get eaten on enrage in PoV/PoS.<br />
Had a mage in my group chew one out last week! heh<br />
<br />
Guess it's back to /pet back off at 10 percent life...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What muzzle of mardu please?<br />
<br />
:)&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Me not lazy troll - went and looked it up.  Can I get these items from a mag and carry around with me and use at my liesure?<br />
<br />
:)&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The summoned weaps/muzzle are norent.<br />
<br />
So if you can ambush a Mage in Nexus or somewhere and grab some, thats a bonus :)<br />
But once you log off, they poof.<br />
<br />
Also when doggy gets eaten on enrage they poof.<br />
<br />
Still pretty handy thought if you look after your doggie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just make sure to tell that damn MT in your group to position so that the pets always are behind the mob...<br />
<br />
Rogues and other melees can move easy - its harder to move the pet all the time, though its doable...<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course, watch if the enraged mob turns and flees... They do that a bit in PoP.. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Achzizra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">.. some think it's worth more than most tho.. saw someone trying to sell True Spirit off for 100kpp.. sheesh, just because it's a shaman spell doesn't mean it has to cost that much ;P~<br />
<br />
On the up side tho, new doggy is 58? Can't wait to go hunting with him some day soon =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah i've noticed a few folks selling it for around 12k on brell.. have like 10k atm and trying to offload some other equipment hehe</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Pet is still dark blue at 65.  I was playing around with it the other night while farming greens in PoD with a 65 Bst mate.  With Focus of Souls, Swift like the Wind and Primal Avatar, it was pretty much max hitting at 60 damage, whereas the Bst pet was 74 (Course with the Bst pet's haste it hit a lot more p).<br />
<br />
Also interesting to not that our pet haste buff stacks with SLTW if u can be bothered to keep topping up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The other stats stack but the haste portion doesn't. You will only get the fastest haste working which is SLTW...With Muzzle however, the haste does stack...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Buffed with celerity and Focus, he does about 15 dps to a level 60 exp mob.  Whoever claimed 30dps must have been fighting a green, or giving pet some serious items or buffs (avatar?  is it really worth it?)<br />
<br />
True spirit + celerity did a whole 7 dps against Innoruuk.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure why everyone is raving about it.  It's a nice spell, but if you're still waiting to get lucky with your parchment turn in, don't worry, you're only missing out on about 8 dps over the 55 pet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you giving your pet 2 weapons? Personally I parsed my pet out at about 40dps with 2 weapons, muzzle, VoG and FoS. This one on dark blue mobs at lvl 65 up in the wastes in PoV which are lvl 60ish.</div></div><hr />

Yes have some.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I got to see the 61 pet in action a few days ago while LFG in Seb and this big grin formed on my face while I watched. Although the fight took a while the doggy hardly took any damage, I think the shaman healed him once. Granted the entrance frogs are the lowest level in Seb but it was still fun to watch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">What is so nice is just what we can do as shaman to buff our pet:<br />
<br />
25hp per tick regen (great for faction work in Droga)<br />
544hp Focus<br />
60% Haste<br />
Alpha input<br />
<br />
Plus a nice 1300hp (1625hp with AA) 50% CH</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Crash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Was grouped with a lvl 61 mage the other night, was disappointed when my polite request for two procing summoned weapons was ignored.  Project Alpha still not very well known to others, hehe.  Used up a couple velium on him but wish I had gotten a taste of the uber mage procing weapons.  In search of cheap procing weapons I noticed Dragon Horn Ykesha in bazaar for only 25pp.  Ranger only.  Think dogdog will equip/proc it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Pet is a warrior, so best to use weapons that are either all/all, or War/all. Also keep it to 1hb, 1hp, or 1hs, as it won't equip 2hs, etc. One thing that is interesting to see, it won't matter what the damage is on a weapon, I like to spend 10pp and buy a &lt;a href=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=2665&gt;&quot;Gnoll Hide Lairat&lt;/a&gt;. Since it's only a 3/20, but pet still hits at max using it and some other 1hs/1hp, and procs the stun every now and then. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Drachen183</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Was foolin around with different proc'ing weapons i bought in the bazaar... Out of all of them i thought the dragon horn ykesha was the weakest, never EVER saw it proc, but i turned others hits on and sure enough bubba was using it and the dagger i had given him. Serrated bone dirk never really proc'ed either that i can remember, so that might lead me to believe that he may use the weapons, but if it is not warrior usable that he will not proc... just a thought, maybe i was just unlucky...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Hyurtices</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I would love a level 58 puppy, I will ding 61 late this week and keep hoping I will get the spell on a turn in but so far no luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>McLeod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I played around with some of the proccing wpns as well.  I can confirm that the Dragon Horn Ykesha and Serrated Bone Dirk will both proc.<br />
  I've seen both go off reasonably well after buffing dogdog with a dex buff (Too lazy to use focus on a pet that shouldn't be tanking anyway).  I haven't tested as many as I would like but every once in a while I find a bargain or throwaway item to let Goner play with.  Favorite is still the Gnoll Hide Lariat but bazaar prices shot up from 5-10pp to 75-90pp soon after people started seeing Project Alpha as more than just a few shaman that tested their alchemy herbs too often.<br />
Limits that I've seen are: 1-hand wpns only, ALL for the race (can't confirm but Dagger of Dropping didn't seem to work), droppable</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dagger of dropping is the one with weaken on it  right? I fed one of those to fido the other day and he proced weaken on the mobs just fine altho it didn't seem that common.</div></div><hr />
