<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bonethug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just wondering where i can go for loot and/or exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hermana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm wondering that myself!!  Without high HP gear (and high mana), places like PoV/PoS can be rough to solo.  Has anyone found any great doable exp at 65 you can solo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">pov-is root rottable (golems/razorfiends)<br />
<br />
pos-never really soloed here. i would think everything but the bees and giants should be pritty easy.<br />
<br />
bot-you might be able to do the bees in the court yard root rooting without to much trouble.<br />
<br />
hoh-zone in is root rootable, just hard to pull without adds.  AA VP, it will help when you get adds.<br />
<br />
pod/pon/poj-easy, but i am sure you know that already. some stuff is still dark blue at 65, you just need to pick the right mobs.<br />
<br />
cod-if you scroll down and read the other posts on soloing pop you will c that someone posted that this zone in is doable with a bit of effort.<br />
<br />
pot-i am not keyed but some of the high end shaman have said they can solo the pit area with some luck /shrug<br />
<br />
this is about the limit of what i know about soloing in pop.  i don't do anything without virtue on...my hp isn't high enough to deal with unforseen difficulties without it.<br />
btw i have given up soloing for parchment/rune camping in bot...it sucks and the xp sucks, but ebolt and plague aren't cutting it anymore so i need my upgrades to go with bane and pox.</div></div><hr />
