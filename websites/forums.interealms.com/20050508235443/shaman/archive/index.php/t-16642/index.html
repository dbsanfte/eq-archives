<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valdak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since discovering this forum some months ago I have found it to be a wealth useful and helpful information.  I have also noticed a trend recently, especially the past month or so, by a few posters to be overly harsh and even rude to the point of being useless in the criticism of some of the posts.  Many of you have knowledge of the game and the shaman class that makes this board one of the best I have seen and makes it a pleasure to learn from.  Some of you however seem to take great pleasure in demeaning and downgrading every post you can.  Everyone at some point was new to this game and new to the shaman class and I personally don’t see any reason for calling someone a “n00b” or an “idiot” for asking a question.  There is going to be duplication of questions, there are going to be those that don’t see the answer they are looking for before they post something but hey, give us all a break and lighten up on the sarcasm and name calling.  I don’t know whether the few I am referring to have maxed their levels and are frustrated, or if they suffer from extended exposure to the full moon but if you can’t post something constructive then don’t post.      <br />
I do not post often, and I am posting this with the full knowledge that it will probably be flamed to death but since I really don’t care about that, flame away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do I hold much pity for those who obviously didn't bother to take the time to do a simple search, or even scan the list of topics on page one?<br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
There's also going to be little tolerance for anything perceived as whining, or &quot;experts&quot; from other classes telling us how to play a shaman.  Apart from that, I think the community here is remarkably civil for a netboard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Valdak, you are absolutely right in your measure of the forum.  It is at once one of the most useful EQ player information forums AND a gathering place of  priggish jerks.  I would assume that they have serious personality disorders and have been the target of playground bullies. <br />
<br />
Ask your questions.  Take your flames. Get your answers and know that most of the jerks are dateless on saturday night.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have to assume that the people who say &quot;go do a search&quot; have never used the search function here at Shaman's Crucible. Don't know what I'm talking about? Go try searching for the following, all of which seem reasonable on a shaman forum:<br />
<br />
SoW potion<br />
RC3<br />
CoM epic<br />
MGB<br />
PoP spells<br />
AA 60 or 65<br />
<br />
This list could go on, and is why people are forced to post the same questions over and over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">SoW potion - try alchemy instead<br />
RC3 - Radiant?<br />
CoM epic - how bout just epic? or Rak, or Neh<br />
MGB - Group Buff?<br />
PoP spells - Whole forum dedicated to spells <br />
AA 60 or 65 Alternate skills?<br />
<br />
There are plenty of ways, if people make the effort, and use a little of the grey matter. The info is there for the taking. By asking the question, without making any effort at all, if expecting others to drop what ever they may be doing just to help answer the same question repeatedly.<br />
<br />
Courtesy goes both ways on things like this. Understand this is more than likely still backlash from when there were 3-5 seperate posts on the front page about &quot;Which race is best for being a shammy&quot; and the &quot;Best Duo Partner&quot; and lets not forget the other favorite post &quot;How to make money??&quot;<br />
<br />
That respect goes both ways. Know I spent months as a lurker finding the information I was after, before I ever even made an account to make my first post.<br />

TOLD!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
     I don't see why people get SOOOO pissed when somone asks a question that has already been answered.  I must confess I think is is pretty fun telling people about your different findings and experiances.  I also like getting the opinions of the other players when I ask a question.  If you see a &quot;What class should I be?&quot; or a &quot;Who should I duo with?&quot; post, and you feel you heart reate increase and you blood begin to boil.  Just ignore it and kill a cleric in PvP, you will feel much better  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Visiting this board isn't a social experience for me, it's an information-gathering one.  There are quite a few people who come here to post new things they've seen, figured out, or have to ask.  I like to keep pace with those because I find them very interesting.<br />
<br />
When I see a question that I've seen previously answered... multiple times... I'll suggest the search function.  Call it a compulsion toward trying to make everything neat and tidy.  No, I don't feel the need to brutalize someone while I do it.  But I don't feel the need to pander to these people who are too lazy to USE the features that the Crucible webadmin has gone to SUCH LENGTHS to implement.  It's laziness.  Nothing more.  The search function works.  It works well.  I have never failed to find what I was looking for with it, though I may have had to try more than one string of words.<br />
<br />
By suggesting that someone use search, I am giving them credit.  I am assuming that they are merely lazy (in that they didn't bother to search) instead of stupid (unable to use a simple search tool).<br />
<br />
I'm a lot less offended by people talking trash to these search-averse lazy folk than I am by the mentality of &quot;Screw you for telling me to use search, you pompous prick.  I came here to post my question and receive the instant gratification that I've come to expect.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Corbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The search feature is nice but because EQ is ever changing you can get outdated info. Even info posted a day ago could have changed due to a patch or players found an even better method than the previous post. I like to see new threads even if they are similar to somthing that has been asked a million times. I even like to read the flames and bs posts from other classes.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What's the big deal about someone asking a duplicate question?  If you see a topic you're not interested in, skip it.  <br />
<br />
Like someone else already said, EQ changes constantly and the answer from last week may not be correct anymore.  Or maybe the person read the answer and wanted a second opinion.  Who cares?  It's not like I'm being charged for each post I read. :p <br />
<br />
Lighten up people.  This is a casual forum to discuss a game we all have a load of fun playing.  <br />

<br />
For those of us that have been around a while, the 'whiners' and 'trolls' here now are nothing but pale immitations of people of old.. Tuda and Eudin spring to mind immediately.<br />
<br />
As with any 'public' forum, one must always have a certain level of tolerance towards others who exist to either intentionally cuase grief to people, or chose to believe thiers is the only opinion that matters.<br />
<br />
Over the years, this site has been, and still remains, the best place for getting information about not only shamans, but for EQ in general.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
No one is asking anyone to drop what they are doing to reply to a post.  If people see a post as a personal request for help, they have a serious mental disorder and need to seek help now.<br />
<br />
I have been a member of the SK boards, and those guys are rude just to be rude.  It is their form of humor.  I don't see this board being humerous about the &quot;search plz k thxz&quot; posts.<br />
<br />
If you can't say something nice, how about not posting?  The kicker is when I see posts from people here that just say that they don't know.  OMG!  Why are you posting?!  If you don't know, skip it.  Your post count is not really that important, is it?<br />
<br />
Some people are search challenged, some people try to search and get way too much fluff to wade through.  Keep this in mind, &quot;k thxz.&quot;<br />
<br />
Personally, I could give a rat's-ass about flaming people for not searching or lame posts like &quot;D00dz how me get Uber l33t lootz quick?&quot; But, you flamers, do not make up lame reasons for acting the way you do.  Tell them the truth.  That you flame them because they are &quot; 'f'ing lame&quot;, and you need to feel better about yourself.  If that wasn't true, then why would you post the flame?<br />
<br />
See, now I feel better about myself and can go back to work and be productive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Got to agree with you but all I'll say is you soon get to know which posters to ignore and which ones to pay attention to.Im naming no names though.<br />
What really makes me wonder about people who read a post entitled example &quot;help with sow potions pls&quot; and then they post USE SEARCH.<br />
My question to these people is WHY READ THE POST IN THE FIRST PLACE ?<br />
Are you the sort of people who when you see a sign saying Warning Hot do you touch it just to make sure the sign is correct or is it the fact that by posting Use search you somehow feel superior ?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You see a thread that reads &quot;Need help plz&quot;<br />
You open the thread and read..<br />
<br />
How do you make sow potions?<br />
What are the triveal at?<br />
Can I sell them for mega plat?<br />
<br />
Now toss in the fact that people have seen these very same questions at least 20 times in the last 6 mounths and it gets real old real fast. When a simple click of search would have answered all of these questions in about 30 seconds each and every time its been posted by someone new.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The crucible search function has some major flaws.<br />
Sometime its hard to get the info you want.<br />
But before asking a question you should do a search</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Search is cool, but by talking about things you can end up opening a dialogue that will not only answer your question, but answer multiple questions and begin a alliance with soemone on your server. <br />
<br />
To no talk and always use the search function is like saying you should never talk to anyone in real life because we have google.com. <br />
<br />
Its simply a more intellctualy enriching experience to talk to another human. Imean in truth, if you already know the answer and are sick of answering it, is it really that hard to just NOT post or to politly suggest the search feature if not one else is replying to them?<br />
<br />
Thats my angle anyway</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The signal to noise ratio of this board is still FAR below most other EQ boards.. much to the credit of Sun and the mods.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think you mean the signal to noise ratio is ABOVE most other EQ boards.  Higher signal to noise == more good information.<br />
<br />
I agree with both sides - yes, there are some lazy questions.  Yes, there are some rude answers.  Yes, overall, there's good information.<br />
<br />
What you have to realize is that some of us have been reading this board for years.  The 1000th time you see a &quot;what race is best&quot; post it really does get kind of annoying.  That doesn't excuse rudeness, but it does explain it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>peleg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">This board is so calm and polite compared to our server board.  Hell, I post and read here to get away from the nonstop trashfest that are the Xev Server boards.  <br />
