But you people who give a rats a** about Yantis never cease to amaze me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just dont like the way he buys out sites, like monkly business &amp; EQShaman. I couldnt give a druid about what he does other than that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ormis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So given the choice of MonklyBusiness disappearing almost completely due to the tons of popups they were going to be subjected to (which it was going to do since they had nowhere near the contributions they needed) or Yantis fronting the ~$5K they needed, posting a *small* text ad for mysupersales.com, and keeping it open you would choose the former?<br />
<br />
Interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">After a couple pages . . it still doesn't seem like an April Fools joke.  Seems like piracy.  <br />
<br />
Yantis also removed an entire section of the Lanys boards, banned the head moderator, and several others immediately.  <br />
<br />
I can't see this as a good thing, sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ormis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's a *joke*<br />
<br />
You don't give up your joke after a few hours on April 1.  You give it up April 2.<br />
<br />
The garish banners at the top and bottom?  The music in the threads?  You actually take this seriously?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">And whatever you do, dont click the bottom banner...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This is quite an April Fools joke.  It is well into April 2 and they still haven't changed it back.  <br />
<br />
I do like the gnomes only forums though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">So given the choice of MonklyBusiness disappearing almost completely due to the tons of popups they were going to be subjected to (which it was going to do since they had nowhere near the contributions they needed) or Yantis fronting the ~$5K they needed, posting a *small* text ad for mysupersales.com, and keeping it open you would choose the former?<br />
<br />
Is this a trick question?</div></div><hr />
