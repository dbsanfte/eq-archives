<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I posted part of this in the &quot;are shaman balanced section&quot; but I think this question deserves its own post.<br />
<br />
Would increasing Shaman melee power be a good idea?<br />
<br />
Personally, I not only think that it is a good idea but also an appropriate fix to our raid stacking issue and in those experience camps where we have plenty of healing and are faced with a very resistent mob.<br />
<br />
The higher level you are and the harder camps/raids you are on the more hopeless the situation is.  I have founds that all our poison nukes are resisted in these situations and maybe, maybe our cold nukes might land every once in a while.<br />
<br />
Now, the $100 question has always been how can you jack up shaman melee damage so that it is not unbalancing. I suggest that giving us a way to contribute in those oddball situations is not overpowering.   Would it make us better soloers? Yes, but soloing is boring, boring, boring.....not very safe, not better experience any more and not particularly lucrative (a nice drop in a group is better than the hundreds of pp items you get in solo play).  In short way overrated and LDON has NO solo content as we all know - thank goodness.<br />
<br />
NOW is the time to jack up shaman melee ability - since soloing has been nerfed all the heck (which in case you have not figured out I'm happy about since this is supposed to be a social game).  I didn't make a shaman to melee, but I think that this is a situational use and one that frankly has a few benefits.  #1, it makes getting a good primary weapon a must (something to look forward to - fun). #2 Lets face it, its enjoyable to melee every once in a while. #3 strategy, this game is dummied up enough all ready...I welcome a chance to have to make a strategic decision to melee or to cast.<br />
<br />
I also suggest that this problem is a level 65 problem so any fixes should only relate to that level.  A easy solution I would think is to introduce a new aa which can be trained at 65 which would give us perma rabid bear (without that stupid bear form).  I would then suggest changing the recast reducer aa into a dps enhancer.  Just keep the melee damage below what a shaman can generate with his spells under a normal resistent mob and we are good to go.<br />
<br />
Impliment this and add in raid shrink and I have solved most of our issues and not created a &quot;superclass&quot; that is unbalancing.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You really want to melee so bad ... well ... go make a melee char.  There are alot of other things that could be fixed before considering improving shaman melee abilities.<br />
<br />
Making it so you can shrink other groups within a raid would be a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Korbis Catchaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ok, here are my views.<br />
<br />
If/when the shaman class is looked at for improvement, they will do something, and move on to the next class. They don't do a lot of trial and error and fine tuning. You get what you're served, and a few expansions later, you might get looked at again. <br />
<br />
You're asking for this precious evaluation to yield mediocre melee ability rather than something actually useful to the class. Me, I have no strong opinions as to what shamans should have added, but I would think something such as a self only hate reducer buff or maybe AA to make partially slow resistant mobs more vulnerable to slow. I personally can't imagine ever wanting to melee. I did 65 levels and 92 AA as a monk and don't want to return to the joys of autoattack anytime soon.<br />
<br />
It sounds like you want to melee rather than cast. Reroll. Your example problem is resists making it hard for shamans to provide dps on raid mobs. Why not ask for something like a self only buff that increases likelyness of our dots to land, or just straight up modifying the resist check on our damage spells? It doesn't make sense to throw everything the class has out the window and replace it with the ability to melee to fix the resist problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you want melee just go grab a good 2hb and farm a lower level dungeon and get it out of your system :) <br />
<br />
I think the closest many people on this board have agreed on is the need for a hate reducer of some sort to couteract our dot aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You guys are so flip floppy it isn't even funny.  The number one complaint about our AAs on this board is how crappy rabid bear is but when someone comes up with a decent idea to up our melee a little you guys tell him to go play a melee.  Pretty lame imo.<br />
<br />
Shaman need something to make it more fun for the majority of shaman.  Melee would be one of those, better nukes could be another, etc.  Being able to shrink people out of group would not be one of those things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">no, a very vocal minority post a lot about how crappy rabid bear is.  That does not make it our number one complaint.  Many of us could not care less.<br />
<br />
I do not play a shaman to melee.<br />
<br />
Meleeing sometimes is fun, and I will do it if I feel like it, but shaman are priests.  We are not casters, we are not melee, we are priests.. we are shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There's no reason shaman can't have double attack at 200 or 150 or so.  This should be true of all casters, including the int caster.  A 65 wiz should be able to melee down some lower creatures.  <br />
<br />
We're still not going to melee anything that means anything.  I'd rather have that then change poison dot aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Onte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You know, quit the griping.  I can sit in PoT for 10 minutes and get 5 group invites; I have no guild, no rep. and I'm only 62, so if something is wrong with shaman, this is news to me because I ain't exactly getting groups based upon my lovely, lovely personality, k?  The only thing glaringly WRONG with the class is that we have to group with someone to shrink them and that was already mentioned above my post.  You get weapons skills maxed at 200 and you're griping for more?  You can heal a Tier 3 group and CONTROL THEIR DAY and you're griping for MORE?  You can solo even, yellow and red cons and you're griping for more??  <br />
<br />
#3 strategy, this game is dummied up enough all ready...I welcome a chance to have to make a strategic decision to melee or to cast. <br />
<br />
This is called &quot;Am I at 85% or so mana?  Yes?  Then I shall melee!!!&quot;  There's no strategy in deciding whether or not to add your weenie dps.  If you're at near to full mana and want to do something other than med, you either find more crap to cast on the mob or you melee.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I wouldn't mind an AE malos along with raid shrinkage.<br />
<br />
It's all about options and playability though.  If some folks want to melee - they can have the option, and I respect that wish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">LOL, you know I had hoped that this board had evolved some over the past few years into a forum for thoughtful discussion.  But, that evidently not being the case lets get a few things straight.<br />
<br />
I have no wish to melee.<br />
<br />
If you can think of another way to address stackability on raids or dps in experience groups on resistant mobs that is not unbalancing I am all ears.<br />
<br />
In response to the level 62 shaman who theoretically plays in bot, I want to be kind so I suggest that he has just doesn't understand how much mana a well equiped 200aa shaman has.  Well, I have news for you my friend, said shaman can not only be the only healer in BOT group and only slower in group but he will still be FM all the time!!  I'm talking about even a worse case and thats having a cleric in the group.  Now what do you do in (lets say North) where ALL your spells bounce?  Read the paper? Might as well because your 200 pts of melee damage (or 500 or whatever you could possibly throw out now) during the fight isn't worth hitting the attack button.<br />
<br />
My only reason to suggest melee damage is that sometimes that is the ONLY way to do damage.  And again to above 62 shaman why do I care? I care because I don't like being dead weight in groups.<br />
<br />
Respectfully yours,<br />
<br />
Purdypog<br />
<br />
PS: Obviously adding bane type spells would do the same thing.  I just think that the added playability factor of taking a few wacks at a mob is a better and more simple solution and has a higher probablility of being implimented by Sony than bane spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shazzog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">NOW is the time to jack up shaman melee ability - since soloing has been nerfed all the heck (which in case you have not figured out I'm happy about since this is supposed to be a social game).  <br />
<br />
<br />
I'd love to see my melee get better, but I'm not losing sleep or hair over it. Like many others, I'd far rather see some of my spells like Shrink get adjusted so they were more usefull.<br />
<br />
There, that's out of the way.<br />
<br />
Now...<br />
<br />
I always have to laugh everytime some bright genius claims people shouldn't solo because this is supposed to be a multiplyer game and soloing isn't social.<br />
<br />
I used to solo pretty much exclusively. You say I wasn't being social?<br />
<br />
On the average night, I would wander over and buff a few dozen people in the zones I passed through. I'd jump in and help save the asses of a few groups or other individuals. Hell, it was for that ability (plus the ability to solo) that I made a Shaman to begin with.<br />
<br />
Others would jump in and help save my ass. In all cases, I am chatting with everyone I know, and everyone I meet.<br />
<br />
You, Mr. Social Grouper, probably don't interact with anyone outside your group. You can't head over and help someone running into trouble, because your group of 5 other people are expecting you to be there for their buffs and slows.<br />
<br />
When that guy you helped three days ago asks you to come recover his corpse on the moon, you can't...you are too busy at your static camp.<br />
<br />
That great Enchanter who always gives you free KEI now because he saw you getting way too many adds one day and stepped in to mez, and you became friends while chatting? You didn't meet him. <br />
<br />
Now, of course, I hardly ever *get* to solo. My guild members found out that showing up where I was camping meant easy XP and loot. This is especially true now that I dual box a cleric (Epic as of this weekend, woot!)<br />
<br />
Of course, now I have to institute a new rule: &quot;Thou shalt not bitch when the Shaman and Cleric head off for 15 minutes on a Rez Run. Thou shalt pull or sit on thine asses while they are gone, as you choose, but thou shall not bitch.&quot;<br />
<br />
(In fairness, my guild members and friends have never, ever bitched about lost time due to rez or buff runs...but I expect them to happen a lot more now that the cleric has his epic, and I should probably make sure they understand that I *am* going to have people drag to us for Rez, or go chasing across several zones with little or no notice)<br />
<br />
Yeah, I'm such an unsocial bastard, playing EQ like a single player game. Idiot.<br />
<br />
Having said that...since when was soloing nerfed? I solo just fine still, whenever my guild is off doing something else. The Cleric mostly just takes my shaman's place as Tank when I solo...so dual boxing doesn't really change what I can do, and I haven't noticed a difference.<br />
<br />
I still get just as much experience solo as I do with an average group (even when I am not dual boxing)<br />
<br />
I'm kind of bummed LDoN will require a minimum of 4 people, but SOE said they may adjust that later. We will see. If not, that's okay...I can solo\dual in pretty much any standard zone, so no big deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">In no way shape or form will they ever increase your ability to melee.  You already have some of the most powerful tools in arsenal of any class in the game.  You get the best slows, the best debuffs, DOTs that are at the top of the line, Some of the best heal over times, the best self mana regeneration, the best regeneration, some of the best resists.<br />
<br />
If you want to play a shaman and melee go ahead, but increasing the dmg output via combat skills is not a characteristic of this class and never should be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The one valid arguement I can see for increasing our melee damage is that we are supposed to be the battle priests. Theoretically, we *should* be better at melee than clerics. My cleric is actually probably better than my shaman.<br />
<br />
Still, as you point out, we have awesome damage capability with our DoTs. Combined with our ability to buff everything except Wis and Int, and our ability to vastly decrease the mob's damage output, and we really don't *need* better melee.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hi friends,<br />
<br />
Oh, I have no problems with folks soloing, maybe I didn't make that clear.  I just personally think that it is boring and there isn't a experience gain or loot advantage any more.  It's a relative nerf, not an absolute one.<br />
<br />
My issue with soloing was when you could get both better experience and loot.  And it wasn't because I was envious of soloers, it was  because Sony could and would not address our dps issues on raids and on resistent mobs - because it would overpower our solo ability.<br />
<br />
Heck, I'm a huge proponent of class balance, mix and match groups, etc. I am not suggesting creating a &quot;superclass&quot;, far from it I am attempting to address a few of the minor concerns that most folks on this forum have agreed are issues.  Raid stacking being #1.  I threw out the experience group resistent mob issue as a problem that I have faced a lot the past few months when there is a cleric in the group.<br />
<br />
Again, my purpose is thoughtful discussion, not &quot;you are a melee wanna be&quot; or &quot;shaman are good already&quot;.<br />

I hear ya, brother. I say we boycott, and refuse to buff anyone until SOE addresses this burning need. Who's with me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just wanted to add... I was a cleric when the cleric melee changes (ie: The Hammer) went in... most clerics wanted a melee increase... and eventually they got it... and many may disagree but that hammer is damn fun... it's damn fun to hit attack every now and then and see damage fly out.<br />
<br />
I got that hammer from the King in droga last night... the 179 proc hammer... about the only way I do any decent melee dps is through procs.<br />
<br />
I was hasted, ferine avatar, and had my current max dex of 280.  I got 1 proc the first fight, 3 the second, and 3 the third.    This wasn't an uber dps group, the fight lasted about 1-1.5 mins each... swinging hasted with a 20 dly weapon and max dex.  I know how procs work in general... some fights I might do 2000 damage in procs cause the random number gods are with me, and other times I won't break out even one proc.<br />
<br />
The cleric in the group was swinging... and I swear procced 20 times in that same fight.<br />
<br />
Anyhow... my point... cleric didn't expect to get a melee upgrade, but did... will we?  I dunno... but if we got one... even a rabid bear upgrade... I'd love it, and I'd have fun with it.  Do we *need* it?   No... I don't think so... but sure would be fun.   <br />
<br />
Hell give all the priests a version of the cleric hammer... it's the only thing I miss from my cleric.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dude, how are you, me or any other shaman out there a dead weight in a group?  Seriously, level 1 to level 65, how is a shaman a dead weight in a group?  Unless the player is a complete and total retard who should have at least bought a gimpy &quot;Official Everquest Players Guide&quot; at BestBuy, no shaman is EVER a dead weight in a group.  Only time a shaman is dead weight is when they've got no mana because they've been meleeing.<br />
<br />
Balancing THIS class will be the byproduct of balancing other classes.  How about warrior taunt?  Think an improved warrior taunt would help with our DoT / Cripplah / Turgur's agro?  Or would you rather have some wack version of wizard Concussion?  I think I'd rather have warriors balanced than yet another spell gem to occupy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Meryll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">This doesn't answer your question but I don't see why people talk about stackability on raids? I'm in an elemental guild, usually 3-4 shm on raids... sometimes up to 6 of us on a major flag/loot mob like Xeg or Fen. I never run out of things to do ... if i'm not on malos/turg then I can do buffs, or nukes, or dots (if i'm careful with agro), spot heals on RT or other ramp targets, spot heals on CC teams or OffTankers.<br />
<br />
As regards melee.. sure extra melee skills might be nice (I still have an unfilled ambition to get a killing melee blow on a major named mob, VT or up) but arent a major concern for me.. despite my attempts to bid on every piece of vengeance gear that shms can =P  AAs or whatever that gave us mgb shrink, ae malos, or agro-reduction would be something i'd take over melee increases.<br />
Other than maybe a minor increase to RB I don't foresee SOE adding anything to our melee abilities though.</div></div><hr />

Well, we're FINALLY doing HoT and old world planes. Last raid to Fear I took my Warrior, we already had 6 Shaman. As Warrior (Not involved in tanking duties), I could not reach mob half the time because of all the priests that were in the way poking and swinging their uber 4-9DPS melee. I know that you learn proper tactics as you gain more experience, but if it's hard to reach a golem in Fear because Priests are in the way meleeing, isn't it hard in Elementals/Time for the same reason ie. overcrowding?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why not? I meleed my way up to 55 (when I got a JBB), at least when I solo'd. Why shouldn't it be viable at higher lvls? <br />
<br />
What would be unbalancing if a shaman could do 40DPS melee damage? Unless the mob is immune to Poison, Cold, Disease (and magic with the new dot) it's never efficient to melee but at least it can be fun. ... and with rabid bear they have the mechanism in place for it, it just needs to be tuned to where it isn't worthless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why don't you have a rep?<br />
<br />
You honestly think having a weapon skill maxxed 25 points more than the clerics/druids is so uber? lol.  Every class has their part to play in that &quot;control the day&quot; scenario.  Sure we can solo even cons, even some yellow if your somewhat bold, but those are in limited areas, that more than a few other classes can solo, or even quad.<br />
<br />
I don't really care too tremendously about melee itself, although I would dearly like rabid bear to get &quot;fixed&quot;, I would prefer our Dodge cap to be raised.  Though I could see a double attack of 150 maybe, although a shaman could still outdo the dps with other means, it would add an old element back to the shaman.  Anyone remember prekunark and wading into the fight toe to toe with a gatorsmash? :)<br />
<br />
btw Wildaar, take a look at necro dots if you want to see top of the line.  Blood of Thule, Funeral pyre, among others.  Best regen, I do believe druids share the same spell, Blessing of Replenishment, so tied.  Clerics have the HOT area, and druids even have spirit of wood, although Q may be the cheapest of them.  The only resist we can buff better than anyone is the dr/pr, which each type of class can buff best, like druids and fr/cr, and enchanters MR.  Dunno about you since you play a bst now, but I never buff resists except mr on occasion unless a raid called for dr/pr specifically.<br />
<br />
Not to say your wrong per se, but you neglect to point out the details that are behind those.  We are essentially balanced, but its not all roses and perfume, but its not all bad either.</div></div><hr />

  I can oblige!  &quot;You see, when you slow the mob, you are actually slowing TIME! Therefor, getting in WAY MORE MELEE ROUNDS THAN *ANY* OTHER CLASS!&quot;<br />
<br />
 Sorry caps lock :P<br />
<br />
  Well it IS true that its a waste of DPS to be meleeing when you can be Dotting/nuking whatnot, but I think Purdy's original point is, what about camps in an exp group where you can't touch the mob with dots / cold nukes, such as some BoT Camps? its even further compounded when theres a cleric, then your ONLY job(and contribution) is slowing, thats it..<br />
<br />
  I think this is already addressed tho, with our new DoT being magic based if I remember right.  I'll test it when LDON comes out tomorrow, if I can even get on, we all know how new expansion days go.....<br />

  Is this what you were asking Purdy??</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Anyone remember what the rage line of spells was like before they nerfed it into what it is now?  I want a line of spells similar in idea to how that worked.  For those that don't know, what the original rage line of spells did was give you some major regeneration at the cost of mana.  Like, at level 49, you'd have about 10 regen from chloroplast, but if you popped rage you'd get an extra 40 regen as long as the buff is up.  What you could do is blow your mana on a mob by dots etc, and when you are going oom, rage and then melee while the regen keeps you healthy until the mobs are dead.  You are 100% at the end, but healthy and then you wince back the mana.  I was doing that at level 19 or 24 when I got the first rage spell, and still used it on occation at 50+.<br />
<br />
If you want better melee ability, I'd like to see something similar done.  As an idea, change the rage line of spells to be like a Yaulp spell that gives you 150 double attack skill or gives you some kind of good proc buff, but silences you while it's up.<br />
<br />
Rabid bear is just plain bad.  Remove the gimp str and dex and remove the attk bonus that rabid bear gives.  We can already do that.  Give rabid bear a +200 double attack skill mod, +50 to weapon skills mod, and 25% stackable haste buff.</div></div><hr />

Your spells greyed out for about 4 ticks.<br />
Afterwards you could cast spells, but you were generally oom before then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Melee potential is not the issue. The issue is DPS potential. Right now sony has given us 3 routes for DPS.<br />
<br />
Nukes - Our nukes suck. After level 60 a shaman is lucky if his nuke takes more than 5% out of an exp mob.<br />
<br />
Rains - Great damage but highly situational use. Chain casting two rains can do immense damage, but at the same time breaks mezzes, aggro's mobs with clipping errors, and gets monsters pissed at you if they aren't being offtanked.<br />
<br />
DoTs - The problem with these is obvious. Today during a raid we were going to engage an unslowable mob and we had more than enough Clerics and druids for healing. Plus, a mage had given me a BA4 bracer, so I decided to have some fun. Bad idea. Our main tank at the time was using a blade of carnage and Scepter of Destruction combo, pretty darn good for holding aggro. I waited until 80% of the life of the mob remained (which took at least 60 seconds), cast Bane of Nife and Blood of saryrn, when they faded I refreshed.... and boom aggro off of main tank, quad quad quad splat.<br />
<br />
We need a viable way of contributing DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">What is the the fascination with being able to hit something with a weapon as opposed to hitting with a spell?  Holy crap, do the yellow melee numbers make the game seem funner somehow?  <br />
<br />
It seems like the people arguing for better melee don't even care if its less efficient then spells.  If you care so little about efficiency why can't you just be happy with the melee capabilities we have now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Glimugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I'm always meleeing my shammy, and doing quite well at it. Hell, for that matter, he does as well as my war does, all abilities included. Ok, the melee dps is lacking a little when compared to a ranger or rogue, but so what? If you want melee damage, go make yourself a war, pal, sk, rgr, monk or rog and then when I say &quot;shaman LFG&quot; you can send me a tell. We do so much so well, I feel bad for the other classes because they aren't as much fun to play. We buff, we heal, we have pets, we dot, we solo, we are IN DEMAND for groups, we got we got. Nobody else has our versatility. Ok, druids can heal a little better, so what, can they max your stats too? Necros dot better and have pets, they don't heal well at all, much less buff you. Clerics can melee, heal and buff too, can they slow that quadmonster down one iota? You get my point. <br />
<br />
EQ has one advantage in that you can play more than one toon. If your not happy with what you have or are jealous of what someone else has, go try them out for awhile. This is a group based game so they won't be making any omniclasses anytime soon. Get used to it<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">no, a very vocal minority post a lot about how crappy rabid bear is.  That does not make it our number one complaint.  Many of us could not care less.<br />
<br />
Slurm, you are so wrong.  Check out this poll I ran: http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=15165&amp;highlight=rabid+bear<br />
<br />
The vast majority of shamans don't care about rabid bear because it is, in fact, crap.  The developers surely had something in mind when they put it in.  The intention must have been to increase the melee capability of shamans in a limited way.  The problem is that it is way to limited to be useful, or more importantly, fun.<br />
<br />
A useable, fun, rabid bear would go a long way towards addressing shaman concerns regarding melee output.  No, shamans shouldn't be a melee class, we have so many other abilities.  But, stackability issues, dps issues, and just plain fun issues argue that something should be done.  Fixing rabid bear would be very helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">If a Shaman could pop out 40-50 DPS purely melee damage on xp mobs, then yes that would in fact cause balance problems.  <br />
<br />
Some mobs resist poison, some resist disease, some cold... with LDoN we also have magic resist based DPS.  How many mobs resist all of those so badly that you can't pop a few DoTs, Nukes, or Rains onto them after already contributing significantly to the group via Slows, Buffs, Heals, Debuffs?  We're a support class, DPS is a bonus.<br />
<br />
Consider the mobs that Poison and Magic land on.  Say you pop a Blood of Saryrn then follow up with the new Bane.  You're doing 740/tick for the next 5 ticks.  That's 120 DPS right there.  You think you NEED to be able to do 40-50 DPS from pure melee on top of that?  That's not factoring that you also are probably slowing, debuffing, and buffing.  <br />
<br />
Believe it or not... shaman aren't the only ones that have certain areas/mobs that they have problems contributing significant DPS against.  However, we do have a lot of other abilities that allow us to contribute to a group/raid without doing any DPS at all.<br />
<br />
You want to be able to contribute melee DPS against resistant mobs?  Alpha Pet.  VERY few mobs are resistant to both Poison and Ice, so chance are you'll be able to nuke/rain/DoT the vast majority of mobs on top of sending in your pet.  Cast FA on all the melee in your group and keep it up, there's another way for you to add melee DPS indirectly.<br />
<br />
In short, if you think your shaman is unable to contribute significantly to a group, chances are you just aren't looking at you spellbook closely enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">One thing I will agree on is that Rabid Bear sucks considering the duration and refresh, even with hastened rabidity.  But then again lots if not all classes have some crap for class AAs and it's certainly not completely useless, just something that's not worth bothering with until you've gotten a LOT of other AAs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What about our pet?<br />
<br />
Has anyone parsed the dps of our alpha 61 pet? Maybe that is what we should be considering our &quot;Melee damage&quot;. <br />
<br />
I think my dog was doing about 28dps or so against xp mobs in PoV, but I don't recall for sure. I remember thinking it funny that my pet was doing more dps than the level 62 paladin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">That's exactly my point Thual.  If you could do 40-50 DPS from pure melee and your pet could do 30+ DPS against xp mobs and on top of that you have Bane and Blood of Thule which stack for 120+ DPS...  Well, do the math.  Now you have shaman with the potential to crank out around 200 DPS for sustained periods of time on top of all of our other abilities.  That is unbalanced IMO.<br />
<br />
EDIT: 200 DPS for sustained periods of time with little effort even.  With a nuke or two thrown in for good measure it would be quite easy for a shaman to top that 200 DPS figure and STILL slow everything and keep the whole group buffed with Focus, STA, FA on melees, and even haste if necessary.  That's overboard if you ask me.</div></div><hr />
