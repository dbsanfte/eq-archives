<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just posting this to warn people trying to take him down. The past two nights the zone crashed when he was at 97% health...very annoying to say the least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not sure if you got the same problem but we have been experiencing a annoying  &quot;lag bug&quot; since DoN was released ( or so). <br />
<br />
Chat channels work but zone is so lagged up that players AND mobs virtually stand there frozen in time. After 5-10 mins lag dissapears, but mostly the zone just crashes. We had that happen twice in phase 5 in time and another time while raiding Zum'Muram Volkana in RDoC. Annoyin to say at least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, all bow down before my might!<br />
<br />
Anyway, this is the same bug many bosses/zones are having since DoN's release, and actually it happened before the release a couple times in Luclin zones. Once on the way to fight Seru, the zone lagged out and I was the only person that didn't actually go LD. Even my brother went LD and we're using the same router.</div></div><hr />
