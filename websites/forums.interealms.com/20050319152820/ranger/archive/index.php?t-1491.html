<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nitefox</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is the contest on the Steve &amp; DC radio show that calls for people to have famous persons call into the show on their behalf.  The winner of the best call get's $1000, cruise for 2, and a Sony home entertainment system.<br />
<br />
So who here know's someone famous?  <br />
<br />
Me, I don't know anyone famous.  I know a lot of people that know famous folk though.  My neighbor's wife sister used to date a guy from N'SYNC.  Also, my Sunday school teacher went to college and graduated with Bill Clinton.  I've asked him if he could give ole Bill a call and see if he would call the show on my behalf.  I figure if I pulled that off, I'd be a shoe in to win.<br />
<br />
Anyone?</div></div><hr />

<br />
A good friend and former neighbor's daughter goes to school with Steve Buscemi's daughter.<br />
<br />
Another good friend works in LA on the Paramount website.  She used to work directly for Robert Guillaume's wife.<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't have famous friends, but I can get you a celebrity.</div></div><hr />

Haha, that's insane.  I went to college with Luke Gygax.  Just for a year, since he was a senior when I was a freshman, but that's just random.<br />
<br />
Edit<br />
Maybe we should play 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon...connecting the gladers by people they know.  :p</div></div><hr />

I did escort duty for a few &quot;name&quot; actors at a few science fiction conventions (and for a local theater company) years ago.  Come to think of it, most of them are so long retired or dead I doubt I could get them to call even if I had a way to contact them.</div></div><hr />

That's pretty unusual for someone well-known who plays EQ.<br />

But then, I can't be that surprised... he runs a wargame publishing company and his email is on the site.  Cool guy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I went to school with Alyssa Milano.  She was in my 6th grade class for a half a year until she left to do &quot;Who's the Boss&quot;.  All I remember about her was she was super quiet.  <br />
<br />
Ricky Shcroeder also went to my school for awhile till he did Silver Spoons.  A couple of friends of mine knew him but didnt like him all that much /shrug.  I never really knew him other than to see him in the hallways.<br />
<br />
Neither of them &quot;know&quot; me.  Although I could probably chat with them over our dorky teachers  =)</div></div><hr />

Same here. I grouped with him when I was REAL low level. Him and I used to bust up BlackBurrow. The name Scythehands always stuck out in my mind. I also remember your name because I had just found out like THAT day what Roshambo was and then I saw you running around with that name. <br />

Good times....</div></div><hr />

Doubt any celebrities would remember me personally.  Only person who probably would be Joe Satriani.  I spoke with him on multiple instances through instant messages when I worked for AOL (and yeah, it was him).  Really cool guy.

I've corresponded with RA Salvatore through e-mail a few times.<br />
<br />
Sir Ian McKellan responded to me once as well.<br />
<br />
*shrug*<br />
<br />
None of the cute female celebrities I've tried to contact ever got back to me though.  Claire Forlani, Alyssa Milano, etc.  I guess they're just busy.  Or my offer of being their love-slave for life along with steamy nude photos of myself  scared them a little.</div></div><hr />

Was on Jenny Jones years ago in a failed attempt to get onto Talk Soup. Met Moby, assorted bigger name DJ's here in Chicago, Real World/Road Rules cast members (hi Ruthie and Janet, I hate you both equally) snuck backstage and interviewed lead singer of a not very well-known Brit band called Ash.<br />
<br />
Umm...and Mr. Comiskey (owner of the White Sox ballpark) often dines at my parents' restaurant.</div></div><hr />
