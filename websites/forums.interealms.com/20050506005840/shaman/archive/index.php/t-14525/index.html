<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kukgulano</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone got any experience with the Combat Agility line of AA abilities?<br />
<br />
I was reading thru the PoP menu last night and it looked like it made more sense to advance in Agility than Durability.  I am looking for something to help survive that initial attack from Tier 2 targets that come in pairs when the group puller can't single and root isn't an option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Agendon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Combat Agility is really great if you max Lr5 also...but its also very random wether it helps or not. But its a great improvement in survival chances :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">CA3 and LR5 will increase how long you can live dramatically</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">LR5 is great, but ND3 is better, if that is what you are deciding between. ND3 will not only help you survive melee damage but also spells and AE's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would be a tough choice, but I took ND3 because of CanniV, not because of AE's. I also have LR5, which is definitley worth having.<br />
<br />
If I was given an either or I think I would go with LR5 instead of ND3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ND3 first imo but the CA3/LR5 line is very very nice</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah....just my opinion....but the CA/LR line is one of the best AAs that we can get.  I did love the extra 250hps from ND.  I do love some of the other aspects of the other abilities.  But...next to Cannibalization (which is undoubtedly easily the BEST AA ability that we get) CA/LR is prob second best.  As a shaman, you will be getting hit alot.  With this ability your survival chances increase dramatically.  Having this ability also helps in alot of the other abilities.  If you are casting and the mob misses you, then you have a better chance of not being interrupted while casting something.  If the mob misses you, then you won't be spending the mana and time to heal yourself when you could be healing someone else or doing some dmg to the mob.  All in all, this ability will save your life more times.  If will also enable you to go toe to toe with some things that you might not have been able to before.  All of the hps in the world aren't going to help you if you are getting hit every time.  <br />
<br />
Basically......get CA3 then work on Lightning Reflexes right after that.  It is another one of those game-changing abilities IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well getting LR5 is 27AA's.  ND3 is 12.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">CA3/LR5 and ID5 have changed my world.  If you raid alot, they will save your ass countless times. A couple weeks ago in VT i evaded an entire flurry and another round of attacks in a row. My only regret is not getting it sooner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tobeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Was just wondering...wouldn't CA3/LR5 be a total of 42 not 27 like the previous poster mentioned?  I thought that CA3 was (2/4/6) and LR5 was (2/4/6/8/10).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Agendon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">LR is 3/3/3/3/3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">A couple weeks ago in VT i evaded an entire flurry  <br />
<br />
I made it through an entire Rampage series (w/ aggro) on Archlich yesterday in Ssra w/o getting hit, which I think was greatly assisted by having CA2.  I was hit the next series, but only for a moment until I backed up again behind the comforting protection of that wonderful column.  CA seems very streaky to me, but worth it.<br />
<br />
Oh, and /rude AL for not dropping GRC.  :mad: <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">One more point about ND: Can you survive canni5 unbuffed?<br />
<br />
If not then you should defnitly get enough ND to survive it. When I got my canni5 I had not enough HPs to survive it without buffs. After ND1 I had 12hp left after pressing the canni5 button. Was fun to watch the clerics when I didn't warn them :)<br />
<br />
If you have enough HPs to survive canni5 unbuffed it's harder to say what you should get: CA / LR are grate skills without question. But with SCR / SCRM you get with one cast torpor /quies once more HP back then you lost with canni5. May be you should think about VP1. Great skill for a quick root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">ND3:  you can't go wrong with more hps. Gives you more time to do what needs to be done, and more time for a quick heal to land.<br />
<br />
CA/LR seems streaky at best, but HP's will always be there and visible.</div></div><hr />
