<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Osrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone else played around in here?<br />
<br />
I've gone here the last few nights to try to kill some named but they seem pretty rare. I've saw 2 named in about 8 hours total. All the loot is droppable and some of it is pretty nice. Everything is solo pullable and easily root rotted.<br />
<br />
How the arena works:<br />
<br />
There are 2 tunnels on each side that are guarded by 2 mobs, either A Converted Laborer (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=14631) or A Twisted Stoneservant (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=14664) where random mobs wander in and kill these greenie slaves. One mob wanders out of one side, kills a slave or 2, then goes back in the tunnel and despawns. Then about 15 minutes later the same thing happens on other other side. I haven't timed it, that's a rough guess. There is also arena seats above the ground level w/ nocs, mastruqs, and aneuk glyphcallers in them which are easily single pullable. Simply cast on them and they warp down to you. <br />
<br />
As for named:<br />
<br />
There is a PH for a named up top, An Officiator (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=14218), for Officiator Keviazh (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=14219). I've yet to get the named to spawn but to get this one solo you need to invis and lev up, run thru the tunnels, go back up on the entrance side of the arena, cast, let her warp across then run float/run back into the arena. If you don't let her warp and you run down early she goes thru the tunnels and brings one nasty train. Trust me!  ;)  I get an add doing this occasionally.<br />
<br />
The other named come out of the tunnels. The 2 unkillable Pixxt guys do zone wide shouts commentating on what is going on in the arena. They have a variety of shouts and I'm not sure if they are tied into the spawning of named. When I killed Pixxt Hihkx (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=14598) (dropped boots) they shouted about this beast that they had saw before and wanted it in the next fight. I've saw this msg again but the mob didn't come out. Also, when I saw Warlord Vokken (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=14635) they shouted about showing the slaves a true warrior. I didn't get to kill Vokken cause I didn't see him in time due to killing a different mob so he made it to the tunnel and despawned.  :mad: <br />
<br />
Hihkx hits for 800 and has a spirit call style pet. The pet hits for 400+ but all you need to do is root it and it poofs a few seconds later. I didn't have BoS or Bane when I killed this so I did it the long way w/ Ultor, Pox, and the occasional Anathema so my roots weren't constantly being broken and the pet came out again later in the fight. I'd imagine if you had Bane (100 pts away!), BoS, and Ultor running you'd only get 1 pet at the beginning of the fight.<br />
<br />
I rarely kill the mobs that wander out of the tunnels b/c the commentators shouts seem to coincide with when a mob is due to come out so I don't get caught off guard. They also seem to be related to when a named is due to come out but it could just be a timed script that has nothing to do with the spawns at all. Any ideas? Do you think killing the mobs that do wander out would increase the chance of a named? Or do you think it is totally random?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Solusek.Spirituous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">one tip i can give u is dont kill the slaves they are on faction you need for the BDiC quest</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just went here to check it out. It was very easy. <br />
<br />
I went to the middle of the arena and single pulled Nochs from the stands. They were very gimp and died fast. The green slaves are non kos so don't kill them.<br />
<br />
A named popped in the arena and started killing slaves. Reluctant Gladiator or something. Malos, slowed and rooted him. He hit in the 800-900 range max. I just rooted and dotted him and sent SC5 and he died pretty fast. Had some +2 regen monk/bL gloves.<br />
<br />
I got bored pretty quick here so I left shortley after and didn't wait for any other mobs to pop in the arena.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hail,<br />
<br />
I had some friends go recently while I was tied up on a 10th ringwar.  They had a group and a half and the only time they had any trouble was when half of 'em were afk and they purposely over-pulled. :p <br />
<br />
They picked up two very nice pieces in just a few hours:<br />
Baleful Blood Soaked Cuirass  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68404) <br />
Surcoat of Tragedy (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68405).<br />
<br />
AC on them is kind of low, but very good RVR for the area in my opinion with awesome effects.  The Cuirass is like a souped up Fungi (but sadly not shaman wearable :mad: ). Not much good for farming solo though since most of this stuff is no-drop, but do-able for upgrades if you need them I guess.  Can't even sneak some twinks in with invis potions to loot anything you couldn't wear unless they are 55+  (Note: those say REQUIRED level of 55).<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its a fun place to solo because 1) It is never camped 2) the loot can be pretty hoss 3) the &quot;event&quot; is kinda neat too.</div></div><hr />

written for/by a necro but it's a damned good guide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Krakur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So I spend 800 points on RGC - and the first mob I kill in the colesium drops Yaeths 73 right..................DOH!<br />
<br />
Well, Unlike most i've seen... I use pet to tank......just a little safer and its not hard at all to keep him alive. <br />
<br />
Also, you can let the mob hit the slave first, and it will assist you the duration of the fight.. heck my pet even shielded one of them lol.<br />
<br />
I'll post more of my findings soon :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sosoca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Heres my necro guide. Im thinking its basically the same deal, sans snare, plus slow.<br />
<br />
http://necro.eqclasses.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=1595<br />
<br />
Its a slight fix to the other one, with fixed mob spawns and drops, plus goes more into how to kill them.<br />
<br />
Enjoy.</div></div><hr />

I think it is a great change cause it will mean less Necro or druid soloist just camping the 18 minute spawns. <br />
<br />
I tend to bring groups and slaughter as far as we can pull before repops. This also helps get the other named like Degredex up from the static Noc's in the arena tunnel's.<br />
<br />
Gotten many in my guild geared up slighty here. I want to move into ferubi some and start working there but so far I have hit a brick wall in that everytime I go I am getting mauled when I try and duo. And I am hesatant taking a group someplace I have not been able to scout some cause I don't want to waste thier time. <br />
<br />
Oh and The Flint mace thingy is priceless for warriors who have Ingenuity.. Warriors critting for 1032 crit blasts is wrong but so funny on some levels.<br />
<br />
Just remember pretty much any static Noc can spawn some sort of named that have droppable loot and you should have a little fun.<br />

<br />
I spent a week or two soloing trash mobs in Barindu and Ferubi and every time I ran through the Arena was occupied...usually by a solo'r, but sometimes a grp of 3-5 people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Setanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Riwwi is a blast. Never tried to solo there (hmm.... actually, haven't soloed since my days of declaring war on the giants in Rathe and Burning Woods). Got some good upgrades for guildies in there. <br />
<br />
By the way Snoww - ecourage the wars to aug that cudgel with the permafrost aug - 1250 crits rock</div></div><hr />

Encourage Wars to aug everything with Anger III w t f.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hail,<br />
Encourage Wars to aug everything with Anger III w t f.<br />
Most good warriors I know have several sets of weapons. <br />
Definitely their #1 set for MA duty to maximize aggro (the anger/EB set of blades), but also carrying another set to maximize their DPS when they aren't tanking and don't want the aggro from an Enraging Blow type proccing sword (like a BoC or BoW).  Then they often have other weapon lineups for special situations (Truncheon of Doom for example).<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Setanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Nah - aug the ones that already have anger type effects with more anger. Aug the ones that deal damage with more damage.<br />
<br />
Blow things up. Its fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Figured I would update.<br />
<br />
The warrior in question Has an Aggro setup and a DPS setup. Thats why.<br />
<br />
I talked him into Ingenuity cause Like others have said. It is fun and a fun to play warrior doesnt log on alts as much.<br />
<br />
My guild has started going into Ferubi now and working on the Elite there for augs and such. 6 man and 12 man group runs.<br />
<br />
Lots of fun but man ferubi is a step up in diffaculty.<br />
<br />
5 to 700 a pop plus procs for yard trash. hurts. <br />
<br />
It is possible to duo in there Or solo But pulls are hard and moving in is really really dangerous. 14-15 minute spawns with the dog spawn roamers hurts.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Oh another update. For riwwi.<br />
<br />
There is another great place to camp as well. 2-3 possible roamers though but they only roam like once every  hour or so.<br />
<br />
I call it ruins. And You can get nightmasters there and the bow named and the Packmaster guy as well. <br />
<br />
If you come out of the little tunnel from the arena There is a tower in front of you and some ruins off to the right of the Tower. There is a gap/ally tween two of the ruined buildings and a small clearing there In front of the ally. Can pull and fight there safely.<br />
<br />
Have fun.<br />
