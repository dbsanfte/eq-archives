any ideas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Knarlz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm not too up on these things but it could be the voodoo card and drivers. Two things,<br />
<br />
 1-  Nvidia bought out the voodoo people a year ago and kinda quit supporting it. thus dx8 is iffy.<br />
<br />
2- the EQ graphics *cough* upgrade *cough* is designed for Nvidia, ie. Gforce cards. Its not likely to be fixed up for voodoo since the company is essentaly gone.<br />
<br />
there was a lot of posts like this a month or 2 ago when SoL was released, and your vidio card stands out as a possable problem.<br />
Also check the official EQ site. They had some tips on system set ups.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fanadile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Problems with voodoo could solve things, not sure in this case from a pure disconnect.  If you crash to desktop or your computer/video locks up entirely it would seem more likely it's your video card.  I was able to run EQ without crashing on a voodoo when Luclin was first released, but performance was so bad I could hardly play...especially considering my CPU is so slow (P2-450).  <br />
<br />
If on a budget and wish to try upgrading video (which I strongly recommend, you'll see a HUGE performance increase over voodoo) go with a GeForce2 card.  Can pick up a GeForce2 64MB card for $100 or less.  If you have the extra money go straight for GeForce3!  $150-300 price range.<br />
<br />
Even if this doesn't solve the problem you're going to see a huge increase in your performance even with the lower cost GeForce2.<br />
<br />
If it doesn't help we can figure something else out.  Moe and others are really good with this stuff, send out some PMs =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It does sound like a vid problem, or possibly a sound issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Are you using onboard sound?<br />
<br />
<br />
Try creating a text file in your EQ directory called &quot;Nosound.txt&quot;.  Doesn't need to be anything in it.  Having the file will tell EQ not to try and build the sound engine.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let us know if the problem continues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My second pc uses a Voodoo 3 2000 PCI card with no problems. I am curious why some think a disconnect would be caused by graphics or sound. As Fana said graphics usually cause a weird screen or crashing to the desktop. Sound usually causes weird sounds.<br />
<br />
If it started recently did anything change on your pc or perhaps just from the patches? When you say disconnect, what exactly happens?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Usually we look at video cards because they are the primary cause of crashes, lag, PL etc.  Just using different drivers can make a HUGE difference in the performance and stability of a system.  I've had drivers I've tried that cause constant 20% PL while another is fine, some that have caused a nice white cursor in the middle of the screen, etc.  Video cards and drivers have been notorious since Windows 3.1 for all kinds of problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sound and video drivers cause all kinds of problems when you pass them a piece of data that they don't know what to do with.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ryu, there is a file in your EQ directory called &quot;dbg.txt&quot; .  take a peek in there.  Scroll to the bottom, then move up a line at a time until you come across something that was &quot;unsuccessful&quot; or a &quot;Exception&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let us know what you find.</div></div><hr />
