<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">*INFO* Most Common Item Upgrade/Twink List<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Since a good load of the questions on this board consist of &quot;This is my equipment, what should I get next?&quot; or &quot;I'm starting a monk with xxx amount of money, what are my options?&quot; I have decided to compile a list of the most common upgrade paths for equipment by slot for the use of the public.<br />
<br />
This list does not contain anywhere near the full list of what is available for monks, just the most commonly available options. Any additions people think should be there will be most welcome.<br />
<br />
* This list contains ONLY droppable items<br />
<br />
* The items are sorted by usefulness - Lowest to Highest<br />
<br />
* The order of the list is due to my personal opinion of the items, but is generally sorted by Haste/Effect, Hitpoints/Stamina, AC, Stats/Resists, with weight being a factor in all of them<br />
<br />
I find this to be a very useful thread over on the Monk boards. I think something like this could be of use here as well, a &quot;common&quot; upgrade list for Shamans. Check out the thread and think Shaman.<br />
<br />
I am going to start on a draft of this, I'll pop it up for your revisions as soon as I get a good start.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zaspacer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That sounds like a very good idea.<br />
<br />
I just made a cat Shammy and I twinked him out something fierce, focus items and all.<br />
<br />
Still need to get a JBB, but I have about 30 more levels for that anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Great idea- post a first draft and I'll definitely contribute any little knowledge I might have.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Feias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You may want to specify or adapt one for those that are Iksar vs those that are other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Equipping a JBB on a twink has been known to cause all gear on that arm to stop functioning.<br />
<br />
Beware!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Angryor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Gloriana had a great post on gear before the DB update,.  I wish I made a backlup of that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Posting the first draft soon...<br />
<br />
I plan to start the list , non-Iksar (well because I'm not and Iksar) and then adapt it once we get a solid base of information going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Iksars can be shaman? :eek: <br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&quot;The upgrade path&quot; they made for monks was fabulous. I hate asking people &quot;What should I get next?&quot; so I usually just ignore it and stick with what i have.. It's amazing what you can find out is right around the corner with a list like the one you're talking about creating. I don't participate in the high high end game, and immensely enjoy getting upgrades with a small force (single group).  Can't wait for this list to come out.<br />
