<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>loobusk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya , <br />
Although my Troll SK is lvl 56 I am having a blast powerleveling (2boxing) a barb shaman. I just went from lvl 14 to 27 in about 7 hours in Unrest, with no downtime. I was wondering if anybody more experienced in powerleveling using the Shadowknight Feign Death technique knew any good spots to level after lvl 28? (or anyone with advice is welcome!)anywhere with steady spawns and ease of pulling ,also prefferably bumped up experience modified zones would be appreciated. Anybody who would like to share some info is welcome.<br />
Many thanks !</div></div><hr />

I have only EVER played Caanus though, so can't help much beyond mentioning that.  Paludal was listed as 85%.. that still your range?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Mistmoore, constant pulls its also a hot spot atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You might want to ask this on the shadowknight boards as well as here, as they would probably know more about good places to powerlevel as a SK using FD powerlevelling techniques (or other SK techniques) than we would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">PC is worthwhile up to about L25 or 26 . . . after that it's basement of HHK.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't use FD PLing.  You'll just have to spend a boatload of time getting your offense, defense and casting skills up.  I have a badly PLed cleric with no AC as an indirect result of this.<br />
<br />
Soloing to 37 won't be that bad, and at 37, start using the shaman to buff the SK and have the SK solo while grouped. The shaman will still slow as well.  It's good practice for when you start 2 boxing later against real mobs.<br />
<br />
Yes, you won't be in the &quot;I made 65 in 3 days&quot; PLing class, but you will have a shaman that is useful and won't fizzle.  Just make sure you keep defense maxed.<br />
<br />
My shaman, even doing all that, had to spend a few hours working on abjuration.  And a little while dueling the SKs pet to get defense maxed.<br />
<br />
It's really not worth the time in the long run to PL so fast your skills don't stay up to snuff.</div></div><hr />
