<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>xector</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hey guys,<br />
with the overseer being fixed ive made alot of progress on my iksar shaman cudgels this last week. im currently working on #7, ive collected all the glowing skulls and the dusty skull. now im wondering how difficult some of the remaining mobs i have to kill are. ive tired to look up info on them but its been unreliable at best.  mostly what im looking for is mob lvls, the force thats needed to take them down, and whether there is anything special about them.(melee/caster, immune to snare/root/fear/all spells, can they be slowed?, etc) im currently a lvl 56 iksar shaman with all my spells, no epic, and of course no jbb. =) any info would be a great help. these are the mobs im interested in....<br />
<br />
-Arisen Iksar(triggered in FoB)<br />
<br />
-Thuuga Dengibl(static goblin spawn in FM)<br />
<br />
-Kaggy Krup(frog in the frog city in SoNH)<br />
<br />
and of course...<br />
<br />
VS in howling stones<br />
<br />
thanks in advance =) the forums here have been a wonderful aid to me.<br />

<br />
-Arisen Iksar: Blue to me at 57, slowable, hits for 237 max. Duoed him with a 60 SK. If you bring help, make sure they wait down where the ramp to the beach is. Unless they're Iksar, the Oracle will jump them when you engage the skeleton.<br />
<br />
-Thuuga: Blue at 57, slowable but resisted a bunch, don't remember how hard he hit (think it was low 200s like the other mobs), and he had a fun proc. Nothing that will make or break the fight, you'll see what I mean. Duoed him with a 60 Druid.<br />
<br />
-Kaggy Krup: Blue at 57, slowable, hit for low 200s like the others, procs a DOT/slow/snare which gets annoying. He spawns right on the edge of the frog town looking out off the edge. Looks like a caster frog. Was a pain in my ass to find him =\ Duoed him with a 60 SK.<br />
<br />
-VS in HS: This fight is bugged to **** and back, be VERY CAREFUL when you do it. Not even sure if it's possible to do it now actually, I'd really recommend you hold off for the time being. We ended up having a non-targetable version of VS aggro on us and kill everyone. No idea what level he was, but was hitting for 247s and HT'd for either 761 or 800-something. GMs don't seem to exist anymore, so if you do happen to die to a bug in the script, you get to redo the last part of the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Last fight works fine, did it 2 weeks ago for a friend.  Just don't do anything until the targetable version spawns.  Takes about 10 minutes of just sitting, and some people get excitable and start moving around, but keep them still.  I'd take 2 groups to VS to be safe, 1 good group might be able to do it if you know what to expect (I wiped once w/ 1 group when noone had done the fight yet).   Get him slowed asap or those ht procs will tear you apart.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Depending on the level of your friends, you may want about 2-3 peeps helping you for the pre-VS fights.  Most of the pre-VS mobs are fairly easy to solo at 60 and I never even needed to throw out a Torpor because I had them all slowed right off.  For someone at 56 it would prolly be a good idea to bring along another priest and a high DPS melee.</div></div><hr />
