<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Uloff Bonecracker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your gear isnt too different from how mine was 4 months ago. My advice is if you're looking at better gear get yourself in a a guild that's doing or about to do the mobs you want. (Or you could start a guild with some friends like we did.) Most of the upgrades I'd suggest you just couldnt do solo or with a pickup group. (Although, you could prolly organise a pickup HoT group and get some armour upgrades that way.)<br />
<br />
/shrug - good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>garguren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">once you ge a guild maybe work on SS armour but small upgrades that cna be doen now i would prolyl suggest.<br />
<br />
mask of the elasions for face has pretty good stats imo and aitn to expensive..<br />
<br />
shoulders (prolyl be argued)  i used igs for quite awhile.. recently got chokadi hide pauldrons..   you'll loose some ac and resists but..  you gain quite a bit of hps...  i belvei stats are 5ac neg 10 str 15sta 50hp like neg 10 dis + 10 poisen or soemthing...    so you'll gain quite a bit of hps loose some resits and little ac<br />
<br />
neck go drop yelemdha loose a little hp but bring up soem other stats which is pretty good imo...  <br />
<br />
those bout only thing that coem to mind..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not sure how much money you have to play with, but here are a few ideas:<br />
<br />
Face: Death Mask of the Elysians<br />
Finger(s): Circled Toe Bones, Glittering Ring of Judgement<br />
Neck: Tracking Wolf Collar<br />
Secondary: Tae Ew Shield, Orb of the Infinite Void<br />
<br />
Also, if they are available on you server, Hurricane Chain sleeves/gloves made by smiths are actually better than SS in terms of hp/mana</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">damn, you stole my profile from a while back too o_o hehe.<br />
<br />
Most of the equipment in my profile was self obtained (other than a few pieces) so you might look there for ideas.<br />
<br />
<br />
Off the top of my head, ditch the alchemy bag. Get a goranga idol or better yet a sandwich of foul smelling herbs, pretty rare but on Karana they run pretty cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Only things I can think to add.<br />
Hurricane chain arms.<br />
Vallorium rings.<br />
Scout quest in WW for a range (Talisman of Benevolence).<br />
Try to find SS chain bracer MQs (swap in the jbb and bracer of sense only as needed).<br />
Other than that Artificers Bracers are pretty nice as well.<br />
Same with the IGS lots of other shoulders out there with hp for when you dont need the resists.<br />
<br />
Pretty much most of the rest your going to need to raid for it.</div></div><hr />
