<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For now I am turning off all new character models except elementals/horses. I'll be playing arouind with performance settings for a while. I will probably never turn on Erudite. I wish I could stop others from seeing it too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Abash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Don't feel bad, Bemi..I think it's really going to take some time to find our &quot;visual niches&quot; so to speak..<br />
<br />
Abash, for instance looks incredibly huge in the armor she's wearing.  (Not just talking about the frontal acreage)  I think it's going to be a little tough for me to get used to.  I know she's never been the picture of femininity but she also didnt look like she could play halfback on a profootball team before either!...not completely decided on the hair/face either..but I'll find my spot in there somewhere LOL<br />
<br />
(How does anyone feel about the short spikey do for the female barbs?) :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Waran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/em admires Abash's HUGE &quot;tracts of land&quot; ;)<br />
<br />
When I think of a Barbarian Female, I picture Brigitte Nielsen as &quot;Red Sonja&quot;.  The movie that had a crossover with Conan and her.  Long red hair is what I imagine her to be ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Abash the look you had last night was awesome. And the main problems I have with Erudites is the conehead. It is enormous. Makes us look comical IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Abash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well thanks Bem and Waran :)<br />
<br />
Coneheads..no I wouldnt go that far..you remind me of the guys in the star trek pilot with the really big brains :)<br />
It's a bit scarey more so than comical I think.</div></div><hr />
