<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As i awake and read this forum this morning and post my reply about melee in the Divine Avatar thread, something occures to me. Doesnt it seem like each class seems to get attention and &quot;apears&quot; to be the favorite of SoE for a while. First it was SK, then BST, DRU, Cleric. I might have the order wrong, but the fact is each class at a separate some has become a seemingly favored class.<br />
<br />
Maybe SoE's way of dealing with problems is that instead of fixing things little by little in all classes that need it, they focus on 1 and get it where they think it needs to be then move on to the next and just got back and tweak as needed. I think its pretty obvious at this point that shaman havent been looked at to hard and just get thrown unthought out scraps from the cutting board. <br />
<br />
So maybe we are next in line or atleast in line to get seriously looked at. I mean it seems you can tell when a class is truly being looked at by SoE cause suddenly they get a ****load of changes or very drastic and noticable changes. Like when the clerics got the hammer thing. It was a drastic change. Or when BST's got fixed, they suddenly got alot of things. Maybe we just need to hang in there and help is on the way after all. Maybe im just havent a moment of delusional morning hope.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sure would be nice if a SoE rep would just pop in and go. &quot;We will be looking at you very soon, we havent forgotten you shaman.&quot;  Or atleast come in and say, &quot;Right now shaman we think you are very balanced.&quot;<br />
<br />
I think beyond all our requests, all our desires and bitching about things that arent how they should be, this is our true complaint that everyone of us harbors.  SoE simply hasnt talked to us. If they would come here and tell us we are balanced, we could move on cause atleast we know what SoE's expecting us to be and we can deal with it. If they are going to look at us, atleast tell us so we arent feeling neglected, just so we know our concerns are heard and will be addressed soon. I dont think its alot to ask.<br />
<br />
My 2 cents anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You want to know why I bitch and moan about rebalancing?<br />
<br />
EQ is a dieing game. This means that as long as people pay, the servers will be up and running, but no one will waste time and money on rebalancing a class, because those Devs will be doing other things.<br />
<br />
I am afraid we are well past this point though. We did our best to get the Shaman class back where it belongs(after sleeping on it for way too long), but it doesn't really seem to work. This for me means, it's over. This is the state in which your class will remain for the time being.<br />
<br />
All I know is that if things stay as they are, I will be gone on the 10th. I like the new Slow, but it needs its resist modifier upped. I like the Canni, but the recast time needs to go. <br />
<br />
For the rest? It's a big pile of crap.<br />
<br />
My DoTs won't land worth **** and I will still die from the ****ing resists when I try to anyway. My best Heal over Time is a ****ing joke that heals as much as it did 4 years ago, *before* the Slow nerf(call it mitigation) and when mobs were doubling for 140ish in Sebilis. <br />
My Healing is falling behind more and more, when it is already relatively weak for no ****ing reason(whoever the ****er deciding Druids should suddenly out heal Shamans after 3 1/2 years was, needs to get fired).<br />
<br />
There's many more and I don't want to rehash everything I have been criticizing for *years*. I say **** You, Sony for turning me away from a game I played from the start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Currently, I don't think SOE is paying that much attention to anyone's issues and is probably focused more on marketing for what is going on outside EQ right now (WoW).  <br />
<br />
The fact that class upgrades have always been myopic and never dealt with more than a single class at one time suggests that SOE has very few resources allocated to class balance and interaction.  Additionally, for the last few years SOE has been reactive and not proactive with regards to class change which suggests they no longer have any sort of &quot;Vision&quot; (tm) left for how classes should function.  The introduction of Berserkers is probably more beta 5 stuff that will find its way to EQ2, but it throws up a screaming red flag that shows they really are out of touch and not paying attention.<br />
<br />
It would be great to see some feedback from an SOE rep on where we stand, but interaction with the customer base has really been at a low point for quite awhile.  Wait for EQ2 perhaps? :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree with you.<br />
<br />
Thats why i dont see why its so hard for someone to just pop in and tell us how it is. I dont think its too difficult for a SoE rep to pop in and make a lil post and say &quot;This is how you shaman will be&quot; or &quot;We havent forgot you, bear with us its alot of work&quot; I mean they have time to browse all these forums and reply everywhere, but not here. Me personaly i can deal with anythign they wanna say, i might not like it, but atleast i would know what to expect from this class. I think a large part of the problems around here, lately anyway, is that no one knows where we stand. The whole team that made this class has changed and its like everyone is afraid to do anything with us. That leaves us in limbo and leaves us to our own devices and hopes for the class. I just want them to come and state what it is they want their new shaman to be. <br />
<br />
Im tired of the guess work.<br />
Im tired of lack of communication.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">*shrugs*<br />
Maybe they're tired of Brenlo making an ass of himself.<br />
<br />
Didn't take long, did it?<br />
In all honesty, maybe it's because the devs are asked NOT to post on community boards, and Brenlo is flat out TOLD not to post about certain subjects, including class balance unless asked to by a senior member of the EQ team.<br />
<br />
*shrugs* He's an assling.  What do you really expect?<br />
<br />
EDIT: Forgot to add, IT WOULD BE NICE IF THEY WOULD POST!<br />
<br />
****ing corporate mentality...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Then why cant he come here and post that? <br />
<br />
There is no reason for 0 communication which is what we get and if it was every class forum i would be fine with that too, but its not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yes its abit depressing, but it does feel more and more like beta  for eq2.<br />
and this means no time to look at class in eq, cos they got too much tied up in eq2, which also looking, to me, less and less fun to play.<br />
<br />
on a possible good note perhaps they will change the shaman to be like it will be on eq2 then? ofcourse if it more like what we have now i most likely wont play a shaman on eq2, if i actually play eq2. as i said on a different post the shaman now is not the shaman i choose to play nearly 4 years ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Brenlo and Rytan both posted numerous times recently on the mage compendium.  After the ****storm hit from their stealth nerf of pet canni, they started doing retroactive damage control.<br />
<br />
Since then, we've heard nothing at all from them.  A few half-assed posts about how overpowered mages were (that must be why there are so few of us) and then *poof*, they're gone. <br />
<br />
The information they did post was either incorrect or intentionally misleading.  I'm not sure which possibility bothers me more.  In any case, their contributions were minimal at best.<br />
<br />
Haven't been back since.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i must admit at first i thought the mage pet canni, jess another shaman like ablility gone to another class:) but then after i thought about i though, great more mana for mages to nuke, summon stuff etc better for group raid etc great:)<br />
i must admit i like classes to get better as it help with groups and raids, hence why i hope they`ll look and shaman and tweeek us abit.<br />
they appaer to have taken out the cleric mana aa too.<br />
<br />
but will have to wait a see, i think all the crap they doing is gonna to affect them badly cos it not just shaman now that a pissed off by all this.<br />
<br />
i know i not gonna buy till i know exactly what is in it and what it is like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Mage Canni was about as &quot;overpowering&quot; and &quot;unbalancing&quot; as Monk Rampage tanking.  <br />
<br />
It was situational, had massive pre-reqs and the nerf was WAY overboard (more so for Monks, but I do understand Mage gripes).<br />
<br />
Let's be honest - how many encounters that you COULDN'T do before could you all of a sudden waltz through because of Mage canni?<br />
<br />
Similarly - how many encounters that you were successfully dealing with could you all of a suddent NOT do because of the nerf?<br />
<br />
EDIT: Thanks Frekkles. Since I avoid Hard LDON's like a drug-using, Haitian Transvestite, I was unaware of the application. But again - 5 instanced zones - hardly a call for a nerf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">In December your boss will tell you are doing a great job...<br />
<br />
He's not going to say gee the company is in trouble and we are thinking about letting you go.<br />
<br />
He's going to tell you everything is fine.<br />
<br />
You want to hear something from SOE?<br />
<br />
Here I'll tell you,<br />
<br />
We are presently looking at all classes, we may decide that the shaman class requires some minor tweaks, but on the whole we feel the classes are quite balanced.<br />
<br />
Wow I should go work for Sony, I like the sounds of that.<br />
<br />
EQ2 - no matter what SOE says, their not going to tell you that they are putting less time or effort into EQ1 because of EQ2, aint going to happen.<br />
<br />
Reality is EQ2 is the next big game for SOE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hail,<br />
<br />
When speaking about mage pet canni:<br />
<br />
Similarly - how many encounters that you were successfully dealing with could you all of a suddent NOT do because of the nerf?<br />
High risk adventures became much more difficult after the nerf if you were used to using multiple magicians for DPS.  Magician soloing power (in terms of kill-rate, not in terms of target strength) was also severely cut back because of the nerf.<br />
<br />
It was truly amazing what 2 Magicians w/ the right AA's invested (and NOT invested in for this scenario) could do for DPS using pet-canni in a single group setting (exp or adventure). Though I personally thought it made Magicians overpowered, I wasn't thrilled with the nerf either &amp; thought it heavy-handed (much like the monk nerf).  The pet-canni nerf hurt my smaller raids' sustained nuke DPS.<br />
<br />
Sony definitely seems to habitually use a sledgehammer to drive 10-penny nails when they go to fix something.  :mad: /sigh<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
