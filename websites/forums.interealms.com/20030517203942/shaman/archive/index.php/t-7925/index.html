<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm still using my ikky bp at 57 also.  Wouldn't trade it for a wis bp.  Well, unless that wis bp also had around 40ac...then it'd be a toss up.  :p<br />
<br />
Actually, I would trade it for an emerald dragonscale tunic, then I'd sell the tunic and buy another ikky bp and some other stuff with the funds.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Swifthart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Keep the ikky. (-;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Keep the regen bp.  i used mine till I was lucky enuf to win a fungi at lvl 56.  Then I used that (forsaking my wis bp) until 60, whereupon I put on my brand new JBBP and twinked a monk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did a direct comparison of ikky vs barbed ringmail against hill giants in Rathe.  The Ikky won hands down over 11 raw AC and 50HP.  I could canni during fights wearing the ikky,  I had to heal wearing the barbed.  made a huge differance in the number of HGs i could kill before medding.<br />
<br />
Keep the ikky for a while.  Or try something else before you sell the ikky,  you'll come back to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Warscar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you are level 58 and above sell the ikky and get a barbed ringmail. At that level you get kragg's and that helps out a lot. 5hp regen just doesn't matter all that much. If you are getting double whacked for over 100 5hp a tick is not going to help a lot.  I would buy a horse and solo outside. The mana regen is ten times more effective then the hp regen off the bp plus the 11 raw ac is like 17 overall ac if you were to use a barbed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>stashin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">for me, ikky bp=ft3, why would i wanna swap it for more medding time ?</div></div><hr />
