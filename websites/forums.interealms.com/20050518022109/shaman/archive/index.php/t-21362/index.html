<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am in need of a ton of help with PVP. Our Guild is having PIT FIGHTS. We all throw our names into a hat. Two names are drawed &amp; we duel to the death. I have no PVP expericence at all. I do know that if i draw a Bard or SK &amp; probably a chanter that i am toast &amp; i will loose. The rules are simple you have 5 minutes to self buff then you fight it out to the end. It will be in an arena so you can not train 5 mobs on your foe. My guild is not elemental. We have some decent geared people &amp; some gimply geared peeps<br />
<br />
I was wondering if you guys could help me with strats on some other clsasses. <br />
<br />
1 pally<br />
2 ranger<br />
3 druid<br />
4 magician<br />
5 wizzy<br />
<br />
I will of course be leaving first 2-3 buff slots open. My magelo link is below<br />
<br />

<br />
Any help or suggestions on strat &amp; techniques would help...thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you got some fairly nice gear, but don't have many AAs.. for pvp, I suggest that you get spirit call, at least level 1. level 3 rocks. Free damage and interrupts.<br />
<br />
When you fight a pally, chances are this will end in a draw, unless he gets a lucky root on ya and you can't get away. Keep yourself quiescenced, don't use dots that he can cure.<br />
<br />
Ranger is kinda tough. Keep moving so his bow damage is mitigated. Dots will work on him. Start with mal decay and then VP. get close enough so he can't bow you, but far enough away that he can't hit you, then malo him and dot him. spirit call when he's at 50% and then chain nuke, pray that he can't channel heals thru the pets.<br />
<br />
druid is alot the same as ranger. keep yourself quiescenced, dispell his dots/debuffs, but avoid doing dots. Melee him down with a high damage weapon. also use nullify magic(or pumices) on him so he loses his pot9 and self mana regen buff. Nuke if you're FM.<br />
<br />
Mage, slow the pet, and just tank it and his nukes. Keep yourself quescenced and tnarg a lot till he's oom, then go to town. DoTs work very well here.<br />
<br />
Wizzie, keep yourself over 75% so he doesn't manaburn you, or you're dead. Watch out for the lures followed by chain draught of thunder(dd/stun), followed by manaburn. Watch carefully at what he's casting, try to land tnarg right after his nuke lands. Chloroblast can also be your friend, it's a little quicker and can keep you above 75% health.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">against Ranger, grow your pet and shrink yourself.  keep dog (even snared) between you and Ranger to eat the arrows.<br />
<br />
get some potions for DS and check on a DS clickie, get the anul and cure potions.<br />
<br />
pray they all have lag or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Crimson potions own chanters, they cant pell them off you and you cant be mez'd with one on as long as you dont have any buff (as in spell) regen up. chanters are one of the easiest classes in the game for a shaman to kill, they have low hp, our dots bypass their runes and they cant heal or cure. take away mez, land malo and poison dot them with everything you have. chanters drop like rocks.<br />
<br />
the same rule applies to all int casters really, but with wizzy/necro you need to out heal them. so its a balance game. mages dis root the pet and gank the mage.<br />
pally ? lol um dont bother? I think the only thing more painful than fighting a paly is fighting a shaman. boooooooooooooooooooring and long.<br />
<br />
rangers are mean bow damage+melee damage+a sweet spell set, if you can root his ass do like the man says, move to close for bow but stay out of melee range, try not to nuke or use dots with the nuke component and just wear him down. <br />
<br />
druids...pell their dots off you, be ready with rgc for that curse they have. and try to out last them. there really isnt a reason you should be able to win this fight unless you can run him oom and still have mana left for the kill, they heal and cure everything we can put out easily. <br />
<br />
chardok faction will get you a 25point 25 min ds clicky that stacks with our potions, at 65 you should have a ds thats pushing 70points. I suggest you burry that thing deep vrs the melee's though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Koridar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shield of the Immaculate will Eat a Crimson Potion for lunch Given enough time.  Better to find a low level Disease Dot to land on yourself. You'll most likely Die to the wizard because of Crit lures and Manaburn.  with a Druid RC3 is your Friend. As you may not want to dispell all you buffs if you don't need to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah get spiritcall. A full dog-burn eats an ench rune.<br />
<br />
Your only chance as a shaman is to get huge resists and hope the opponent dont have any resists (or low enough to get stuff through after Malos). If both of you have resists then your only chance to do any damage is melee (haha) or nukes with crits.<br />
<br />
However, if you manage to stay alive and unsnared, and you know how to play your class well, you can be very hard to kill, and with mana regen you should be able wear others down in time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Since you're drawing names and not going through set matches, your opponent might not have prepared for an encounter with a shaman.  Disease spells have the best shot of landing in most cases with the proper debuff, but forget about it with a priest class.  I played on a blue server, so my PvP exp is very limited, BUT I had a lot of success with DR dots and slows.  On team arena PvP I went up against a team with an inexperienced healer and panicked the hell out of him when 4-5 debuff/dot icons went up on him.  It forced their melees to chase me around the arena changing their tactics while my melees went after their casters.  I'd listen to what the other shaman here have suggested to you, but above all else, evaluate your tactics based on your opponent, not only his class, but his experience, gear and personality.  Knowing your enemy is your best weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks a bunch for the info...I will try to do us proud.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Oukast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's not possible for a shaman to beat a Druid, Pally, or cleric if they know how to pvp....all the other classes you mentioned above are cake unless the mage / wiz has full crit aa's...then you are in trouble there too...<br />
<br />
Shaman use to be the kings of pvp, and now we suck terribly...Pray for the PvP code changes to come faster...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ophidion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's not possible for a shaman to beat a Druid, Pally, or cleric if they know how to pvp<br />
BULLSHI+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have killed MANY a cleric in pvp, possibly my favorite death was killing one who was da, he da'd after I landed a fresh dot. clerics while they can heal and can cure for some reason often go down easily. I have no idea why.<br />
druids die fast to our dots if they are dumb enough not to have pureblood/counteract poison. but the flip side is they can put a big fast hurt on you with just nukes alone.<br />
paladins would have to suck alot or seriously mess up to lose to a shaman. times I have killed paladins that I can think of...once when the paly burned his LOH on a mob, once when I disease rooted the paly into the hole from paineel...thats about it that comes to mind, they have cures/hp/heals.<br />
<br />
that being said most of my pvp wins come against the morons or the undergeared. vrs anyone with skill my best chance of winning is to try and disease root them into a mob. (yes is sad as hell but so is LB/DT/MB)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Unfortunately, you are probably going to get raped by just about anyone. If your opponent has goo dresists, you are toast. Even if there resists are not uber, you are probably toast anyway. However, here are a few tips that might help a little...and if your opponent is clueless, you stand a chance<br />
<br />
1. Get yourself a minimum of 2 insta clickies, 3 is better and 4 is best (SoW booties dont count if you are fighting indoors). Expect to get dispelled. Use the instaclickies to fill first 4 slots then click 2 off to give you your dispell slots, but still retain 2 in case of cancel / annul magic<br />
<br />
2. Make yourself some of the 33 point damage shield potions for use against melee classes who are dumb enough to use 2 weapons. Ideally get JB BP for pre buffing<br />
<br />
3. Make yourself stinging wort potions - the more the better<br />
<br />
4. Expect to be unable to stick any magic based spells.<br />
<br />
5. Cast annul magic on your opponent as regularly as you can.<br />
<br />
6. Get the divine aura totem thingy from HHP<br />
<br />
7. Dont bother trying to kill anyone fast - expect to take a long time to kill anyone<br />
<br />
8. Against casters, try to run them out of mana - you are the king of mana regen, so if you can get them oom, you will win.<br />
<br />
9. Do get spirit call - as high level of spirit cal as you can<br />
<br />
10. The AoE level 64 posion spell (Tears of Saryn?) is strangely easy to stick after Malos in PvP (whereas it is resisted like crazy on mobs) <br />
<br />
11. Get plenty of mage summoned pet stuff - muzzles, belts and proccing weapons<br />
<br />
12. People often have weaker disease resist than other resists</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Yodelroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Spear and poison rain (and occasionally VP) are the only things that land on people with uber resists. Don't bother with any other damage-dealing spells, chain cast these.<br />
<br />
Oh, and chanters are a total joke if you have crimson potions and clickys. The #1 advice anyone can give you is to use clickies to stop dispell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Oukast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I love it when bloobies try to talk pvp...please tell me where my bull **** is when all the classes I mentioned can cure all shaman dots casted with one single spell...? that is if your dots even stick...and BTW, spear is easily resisted, so uber resist peeps will not be affected by this spell...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">dispel is your friend.  open with it until your reasonably sure he doesn't have a buff left.<br />
<br />
get a couple right clickies.<br />
<br />
if your friends have resists similar to yours, you should be fine.<br />
<br />
crimson pots only work when your regen doesn't seriously overpower the dot on the pot.<br />
<br />
don't use disease dots.  do get a nice 2 hander.<br />
<br />
get puppy zerg for casters.<br />
<br />
get your svm higher (shoot for at least 200, without buffs).<br />
<br />
get an item/aug with see invis.  don't be that guy.<br />
<br />
cure poison pots take care of tash.  use a pot, don't keep the spell mem'd.<br />
<br />
please don't ever ever call what you're doing pvp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Yodelroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">&gt;&gt;BTW, spear is easily resisted, so uber resist peeps will not be affected by this spell...<br />
<br />
Spear lands consistently on people with 500 resists. Try it, I'm a bard and it lands. Yes I get some full+partials, but it definitely does significant damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">As a bluebie, I'd trust the Zek folks' advice before my own, but my own personal experience/advice below:<br />
<br />
Depending on what yer fighting classwise, tribute out your resists (more the merrier right?).<br />
Malicious Decay Yourself, and keep scourge up on yourself if you are playing with a chanter. My natural KITTY regen &gt; crimson potions DoTs heh.<br />
Bury Important buffs like DS, Focus, Boar, and Quiescence (I use acumen, lev, diaku, agi,and others as junkbuffs, also, toss up resist buffs too).<br />
For chanters.. My toughest problemis that pet of theirs. Ginsu is annoying, but 1 Blood of Saryrn can nearly keel it. Depending how you know the ench, I usually just malos + blood + Spear of torment(after pet swarm eats his rune) untilhe's dead. Sometimes I change itup and use Ultor/Pox instead, or all 3. Chanters are sissies.<br />
Wizzies.. uhm.. the one I fought refused to MB people (thank god!), but constanting dispelling him helped alot, he would sit back and try to redo SHielding and some other rune type buff, while I had time to newk him again.<br />
<br />
ALl in all though, you MUST be essentially IMMUNE to root/snare. In pvp I get an occasional root on me if I bump my MR up to around 180-200 and it lasts about 1-2 seconds and breaks.  Also, Chanters have a mez(lvl 49 i think) that is totally unresistable(just like malos..).. So just keep an eye out and all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">oh, and don't be fooled by the monks flopping over on the ground after you nuke them...they're not really dead</div></div><hr />
