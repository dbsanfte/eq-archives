<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,<br />
<br />
I have spent many hours xp grinding in DL... mostly in grp with my ranger &amp; solo with my wizzie from about lvl 44 on.<br />
<br />
I imagine a shammy can do extremely well solo in DL... at what level have most found their earliest solo experience here.<br />
<br />
I'm just a 36 shammy atm &amp; my dogdog just turned lo-blu to me so I was thinking of heading to DL to xp in grp until 39 when I get the new &amp; improved pet.<br />
<br />
Any ideas? And I have read lots on SolB solo xp, how good is DL compared to that zone? Only been there on naggy raids but at 52 there were quite a few hi-blus (not talking giants either) on the way to naggy.<br />
<br />
thanx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Moglyzok Moogleman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i would say solb is alot better, but harder to pull simply because you usually get two of them at a time, but overall good experience.  <br />
<br />
As for DL, i think to be on the safe side you might want a KEI, but you will be able to do it, just avoid the following monsters (they are around 37-40ish)<br />
<br />
A drachnid widow, A drachnid recluse, A Voracious brute, A petrifier cockatraice, Mountain giant steep, a drolvarg rager,  and there is another drolvarg that is pretty strong, but other than those mobs i would say you would do fine, but con everything before you pull, because 36 is a bit low for there, but you probably could do it, even on the KC side. That's just my 2cp, i personally went there at 40 at was pwning, even before i got massivley twinked.  Good luck, and dont bore yourself there.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The hardest common mob in the zone is the ravishing drolvarg which eventually be good xp but prolly not a good idea until pet lvl 44 anyways.<br />
<br />
I zoned into DL omw back to POK from FV &amp; without a pet &amp; c3 gone I decided to pull a tudra yeti near the tunnel (weakest mob in zone I believe) &amp; downed him nps once slowed with 2 dots stacked on him. I then tried my hand at a gnasher (weakest of the drolvargs) &amp; althought a little tuffer &amp; a bit of a mana burn he was eating dirt in the time it took for 2 slows to expire.<br />
<br />
I dinged 38 in grps today &amp; halfway to 39 &amp; I am certain (as I have been conning most of the mobs pulled today) that solo won't be a problem.<br />
<br />
Will defiantely stay away from spiders (rangers &amp; droods that root &amp; dot) &amp; the higher drolvargs. I don't think a hi-blu conned brute is going to pose any prob &amp; prolly will stay away from the giants just because they have a good amount of HPs which I remember from solo'ing with my wizzie.<br />
<br />
cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Go to Velious, Eastern Wastes in particular. <br />
Ulthorks, Walrus, you can feed off of them until 45+. Good exp, pretty okay loot, with a pet Ulthork Hunters and Walrus are cake ! Much easier than DL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shubert TZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Watch out for ravishing drolvargs.  They are tough  (almost level 50 if i remember)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">EDIT: ok im a retard....44 was level of your other char's.....got to read posts more clearly :)....definitely stay away from the ravishing drolvarg, the widow might be doable, the recluse is a tough one though, ragers got a lot of hp, wait till at least 39 for them and VoS dot, new slow and pet...basically grab kei and temperance (virtue is nice...but a lot more - temp you can get for 15pp or so, or buy the dot for 10 (max cha) and theyll usually cast free, while virtue costs 3 dots i think, and harder to find since you need the group virtue spell until you get to 46...its also more mana intensive, so at least 50-though personally id feel cheap giving less than 75) and you can solo just fine...i solod there, or duod with tank, from about 38-45 in the past 2 weeks or so, at most a few hours a night...just dinged 45, now im going elsewhere, but the xp was pretty good, and not risky at all (only died once the whole time, and that was because i was a total moron and rather not relive the bitter memory :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sandadarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I say hunt in OT till 39 than get in a group at DL cause they get annoyed at 38 and lower ppl lol than just group and stuff till 44 and I found that you can solo hell better when your at 44 my lineup of spells are,<br />
<br />
1. Nuke<br />
2.Slow<br />
3.DoT<br />
4.DoT<br />
5.Root<br />
6.Sow/ bih'li<br />
7.Gate<br />
8.Heal<br />
<br />
I found it very easy just have pet, pull by slowing tell pet to attack DoT it a lot than root. Let pet do dmg till mob has 3 health bubs left. Than nuke twice and med. Than repeat  :D</div></div><hr />
