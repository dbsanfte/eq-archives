<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just thought I ask if there are many people here doing the Euro Beta.<br />
<br />
Just started playing in it myself and am enjoying it loads. As it's Beta and the Characters are most likely going to be wiped, I thought I'd save the Character I plan to have as a main till retail (Tauren Shaman, liked the idea of shaman and playing large races).<br />
<br />
My current character is in my Sig.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not a bad idea on waiting for retail to start your main. I used the NA ST1 to figure out which class appealed to me most (Hunter), then ST2/OB to play the other classes to learn a smidge about them.<br />
<br />
Retail came, started my Hunter, and have never regretted it. I still have my alts here and there, but I knew Hunter was my calling before retail came. That way I got to experience a lot of new content and get that &quot;awe and wonder&quot; feel all over again from a different classes perspective.<br />
<br />
FYI...I played a Warlock in ST2/OB. Fun class too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm in the beta on Server 10 - PVP<br />
<br />
I've got a shaman for playing with a friend to complement his Hunter and I'm trying out a Warlock to see if I prefer it the the rogue I played on the US open beta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Im on the un-numbered Beta Server with Weeble my gnome rogue and Wilu my tauren Shaman<br />
<br />
On Beta 2 with friends as Luthan (human priest)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Have you noticed how there are more PVP than PVE servers on the English Euro beta?<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if that is the same for the US retail?<br />
<br />
I thought there would be a ration of 2-1 in favour of the PVE servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nope, more PVP even on US, but not by much.<br />
<br />
PVP = 43<br />
RP = 5<br />
PVE = 40<br />
<br />
WoW is based on PVP conflict between the factions, so it's only natural that be represented in the server make up.</div></div><hr />
