<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I said I'd never do this again since everytime I said &quot;goodbye&quot; in the past I always ended up coming back. However, after spending over 3 months trying to revive my old guild, then realizing that none of my old (close) friends even played anymore, EQ simply no longer holds any interest for me. Even my brother in law quit (and deleted all of his toons). My accounts expired over a month ago, so while I won't be able to log in and delete all of my toons, they'll forever be suspended in the Norrathian ether with no life or purpose.<br />
<br />
With that said, anyone here who cares to keep tabs on what I'm up to musically can always stop by my site:<br />

<br />
I've started updating it again and now that I have my home recording setup tweaked a bit I'll be posting tunes more frequently. The most recent additions are pretty cool and have been rated highly on Acid Planet. If anyone wants to stop by there and rate 'em...<br />

So take care everyone. Maybe we'll meet again in Horizons or WoW (if I decide I want to play another MMoRPG, that is). :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well met Valgoth- thanks for all the info you've posted on the forums, its been helpful to me. You've got some good tracks up on acid planet, I would spin em'. I'm sure you'll start coming back to the boards in a few months and will reactivate, unless blizzard gets their stuff together and can match eq.<br />
<br />
good times no doubt 'eh-</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Welcome back to retirement =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Good Luck with RL and your music career. I've enjoyed your posts during my time at the Crucible, so I hope you at least visit the board some. /salute :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">wow, another old timer bites the dust.  good luck, have fun with life!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Kind of amusing,as two of my friends spent over an hour in Denny's this morning trying to convince me to invest the $150 to return to EQ.  Sad thing is I may bite.  Ah well, take it easy man.  See you in WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Goodbye Val, was nice talking to you from time to time in game. Maybe we will meet again in the next big MMORPG. Good luck with your music.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Farewell and good luck to you.<br />
<br />
The old school players are becoming fewer and further between.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zammatacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Good fortunes to you in RL Valgoth ~salute~<br />
<br />
Thantu... why $150?  If that's for all the expansions, you can buy them all (except LDoN) for $30 or $40 in the newest group pack.  If it's for Hardware / expansions... ouchies :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Take care Valgoth, may your spear of fate never go limp :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Laters Valgoth.  You will be missed, but keep in mind, you won't be missed enuf to make it worth ever returning.  <br />
<br />
I'm only a week or so from calling it quits for good for almost precisely the same reasons.  My RL and even my &quot;close&quot; EQ friends have all called it quits.  EQ is no longer a social event worthy of notice to me.  It's simply too antiseptic, too impersonal when you have no friends that play.  Too meaningless even.  <br />
<br />
In otherwords, yer not alone there big dude, I'm hanging up my Spear of Fate right there on the wall of veterans beside yours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">See you around Val, sad to see another Veeshan old timer fade away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Be safe Val, GL wherever you go next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Thantu... why $150?<br />
<br />
My account is good to PoP, so I bought Ykesha online for $23.95<br />
Need to get LDoN yet (I want the bag, though the keychain gave me a rash, must be zinc in it), so that'll be $29.99.<br />
<br />
Wife's account (she's ecstatic to be playing again) was only good from Luclin?  Maybe not even.  So I bought her Evolutions (kick butt idea, really), which was $29.99 and LDoN (also $29.99).  Then $12.95 * 2 for two months of service.  So.....<br />
$139.82  (close enough :) ).<br />
<br />
Darn expensive habits.  I &quot;JUST&quot; bought Planetside and Temple of Elemental Evil too, still both in the box.  Figures.  Ah well, it is good to be back I guess.</div></div><hr />
