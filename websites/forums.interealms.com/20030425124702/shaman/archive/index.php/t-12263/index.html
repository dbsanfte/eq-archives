I've had a streched fungal hide for last several levels, but am currently farming parts with guild smith for the Tae Ew for me and other guildmates--nice stats on it!

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Myst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You didn't post a Magelo but from your selections it looks like you are trying to bump your wisdom up with a dropable item.  From what I've been reading here the two links below are what most everyone is recommending.   The Tae shield on Prexus is going between 8-10K and I've seen the orb for 13-15K.  Just thought you might like a few more choices...  :) <br />

Tae Ew Shield<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Even between the Tae Ew and the Orb, the Tae Ew is superior.  Same AC, more Wis, and resists on the Tae Ew, along with being cheaper.  The orb gives just 25life and 25mana (but w/ 3 less wis).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Powermaxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm assuming that the primary stat post 60 is STAM and/or HPs for gear, yes? Or is WIS still an issue?</div></div><hr />

OOIV all the way.  HP's will be king once you have Torpor/Canni5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Another option if you can find it: <br />

AC: +35 Sta: +10 Wis: +8 Int: +8 Fire Resist: +15 Cold Resist: +10 HP: +65 Mana: +85</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I like my orb.  AC/HPS/mana is hard to beat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">At your level, you need to seriously loose some Wis and make that into HP and resists.  Get a Tae to bump those resists up a tad and get a decent plus to hp all in the same slot.<br />
<br />
Ditch that barby earring and jasper ring while you're at it and pick up a Shadel Bandit ring and Solstice ear.  Sell the Forest loop to a vendor and put your 300pp towards a nice Earring of Tempests,Stone Fang Earring, or that thing that drops in the PoJ exe trial.<br />
<br />
A Coldain Military Wrist, Enshrouded Veil, and an Iksar Hide Cape might help you live longer too if something decides you might be tasty frozen, broiled, or sauteed in poison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Tae Ew 100%<br />
OOIV is nice and all, but 25hps vs a total of 52 to assorted saves?  No contest, none whatsoever.  Call me lazy, but I hate switching out resist gear, and I hate being easy fodder for casters.  I suppose I'd use OOIV if I could afford to have that AND the tae ew for resists.<br />
<br />
Mostly I was happy to switch out from the stretched fungushide because my sta is about maxed out with the 62 sta buff, and it's time to start phasing over to straight hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'd go for Tae Ew as at 61 you can easily solo CT entrance lizards til they drop a Tae Ew Blood then go solo Windscorn Boat Iksar in Dulak and get an Iksar Blood (they do undercon a bit though...).<br />
<br />
Then you just need to find a smith who will do a shield combine for 4kpp (or free if you know a GM smith).<br />
<br />
I am charging 4 or 5kpp for successful Tae Ew Shield combines atm. There is 70 to 80% percent chance for success at max mod skill of 252 smithing. Other servers smiths may charge more or less depending on the retail value of the item (15kpp on my server).<br />
<br />
Maybe get two of each bloods just to be safe. You also need some easy to get bloods (1 Froglok, 1 Sarnak from bazaar) and 1 Bloodwater from the vendor opposite the Fungus Grove bank.<br />
<br />
Edit: BTW, by the time you get cana 5 (which is the first class skill most/all shaman should go for) you are going to want a BUTTLOAD more Hitpoints. Either that or always exp with an Aego/Virtue/etc!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Wow, is it a trend to charge someone multi k to do combines, at no risk to you whatsoever?<br />
<br />
Not flamming, just curious is all.  I know the costs to get to 250 smithing, and 4k is certaintly a fair price for that item.  However, I would never pay anyone to do a combine for me, except to make it worht while for them to get to a forge, at no risk to themselves, especially without a guarantee for success, and me having to refarm parts.<br />
<br />
Especially when its so easy to find a Grand master to do it for minimal cost.  I know they are not exactly a dime a dozen, but it takes less time to find one than it does for me to farm 4k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I know the costs to get to 250 smithing<br />
Judging by your attitude, you don't know the cost in both platinum and time.  If you don't want to pay someone, get 250 skill and do it yourself, if its so easy.<br />
<br />
As far as droppable shields go, I'd lean towards OoIV.  On my server they're at least 35k though, whereas tae ew have dropped to about 12, and is what I currently use.  Most servers have more sane prices for the orb.  A reasonably obtainable (don't need uberguild) nodrop option is the one off... rumblecrush I think?  Iirc its basically an ooiv with some stats and saves, pretty nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Since the trivial nerf on FS plate smithing is a pain in the ass to raise, charging prices for combines isn't uncommon and depending on your race can make up for some of your investment. Unless you're one of those human smiths who's whored out heraldic and now a plat millionaire ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bannek Luminare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Judging by your attitude, you don't know the cost in both platinum and time.<br />
<br />
To bad this theory isn't readily applied to Alchemy :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Tae Ew and OOIV are both nice. HP are crucial, but resists are great too. If you go for a OOIV you may want a sarnak battle shield for the resists, to swap in on AE mobs.<br />
<br />
I prefer just to get the Tae Ew, invest the spare change somewhere else and save on having to carry 2 shields around for resists vs hp. Its a tough call though, and may depend a bit on the relative prices of the two on your server.<br />
<br />
I paid 1k for the combine on Tae Ew shield - and it failed :( I got all the parts again, just waiting for the smith to show up when I'm around (he promised he'd do it free next time). I think its only right to pay them something given the initial investment required.<br />
<br />
I'd strongly suggest reconsidering a lot of your gear though. Take a look at some other threads or other people's magelos, and try to get those hp up. Don't worry too much about wisdom dropping. My magelo might give you a few ideas, although I still need to do some work (I'm saving for an earring of the solstice at the moment, my earrings are horrible).<br />
<br />
Velium fire wedding ring, shadel bandit ring, silver hammer earring, deathmask of the elysians/crystal spider eyes, heiro cloak and a horse are all some things to aim for. Most can be got with a bit of effort and a friend or two, or farm Sebilis/PoG if you prefer to buy your items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I use the OOIV because of greater overall hp. On raids with a bard, my resists are very rarely under 300 or so, so the hp on the OOIV are nice. Also, I don't like the look of the Tae Ew =\.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Judging by your attitude, you don't know the cost in both platinum and time. If you don't want to pay someone, get 250 skill and do it yourself, if its so easy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well I do know the cost; I thought I made that clear in my original post.  I also didn't say it was easy.  I said it was easy for me to find someone to do a combine for free, or for a small donation. <br />
<br />
As for my attitude, I was simply curious if it was a trend or not.  I don't have problems with people charging alot of money for combines, not at all.  I just wouldn't pay it myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Fleury Moistfeet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I went for the OOIV because of the raw hp/mana I gain from it. The AC is nice too.<br />
<br />
I think that the Tae Ew shield is very nice too, because of the resists gained. For now though, at least until I start encountering mobs which may require more resists, I'm sticking with the OOIV.</div></div><hr />
