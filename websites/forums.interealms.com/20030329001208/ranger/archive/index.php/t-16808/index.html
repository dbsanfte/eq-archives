<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arborlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there any difference in success rates when fletching (or any tradeskill for that matter) if that item is trivial?  In other words, will I have a better chance at succeeding on a class 1 wood point arrow (for example) if my skill is 200 as opposed to 100?<br />
<br />
I have searched around for an answer but if I have missed a thread somewhere, please point me in the right direction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is a formula that supposedly tells you the point of max success rate on an item based on trivial.  It was on the old EQtraders message boards, however, and I neither remember it or know if its been transferred to the new EQtraders boards.<br />
<br />
I suggest you ask over there.  Maybe someone over there recalls it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kapanen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is a mandatory 5% rate of failure on every item, regardless of your skill.  So you could make those easy arrows at skill 250 and still fail about 1 in 20.  Every once in awhile you'll get a long batch of successes, but the failures catch up eventually.<br />
<br />
The formula I have seen is:<br />
<br />
Chance = (YourSkill * 1.15) - (Trivial - 70)<br />
<br />
When I want to know what skill I need to have the best chance for a given trivial, I use this:<br />
<br />
YourSkill = (95 + (Trivial - 70)) / 1.15<br />
<br />
I used the 95 to reflect the 95% chance, but maybe it should be 100.  It's Mystery Math, but it gets pretty close.  I add a few skill points to make sure anyway.</div></div><hr />
