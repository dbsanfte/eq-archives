<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>darkfox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">1) Why does everyone call their wolf &quot;dogdog&quot;? Am I missing soemthing? I call mine &quot;puppy&quot;, but every Shaman I have bumped into says &quot;dogdog&quot; duuuuhhhhh<br />
<br />
2) I read that you can put 1-Handed weapons on your pet as long as they are not &quot;No Drop&quot;, and warrior/all? So what happens when your pet dies? Does it just pop back in your inventory or do you get a55ed out and have to get another sword?<br />
<br />
3) What is the average air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?<br />
<br />
I think that's it.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1.  *shrug* Mine is named Puddles.<br />
<br />
2.  No, there is no way to recover an item given to a pet.  If you hand it over, it's gone. (Unless you're like my guildie who handed his cleric epic to a mage pet, then you can petition a GM to have it restored.  Until he got it back, we had a lot of fun asking Jobober for rezzes!)<br />
<br />
3.  African or European?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">african or european swallow?<br />
<br />
1) Cause that's what i like to call him....<br />
<br />
2) Yes, weapons gone if you die, pet dies, you zone.  Once given to dogdog (puppy if you like), they are no longer retrievable.<br />
<br />
3) see above...<br />
<br />
Slow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I used to call mine dumbdruid, but the druids got offended.<br />
<br />
Now I mostly call her Goner.<br />
<br />
Bonus if I summon her with that name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xanivus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">1) I call mine......Wonder Mut!<br />
<br />
2) You lose the weapons and they dont have to be warrior/all<br />
<br />
3) They should never be unladen, they are always carrying coconuts!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hadina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">1) Blart Ba'Klomp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">1.   dogdog is my generic term for him, in use on the forum.<br />
      He's my puppy or Jobabr when I summon him<br />
      When he dies, he's a poodle puddle<br />
<br />
1b.  When I spirit call, there are enraged dr00ds flying out of my butt (it's a long-standing joke about me eating candied dr00d headz)<br />
<br />
2.  who said anything about them being only drop?  I accidentally fed my puppy my Sprinkler of the Spirits, thinking it was one of the FS maces I had and it took me two weeks to get back.  And of course, the cleric epic that glory meantion is no drop also :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">1.  Blart Ba'Klomp  <br />
<br />
exactly, he is the same person as fansy the famous good bard (if i remember correctly) he made a whole story about his search for his dogdog, it involved killing dorfs and elves, was a good read, but i couldnt find it in the 20 seconds i devoted to the endeavor.  People started using it in reference to their own pet's, and it stuck.<br />
<br />
i call mine puppy, or tuppy sometimes, or my special little guy.<br />
<br />
My horse on the other hand, his name is clip clop and he likes to eat sugar.<br />
<br />
2. has been covered<br />
<br />
3. an african or european swallow?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You can hand the mutt no drops, but Goner doesn't seem to know how to use them.  To verify - turn on all the battle spam.  When your pet stops 'hitting' and instead starts 'piercing', 'crushing', or 'slashing', you'll know if the mutt has decided to use the weapon(s) you've fed him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kaninfrenzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">1) Blart from FoH (Flowers of Happiness) is when I first heard it too:  http://www.notacult.com/episode4.htm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">1) As mentioned, Blart was hte inspiration for me. I tend to call mine Goner or... Well, I name it after whatever tank we have along at the moment... v. 2.0, of course. Nothing ticks off a Paladin more than calling your RangerDog by his name.<br />
<br />
2) Nope, it's gone<br />
<br />
3) Don't know, but if you hit it with a rock it'll be moving pretty slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>eq_newb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">how can an unladen swallow carry coconuts...i thought they were non-migratory...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Haneb Bobanen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">1) I call my dog Sparky.<br />
<br />
3) What if two swallows carried a coconut together?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Dogdog because of Fansy.  Just seemed funny at the time.  Now it's a habit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>sir0die</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i call mine fido or if you are french Phideux.<br />
