<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vageta31</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've seen a few of these threads on different boards, including this one, but I just love hearing stories from different people that remind me of the game that EQ once was. I'm not going to get into the arguement of it being better now or before, but I can tell you that I had much more fun in the game back then. So many things were broken, many classes unbalanced, the world was very crowded, etc.. but nonetheless it had a certain charm to it that has been all but lost since then. I started playing EQ during the final beta phase so I've seen a lot of changes in that time. I quit and came back many times through the years but I really stopped playing for the most part after Velious because that's when I felt it started to change too much for my taste.<br />
<br />
Anyways a quick recap of my first days in EQ. I started playing in the last phase of beta and after playing different classes I settled on starting a Ranger during release. Got him to level 20 and then rerolled a wood elf Druid and took him to 50 before PoF opened up. Back then hitting 50 quick wasn't trivial due to the crowding of the zones and lack of content to support the level 40+ crowd. Everything, and I mean everything that could give exp was camped. I only was able to do it because I worked swingshift and ended up playing all night long when the population was low. <br />
<br />
At any rate here are some things that I remember about the game back then, both good and bad, but they really stir up the memories. I'd love to hear from other about what they remember, especially what you were fond of.<br />
<br />
Remember when...<br />
<br />
Harmony didn't work. I was level 50 before they ever got harmony to do anything.<br />
<br />
Snare was better than ensnare. I think ensnare used to last less than snare even though it was higher level. No one could figure out what was better about it so no one even used it until it was fixed.<br />
<br />
You had to sit with spellbook closed to meditate until you hit level 35. That really sucked when I was kiting hill giants at level 29. I used to run far ahead then stop and med and wait for the footsteps to get close with earphones. I had it down to a science after a bit.<br />
<br />
Monks could wear rubicite armor for a short time.<br />
<br />
Shamans could charm. Imagine that heh.<br />
<br />
There used to be 80+ people in lower guk and you had to wait in line for a spot.<br />
<br />
Doing the paw of opolla quest and finding those damn rings. Especially from kerra isle.<br />
<br />
Permafrost was still perma-empty most of the time.<br />
<br />
Everyone had their own theory on how to spawn Pyzjin(sp?) and get the glowing black stone. I still don't know if it was ever officially figured out or if he still spawns to this day.<br />
<br />
Blackburrow was so crowded you could run to the deepest part and not see one spawn because everything was always camped. That and the constant &quot;TRAIN!&quot; spamming every 5 minutes. I think I saw my first surname on a player in this dungeon and wondered how in the hell they got 2 names.<br />
<br />
Befallen was a dungeon to be feared. I fell down the well before I was level 20 and convinced my 2 friends to follow me down and we actually worked our way to the locked door without a map. We died before it opened but damn I had white knuckles the whole time we fought our way there.<br />
<br />
The BBC(bone bladed claymore) was one of the uber weapons of the time. I camped mine for 12 hours with other people until i finally got mine and was so damn proud of it, even with the -agi modifier. I ran to unrest with that bad boy and unleashed fury(or so I thought).<br />
<br />
You knew Karg Icebear had the GZ when he was putting out a lightsource. They later added a lightstone to his drop table to throw off the farmers (me :P).<br />
<br />
When 50% of melee characters had no clue that their taunt wasn't working their entire character lives because they didn't train 1 point in it.<br />
<br />
When newbies griped at high level characters for killing their guards. Back then they were some of the only mobs to get exp from, unfortunately it made newbies have a harder time surviving.<br />
<br />
The mino lord was the bane of everyone in the steamfont zone. God I can't remember how many times I saw the mino lord being trained to the guards, not to mention how many times he killed me in that time. Thankfully I got my revenge.<br />
<br />
Jboots dropped from Drelsna and there was a constant line to get them.<br />
<br />
Everyone mid level player was in south karana killing aviaks, centaurs and of course the hermit.<br />
<br />
The Oaken Scimitar. God I remember how much hype evolved around that item that never even existed.<br />
<br />
The ancient crok in upper guk was camped 24/7.<br />
<br />
Dorn B'Dynn. Nuff said. I finally got revenge at level 30 with my druid.<br />
<br />
Ambassador Dvinn. Again, nuff said. I can't count the number of times I zoned in only to be handed my ass by him at the zone line. <br />
<br />
<br />
I'll add more as I think of them, but I'd love to hear from you old schoolers that are still around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>vageta31</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A few more...<br />
<br />
How could I forget the first time I ran from Kaladim to Qeynos. Somehow I made it all the way through the karanas and the commons without getting killed, pretty impressive without having SoW. The best part is that I made it to Qeynos as was about to /ooc for a bind and I went to hail the guard and hit attack instead. Oops.<br />
<br />
Killing Broon in East Karana and then getting the heck out of dodge when Proon showed up.<br />
<br />
The first time I tried to run through high hold pass, not to mention camping my first PGT and CDS.<br />
<br />
Nillipus! God I remember waiting for that little bastard to spawn and sing his song so I could slay him with my druid.<br />
<br />
The music that played when you were in WK and the bridge to EK started to appear. To that day it was my favorite EQ music and used to give me goosebumps. Unfortunately it's long gone with the newer music changes.<br />
<br />
Hating darkness because back then it truly did blind you. It was hard to find items with ultra/infravision, let alone anyone that was able to cast it on you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yes finding magic boots and also shield to bash and kick with. We take so many things for granted back then.<br />
<br />
I used to farm hero bracers as they were uber back then, especially for monks. Which brings to mind that they never had any 1h or 2h weapons back then that were worth a crap. You just accepted that you fought with fists back then.<br />
<br />
My first magic weapon was BBC and it was so tough to get. I think I sold it for like 100pp when i rerolled as a druid. <br />
<br />
Remember when every single Derv and Orc camp in the commons, Ro and Oasis were camped? Those old zones were so bustling with players back then, I really miss that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>vageta31</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I actually miss those hours I spent during the weekends in the EC bazaar. I used to farm all week long during the late night hours and then spend all day Saturday and Sunday selling my items and buying new ones. I used to pretty much rule Permafrost, Upper Guk, Sol A and anything else I wanted with my level 50 druid because no one else was there late at night. I don't even remember how many manastones I looted from that Evil Eye and it sickened me to know how much they were worth after I stopped playing and gave them away hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>vageta31</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I remember the first time I went LD on the boat in OOT and logged back in under water.

I honestly felt scared for my druid's life and was nervous all the way to an island.<br />
<br />
That is what's missing from EQ nowadays. Uncertainty. Back then you really didn't know what could happen because no one had done it all yet. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I didn't start until just before luclin time, but here are a few memories that I remember.<br />
<br />
Always loved playing a warrior, started one up in freeport (human) and spent first 8 hours playing trying to figure out where the guild was at.  Finally found it, ran up to the guild master, and died with the quickness when i hit attack.<br />
<br />
Spent the first 2 nights trying to figure out why no one was answering me (i was talking in /say).. until i chanced upon someone who explained how to send a tell to someone, and how to use /ooc and /shout.<br />
<br />
Was a nice lady that was a higher level than I was, hanging around freeport and told the zone that she was giving away free &quot;buffs&quot;.  So i went over to her, hailed her, then proceeded to click off every thing that she gave to me cause I didn't understand what it was or did.<br />
<br />
Was in oasis at 16 with the warrior, and a shaman came by and asked if I wanted to group.  He was level 17 and gave me all these kick ass buffs and sow (OMG).  Not to mention he was outmeleeing me.  Was then that I decided I wanted to be a shaman.<br />
<br />
When I started playing again a few months later, had a few RL friends who helped us a little bit.. so had 9 of us or so in Lake Rathe and the two higher level guys were chain pulling the Aviaks for us.  Man, i was so scared, especially when I had to camp there.  Since I played at a differnent time than the rest of my Rl friends, I didn't want to stay there for fear of not knowing how to find my way back out or dying in a place I had no clue how to get to.  So, I made the trip from Lake Rathe, through Ferrott, through the swamp, through the Ros, and back to freeport to bind myself.  I swear, to this day my heard was thumping out of my chest the entire time.  I was so scared to die and lose my corpse.<br />
<br />
One of my uber RL friends gave me a spine chill spear, and it was awesome.  I was kicking ass with it, even though I couldn't get it to proc at my level (16).  I was at work one day, and my roommate (played a rogue of the same level) called and said that he had something to tell me.  Seems he let his brother borrow it to look at the stats on it, and when he went to give it back to him, he gave it to his pet instead (necro pet).  So, I ended up going about another 20 levels without a weapon cause of that. <br />
<br />
Peddling my sow potions in EC for three weeks in a row.  Made me more money than all my other friends had combined.  I bound myself at the spires in TD, and was willing to travel anywhere to give them to anyone.  I sold them a lot.  Eventually I sold enough to get back my spear, and also the howling harpoon to use in my range slot.  The money I made from these also let me have enough cash to upgrade other slots so that when I soloed, it wasn't that hard.  I do remember sitting there and doing all the combines I could, then ended up one or two short of a 10 charge, so I'd run back out and kill a few more things in everfrost, come back, fail the combine and have to go out and find more stuff to sell to get money to attempt another combine... ahh, the fun times.<br />
<br />
First pickup raid was fighting Vox/Naggy.  One weekend I spent all four days of it, sitting in the zone while they went out and tried to get people to help us.  Everytime that we did it, it ended up taking 8 hours a day to do it.  Man, that sucked, but it was fun.  Only ended up killing Naggy once, and dind't get vox.  However, I did think that once I got vox slowed (then again, this was before I realized that you could have more than one chat window, and also before I knew how to filter out stuff).  Naggy died that time standing over me, with me and three others left alive.  I got the KS too on it with melee hehe.<br />
<br />
First real raid was hate.  I get a tell saying that they needed a shaman on the raid to help this guild.  I'm there, i get told what to do.  I zone in, and proceed to get smeared.  Since i'm the only shaman, they rez me back up quickly, and I'm sitting there and this guy sends me a tell and asks how my mana was.  I'm like, it's fine.. &quot;why&quot;.  I end up seeing the message &quot;Valsuvious twitches&quot;  Now.. *** is happening to me.  Took me a while and he explained.  That raid lasted 12 hours, and by the end of it, we had just gotten past the Maestro and they didn't think we had enough time to get to Innoruk.  <br />
<br />
Remember my first Plane of Air raid.  I was the only shaman on that night, and I got raped literally.  I swear, if a spider was near the raid, it was on top of my corpse.  I must have died about 20 times that night.  It was just a little bit better than my first PoEarth rings fight.  That time I was one of two shaman there, and was before I learned really all the mechanics of slowing.  I ended up dying about 10 times that night too, and at least four times on that first ring for slowin too early.<br />
<br />
First real raid with my current guild was that same earth ring.  This time, the guild had a lot of experience with it, so I remember that all I saw the entire time was mobs just everywhere.  These guys must have pulled about 20 mobs at once, cause there was always something in the camp, and always had at least 10 on their way to the camp.  Was awesome.<br />
<br />
The excitement of waiting in line with the guild (i was still a recruit and not tagged yet) after their Rathe kill.  We formed a huge line outside of PoI entrance area, and waited for the jar to combine to make our Time key.  Was just exciting to know that we finally did it, and that even though I wasn't in the guild yet, I knew that I had helped contribute greatly on the victory.  Was exciting zoning into time the first time.  <br />
<br />
For me, true excitement comes when you beat something that you really put a lot of time and effort into.  I will always remember the thrill of that first Rathe victory, that first Quarm victory, first Barxt, first Noqufiel.  Those were the fights that really meant something when your guild persevered and got through it after failing several times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Reeva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">How about when there were boats and they were on a regular schedule and you get get drunk and fall off the boat and learn new languages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The anticipation of something new.... <br />
<br />
Like that first boat ride to overthere.. the calm voyage.  Lots of time to chat and reflect.  Watching the sun go down over the water....<br />
<br />
And then that adrenaline rush as you have to leap off the boat and swim to the outskirts of town to avoid the meanest, red'est guards you've ever seen.  Finally dragging your dripping wet body up on shore.. and seeing HUGE golems patrolling the walls...  <br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but to everyone that thought PoK books were great... bah.  It was the sense of realism that both bored you and excited you. You can't have light without dark.  <br />
<br />
I think what happened to EQ was this:<br />
<br />
Everything they added to make the game &quot;user friendly&quot;, ended up muting the realism of the world.  And while you sure appreciated the ease at which you could do things.. in the back of your mind.. something was missing.  That something was a world that felt concrete, something so similar to reality, yet still fantasy.. that you found yourself engrossed.</div></div><hr />

I was so scared that I would die, and half the group took the boats, and the other half ran there from wherever they ported to.  In the end, only the ones that took the boat made it.  I remember getting rebound in FV and dying six times from the stupid spiders in FV on the way to LOIO.  Those bastards.  My warrior spend a year in LOIO camped at the windmill because I didn't want to move him and risk dying to the stupid spiders.<br />

- on that note, my first trip to Velious.  Took the boat to Iceclad.  Stepped foot onto land.  See the villiage right there, took three steps and proceeded to get smeared by a derv.  Got back to my corpse, took there more steps, smeared by a derv.  God I hated those things.  Finally had to have a cleric friend of mine come and rez me, then kill the dervs so that I could move a bit.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>vageta31</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I think the one major thing back then was that people were different. The world was so new that we relied on each other and helped and trusted one another more. I made so many good friends back then that I never have a chance to meet anymore. I've had random people help me do CR back then that would never consider it nowadays because it takes away their grinding time. Remember RAK(random acts of kindness)? It used to happen a lot but I don't see it much anymore and when I do see it it's more like charity. Giving a newbie 100pp or a nice item means less when you have 500k in the bank. However helping someone when you're not much better off than them means a lot, even if it's just a time investment and not an item.<br />
<br />
Get this story. I was killing Gnolls in high hold because I'd heard about the infamous PGT. Well I was killing with a friend and the named Gnoll popped, I ran over and unleashed all I had to get him killed. Another guy came up and started beating on him and thought he was teh bad guy but little did I know he was being camped(didn't even know what camped was back then) and I had stolen the kill. I explained I didn't know he was there, etc.. but I didn't want to give it up because I wasn't sure if he was lying. However I promised that I'd camp it again for him and he agreed probably thinking I was full of it(weren't lore back then). Well the next day I went and got another one and promptly sent a /t to him telling him I have one for him. I think he was shocked I actually did it but we remained friends until I left that server.<br />
<br />
Another time I camped the BBC for about 12 hours and I was 2nd in line. It took like 6-7 hours to drop the first time and even though the guy who got it could have left he didn't because he was returning the favor for helping him. The other people in the group with me stayed until I got one even though they didn't stand a chance of getting one. Why? They were generous and at the time it was a big deal to get one so they wanted to experience something fun. Befallen was a dangerous place at level 20 back then so it wasn't a piece of cake.</div></div><hr />

Running around in Shadeweaver, and someone came up and cast this Spirit of the Wolf thing on me. OMG I'M ZOOMING AROUND! THIS IS SO FUN! I can get to mobs faster and run away if I'm about to die! WOW!<br />
<br />
So then I learn that I, too, can cast this amazing spell once I turn 9!  Someone tells me I should go to Paludal Caverns at my age, but I decide I should wait until I can cast that so very useful SoW, so hold off and keep grinding away in Shadeweavers until I reach that magical number.  I run and get my spell; FINALLY I can go take on the new area in style!  ...only to learn, once my very first cast wore off, that Paludal is indoors... and see for the first time, &quot;You may only cast that spell outdoors.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wanting to get through Paludal SOOO much... there's a city on the other side! And then the Nexus, to get to the whole rest of the world!

<br />
First time in Old Sebilis, following around some higher level guildmates who knew the ropes (OMG, a 60 cleric, I'll never never be that strong!) Trying to escort the warrior to the exit since the group had no porter -- invis, hoping to bypass some critters -- and dying under a huge pile of frogs while the warrior made it out just fine (I still wish I had a screen shot of that death, just my tail sticking out from under sixteen bajillion frogs).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I started playing just after the release of Luclin, but I only had the trilogy until I got to level 40 on Raccoo.<br />
<br />
My first character was a ranger, the first time I logged on my graphics card was so bad that all I could do was turn around and talk (very delayed) with my two real life friends who made new characters (druid and cleric) to group with me. I managed get inside the ranger guild where I watched my dwarf cleric friend sit in a fire to toast his buns.<br />
I bought a new video card so I could play (voodoo3 I think). <br />
<br />
Next I remember being lost in Gfay, dying to that darned orc centurian that saw me running by in the darkness. Losing all my newby gear (sword, tunic, food and drink) at level 3~. Then around level 5 a nice druid gave me some tizmak pants and shirt, and a shaded sword (OMG the ubber! Wasn't magical though). I was chased from Kelethin to Kaladim by a guy who wanted to trade swords with me because it looked cool (that's my only guess now, I -think- he was wanting to trade me his centi LS/SS). I rejected the offer and tried to ignore the fellow. lol...I was a noob. <br />
<br />
Around level 14-16 I accidentally attacked the vender that's near the bank in Kelethin, then ran away and died on one side of the platform. When I ran back and looted my corpse, I noticed I couldn't buy/sell with the merchant anymore. So I thought it was my duty to move him back into his place so that everyone would be able to trade with him. I died two more times before getting him into place I think. I got no rezzes, but back then I probably didn't even know such a thing existed.<br />
<br />
When I went to sister island in OoT to do part of the trueshot quest, I was attacked by someone who I thought was another player. I kept telling them to stop attacking me and sent a couple of friends tells asking why would another player attack me. It seriously freaked me out and I died...again (ranja down!). Figured out later that it must've been a pirate, although I'm still not sure about where he came from since I didn't see him before I sat on the dock to wait for the boat.<br />
<br />
Hitting level 17 in CB and wanted to keep leveling in the same zone. Eventually went to HHP (omg the journey). Then HHK (THE LISTS WERE THIS ----------------------------------- long! Then I retired my ranger at 32, and I made an enchanter because I was tired of dying so much. =)<br />
<br />
It took my first day of playing the enchanter to figure out how to navigate Qeynos. I followed the walls all over until I found the zoneline to North Qeynos. I had fun in the newbie ground, and Qhill, except when the ranger killed me just because my dumb pet attacked a wolf that attacked me first!! =P<br />
<br />
Moving on to BB, where an ogre warrior taught me how to mez (and the others in the group not to BREAK mez). One group went into WK and on the way there I was attacked by a lion and killed. The druid(s) was(were) afraid to heal me or something... I ran back and looted my corpse, then found where they were killing stuff. Not too long after that they had adds and I was mezzing stuff, but then another lion attacked and killed me... I left that group.<br />
At around level 14 the groups stopped wanting me so much.<br />
<br />
I could go on...but it's taking me long to write all this (write, delete, rewrite, delete, etc). And I want to be lazy and read a book. =P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Joril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I am a true oldie.  started playing in beta 3.  i cant believe no one mentioned this one yet... after you died, if you consented someone to drag it for you, they could loot EVERYTHING from your corpse.  you had to really trust someone or be REALLY desperate to get your corpse.  I remember people dying in the CT maze and never finding their corpse.  that scared me so much i memorized that freaking maze.  I use to volunteer to help people recover corpses when they ran the wrong way and invis failed.<br />
<br />
i remember getting my first piece of banded armor and thinking how tough i was then.<br />
<br />
fighting solo in black burrow while others had to group.<br />
<br />
this has been said, but its a fond memory, running through the tunnel from permafrost to BB completely blind and zoning multiple times until you figured out which way to face after you zoned.<br />
<br />
HATING the damn run along the river in west karana (that zone STILL feels like the longest trip) because it was the safest route.<br />
<br />
dinging 50 (highest you could get at the time)  and running down the east karana ramp, talking in guild chat about how happy i was to finally ding 50.... then promptly running of the edge of ramp and falling to my death and BEGGING a guild cleric to come res me.  yeah i had levitate, but didnt have any frigging bat wings to cast it and who needed it anyway?  its a wide ramp and nothing can hurt me in that zone........<br />
<br />
spending DAYS in PoHate and never seeing a bp drop!<br />
<br />
getting bumped back into the zone you just left because there was only one zone point and if someone stood there, they blocked it.<br />
<br />
falling into the mistmore zone line knowing i was dead and going to bind in permafrost (had forgot to rebind) and then zoning into lfey with ONE hp.<br />
<br />
timing buffs in groups (man people thought i was THE shaman, becuase buffs never faded in my groups, i refreshed just before they faded), then having someone new join and screwing up my timing!<br />
<br />
Kunark coming out and seeing the ghostly mobs in karnors for the first time!  WOW they were cool.<br />
<br />
having to have the key to sebilis on you or you couldnt zone in... which meant if you died in sebilis and didnt have a cleric in group you were screwed.<br />
<br />
my first trakanon kill and it dropping the first shaman bp on the server and me getting it.<br />
<br />
my giant faction legs from ToV and never having to mem sta again to buff entire raids!<br />
<br />
the first group buffs!  that was a god send!<br />
<br />
finishing my veeshan peak key and being the first in my guild to zone in and kill anything (was part of an alliance at that time).<br />
<br />
making resist potions for VP raids to raise my alchemy skill.<br />
<br />
joining a new 'uber' guild and killing Aary for the first time as a guild.  then spending entire weekends clearing ToV.<br />
<br />
the first time I zoned in western wastes and seeing all those dragons roaming around.  I love that zone to this day.  something about killing dragons is so much fun.<br />
<br />
Getting the form of the great bear and becoming the coca cola polar bear!<br />
<br />
having a shaman friend from a another guild give me cana3, then promptly going back to cana2 because cana3 fizzled WAY to much to be usefull.<br />
<br />
learning the canni dance!<br />
<br />
camping a jaundice bone bracer and never having one drop, then being given one at a PoFear raid and being deliriously happy (its nice to have friends)<br />
<br />
last one, but in no way least and leaving alot out, waiting for a TA to drop over and over.  life changing so cant play as long or often and figuring i would never see one.  then logging in one day to find myself snared at the time entrance in PoTranq.  taking 10 minutes to figure out im snared because i have my entire cash savings on me (WAY over the weight limit).  then spending the next 20 minutes crawling to bank, while the entire guild is laughing their butts off at me.  knowing something must be up at this point.  when i get to bank going through every bag (im a tradeskill freak, so they are all full) and finding a TA buried in one of them!!!!!!!!  was the last time our guild got that far in time before it broke up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>vageta31</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Going through BB blind is one of the most common memories any of us have. I remember how scary it was to run past all of those guards and hope to hell you made it. Even though it was a short run there was plenty ways to get killed.<br />
<br />
I too used to walk backwards to follow the torches to find my way down the tunnel. Back then no one was high enough to cast vision spells and no items other than uber ones had that as an effect. We really did have it hard back then...<br />
<br />
BB really was one of my favorite dungeons. I hope they never ever update it to be higher level because it is probably the most popular newbie dungeon. I spent a lot of time in crushbone as well but the trains in BB were legendary and when the game first came out you couldn't go 5 minutes without seeing a huge gnoll train. It felt so good to be higher level when you could start picking gnolls off the train and saving newbies. They must have thought we were gods back then for doing that.</div></div><hr />

Watching the mobs drop from the sky around Freeport.  Or even better the duos that would spawn and float for a few seconds before descending.<br />
<br />
Dying in Netulous forest as a human and never being able to find your corpse.<br />
<br />
Dying muliple times at the back way down to the evil eyes in Runnyeye since you didn't know about the /corpse command.<br />

Having to endure the massive number of scammers who were trying to trick you with &quot;potions&quot; or other game enhancing things that didn't exist.<br />

<br />
Dreading the trips through E. Commonlands because of the auctions there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything on me for sale at torch 1.  Lots of good monk stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Asking for a PC on a jade mace in EC and having the trader's alt character respond with a bogus price.<br />
<br />
Logging in to find that your large number of Crushbone shields are now &quot;pending lore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Falling off the boat and getting your swimming up to 70 before you find land and can board again.<br />
<br />
Being in awe of the first person you have ever seen wearing plate armor.<br />
<br />
Discovering that you can do quests multiple times.<br />
<br />
The ugly realization that faction does matter and you can't go to the N. Freeport bank anymore.<br />
<br />
The first time you see someone with levitate on.<br />
<br />
&quot;/auc Paying 600pp for Flowing Black Robe&quot; and everyone falls over having never seen that much plat in one place before.<br />
<br />
Being laughed out of newbie zones trying to sell backpacks for 50pp.<br />
<br />
The first time you fought a mob that some enc. charmed and buffed the snot out of.<br />
<br />
Selling honeycombs for outrageous prices to the people finishing up the stein of moggokk quest before it was nerfed.<br />
<br />
Watching a single wizzy steal all your group's xp at the bandit camps by casting a single spell when the mob was close to death.<br />
<br />
Getting paid well to run to W. Karanas to buff a necro and his pet who are camping the barbs.<br />
<br />
Watching all the griefers spread money and weapons around the arenas and killing any newbies that wander in.<br />
<br />
That first magical time you use an AOE spell or song and the guards make pulp out of ya.<br />
<br />
Having to explain to everyone that you weren't trying to kill them with AOE songs.<br />
<br />
Discovering that you can kite stuff.  And spending several days doing nothing else.<br />
<br />
Getting yelled at and numerous /duel requests after you get tired of a character and twink your replacement with blackened alloy armor.  People were furious initally to see lower level toons with better armor.<br />
<br />
Sitting in the first room in befallen with everyone else, and having the first level 30 character come in to map the place.<br />
<br />
Watching the first giant go down in Oasis.  Everything changed the day that you realized that they could be killed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Lorianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Wow, brings back memories.  Won't duplicate the lot, but I did most of them.  Been playing since 12/99.  Here are two that stick out for me.<br />
<br />
Making level 30 and going back and getting revenge on my first &quot;I hate you, I hate you, I hate you&quot; mob .. Ambassador Da'Vin in Crushbone.  I smiled the rest of the night off that kill.<br />
<br />
Last week - doing a tipt trial for some backflaging.  War, ranger, mage, cleric, enchanter and shaman.  Enchanter went ld with cable outage before first mini mob, and never came back.  <br />
<br />
We opted to finish it with 5.  We are all on teamspeak, so our response time is instantaneous - and we needed it.  The slow crawl up, the getting caught at one major crossroads, and ending up with add, after add, after add, for a total of 6 and living through it. <br />
<br />
Huffing and puffing forward.  Always looking over our shoulders, canna'ing like I have never canna'd before.  Praying for crit heals, crit anything.  Making it to the boss mob.  Being too cocky and dying to him.  Sad ending, but what a journey.  All of us being so over-loaded that we could barely hear each other on teamspeak.<br />
<br />
Two feelings that speak volumes on why I still play the game.<br />
<br />
Lorianna<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>vageta31</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Here's an good one for those that grew up in Faydwer. How can you forget that pair of Ogre's that would run through ButcherBlock and slaughter everything in their path. One was a shaman, the female one while the male was a warrior, both had SoW so you never had a chance to outrun them. I remember the first day me and a friend managed to kill them, the whole zone was cheering. Unfortunately they respawned like every other mob so people went on getting slaughtered after we left. I haven't been in BB in ages but I wonder if they still spawn. I doubt it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>refresh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Stuff I learned/newb moments<br />
Getting attacked from behind by a griffon and not knowing what one was.  I though it was a PC of some sort.<br />
<br />
Killing the DE outside of Qeynos over and over again and then trying to run through highpass  I think I died 8 times that night.  That was a hard lesson in faction.<br />
<br />
Buying banded armor off a guy in EC for 1p per AC.  (lol that was a lot of money to me at the time).<br />
<br />
Accidentally selling a jade mace (that my friend loaned me at 25) to a vendor for 1cp by accident.  Hard lesson in petitioning.<br />
<br />
A friend told me to stay around qeynos until I was a higher lvl because of bandits.  I remember thinking that bandits would take my stuff after they killed me.<br />
<br />
Finding out the hard way why you need a magic weapon to kill willow whisps.<br />
<br />
I remember the first time someone was trying to explain the &quot;stay here while I pull&quot; stratagy.  It was in Oasis killing crocs.<br />
<br />
Dont walk into the hollow tree stump in Black Burrow.<br />
<br />
I remember brining diseased pelts to the lady in Qeynos to get cure disease cast on me.<br />
<br />
Being asked why I wasn't slowing the orcs in EC and not know what the hell he was talking about.<br />
<br />
Seeing my first dragon in DL (gore) and watching him kill every person in my group except me and not know why.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>bumluc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I think one of my most memorable moments of all time in any game happened in EQ... starting as a DE and finding the pyramid.  Running across the 3 piles of bones on the ground and seeing them jump up and start beating me silly.  I don't think I managed to hit attack - it scared the hell out of me.  I was hooked for 5 years...<br />
<br />
Having a high level mage gather a group of newbies and have us all pick a number from 1 to 10 and giving away an EE bag.<br />
<br />
The random acts of kindness (that seem to have disapeared.)<br />
<br />
EC for the auctions.<br />
<br />
First trip to befallen.<br />
<br />
Getting my epic (back when it couldn't be duo'd) still brings back a lot of emotion.<br />
<br />
-bum</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">haha, Joril.  That reminds me.. that first trip up to hate.. when I wasn't even with my guild, was just helping a guild who needed a shaman, I looted the bp up there that dropped.  Was the only one who could use it so yeah..<br />
<br />
Was remembering other stuff as I was reading others responses.  <br />
<br />
First time I went to the karanas to turn in my parts for the epic to the wandering spirit.  The bastard wouldn't hold still he kept moving off when I was trying to give it to him.  I happening to be two boxing that at the time (a ranger friend of mine so that I could track him down).  Well, i got the bright idea to just root him.  So I proceeded to do it and ended up killing him by accident before I could do the turn in :(<br />
<br />
On the test of patience, I had to redo the thing four times before I finally got what I needed, and even then I got lucky.  Basically the first time that I went there, I was a lower level, but I was safe with invis to animals on.  Well, somewhere inside of the first 30 min invis dropped and I ended up getting agroed and died.  Okay, went back a few levels later and sat down there.  Same thing happened.  Waited there about 30 min and ended up having to gate cause of agro.  So, next time I went there, I was fine.  I was there another 30 min when I receive this serverwide message that the server was going down for an emergency patch in 30 min.  At this point, I've already been there a long time, and Abe was just ready to spawn, so I thought that I'd be okay.  Well, abe spawned, gave me the arrow and left.  I think &quot;man, i'm almost done, i can't wait&quot;.  Well, about 2 min later, bam.. server comes down 15 min early.  I'm so pissed.  I was within minutes of completing it and I lost it.  I petitioned it and of course, they wouldn't/couldn't do anything about it.  So, I finally go back there, wait the 30 min or whatnot and Abe spawned.  I'm sitting there, and I can see him talking, but I can't find where he's at.  I couldn't find him, but could hear him speak.  I can't remember if he talked to me either when I said the text.  So, he despawns, and the greater spirit spawns, and I can't find him either.  Somewhere in the time my sense of direction got messed up and I had no clue what was the up out of the water direction and what was the land direction.  I couldn't do anything.  Fortunetly somehow I managed to find the spirit after he had spawned for what seemed like an hour, and even though I couldn't get close to him, I managed to hail him and receive the piece.  To this day I seriously cringe at this part of the quest.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">All of these are pre Kunark. I could probably do one for every expansion!<br />
<br />
Duels were zone wide so you got lots of &quot;OJ defeated Nichole in a duel to the death&quot; (if I remeber correctly for a little bit they were server wide announcements)<br />
<br />
I killed the stupid Gypsie in the Karanas over and over again until she gave me level 50. I was then given a serverwide Announcement stating I had reached level 50 and must have got 100 freekin tells ranging from congrats, to questions, to &quot;you no life having fool.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hating the crap out of the madmen in the oasis zones that would nuke the crap out of you if you. Then later the spectors dropping the box of nil? MMMMM.. That was great loot.<br />
<br />
I will never forget the first time our guild killed naggy. It was a server first and I was blown away by the huge red dragon. It had to be the coolest thing I had ever saw in a video game. I was so blown away I wouldnt stop talking about it for a week at least.<br />
<br />
You used to be able to log into a character no matter if they were playing or not. The person who was playing first would turn into a &quot;ghost&quot; they were not actually in the game as their characters but were able to go around anywhere without worries of aggro or death. A lot of maps were made this way. This is also the reason you have to deal with the stupid active character errors now.<br />
<br />
To this day I still kill Dorn B' Dynn anytime I run through North Ro, that little bastage killed our groups so many times. Everytime we leveled we would go back to see if we could take him yet. I took so much pleasure from the first time I was able to backstab him in one shot. That picture was my desktop for 2 months.<br />
<br />
The flipping line for Jboots. OMG waiting for hours (up to 24 hours) to get in line for those things killed me. But the day I got my set was one hell of a day. I was so thrilled.<br />
<br />
Unrest was the place to go. You could practically run through the entire house without seeing a mob. As soon as one popped you grabbed it and it didnt matter if multiple mobs all popped at once because you knew that by the time you got to your group you would be lucky to have one mob. The dwarven boots were madly craved after!<br />
<br />
My first trip into Najena was with a group of RL friends we all worked together at a computer store and would play all day long. We were sneaking in there and everyone kept asking... &quot;are you practicing sense traps?&quot; That was sooooo cool. During a fight we found a secret wall because one of us backed out of aggro. Life could not have gotten any better at that time. We were all so amazed.<br />
<br />
The day my druid got his manastone. It sucked so bad when they nerfed it! I still think how kick arse it would be with the sitting mana regen in the game now! /shiver.<br />
<br />
I used to spend a lot of time in Befallen working on my lockpick skills. It was during the time when you could loot someones corpse once you had consent. I loved helping people recover their bodies but hated having to convince them to consent me. It finally came down to them dying 3-4 times trying to get their body before they would risk consenting me.<br />
<br />
I think I still have a level 1 monk in PoF in full PoF fear armor.<br />
<br />
Going to the Ro's to buy a magic weapon way before we were high enough to go there! I think we made that trip at lvl 5.<br />
<br />
Haha, cant believe this is a good memory but when the GM's used to do events and their events involved death touching people until some lucky SoB blew the gm and got a nice weapon or piece of armor. It was great when the calls went out and all the sudden X zone was filled with 300 people and it was total confusion but it was still a blast.<br />
<br />
Oh early on you could go LD and the mob would ignore you. So if you were in a fight and getting your butt kicked you could pull your modem cord and live to see another day! And because you could log right back into a LD character there was no worries about not getting back on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Not realising that I could buy armour from players far cheaper than from a vendor, and paying 70+pp for a single piece of armour in Qeynos. <br />
<br />
People have said it many times, but the Blackburrow trains. My God, I hope they never change that zone. <br />
<br />
Seeing Lord Elgnub for the first time, killing him, and then finding out that the darn quest was broken, and remained broken for nearly 4 years after that point.<br />
<br />
Feeling uber in blackburrow because you were killing Elites, but knowing that someone else out there was killing the commanders!<br />
<br />
Getting max faction with all the related Stein of Moggok races because I did it so many times with my enchanter.<br />
<br />
First time in Kunark, LoIO - damn! Those mobs hit HARD compared to Karanas mobs!<br />
<br />
ToV.  'nuff said. (I LOVE that zone!)  I never really liked Velious until I got to ToV.<br />
<br />
Finding out my Iksar can bank in Runnyeye, then killing the halfling guards over and over and over and over and ... (you get the picture) so I could make some plat and xp at the same time!<br />
<br />
Karnors Castle.  People were still scared to go there, and if you were in there, you had to be Uber, but the only really uber thing about that zone, (even when people first started to get into it) was the trains.<br />
<br />
Petitioning for my first ever surname.  It was the stupidest surname ever, (my excuse is that I was young and naive) but I was sooo proud of it when I finally got it.<br />
<br />
So many other memories, many of them relating to the 'magic' of EQ for the Original/Kunark/Velious zones and first times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Two of my most memorable moments from my early days:<br />
<br />
Finishing the Trueshot Longbow on my first char and being so excited I could kill things in the gfay newbie area with one shot with it I called my wife in to show her how cool it was.<br />
<br />
Not long after Kunark came out and I had switched to this char, I was 18th lvl or so exping in LoIO and someone pulled a Bloodgill goblin to the beach. Three groups of us, all 17-19, decided to jump it. The resulting 10 min battle was to this day one of the funnest things ive done in EQ I think...not only did we win, but I was one of the 5 (out of 18) still standing at the end.</div></div><hr />

I first tried mine after a patch that modified pathing. I triggered the event, ran to the spot and waited there with a friend for an hour or so without even seeing the first spirit. Ran back to the island, and saw Ooglyn stuck in a loop, colliding with a ship and warping back to her spawn point. Test of patience indeed... : :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">So many memories - a lot were about how helpful and kind people were.<br />
<br />
Getting given 10pp at lvl 4 in newbie zone, meant i could buy all my lvl 1, lvl 5 and some lvl 9 spells :)<br />
<br />
Getting given a Glowing Wooden Crook at lvl 9 because I ran acrross Feerot to give an uber lvl 30 warrior a sow.<br />
<br />
A lvl 40 bard letting me buy a Charred Guardian Shield for 356pp (I still remember) when the going price was 500pp because it was all the money I had earned in my life up to lvl 28 killing treants in SK.<br />
<br />
Soloing Grizzleknot at lvl 29 in SK (well, helped by a wouldbe KS'ing mage :p) and having a totemic BP at lvl 30 - I was uber.<br />
<br />
Getting full set of totemic by lvl 35, I owed money for months to pay for all the dufrenite to guildies.<br />
<br />
Our entire guild running through the sky over DL, setting up near BW entrance in the main field and eventually wiping to the millions of adds :)<br />
<br />
Our entire guild getting keyed for Seb then doing a raid to Disco, all 18 of us and only 3-4 characters over lvl 50 - loads of shouts and ooc's about how we were going to wipe - didn't happen :)<br />
<br />
Surviving cleric LD in Seb Armorer camp with me and a druid to cover heals, I had about 6-7 adds all root parked and slowly rotting away with dots. <br />
<br />
Mentioned before - but seeing a serverwide duel message &quot;Everquest has defeated Ultimaonline in a duel to the death&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking 50 days to ding lvl 50 - and people being amazed at how fast I had levelled :)<br />
<br />
96 people in Lower Guk and 130 people in South Karana<br />
<br />
My first Ring War, PoF and PoH raids. First ToV raids, dying less than 8 times a raid was a miracle for me in ToV.<br />
<br />
Finally getting the piece from the Hole, killing Rhak and not following script so I gave the wrong piece to Fallen spirit - having to drag my entire guild back down the Hole again to repeat that part :(<br />
<br />
Getting epic 1.0 - it stayed equipped until a couple of months ago when I got a Mithril Battlehammer, and now replaced by epic 1.5<br />
<br />
First character was a paladin, soloing a goblin wiz - had him down to 30-40% while I was on 20%. Thinking no problem I can LoH, casting LoH and healing the freaking goblin wiz to full hps :(<br />
<br />

<br />
Running through BB on my way to Unrest at lvl 20 (i'd heard about the uber xp there) and a whole group of lowbies fleeing from me thinking I was the ogre npc :)<br />

Getting chased by Wisps you thought you could handle, all the way around Eruds Crossing. Several laps.<br />

Running at level 9 from Qeynos to Oasis of Marr to get vision spells, only to get sandwiched by a sand giant when browsing the gypsy vendors.<br />

rofl yes, that was the best ever from Kunark.  I had forgotten all about that, but the response from the zone would always crack me up when it happened. :)<br />

Being solo Shaman on a Hate raid and getting an almost complete set of Runed Etched armor.  Having to go outside and yell in exhiliration when the BP drops.  Never did get the hat though.  : (  <br />
<br />
Or camping up there for a week doing clears, praying it would drop, and having a cleric camped in case of the all too frequent trains to safe spot.  Course, I never got that silly hat either :(<br />

And OMG, if they dropped a tusk, you could sell it for 9-10pp!  And...and...sometimes they dropped two!  Sheesh, I am king of the world...Totally rich!<br />

Remember your first &quot;kiting&quot; experience with those same mammoths later on?   Dot, run like hell, sit, listen carefully for the pounding feet...up and run, turn and hit the dot key until the purple bar showed they were in range?  Then run like a little girl again.

All Barbarian groups out in the tundra! 3 warriors, 2 shamans, and a rogue = Group! Watch out for Snow Orc Shamans!<br />
<br />
Blackburrow trains. Can't be given enough praise.<br />
<br />
Running to East Commons at level 8, because my friend could get me an orc group. Then running back when the group was over.<br />
<br />
Getting lucky and having like three High Quality Bear Pelts, selling them for 30 plat each, and using the resulting plat to buy some Imbued Northman armor!<br />
<br />
Seeing a level 16 necromancer kill an orc in the oasis that was red to me at 17. I was awestruck.<br />
<br />
Getting level 24. With affliction and Envenomed Breath those big mammoths would just Melt!<br />
<br />
Camping that goddamn glacier bear. I swear I saw that stupid lich in my sleep.<br />
<br />
Having two of those Tribunal ivory earrings, and seeing a shaman wearing 2 orc fang earrings, and wondering why. The response? &quot;I need the HP.&quot; pure gold.<br />
<br />
Seeing a shaman in polar bear form standing outside permafrost 2 weeks after velious was released.<br />
<br />
Finishing the epic! Mage pet tankage!<br />
<br />
Buying Torpor at like level 59 for 70k after spending months upon months searching, and owing people money for like 4 months after that. I did grind my ass off to ding though ;p<br />
<br />
Howling Stones groupage. This is without a doubt the best zone in EQ hands down. They need to leave it as is for quests/farmers and make an exact copy of the zone, only make it higher level so I can continue to enjoy it. Solid Gold.<br />
<br />
Dinging 60 in Sebilis after a 10 hour grind-a-thon with my oldest monk friend, then scribing torpor and snaring him when he went off to pull!<br />
<br />
After getting a little exp into 60, immediately heading to Western Wastes and soloing Yeldema.<br />
<br />
Duoing Kael Arena with a 60 Warrior, who had a frostbringer/LSoEE combo. Holy **** those veterans took forever.<br />
<br />
Zoning into plane of Valor and there being only 12 other people in the zone.<br />
<br />
Trying to solo in PoTactics without Quies, using DD-DoTs... Gotta click that Torpor off fast enough! ;p<br />

Geez Blazz...a Mortal Sin?  For what, using you brain?  I always thought that doing something from a logical perspective, using your intelligence over a &quot;dumb animal&quot;, made sense.  Its what has elevated humans above the rest of the animals in real life.  I always thought it would have been nice to take one of those hill giants (who regularly kicked my sorry behind) in EK up the ramp towards HHK, and then dump his butt off the edge of the cliff (hee hee..i had levitate..finally!)  But I suppose you figure this is wrong?  But wait...if I DIDNT have levitate....CRASH!!   You have taken 20,000 hp non-melee damage.  You died.  You lost level.<br />
<br />
I really dont see how having him stuck against the wall is much different than rooting and dotting him, stepping back, sitting and watching him die?  But wait, back in those days, something that conned even or above, you could count on your root NEVER landing. And a shaman take on something even con or above..wouldnt have happened.  In fact, most of the time, you had to be very careful with light blue cons.  Maybe thats a problem with the con system, which I always felt sucked.<br />
<br />
Finally, I didnt feel bad taking on that mammoth, not when Droolerz were able to 1) make a ****load bag full of money from whoring ports<br />
2)  make even more pp by quad kiting in several zones, and 3) making 4 times the amount of experience shaman were capable of getting by doing so.   That offended me way more than any &quot;exploit&quot; that I found after being stomped and smashed and risking all to retrieve my body in EF... damn those orcs...leopards...skeletons...Mammoths!!<br />
<br />
Oh, did I mention, one of the first times I went &quot;exploring&quot; in EF, very carefully, I came upon a castle wall, was sneaking along it, looking around for danger...and squash!  Something called an Ice Giant stomped me flat...through the wall !!  I prefer to think of the &quot;exploit&quot; more in terms of &quot;deserving revenge&quot;!!<br />
<br />
Oh well, to each their own.</div></div><hr />

- Thinking that I could cast gate on other people<br />
- Being in the Oasis and seeing the first shaman go great bear form<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Geez Blazz...a Mortal Sin?  For what, using you brain? Dont get me wrong, using legitimate tactics to kill is fine. The whole idea of &quot;Vindi-ing&quot; a mob into the corner, face first, so he cant riposte on people, is a strat, not an exploit. <br />
<br />
But sticking a mob into a corner, then sidestepping around the corner yourself, while the mob tries to &quot;chase&quot; you through that stuck corner, and nuking it down is lame. Certain things are OBVIOULY not within the scope of the overall game design, and this is a big one IMHO. <br />
<br />
Not only that, but if you were caught using such tactics, you risked suspension of your account, or worse (yes, in that first year, some people got banned for certain exploits). <br />
<br />
I will lean toward the players side in the &quot;grey&quot; areas, but if you used &quot;strategies&quot; that were OBVIOULY exploits, then I view that as a form of cheating. Its not like the game is so hard you have to resort to such things to level.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">This is a repost from a long time ago. 2002 I belive (Thanks Sam) I added a few short lines of more memories. Good times folks, very good times indeed..<br />
<br />
In bear form I am old and majestic, An elder in title and in truth.<br />
<br />
I walked the permafrost when times were new. Before the age of the gods and before the fires of heaven scoured the land.<br />
<br />
I battled bear cub and goblin, with nothing more than an old stick and the knowledge that my calling as a shaman would be strong.<br />
<br />
I walked in the night when it was truly dark. Before the vengeful bards took shape and wandered the icy plains. Before crafters learned to make the tundra rings of ice into armour. Before the lands were mapped and weighed and measured.<br />
<br />
I have hunted the fabled Pyzjin in the Qeynos hill, and died to her dark arts. I have fished beside Hadden before the cursed earring made his life a hellish thing. <br />
<br />
Cros Treewind and Holly Windstalker were thorns in my side as I tried to master the art of wolftaming at little rish to myself.<br />
 <br />
I have killed Hill giants with only my mutt and my spirits around me when the deed was considered impossible but for those of the dark arts. I walked Into lower Guk when the place was fabled and new.<br />
<br />
I have inspected the claw marks on the walls of Permafrost, then matched the same marks to rents in my armour and body.<br />
<br />
When Kunark was discovered, I carried the long arm of northern Justice to the sarnak. And to the undead in the ruins of Kaesora. I watched as frost froze the ichor of the emporer of long dead seblis in his spectral form.<br />
<br />
I have wandered and led in the icy wastes of velious. Friend to dragon and slayer of giant. Much like the long times past in the mountains of rathe. I was charmed and cursed in the Sirens grotto in the first day of walking that blasted land. I have raised my spear in salute of The Darkpaw and slain Yedelma in honarable combat. After many had done so before me. And many would come after me.<br />
<br />
I walked the Moon of Luclin, once again delivering the Justice of the Tribunal. And trying to rid the land of shadow. I have braved the scourge of the temple of Ssra, and walked in the airless depths of the grey itself.<br />
<br />
I have met my lords and protecters in the halls of Justice. I have stood before them and been Judged. And not found wanting. I wander now in the Halls of Honor, and the plane of tactics, proving myself with the stregnth of my arm and spirits and with the friends of all my past arrayed behind me.<br />
<br />
I am the tip of a spear aimed at the neck of the boar. The speed of the wolf inside me, the pack baying at my heels. I am a caller of spirits and a weilder of poison and disease. I cripple and call upon the insects to weaken my enemies. I am a healer of my people and of all the races that stand with me. I am the growl of the Kodiaks that still live on the northern plains of my home.<br />
<br />
It has been a long Journey. One of fun and fright. Filled with laughter and pain, as old friends fall by the road and new friends pick up the pace.<br />
<br />
But one thing will endure. The memories of the Silverhammer. Standing in the firelight, looking out over the frost. The memories of the good and evil that I have come across in my jorney are still strong. And thankfully they are not at an end. My spear is still in my hand. And the Hammer of spirits is still only a reach away.<br />
<br />
Justice will rule in the far north for some time to come.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>frynque</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">hah, been doing Wow and stopped by for a peek and saw this thread.  /em wipes nostalgic tear from his eye.<br />
<br />
some of my own:<br />
<br />
doing cabilis faction with my troll shaman back during the velious days, because, the boat ride back to grobb for spells was &quot;t3h suk!&quot;.  nowadays faction is useless.<br />
<br />
sharing beers (as a troll shaman) with Grype.  [and laughing about the 2 times he got me HTed by the guards, you ole bastard.]<br />
<br />
camping the gorge alchemist (with my 19 monk) because Treant Fists were uber and GiGs looked gimpy.  she still had the TFists in the bank when i sold the account.  some NODROP stuff you just cant delete.<br />
<br />
my first platinum piece.  i think i was around 9th lvl when i had accumulated enough change to make 1pp and my brother saying, &quot;dude, you can take all that cp and sp and change them to gp and pp&quot;   /slap self.  lol<br />
<br />
seeing my first hill giant in West Commons, and nearly ****ting myself.<br />
<br />
running from Firona Vie to LoIO (lake of ill manners :P ) before the Books and luclin and hoping to god FD didnt fail once the drachnids saw me.  to give the original poster a nod, YES, i was proudly wearing a Lockjaw tunic.  ha hah hah hah.<br />

retired, doing the shaman thing in WoW now as a Tauren.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Morgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">If you want something that is akin to the olden days of EQ, pick up a copy of EQ Mac. I used to play the game PC side for a while (from Kunark until Luclin came out more or less). I went on to be a beta tester for EQ Mac, and I play the game now. The game is pretty empty, but there are more than enough people around to have a good time.<br />
<br />
A few ideas about what the Mac server is like:<br />
30 people in PoK is about normal.<br />
20 people in the Bazaar is an average day.<br />
<br />
There are quite a few people who are already level 65 (we don't have any expansion past PoP, so level 65 is the highest) -- a good number of those people have their epics. Unfortunately, no one seems to have Innoruuk's Curse =( But I have seen the druid, shaman, paladin, bard, ranger, cleric epics. I haven't seen the others, but I'm sure that they're out there.</div></div><hr />
