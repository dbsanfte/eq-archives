<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Knibble Megentlee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ya know I know there are heartless people in the world but this really pisses me off... I got a phone call from  my store last night.. Yes  you guessed it.. WE were robbed.... my gut dropped...Now  how heartless is it for some punk to come in  and rob ya at gunpoint with no care in the world as to what family you have  and not realizing the person you pulled that gun on has children etc. and not realizing how this effects this person deeply... So thanks to this asshat.. I lost an employee.. :( <br />
One who been working for me forover 5 years..3rd shift is generally my shift.. I just keep thinking god that punk was lucky it wasnt me... /shrugs..  He made off with about 130.00.<br />
This was the icing on the cake for my christmas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sorry to hear that, Knibs.. *sighs* Definitely not the way to celebrate or remember the holidays. You should be glad it wasn't you... and at least everyone is safe and the only thing truly lost is some money, not anyone's life. There is never a good time for evil..it will happen when it wishes, holidays or not. <br />
<br />
I hope the police catch the prick soon...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Windigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ouch Knibs :(  Sorry that had to happen.  Yeah, the world is a bad place sometimes.  Glad it didn't turn out as bad as it could have though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Acies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You know, just to bring some levity to this, hit the back button, then look at the title again with your name after it...hehehe<br />
I can just say, I am a fast learner :D</div></div><hr />
