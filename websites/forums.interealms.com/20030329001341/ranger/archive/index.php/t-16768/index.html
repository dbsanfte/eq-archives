<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Keek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I havent bought PoP yet, but are the Planes of Justice, Nightmare, Disease and Innovation simple zone in/outs' and dont require any quests or keys to be done first?<br />
<br />
I'm just curious since I keep reading about Trials and Tiers<br />
<br />
Thanks - Keek<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ralence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They sure are.  PoD exit is in the trash compactor door near zone in.  PoN exit is in the house, again, right next to zone in.  PoI is right next to zone in as well, and PoJ is a little trickier, but its actually the safest of the 3 normally, since the mobs near it aren't KoS.  Just don't get lost in PoJ, the mobs further away are KoS.<br />
<br />
  The only thing to be careful of is that people do train zone out quite often in the first 3, and since out and in are very close to each other, zoning in can be treacherous at time if people aren't careful.<br />
<br />
  Just be ready to make a dash for the exit once you zone in, just in case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>khalysta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">those are all first tier zones so you are automatically flagged for them.  You dont need quests or flags until you hit the second tier and usually the first flag you get is from plane of justice for entry to pov/pos.  Basically if you have ever spent any amount of time in karnors then you know all about trains and know what to expect from the poi and pon zone in/out.  PoD is pretty safe not many train there since most mobs are a fair distance from the zone in/out.</div></div><hr />
