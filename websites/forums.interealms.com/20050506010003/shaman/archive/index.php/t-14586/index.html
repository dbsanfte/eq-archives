<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Spell Casting Reinforcement, or Buff Extension.<br />
<br />
What is the Cap in it, or, is there one?<br />
<br />
SCR1 = 5%<br />
SCR2 = 10%<br />
SCR3 = 15%<br />
<br />
Combined = 30%<br />
<br />
SCRM = 20%<br />
<br />
Combine them all, you get 50% Buff Extension.   Now.. is that the Cap, or if you have an item that adds more extension will it stack?    I have a 20% Extension item... so what I want to know is, Is it possible to get 170% Extension?   <br />
<br />
If anyone can show any hard proof one way or another instead of just conjecture, I'd like to know.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">SCRM is 50% extension. Any focus effect will stack with this.<br />
<br />
So SCRM and 8th Shawl (the most comon 20% buff extension) will make all buffs but Torpor/Quiescence last 70% longer. The 8th Shawl doesn't work on Q/T as it has a 48s min duration, Q/T will be at 50%.<br />

I'm a big fan of SCR/SCRM, it's one of our best AA's.</div></div><hr />

There is no known cap for extended duration buffs, but currently the max possible is 70% (to my knowledge).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Had a question along those same lines actually... As it happens I Finally got my hands on Quiescense today, It's Game changing ....  especially since I've never had torpor because the gwurms are evil stingy bastards. Anywhoo I've already Got Spell casting reinforcement 3 and was pleasantly surprised to see Quiesc lasting long enough to give back 1800 hp. (Tried it a few times to make sure but innate regen tends to skew results a bit, was more like 1940 hp, but counting the actual hp jumps I counted 6.)<br />
<br />
<br />
I was wondering if Spell casting reinforcement mastery would also extend torpor/quiesc (consensus here seems to be that it does so that question may already be answered) How much does quiesc heal with Spell casting reinforcement mastery ? Is the difference worth it or should I start on quickbuff now ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, I remember a thread a while back that listed a few focus items that actually work to extend torpor (as opposed to the normal buff extend foci that don't) There was a crown from VT and an earring from plane of water I think ? Anyone remember what they were ? What's the max hp you've managed to squeeze out of the spell ?<br />
<br />
<br />
And while we're in a questioning mood... those that have had Q a while, do you still bother memming Kraag's mending ? (personally today I didn't feel the need to use it on any of our raids since Q was working out so well)<br />

SCRM works on Q.  Instead of 4 ticks (24 secs), it should go 6 (36 secs) every time (1800 heal).  With just SCR3 you will get 30% longer.  Q will go from 24 secs to 31.2 seconds, which may or may not go a full 6 ticks; it depends when the buff landed and when the tick happened, from what I know.  So, for example, if the tick starts at time index 0, and you land Q at time index 5, and the first tick happens at time index 6, then Q will drop at time index 36.2, which means you will juuust manage to get 6 ticks (times 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36), but if you landed it at time index 4.5 instead, then you will have it drop at 35.7, and you will only get 5 ticks.  Long story short, get scrm.<br />
<br />
Side note:<br />
Can5  = 5 pts.<br />
MGB   = 9<br />
SCRM = 8<br />
QB1   = 3<br />
============<br />
24 Class Abilities which means Elder title<br />
These are all AAs that you want anyway.<br />
(Well, you want QB3, or QB2 + Haste of Mithanial, but whatever)<br />

Look there to see if an effect will work or not.  Different spell effects have different limitations.  Some effects dont work on spells with casting times too short, or with buff lengths too short.<br />
<br />
<br />
And while we're in a questioning mood... those that have had Q a while, do you still bother memming Kraag's mending ?<br />
Never.  Fast heal and Q are all you really need.  If they need a heal NOW, then use the fast one.  If they can survive without the heal for the 10 seconds it takes to cast that other heal, they can just get Q instead and get basicly the same amount of healing for 1/2 the mana (I have scrm).  I don't fight insituations where a 10 second 2k heal is of any use to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have to agree with the others here, SCRM is definately one of the top AAs for shammies after Canni V.<br />
<br />
Not only does it boost Torpor/Q, it also makes hasting fun again and offsets the stupid nerfing of stat buffs durations post 60 (yet again /rude SoE).<br />
<br />
Had to edit: i make it a point to whine every time about durations, when they are mentioned, but has SoE ever made a comment, WHY they lowered them? (i can see some arguments for KEI/Tranq and other power buffs, but why all stat buffs as well? and focus is great, but not overpowering in any way). Never saw any info on that.</div></div><hr />

PoE exp now is about 4-5% aa per kill.  Only takes 45mins per aa.<br />
Quick Exp before a raid can net 2+ aa.  It's not hard now days to crank out the AA in quick time.<br />

<br />
That does explain why I was getting 1800, I was waiting for the tik, then casting. I might do a couple of levels of QB first but I definitely will get scrm then, thanks.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 If they can survive without the heal for the 10 seconds it takes to cast that other heal, they can just get Q instead<br />
<br />
Pretty much what I figured as well. It just feels a bit wierd to set aside krag's after making due with it for so long.<br />
<br />
Btw, I tried finding the Q focus items on lucy a while back but not knowing the the name of what I'm looking for I've had very little success<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">OK Here's the deal with SCR and SCRM and extending Torpor/Quiescence.<br />
SCR will extend by 30%, which will put Q at 1500 hps every time, and depending on lag, sometimes 1800.  SCRM will add 20%, making Q last for 1800 hps healed.  From there, you'll need focus items to increase Q duration.  Currently there are only two items in game that will do this.  Not sure what earring name is (elementals) but the hat is the one i have on my shaman, and it does two things: extends all spells with a duration for 15% (which bumps Q to 2100 hps healed) and then adds one tick to the duration of any spell, which makes Q last for 2400 hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">With a Veil of Warmth (Focus: Eterninostrum - 20% increase) and SCRM a guildmate was able to get 8 tick Quiescences (2400 hp healed)<br />
<br />
With SCRM and Focus: Eterninostrum you can get spells up to the following durations:<br />
<br />
Ferine Avatar - 11 minutes<br />
Focus of the Seventh - 2 hours 16 minutes<br />
Endurance of the Boar - 2 hours 2 minutes<br />
Blessing of Replenishment - 35 minutes<br />
Swift like the Wind - 27 minutes<br />
Talisman of Alacrity - 1 hour 1 minute<br />
<br />
Even with the Crown of Ambivalence its definately worth having since it greatly increases the durations of commonly used spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Elemental access and spending 5 or 6 hours on a game session (xp and then raid) is pretty hardcore in my book  ;) . When you spend only a few days per week 2 or 3 hours in revamped KC aka BoT or HoH, you will need some weeks.<br />
<br />
But never mind, of course everyone has it's own view, what is hardcore and difficult/time consuming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Currently from what I have seen..there are four items that affect Torpor/Quiesence.  One was already mentioned..and taht is the Crown of Ambivalence from Vex Thal.  <br />

Basically....your best bet to get an item that will affect Torpor/Quiesence is from VT unless you are in a very high level guild.  There are no other items than these four that have been found that will affect it so far.  Unfortunetly the vast population of EQ will not see anything that will affect these.</div></div><hr />

If it's in lucy it should be an item in game since it's an item sniffer. I'd have to assume that is a raid level dropped augment but I haven't heard anything specific about it.<br />

Personally I have the crown and it pretty much owns for a focus effect and even when you get to time you still need 2 items to replace it since nothing else covers both benificial and detrimental.</div></div><hr />

First of all, let me chime in and say that SCR/SCRM kick much ass, I dont see how anyone can say that getting a 180-2100 point Q and all our buffs lasting 50% longer (2 hour focus isnt the suck) isnt bad either.<br />
<br />
Secondly as to the Lucy being a item sniffer, sure it sniffs stuff in the data packets but just cause it shows up in lucy doesnt mean its in game (Group True North anyone?)<br />
<br />
If you are xping in elemental planes you most likely already have SCRM and other aa's requiring a large amount of banked points (6+ points per ability).<br />
<br />
Actually I know plenty of people that end up in the elementals that dont have squat for AA; clerics and bards especially. You dont have to be packing 80+ AA to be effective in tier 3-4 but it sure dont hurt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">but just cause it shows up in lucy doesnt mean its in game (Group True North anyone?)<br />

The problem with this logic is that things like Ancient MGB True South are *spells*, and the information about them is gotten by reading the sp.dat file. Nobody needs to own the spell for Lucy to see that, the information just needs to be downloaded during a normal patch.<br />
<br />
An item like this focus augment actually needs to exist in-game for Lucy to be able to &quot;see&quot; it.</div></div><hr />

Ok again, I will say, just cause you can &quot;see&quot; it on Lucy doesnt mean that it really exists somewhere or that its something that you can actually loot yourself heres a little proof:<br />

It's probably a gm only item or a joke item, there are a number of those. Common ones like the ugla stick are well known. Lucy snifs the data packets for the items. Someone was running thier program and saw a link for that item. I will admit that doesn't mean it's obtainable by players but I could see that augment being a drop on a LDoN raid. As far as the slot goes the ldon raids drop some time quality gear with multiple type 3 slots on em too in the time level raids.

SCR1 = 5%<br />
