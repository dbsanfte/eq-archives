<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, for the love of God, please believe that I am NOT trying to start a Flame thread, or troll for trouble (heheh), but I am curious about Fizzles, and what we think we can do to lessen them.  The one thing I know is that it is based on your skill level in the specific casting discipline (divination, alteration, etc.) vs. the level of the spell, but are there any modifiers on top of that?<br />
<br />
     I have heard rumors (here we go) that a high Cha. and/or Wis. can help reduce your fizzle rate.  Anyone have any experiance or feelings about this? Thanks for your imput.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if your facing northeast when you cast you will never fizzle</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've not heard the charisma rumor, mine is like 60 (lol that's what buffs and steins are for). I've been told charisma has more of an effect on bards/rangers/enchanters, though since I've not played any of those classes I couldn't speak to that properly.<br />
<br />
I have heard the wisdom rumor before, though I've also been told ... &quot;forget wisdom, go HP-STA-AC&quot; ... My wisdom is at right around 238 or so, and I have no problems fizzling, though all my casting disciplines are close to being maxxed. I'm looking into backing off the wisdom even further. I've spoken to shaman with wisdom of 150, and while they says they've not had all that many problems fizzling, they do say they wish for wisdom of in the 190-200 range, but haven't yet given me comprehensive reasons as to the reasons why they chose that wisdom range. <br />

Why was that thread in the equipment section??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I never saw those tests you did before Junkilo, thanks for posting some hard info.  Seems to prove that Wis helps avoid fizzles, with some breaking point at 200 Wis.</div></div><hr />

It initially started off as a small gear check, but then evolved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Jawoot JZ, thanks for the test. Never did see that thread, I spend a lot of time sifting through old ones to see what I've missed, but somehow overlooked that one. I can't wait to update my Magelo and experiment with the new equipment I've got and a couple other wish-list items to see how low I might could go with the wisdom and gain some HP/Sta ... hmm ... *muses*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Junk.. one thing you forgot to mention(although I probably know the answer to it) is what spec you have. It would be interesting to see a test of a spell that you are specced in.. i.e. replenishment</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Unoeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Anyone else notice an increase in fizzle rate for a short perior of time just after gaining a level?  At lvl 64, i've only one more level to go.  However, I've consistantly noticed two things after gaining a level.<br />
<br />
1.  I fizzle a lot more until I've gained at least a couple blue of XP in the new level.<br />
<br />
2.  The level police come lookin for my arse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Shaman seem to have innate fizzle even at 355 wis and everything maxed to the bone..<br />
<br />
Also some mobs just have higher resists than others of the same type, like the other day I malos'd something in poe, and the bard hos'd it, and me, bard no bl could slow the bitch we just gave up at 50%..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Some mobs could have resist buffs on them. Wisdom up to 200 supposedly helps reduce fizzles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Arctarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There is one thing that upsets me: MOBS NEVER FIZZLE!<br />
<br />
What's their secret ? :(</div></div><hr />

I was actually thinking of that too. I'll try and make a run at some tests this weekend. My spec is alteration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Most have long since stopped paying attention, but hit the button on wisdom at character creation screen.  It says right there that fizzles are affected by wis.  It was added when they changed all the stat/class descriptions a while back.</div></div><hr />

These new spells (to you) you were casting that seemed to fizzle more?  Which then begs, were your skills maxed?</div></div><hr />
