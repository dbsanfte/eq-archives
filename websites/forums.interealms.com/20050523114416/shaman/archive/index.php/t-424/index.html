<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shakasa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am currently saving up for my JBB (I am lvl 44) and at this point I am looking to make some serious Platinum as I only have around 3k or so in the bank.<br />
<br />
In grouping with friends the best cash I could make in pure PP (not in sellable loot) is about 300p for 3 hours time.<br />
<br />
In dual mode (Druid and myself) in Rathe we can bring in around 115pp per hour...some better than others.<br />
<br />
Any ideas on the best way to maximize PP at this level?  Any items, quests, etc... that maximize the most PP for the time spent?<br />
<br />
I realize this is a very newbie question...blah and up untill this level I had no desire to push myself towards cash as it was quite unimportant.  Now with the need and desire for JBB I am focused soley on CASH!<br />
<br />
Any ideas?  Comments?  If you think I am being completely crazy here with my train of thought please pass that along as well.  <br />

First of all, you are BARBARIAN SHAMAN. <br />
You CAN replace your neck piece and earring with Tribunal Jewelry.  Imbue 3 ivory and contact your local jeweler.  Very cheap upgrades.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shakasa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm actually I was having made 2 Velium Fire Wedding Rings, 2 Black Sapphire Electrum Earrings and 1 Black Sapphire Platinum Necklace...<br />

That is unless you think I am going way to far on the AC HP trail over the wisdom?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You might be a little low for this, but I found the Ry'Gorr Orc Camp in Eastern Wastes to be great for loot. Between regular Ry'Gorr armor, Ry'Gorr Mail, Spine Chill Spear, and those Cleric/Paladin gloves that drop there (can't remember name: they're Firbrand's common loot), I was averaging about 500-600pp each 4-hour session. I never won a roll on a Dark Ember (only saw two drop while I was there), but that would be some additional plat as well. Biggest problem is everything is Lore so you need to spend time auctioning stuff every night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I kinda split the difference, myself<br />
Imbued ivory necklace and earrings.  Velium jasper ring, platinum fire wedding ring.<br />
<br />
edit:  Oh, and Gornit's pretty well baby-sat 24/7 on Bristlebane, from my observations.<br />
<br />
I've been able to work up to 5k in bank, but then I (sob!) went on a spending spree.... maxed out my alchemy skills.  On the other hand, Kilva's is making my melee skill-building time a bit more enjoyable.</div></div><hr />

If it was an hour or so I would ask them to send me a quick tell when they were finished and go slap some Seafuries about to get xp till then.<br />
<br />
To get money for my JBB I fought in Rathe Mountains.  Took me a long time to get the money, but I got it and got my JBB about 15 minutes after hitting 45.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Eh hmm.  If you gotta have a dr00d partner for HGs, I'd drop the HG idea.  A monk or warrior partner for HGs is a much better synergy for you as a lvl 44 shaman.  Your avg kill rate will improve a lot.  Heck, at 34 with a 36 shaman my monkie was killing HGs almost back to back.  How much time do you and the druid spend medding?<br />
<br />
I got my JBB at 47, but did it a different way.  I left the HGs to the r00d dr00ds in RM and went to BW to hunt wurms.  My druid partner and I were able to get a few named wurms and thus complete two wurmslayers, which at the time were all the rage.  We sold them for about 9k a piece and I took my half of the money and what I had in the bank and bought me a JBB for 12k.  <br />
We went back and re-did the wurmslayer quest several more times for pure profit and to upgrade our gear.  We stopped doing it when WS's started to get to about 4-5k in price.   Just wasn't worth it to us rich fewls anymore :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I remember the days..I got my JBB by trading a wurmslayer I camped straight up for a FBSS, and then trading the FBSS for the JBB.<br />

Of course now I dont think you could get 1k for one of those ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Tower of Phrozen Shadows.<br />
<br />
5-6th floor - mainly 5th.  So many weapons, plat, and bricks of velium drop that one can make 1k+ a couple hours easy.  Ssshh.  Its our little secret.<br />
<br />
5th floor bind - then use mirror to run to gnomes, sell, gate.  Repeat.<br />
<br />
Only prob is banking, you'll get weighed down so bad =/<br />
<br />
Recommended lvl if caster 50+ just because of golems.  If you have melee, 35+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hail!<br />
<br />
I completely understand your dilemna.  I was in the same situation awhile ago, but decided to solve the problem a completely different way. :D<br />
<br />
I threw my entire savings (6kpp) into a Geerlock Gemsetter (1kpp), some rare loot-only gems, and gave the rest of the cash to my spouse, who plays an enchanter.  Self-funded, we raised Jewelcraft to 250.<br />
<br />
Then I went on an auction binge for about a week solid during prime time play hours playing the enchanter in EC.  Ironically, my spouse HATES to deal with the public selling, so I have to do it all.   We were unable to make velium jewelry, because the enchanter couldn't enchant velium (level 44 spell) yet.  Still, we netted over 20kpp in that one week timeframe.<br />
<br />
Unbelievable!  I couldn't imagine obtaining that much cash in my bank in a few months, much less a single week on my own.  I paid 18kpp cash for my jbb, and it has been worth every penny.  It took about a week of serious searching (and posting) to find a seller.<br />
<br />
Money really wasn't that important to me either before I hit 45 and wanted my jbb.  I realize my method may not be practical for your own monetary plight. ;)  <br />
<br />
The Forest Giant camp in Firiona Vie may be another option for you to raise cash while duoing.  The exp should be very good, and while the cash isn't amazing, the loot sells very well even to vendors.  A few lucky forest loop drops really helps out too.  Same zone banking makes the lore drops a non-issue.  Be careful of the Forest Giant Verdant's though. :)<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />
Frekkels</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ok, I took yet ANOTHER approach.<br />
<br />
I scrimped and saved and neglected other gear to save up 12k, starting at about level 42.  However, I made sure to grind in XP-bearing areas.  FM giant fort was a favorite, get lucky with a couple of tunics and you can make good money there.<br />
<br />
However, I suddenly found myself about to ding 50, and with about 12k in the bank.  Then I started going on raids and realized how important resist gear is, and how relatively unimportant something like a JBB is.  So I've been doling out my stash to buy BDs, velium bars, and the like, as well as some other equipment upgrades.<br />
<br />
This isn't sour grapes - I'd love to have a JBB and if I saw an offer and I had cash for it I'd buy it today - but I'm not going out of my way hoarding cash or looking for it any more.  I'm moving on and playing the game.<br />
<br />
Btw, at my level, if I want cash I can make 300pp per hour solo in the FM giant fort easily.  If you get lucky and a Forest Loop drops, double that.  Make sure you have a convenient way to get rid of the lore weapons without running back to town - I have a second account with a druid who gates to surefall, sells 'em, and gates back with the money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ice giants are still my favorite cash cow. 300 pp per hour, especially if you have a partner that can run and sell those tons of FS weapons you accumulate.  Plus decent experience till 54.<br />
Another fast cash option is ralik packs. They take about 2 h per to get and go for 1k+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kanadar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I got my JBB in trade for a wurm scale for the Wurmslayer quest.. this wasnt long after Kunark came out<br />
<br />
Bet that guys kicking himself now<br />
<br />
I was never very good at making plat.. but I would suggest trying to find a nice spot where you can get both exp and reasonable plat, farming greens never appealed to me :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Couple of different ideas:<br />
<br />
Try learning (spoiler sites likely best bet) the rare cycle in FM and selling the results.<br />
<br />
Bind yourself and your druid friend in the evil eye room in LGuk and sell EE bags like mad.  The respawn is fast and I'm pretty sure it always drops the bag.<br />
<br />
Make SoW potions and grab 50pp profit per sale  (if you've got alchemy and it's a decent enough level to not fail too often) and get your druid friend on the port channel to rake in usually 50pp per port.<br />
<br />
Here's a long shot hehe...see if you can borrow a cleric friend's account and when he's not take the cleric to a few of the zones where people are always dying and make around 100pp each res.<br />
<br />
If you can get a melee along, I'm thinking you 3 would be about the right level to do the rare cycle in TT too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tobasko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Originally posted by astalus <br />
the geos in CC are good for gem money...can do them and make a good amount of money there...and since their quest is for a intelligent casters quest their faction doesnt really matter <br />
<br />
I second this.  With luck you can make THOUSANDS there in just a few nights.....<br />
<br />
Now for eh down side....The trains.  Every other swingin dick with a spider or Tentacle Terror chewin on his butt will run past you on his way to zone.  When fighting the Geos make SURE that you are facing DOWNHILL so you can see the train a comin and gate (be sure to bind yourself in the dwarf town in CC, perhaps by the banker).<br />
<br />
Ohh, one more thing.  When the geos run, they will run down hill, so start at the bottom and work your way up to the top.  It will cut down on adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I got pretty lucky and made an Arctic Wyvern Cloak in one try with my 158 tailoring skill.  This was before anyone on Eci was even close to grandmastering tailoring and this was one of the only cloaks on the server.  As a result the price on cloak ran about 12k and i traded cloak straight up for a JBB. Been smiling ever since, especially cause now these cloaks are virtually unsellable, along with the rest of velious tailoring sadly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
exactly how my mage got me a fungi(was around 23k when i brough it)<br />
<br />
the EE spawn is 30mins.EE is the place holder for a rare spawn -- froglok xxx shaman(normal rubbish shaman frog,33ish,nothing special)<br />
<br />
i also do ass/sup if no one is camping it.light burlap sac is higher seller to twinks,since they are rare on market and twink don't border to camp it.i sold it from 350~500(which is very underpriced imo) and EEbag at 300~350.<br />
<br />
that got me 20k in 1 and a half month.plus 5 TBB.i sold 4 of them to fund my first JBB.(no,you won't sold them at 3k each like i did,i'm uber gbay-trader)</div></div><hr />
