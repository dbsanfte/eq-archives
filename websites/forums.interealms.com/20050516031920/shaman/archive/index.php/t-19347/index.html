<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If they ditch the whole melee openings thing that no one seemed to like (not even the developers), then how significant would that totem AA we have in GoD be?  (the AA summons a stationary pet that gives anybody near it endurance over time-- druids and clerics have something like this except it heals over time-- wizards I think get a damage over time).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just with the current discipline stuff and incite, it's definitely possible to run out of endurance on big, long fights, so it will be useful as far as that goes.<br />
<br />
I also get the impression that melee characters will be getting more &quot;on demand&quot; abilities that use endurance to replace the now defunct opening abilities...  Only time will tell on that, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you think that Endurance regen AA will have any significant impact, you are fooling yourself and don't know how EQ works.</div></div><hr />
