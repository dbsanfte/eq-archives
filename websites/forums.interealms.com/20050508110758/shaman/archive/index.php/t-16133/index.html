<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone else have issues seeing such mobs as the wandering spirit in WK or the spirits in KC and COM? Occasionally if I turn my characters view 30 degrees or so I can see the outline of them so I at least know that they are there, but on the whole I can't see them. Is there any setting I can change to make them appear?<br />
<br />
Fortunately I am past the wandering spirit part of the epic (thanks to patient rangers tracking him while I auto-followed and spammed F8 and H) but I would really like to get this resolved. It can be annoying to think a passage is clear only to get halfway down it and be whacked.<br />
<br />
Thanks for anything you can think of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I highly recommend reinstalling directx 8.0a or 8.1 and the latest drivers for your video card, in that order. You can find most any driver you can want at http://www.winfiles.com , just pop in the name in the search there. <br />
<br />
Then check the options on your EQ to be sure you're not overloading the memory with random stuff it can't handle (like all models + mip mapping, lighting, etc... on less than half gig of RAM).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Make sure DYNAMIC LIGHTING is active inside EQ.</div></div><hr />
