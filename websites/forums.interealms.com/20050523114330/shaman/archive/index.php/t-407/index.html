<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vadmir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all;<br />
<br />
Lately (since the last patch I think, have not been playing much) I have been spiking badly.  Even to the point to were when I am sitting looking at the ground doing nothin (not even in a group) I am still spiking in the yeller.  It does not seem to matter what zone I am in I still spike (some are still worse than others ie THE MOON).  Any ideas what may be causing this and more importantly how to fix it.<br />
<br />
Comp:<br />
<br />
nVidia 16mb vid card (depressing  isnt it)<br />
P3-700Mhz<br />
Montego Sound Card (played with SOUND OFF)<br />
256 mb ram<br />
All animations and new models off.  Also clip plane is set low and so on.<br />
<br />
Its getting to the point where I am thinking of quiting because I cant play.  I do have a voodoo 3 card that I am going to put in and see if it gets any better butI finally (took a couple of weekls) got SoL to work with my current card and don't want to mess with it and maybe mess it up.<br />

<br />
Run a trace to the eq servers... talk to your service provider... GET A NEW VIDEO CARD :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Vad, there are a number of things you can do to reduce the amount of stress on your computer and video card.  Some of the common ones I use are<br />
<br />
/shownames 1<br />
/showspelleffects off<br />
/serverfilter on<br />
/dopropertinting off<br />
<br />
Cleraly, more RAM would help, but that may not be an option.  The above commands will reduce the amount of work your computer does.  However, that being said, your issue may not be due to your computer at all.  You didn't mention what kind of connection you were using--dial-up, cable, DSL, etc.  The issue may be with your internet provider.  I'd recommend you go to dslreports.com and play with the tweaker.  I think they have a speed test.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I had a crash a while back that trashed my networking layers and caused massive and depressing lag spikes, reinstall all that stuff under TCP/IP from your windows CD - doesnt take long and worth a try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vadmir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For information sake I have a cable modem that seems to be running fine (based on downloads from other sites).  All of these spikes issues are relatively new as before I was playing with sound and a few of the models activated and clip plane/animations at their highest setting.  Oh well.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice.  I will have tyo try em when I get online.  (best I can do for a new vid card is a card that is 1 AGP compliant unless I get a new motherboard :  ()</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vadmir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Another thing that is funny is that when I am spiking if I send a /tell it immediately starts going down.  If I am yeller it takes 2 /tells red takes 3.  The effect is not instant but it is very fast (and it is the way I have been playing lately giving me friends tell hell : )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There is also the &quot;Datarate=xx&quot; setting in your ini file that you can play with. I believe with a cable modem you can try 8 or 9, then work backwards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Aye, change your datarate for sure.  It's in your EQ file.  Datarate.txt  and change the setting to 9.  The datarate is a default setting for a 56k modem, so it's a good idea to bump it up.  If you keep getting dropped, you may want to purchase the ping plotter software for a month (it's a service) and run it while you run EQ.  It can tell you if your ISP is dropping you, or if it's purely a game-related issue.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A lot of people on the official message board are complaining about lag since the March 7th patch.  Of course Verant won't acknowledge anything exists, but, just be aware of that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Odds are that you wouldn't notice lag spikes in other applications like downloads.  Downloads are all about THROUGHPUT - how much data you get through in a given time period.  EQ and related games are all about LATENCY - the time it takes for information to get from you to the server and back.  Odds are really good that you don't have any latency-sensitive applications except for games.</div></div><hr />
