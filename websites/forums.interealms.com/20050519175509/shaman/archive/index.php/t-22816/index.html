<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>refresh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya, sorry if this has been posted before but I can't seem to find a way to bind &quot;Slam&quot; to my Q button on my keyboard.  I am trying to stream-line my shortcuts and I would love it if I always had access to slam all the time.  Does anyone know how to do this?  I tried the keyboard settings under the game prefferences but it doesn't seem to work.  Any help would be appriciated.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I looked before, and could not find out it is done, so I use the second bank of keys, and put SLAM on button 2.<br />
<br />
If I need to slam, I just SHIFT-2, and press 2, then SHIFT-1 again to toggle back to my main hotkey bank.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think all you can do is put it on a hotkey. You can assign Q to a hotkey if you want, but that's not much different than 0-9.<br />
<br />
On a related note, I see there's now a key to stop casting a spell, Shift+S by default; you don't have to type out /stopcast. Another thing they forgot to mention in a patch message?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No it doesn't work on horseback. Horseback still requires you to either dismount or move to interupt spells.</div></div><hr />
