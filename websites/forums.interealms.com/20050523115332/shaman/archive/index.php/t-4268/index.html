They don't post often, but they do post.  In all the years the crucible has been around, I don't think I have ever seen an official sony/verant representative post anything here.

 Did we do something wrong? <br />
<br />
We chose shamans on the character creation screen, VI apparently does not like that :/<br />
<br />
Seriously tho, I wish I knew.  If one would actually ever freaking post here and acknowledge our existence, we could ask them :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I suspect there are three reasons:<br />
<br />
1.  Devs don't play shamans<br />
2.  There aren't as many of us as the those other classes<br />
3.  We don't whine as much</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Everything Bigguss said makes sense to me.<br />
<br />
All those classes either had or continue to have serious deficiencies, and have made lots of noise about their problems. Look around in the game: not too many Shamans (despite our always having been one of the more powerful and soloable classes), probably due to the class playing like a gimpy hybrid for at least the first 23 levels. And one need only read a few of the many developer posts that refer to Shamans as the &quot;masters of buffing&quot; to understand that no one on the team plays a Shaman (or if they do, they apparently see themself as primarily a buffer).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Absor posted here once when Haleice mentioned that he recieved a load of spam email from him.  That is the only time I can think of.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">what was the last legitimate shm specific issue brought up here?<br />
theres relatively little discussion on game mechanics or stuffs shm's might need changed(i dont count wishlists, most of them arent very serious anyways) sure, theres general issues, but they can be read elsewhere as well. and outright whines i can sure understand why they wouldnt reply to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">1)  Devs play shaman and know we're one of the most balanced classes out there.  All of our stregths are balanced with some weaknesses.<br />
<br />
2)  There are growing numbers of us because of #1 and we're running into raid stacking issues more and more, requiring some changes.<br />
<br />
3)  They know when we start talking here we're one of the best boards and we tend to eventually come up with some reasonable suggestions.  They post to Dr00d message boards when they're done laughing at their suggestions.<br />
<br />
I think it's quite clear that they're reading these boards.  The FF thread had Alchemy and shrinking raids mentioned the most and both were brought up at the FF and GenCon.<br />

No one ever seems to stop by the Cleric or the Bard boards as well.<br />
<br />
And I think everyone can confer that at least the Bards have some issues that could/should be addressed.<br />
<br />
Some classes just have more representation (play time) by the people at Verant.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">At the fanfaire, Absore asked my class... I said &quot;shaman&quot; and he mentioned that he had misplaced the URL to these forums. He asked me for the URL again and said that he'd have to try to stop by more frequently.<br />
<br />
Other developers obviously read threads here and there, however. That whole silly group shrink request was acknowledged by a developer, wasn't it?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just because they don't answer every second thread doesnt mean they aren't reading. They don't need to reply to get an idea what the issues are with the community.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I don't think anyone is expecting a reply to &quot;every second thread&quot;.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Xican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Why would the developers need to post?  The Shaman class has no outstanding issues that need to be dealt with.  There's no real need for them.  Though they do lurk,  always reading just in case.  Hell, I bet a Verant employee is readin' this now!<br />
<br />
'sides even if they did post, like on any other class board, it would break down in to an arguement amongst the community.  Granted it's nice to know that they're lurking and keeping us informed, every thread that has been started by Absor or Rich on The Druid's Grove, Graffe's, The Safehouse, or any other board I've seen degrades in to a sh*t flinging fest.  Do we need that here?<br />
<br />
I think the Crucible does quite well without the bull **** PR 'updates' that other classes get.  This is an egocentric, secluded community.  Which is better than a hostile, egocentric, secluded community.<br />
<br />
But, I'm a pessimistic, retired, as*hole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Not that we really need tweaking, but if they felt like dropping by to say, &quot;Hi!&quot; I'd be happy to make them a dev forum area (it'd have to be a little heavier moderated though, can't have ya'll scaring them away now).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Would you rather <br />
<br />
a) Be a Shaman and have a quiet board<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
b) Have Absor / Abashi stopping by all the time and be a DRUID.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, no insult meant (not this time), I have more faith in the collective intelligence of this board re Shaman and Shaman problems than the collective folks at Verant.<br />
<br />
And here is why.<br />
<br />
People on this board play a Shaman to VERY high levels. I would be willing to bet that any Shaman of comparable level / power / equipment at VI headquarters was _Botted with a few keystrokes.<br />
<br />
I know that certain nuances are lost on the folks in San Diego. When Absor (iirc) was talking about the Monk weight limit, he thought it was 14 pounds IN Addition to the equipment. (al Inventory.)<br />
<br />
IOW why do you think a set of Black Pantherskin comes out to 13.9 stones?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Xican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Faern, how does being a Druid or Shaman have anything to do with it?  I play both.  I visit both boards.  I see both sides of that arguement.<br />
<br />
In any case, this board is pathetic with the cracks about Druid's, so constantly.  I'm tempted to wonder sometimes about the Crucible community as a whole when I see remarks like the one, above, Faern.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">wow that was a tre higging hippy response any druid should be proud of ;)<br />
<br />
look mate we are shamans , our symbol is the mighty bear . we are proud and i dont know about you , but i have met plenty a sharp tongued druid quick to slam a shaman cause they can snare and heal .<br />
<br />
its bolth sides friend.  you cant hang this community cause some people dont like druids . i dont like mint ice cream , whats the big deal ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Predicted pattern of events:<br />

a.5)  entire world spontaneously destructs.<br />
<br />
b)  It gets picked up by eq.castersrealm, everlore, equilizer, etc.<br />
<br />
c)  This board is flooded by new people (not a bad thing, by itself).<br />
<br />
d) People think that the crucible is a hotline to the VI devs and start posting every meaningless gripe, petition, complaint, and anything else they want the Devs to see.   For reference, I refer you to the Druids Grove, or the Safehouse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Xican, the cracks about druids are every where.  Most boards I have read they have had them at some point in time.  Most of the hostility comes from people that have read the druids grove I believe.  There are a few people on that boards, along with idiots that don't really know the class, that seem to whine on end all the time, thus giving the druid community a bad rep by association.  The same is coming thing is happening to the safehouse.  Every day someone that knows nothing about the class comes in a complains about something that rogues have, or don't have or should have.   It is usually something ludicrus and not representative of the population.  <br />
Not to mention, do I have to point out if you don't like it don't read it?<br />
I get wise cracks about the race/class I play all the time, its really no reason to get your knickers out of shape over.<br />
Just thought I would mention I like reading these boards because that whining isn't really even an issue here :)  It's nice to go to an everquest related board and not see a hundred different topics on manaburn teams :rolleyes: or the *cough* ragefire</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">To my knowledge they did acknowledge the group shrink request by saying no, because it's too hard to support with 2 interfaces now. I think they said no to the group shrink with confirm boxes (additional code). I don't know if they were asked about changing shrink to work like Translocate (can cast on other groups, but pops up confirm box).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Why would they post?

As soon as someone would ask a valid question about our class they won't have anything to reply in a logical manner.<br />
<br />
Someone from Crucible: Why even yardtrash from any zone resists Bane of Nife?<br />
Developer: Ugh ... working fine.<br />
<br />
Someone from Crucible: Why do spell drops still suck? Malo still sells for 40K and Torpor same.<br />

<br />
That said.  My comment about the hostility toward Druid's on the Crucible still stands.  On the Crucible it's not friendly-class ribbing.  It's constantly tearing at a class.  I realize class ribbing is all well and fine.  But, with the number and severity of comments made on the Crucible, I'd come to think Druid's were the anti-christ.<br />
<br />
Like I said, I play both classes, and enjoy both.  However, I can't stand this board's constant attitude toward Druid's.  Maybe it's the sweeping generalizations, and blanket statements, and the simply misguided assumptions on the Druid class.<br />
<br />
Everybody rips on Druid's.  This is a fact.  At Graffe's it was just as bad, until Moderator's put their foot down.  Druid's being the butt of a random joke is well and fine.  When every other post has one of those sweeping generalizations about an entire class, some thing is wrong.<br />
<br />
As for comments made on the Druid's Grove?  Just as Druid's over-estimate torpor, and Shaman abilities, you all claim to know more about the Druid class than some of the best damn Druid's to exist.  I mean, when you have a Shaman refuting the ability of a 60 Druid with Sobe, or Tenil, you can't tell me something isn't dead wrong.  The day you let Level 43 Winddancer Lifetree tell you your classes position and definition within the game, will be the day that level 45 Gromb Strongbear can mention the Druid class and have his comments carry any validity.<br />
<br />
But, I suppose that attitude is what makes the Crucible what it is.  Hopefully that attitude will keep the community sub-merged in some of it's horribly misguided angst, and twisted misconceptions of the Druid class.  It's clear the Crucible community would preffer to remain a secluded, egocentric, delusional one.<br />
<br />
I'm done with this thread, and this board.  Have a nice day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">You sound a bit overwrought Xican.  It's fun to have a red-headed step child to beat on, or a crazy aunt in the attic to throw stones at, or some other horribly mean metaphor conveying a willingness to woefully mistreat another.  <br />
<br />
However, you're distracting Absor from getting me Ice Comet.  I think he's working on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Druids are fun to pick on.<br />
<br />
Xican, don't let the door hit ya where the good Lord split ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I think Xican is letting the vocal minority get to him too much.<br />
<br />
I honestly hardly ever see true maliscious druid-bashing going on here.  I see (at least what I interpret as) ribbing going on, but rarely flat out druid hating (there was Berserker, but he, thankfully, has stopped posting here).  <br />
Hell, I like druids, very much as a matter of fact (I even play one).  I think they stack well with shamans on raids and in groups (can only speak for myself, but they save me tons of mana on group regen alone). <br />
Now that being said, look at what some of us have to base our view of druids on (see Fozy's post for further details).  Not saying that slamming all druids because of the actions of some is right, far from it, but class-ribbing is something that has been, is, and always will be present in EQ.  I've been ribbed (yes, by druids) about being a shaman many times in my EQ career.  Anyone remember that one player's post on the old Whineplay boards calling for a flat-out nerf on shamans after she &quot;claims&quot; to have seen one soloing a HG in their upper 20's?  <br />
The door swings both ways.<br />
<br />
Anyway, sorry you had a bad experience, Xican.  But as long as we are talking about generalizing, I couldn't help but notice this paragraph in your post:  But, I suppose that attitude is what makes the Crucible what it is. Hopefully that attitude will keep the community sub-merged in some of it's horribly misguided angst, and twisted misconceptions of the Druid class. It's clear the Crucible community would preffer to remain a secluded, egocentric, delusional one.<br />
Wow, nice way to bum wrap the entire board.  Hmm some repressed &quot;angst&quot; there?<br />
<br />
Ah well, have fun hating us :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Second Rodahn.<br />
<br />
Post like yours Xican are the reasons everybody rips at druids, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Me personally, I love having a druid in my group when there is healing to be done.  Ever compared a Druid's mana pool to a shaman's?  Unless you're in uber gear, a druid's mana pool is much larger.  I'd rather them heal and have a chance at more heals due to their pool, and me slowing and debuffing, what a shaman does best.<br />
<br />
I group regularly with Druid's and have no qualms with them in general.  However it's druids like you Xican that tend to give them all a bad rep to the shaman that don't usually group with them, and hear horror stories of having a quad dumped in their lap only to come to their board and see a druid bashing his class.<br />
<br />
I can see where alot of hate for druid's comes from, and there are specific druid's that I hate with a passion, but I'm not one to make sweeping rationalizations against all tree-huggers because of a few kewl doods that that class tends to attract.<br />
<br />
Now I'm sure if we go over to the Grove later on, we'll see a post from Xican bashing shaman, ah well, such is life.<br />
<br />
Have a good day :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I think the most satisfying aspect of Druid Bashing by Shamans is the deep down knowledge by both sides of the argument that the class is amazingly easy to play and as a result attracts more than its fair share of terrible players.  Too many of us have been burned by a poorly played druid - it's simply easier to lump them all into the &quot;avoid like the plague&quot; category unless an individual druid does something to prove otherwise.<br />

See?  Every class has its strengths and weaknesses - even dr00ds.<br />

P.S. I also play a level 54 druid - on my second and occasionally 3rd account (simultaneously).  He's pretty much automated on macro-keys, and gets compliments all the time for being played so well.  The irony of that is just righteous! :D</div></div><hr />

As for the guy who think's we're all druid bashers, I just want to point out that I have a 60 druid, and a 52 shaman, and I still bash on druids :-)  It really doesn't have anything to with the actual class, much more to do with the perception of the druid community (it only takes a single disrespectful quad-kiter to piss a whole lot of people off).  All of the ribbing really isn't serious though.  I also joke about how boring it must be to be a cleric, even though the real life friend I play in the same room with has made me painfully aware of just how complex cleric-ing is.  Just remember, its only a game, and this is only a forum about a game.</div></div><hr />

I went to Fanfaire, as did Tanuden &amp; a few other shaman that I met.<br />
<br />
I was the one who printed out the 3 page list of things to bring up to Fanfaire.  I left it in my car Friday night, but had it for Saturday.<br />
<br />
Friday after the intro, I spoke with one of the dev guys, and mentioned in our conversation that I brought that thread with me.  He said he'd read it already. :)  I did re-emphasize how whacked our Kunark spell drops are, but he didn't seem very receptive.  Mentioning that Torpor is on sale for 100kpp in the Bazaar did get his attention though. (Still listed btw, that fellow is crazy, but I'm sure there are unguilded oracles saving up for it.)<br />
<br />
I brought the list, culled it down to a few things, and spoke about my alchemy concerns at the Tradeskills forum for the first session.<br />
<br />
I was headed to the Dev forum but ended up in the Community/Feedback session with Baelish instead. :D <br />
<br />
Later on, my Crucible notes became scratch paper for the live quest.  :o  Oh, well.<br />

<br />
&quot;Not all Druids are jerks - but all jerks are Druids.&quot;<br />
<br />
Quote:<br />
<br />
 Ever compared a Druid's mana pool to a shaman's? Unless you're in uber gear, a druid's mana pool is much larger. I'd rather them heal and have a chance at more heals due to their pool, and me slowing and debuffing, what a shaman does best. <br />
<br />
I play a 55 Enchanter. C2, FT1.<br />
<br />
Faern at 52 has a larger mana pool. Why?<br />
<br />
Cannabalize.<br />
<br />
Regrowth + Fungal  = I don't sit down. <br />
<br />
Clerics &amp; Druids have (AFAIK) NO mana regen capability other than Med. Shamans get Cann, Mages can Mod Rod, Wizards can &quot;Gather Mana&quot;, Necros can do about 5 different things, Enchanters get Clarity series.<br />
<br />
We are fortunate as a priest class to get a mana regen ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">clerics have BAOtR<br />
<br />
druids have POtG<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">druids get several mana regen spells.  They have um, form of the howler at level 54 - mana regen +2<br />
<br />
they also get mask of the hunter/stalker - increase mana regen by 3 thats at level 60<br />
<br />
both those stack with Protection of the Cabbage/Grove (+6 mana regen) that stacks with KEI...<br />
<br />
So druids can self buff +9mana regen per tick at 60, unless I am mistaken?<br />
<br />
<br />
Clerics Blessed Armor of the Risen is +6 mana per tick.<br />
<br />
In addition to mod rods, I think mages also get a spell called <br />
Transons Phantasmal Protection that gives them +3 mana regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Which is why I said mana &quot;pool&quot; being larger on a druid.  I know we can regen mana faster than them, but when I'm trying to slow and debuff, one or 2 resists and it becomes decision time as to continue trying to debuff or just make the tanks ride it out and heal what I can.  With a druid, no problem, their mana &quot;POOL&quot; is much larger and they can get more heals off without having to lose their health and possibly draw low health aggro.  I've drawn low health aggro from canni'ing more than once in a desparate attempt to gain mana to get that one last heal off on the tank, only to find me needed it at the last second when I was only healer.  I'd much rather have a druid healing personally if there isn't a cleric to be found.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That, and because you were wrong.<br />
<br />
The number of mana points you have depends only on your level and wis (for priests) or int (for casters) and direct-mana items.<br />
<br />
It is possible that druid spells are less costly which would make their mana pool appear bigger; i haven't checked this, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You yourself pointed out that mana pool is based on Wis.  How many druids do you know are running around with 150ish Wis at lvl 50+ ?  Not very many, I'd wager.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">As a Level 58 Shaman with an abysmally low Wisdom (118), I can definitely say that while it's usually all about mana regeneration, sometimes it's the mana pool that's more important. All it takes is having to slow and root a few adds, and I suddenly find myself with 3 angry MOBs glaring at me, a monk praying (to whomever the Agnostics pray to) that Mend will refresh in the next 30 seconds, and barely enough mana to Gate. I still wouldn't give up any AC/HP for mana, as most of the time I'm well over 50m, but there are cases where it would be nice to have a larger pool. And healing when up against a particularly tough MOB is one of them.<br />
<br />
Druids are basically undercover Int casters: they pretty much all max out Wisdom (or at least get to 200) and then start looking at other stats.</div></div><hr />

Your Kunark spell drops are broken.  This concerns Malo, Torpor, Voice of the Berserker, Pox of bertoloxxus, Tigirs Insects, Bane of Nife, and arguably several other high level shaman spells.  <br />
<br />
Malo, a 60 shaman spell is so rare it costs 80-100k on average to purchase it on the off chance a copy is ever available for sale.  Mala, a 60 Magician spell identical to Malo minus 10 pts of debuff, is so common it is usually sold to vendors or in the bazaar for 100pp.  The number of shamans vs mages on the servers do NOT account for this ridiculous disparity.  This is just one example of the relative rarity of these spells.  I know you do not believe me, but you HAVE lost customers over this problem and will continue to lose them.  <br />
<br />
If this is &quot;working as intended,&quot; I demand to know WHY on behalf of the shaman community.  If you can explain this without denying the problem, we will let it rest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With all respect, Juventus was expressing his frustration at 2 years of struggle to have an issue that goes to the core of being a shaman adressed. In fact, didn't you take a long walk once upon a time to try to get ranger problems looked at?<br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is, depsite hundreds of e-mails (i'm guessing, yes, but i've sent a fair few and i expect i am not alone), numerous posts here and on many other EQ-related boards, lots of polls, and a petition signed by hundreds of shamans from these very boards, STILL shamans cannot obtain their 59 and 60 spells even after ridiculous amounts of camping contested mobs or rare spawns and/or offering to pay exorbitant amounts of cash.<br />
<br />
Now turn your quote to EQ. Treat the paying customer with respect, and i'm sure they'll offer the same in return. This is your demand, and i don't think far off from Juventus'.<br />
<br />
Personally, i don't agree with bringing up class issues every time a VI employee pops his or head in the door. Smacks of hysteria. But, i can understand why Juventus would feel compelled to say something. Kunark came out over 2 years ago? Since then, we've been tearing our hair out trying to get our spells. And guess what, apart from a slight increase in our 56-58 spell drops on Sebilis Juggernauts (bane of nife, tigirs) , nothing has changed. Malosini still drops off those mobs, even though its vendor bought, instead of malo. You still have a thousand to one shot at getting them to drop off chottal and gwurms. And the Kunark dragons are still out of reach for the majority of players, unless they now happen to know 6 manaburning wizards.<br />
<br />
Now, ok, dead horse yadda yadda, but only if you are not a shaman. You cannot understand what it is like to be at the height of your powers in level (60) and yet be missing the true rewards of that trek to the top, which are torpor and malo, for months and months.<br />
<br />
I think it's fair to say that no other class is as crippled by the rarity of their spells as a torpor-less, malo-less shaman. This is what Juventus was trying to say. And he has said it many times in many different ways to Verant i'm sure. The fact of the matter is they are not listening. I don't blame him for bringing it up.<br />
<br />
And hullo to Absor. Good to see you on the boards. Hope you and other VI folks keep stopping by. I'm sure you'll find a chuckle or two and even a few eye openers now and again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">I can certainly understand the frustration too.<br />
<br />
My guild gained a copy of Torpor from our very first Gorenaire kill, back in March.  Since then, we've killed quite a few things that could drop Torpor, and we've never gotten another copy.  (Guildmate shaman who's been tracking said he thought around 70 mobs that could drop it.)  In addition, I've only seen Torpor for sale one time since then, for 80k, I think.</div></div><hr />

It might be something worth considering toward getting changes/fixes, as well as having direct answers to concerns. It would definately make the people at VIs jobs easier and we'd be getting some sort of satisfaction out of it. The players actually working *with* the company and vice versa.<br />

  In other words, I don't think Verant is unaware of the shaman spell drops problem.  I just think they have their own reasons for not fixing them, which they haven't shared with us.   Maybe its like the cleric epic: they only want a certain number of powerful (torpor enabled) shaman entering a server at a given time.

I have some cleric members that have been around since beta and still don't have word of redemption, for example.<br />
<br />
That being said, getting all your spells as a guild is just as important and as much a stepping stone as getting gear.  It's a progression thing, and it should indeed take some work to fully realize the goal.  The question is, with how easy it is to get gear upgrades that are well beyond the kunark era, maybe the spell drop rates should be kept more in line.<br />

As for the high end shaman, kudos for adding natural durability and combat stability to casters in general, why not combat agility?  For us relative weaklings, missing a round of attacks is far better than mitigating it, and balanced in terms of work for the reward.  Much as I loathe aa exp, I'd pick it up again for CA.</div></div><hr />

i agree to a extent . but my reply is simple and short . some of us have lives . we have childeren we have jobs , we arent kids here playing this game . <br />
<br />
i pay just as much as you or anyone else on the server . i dont feel the fact that i have a life to lead should inder my ability to get these spells. i cant dedicated 6 hours a day for 2 weeks to get 1 or 2 spells.  Life isnt fair . i dont expect to be equal on all levels . but i am a paying customer and feel i deserve the same perks that all the other paying customers get. <br />
<br />
<br />
other then the simple drop of levle 60 spells i have no complaint . i luv EQ and will play even if they remove these spells * shrugs*  but it sure would be nice to know that when i hit 60 i can reach my potential .  peace</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">Hey Chuk,<br />
<br />
You know me a little bit. I have to say about spell drops that you are dead, flat out, wrong.<br />
<br />
You are riding the wave of the expansions. You had a guild that killed the proper mobs time in and time out. For the longest time after yall dropped trak yall were the only guild that could drop trak. In the almost 2 years that it took me to level Feather up to 60 then come back to Snoww and level her to 60 you have been on the Leading edge of the game. You have always had the support and some of the best gear available.<br />
<br />
Tell the guild right now you want to go kill guardian wyrms. Tell them that you have to get something off of them but it is an amazing rare drop that could drop off the first one or the 200th one. See what they tell you. Tell them that you need 5 others to give up thier next 6 months trying to help. See what they say.<br />
<br />
You have no clue what some of the other shaman go through. I spent 6 and a half months trying to get Torpor and Malo. Some of it started at level 54. I leveled to 60 and got 14 AA points before I finally got Torpor. And Guess what. I bought Torpor from Cinny. (She had been saving it for Leepew but I talked her into letting me buy it for the cheap price of 50K.)<br />
<br />
This isnt the time of Just kill the kunark mobs. Because they are never up. If they are up someone has already massed a force to take them be it 24 ubers or 5 manaburn wizards. The game has boiled down to not only compatition with the insanely small drop rate of these spells to also a compatition to even get to try and kill the mobs. <br />
<br />
After over a year of trying activly, and 2 years into the expansion (Hell almost 3 now) I finally got Pox of Bertox. Once again I had to trade for it. (Sigh) But I have the spell now and can replace the item I traded. (A Braclet of Sense) <br />
<br />
You go through the bull**** of insane key camps and time sinks to ride the wave now. Just trying to catch a glimpse of a spell that should have saturated the market a year ago is our insane time sink. And when one is for sale now people charge 100 K in the bazaar becuase it is the only game in town. In fact the guy Fastneazy has two copys now on him selling for 100K because he saw another copy and bought that one as well so he could mark up the price.<br />
<br />
It is wrong. If verant wants to actually pay thier customers back do something like the Refined ore quest. Have a vendor with 5 copies of Torpor on sale for 10K Once those copies are sold you have to bring the vendor 3-4 semi commen items (That he friggen NAMES) to have him restock the 5 copies.<br />
<br />
You would then have an avenue other than insane Guardian wyrm camps, or price gouging Shmucks to turn to, and it would be an okay money sink and lesser item sink in the game as well. <br />
<br />
Or maybe just maybe this is working as intended. Maybe Verant wants us to slave away to try and get the spells. Maybe this is the punishment for making them look so damn stupid over Alchemy.<br />
<br />
Working as intended, Indeed.<br />

It's true, if you're in a guild that can kill Kunark dragons, 59-60 shaman spells are easy to get.  Heck, I got FOUR copies of torpor in one week: we got two off Gorenaire, one off Sontalak and one off Talendor.  <br />
<br />
If you're not in a guild that can easily mobilize and kill Kunark dragons, then the spells are much more difficult to obtain (rare drops from Guardian wurms, Jumpy, Prot, and the Emperor).<br />

Since Chuk's in a guild that has been treating the Kunark dragons like orc pawns for 2 years, he thinks they're easy to get.  Since Snoww is in a small raid force, she thinks they are hard to get.</div></div><hr />

It's going to require you to spend time camping a key and to go on at least one Trakanon raid.  But if you can't manage the time sink, perhaps you can buy MQs or maybe your friends have ideas.

This isn't a game that caters to having real lives, but you'd be surprised how many players in the absolute top guilds on each server are adults with real lives.  It can be done.  If you're having problems perhaps you need to rethink your strategy and/or get help with it.<br />
<br />
I know a shaman on my own server who never got his epic until lvl 60 and 9 AAs.  Was it because he &quot;couldn't?&quot;  Nope, he could have done it many times over with the guild he was in (mine).  He just wasn't interested in doing it.  Same with many people and their spells.  Heck, I'd sell Malo and Torpor for ungodly amounts of pp too.  If those shamans want to come up doing the easy zones and just make it to 60 on spiders in velks, then I have no sympathy.

1 Torpor<br />
2 Avatar<br />
2 Pox<br />
2 VoB<br />
1 Talisman of the Raptor<br />
<br />
We mainly focused just on dragons, not on clearing for spells.  We did kill a couple of wurms trying to get non see invis to pop, but we didnt' kill very many.  We also got a couple of Words of Restoration and a Legacy of Thorn as well as some other spells that no one seemed too excited about (mala, asphyxiate, mask of the hunter, etc.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>BaakFrostlion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">The no drop off ubers spell idea is amazing. As it is now, how do casters improve? Max mana sucks. I would bring more to any group/raid situation with cannibalization then I would with a 6k mana pool. <br />
<br />
Max hp? Almost as worthless as max mana. How often will the fact that some shamans have 3k hp unbuffed and some 2-2.5 make any difference? I don't die often vs normal mobs, in fact I die so rarely vs them that it's not even noticeable. And in some of the more uber zones where you can end up with quad 700 mobs who flurry or rampage or what not, you are going to notice little difference again. If it aggro's you from a slow resist, your dead. From slow? got a cleric with you? You might live, but then again even with your max hp boosted up 1k more than the other shamans in everquest its still possible to die in just 2 more hits(and likely I might add). <br />
<br />
AC is softcapped.<br />
<br />
So how do we improve? AA's? I'd be better off in a non raiding guild if AA's made the difference. Why even bother? But on the other hand this spell idea could make the difference. Ask the wizards who are killing the emperor and getting garrisons how they feel about it. They finally have something that seperates them from the rest. Sure the wizards from guilds who cant kill emperor who don't have it probably aren't happy, but then again a rogue who doesn't have a khalshazar from a guild that can't kill cursed probably isn't happy either :P It's the same feeling. <br />
<br />
Spells off uber mobs offers a way to seperate spell casters other than AA's. Shamans in this thread have been complaining that they lack some of the higher end spells. Why? Rarity of drops, lack of play time to acquire them, inability to get a group together to kill the mobs that drop them(guardian wurms), etc. But what they don't realize or care about is that there are shamans out there who camped their VP keys, put in the time necessary to camp juggs, made the friends to help them camp them, and made time in their busy lives to play eq so they could do these camps. But who cares about them! We should increase the drop rate some more so we can do it easier than they did! They have uber guilds that they had to work hard to join and raid with on a daily basis! Why should they have a full spellbook and us not!?<br />
<br />
What if when kunark came out they made a vendor selling every single int caster researched spell in the price range of where other spells of similar level fall? Think that would've made all those int casters who worked hard to get their research up and find all those pages, tomes, runes, and what not to make their spells happy? Is it fair to them? Is it fair to the people who did juggs VP and what not for hours/days/weeks on end if VI just ups the drop rate more and more so any lazy caster who types /bazaar can see them on sale for 100pp? What about those who have already bought them for 80k? I bet they're going to feel like crap when they find out the drop rate is so common now that they wasted 79k of their money. All the time we put into our camps for spells, or the money spent would be pushed aside, so that the 60 shamans who don't want to put the time in or can't can just have their spells handed to them because of their incessant whining.<br />
<br />
Baak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">Difficulty != Time sink.<br />
Some of us just literally don't have the time it takes to sit around waiting for these mobs.<br />
Some of us work, have children, are in college, and still play in as much free time as we can.  Does this mean that some 12-year old who's homeschooled and can actually spend that 92-hour marathon playing to camp these things deserves it more than us?<br />
*shrug*<br />
Maybe so.  Maybe the fact that they're sacrificing anything they have that resembles a real life for an electronic game means that they deserve all the little things that make their class &quot;balanced&quot;.<br />
Does that mean those of us who work our butts off to make enough money to support a family don't deserve to be able to perform our duties in game as well as some snot-nosed 12-year old who spends all his time in a fantasy world?<br />
Maybe not.<br />
But, in that case, Verant needs to rethink how they see class balancing.  Even though they're catering to the top-end guilds with each new expansion, I think they've finally realized that unless they keep people interested all the way through, they'll run out of new top-end players once the current run burns themselves out.<br />
<br />
You people sicken me bickering back and forth over and over again about how Kunark spell drops are broke for shamans, or how they're just fine and to stop whining.  Each side has their own point of view.  This isn't your game.  It's Verant's.  If that means that people like me will never see 20% of our top-end spells, so be it.  I'll eventually get tired of it and Verant will lose my $26 a month.  I have more important things to do than sit around and wait for these people to realize that casual players are more important than they think.</div></div><hr />

The effort to get spells that are game changing, that seperate the Oracles from a level 59 shaman are two expansions old. <br />
<br />
I was told that I was not needed in groups because I did not have torpor. Xp group in seblis.  They wanted a healer. They didnt take me because they said I could not heal well enough.<br />
<br />
Who works harder for thier spells. <br />
<br />
Someone who joins a guild already established. And is handed a spell after a couple raids.  Or the shaman who is a leader of a small guild. (12 people) who day in and day out plans things to do for those people. Who after 8 and a half months of dragging them 2-4 times a week to kill guardian wyrms finally was lucky enough to con a boared uber who had a torpor scroll in the bank to sell the copy for 50 thousand plat?<br />
<br />
You will never hear me gripe about Primal avatar. Or Ancient avatar. (Well other than the fact that we have 3 versions of a spell that for the most part should never ever have been on a weapon int the first place) Why will I not gripe about them. Because I can do my job without them. They are simply a conveniace. <br />
<br />
A primal avatar Shaman has a large advantage over me. Yet I don't mind that. Because he earned it. A shaman with 3K hp unbuffed will die so many times less than me if he was hunting where I hunt. That is what seperates the uber from the non uber. Then gear you have is so much better than mine it is not even funny. The uber have spells that I will never see because I made a choice to not go that route. A consious choice.<br />
<br />
I would rather stay in my small guild of friends, where one person means a good night or a bad night. Where we push our limits, doing things that are appropriate for our power level. It means the only way I will get certain spells is through trade. (Thanks Midnight Fury, for group Aego and Group focus in trade for Maidens eye Shards) but I am content with that.<br />
<br />
What I am not content with is people who have a holier than thou attitude, because they feel they are better at playing the stupid game than me due to the guild tag over thier heads.  Due to them having more time to be able to sit in front of the computer and profess thier adoration of some jackbooted thug who would rather Free for all a spawn that wish people luck and do something else. <br />
<br />
There will always be better gear. There will always be better spells, there will always be the carrot. What makes this game great is not the carrot but the people that are there along the way.<br />
<br />
Sadly this is also the biggest flaw. Cause people can be real *******s at times.<br />
<br />
We are all in the sandbox together. Don't **** there cause you have moved on to a bigger sandbox.  And don't say the problems with the sandbox are non existant because you have moved on or had it easier than another.<br />
<br />
Oh and one other tiny thing. When you bring an army to kill one thing you can expect to be bored.  I am happy I am not Shaman number 5 on a raid. I know what I do makes a differance. Loot or no loot. When we go places everyone is needed and welcomed.<br />
<br />
(No Glory none of this is directed at you, You are a class act. And Despite Chuk being... well Chuk.. I respect him too.)<br />
<br />
I don't want every spell. But I do want the ability to play my class and be effective.  Variations on a spell are fine but allow the core ability to be used. Don't make a player a second class shaman because he wasn't there when Lightning struck. The game is supposed to be fun too remember.   <br />

More fun faster. I know a friend of mine had that as a mantra for a while. Along with Bring back Winged Courior!<br />

I don't play a high level shaman, so I can't fully understand the dilemma. However, in my guild, we have 4 level 60 shaman and I know a few of them have Topor, maybe all. We are FAR from an uber guild, yet we still seem to have the spells. Hell, I could bitch about Warder's Protection as well. I could never get one to drop, so I finallyjust bought it.

<br />
The point I was trying to bring up to Juventus (who by the way I never came close to flaming.. sorry, I don't play those games) was that you'll get a lot more with a well thought out wording of the problem, research, hard numbers than with a demand on behalf of an entire community.<br />
<br />
Yes, back in the day, I had my walk.. and I'd like to think that because of that, some of Ranger's concerns were answered. But it wasn't a demand that did it, it was a concerted effort on my part and hundreds of other Rangers that were polite and to the point and backed up everything with numbers.<br />
<br />
That's all I was trying to say :) Juventus, if you leave over that.. well, not much I can say, no one here attacked you, I just asked that you be a bit more repsectful to other people.</div></div><hr />

Sure, EQ is just a stupid computer game that you're not supposed to take seriously, but reading the boards when anonymous posters don't give a **** about treating people with a modicum of respect grew old, and quite frankly, there's enough bull**** and hatred in real life that I can safely say I don't need any more of it here. <br />

Most of you are really respectful people and have a lot of wisdom to share about the game, but the atmosphere hasn't been one of &quot;friendly ribbing&quot; for some time.</div></div><hr />
