<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sylino</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently bought a new computer, pretty much all custom... 1 gig of RAM (DDR), 280 gig HD space, SB Live sound... and an nVidia FX with 128 MB of video memory.<br />
<br />
Short story -- everything else on my computer play like a dream, highest res, highes textures, 32 bit colors... unbelievable frame rates like 130 and up, which for me is a vast improvement...<br />
<br />
...and then I play EQ... frame rates probably around 45-100 depending on number of people etc... BUT... without any warning at all, my entire system will freeze.  Not just EQ... the computer freezes up.  CTRL ALT DEL doesn't do anything.  HD light is off... it's totally crashed.  I have to turn the power off to get any response.  =\<br />
<br />
I got a great deal on the card, very impressed with it in all other respects... everything else on my computer plays perfectly.  Never freezes or even has an error... but EQ just locks up, random, without warning, in any situation.  Turning around in PoK?  Lock.  Sitting and chatting with a friend?  Lock.  Scribing a spell?  Lock.  Doing anything -- or nothing -- and I get same result.<br />
<br />
Anyone know a way that I can play EQ again with nice graphics?  Or should I try to return the nVidia card and get something cheaper just for EQ?  Heh... I'm NOT rich either...<br />
<br />
EDIT -- I think I may have found a fix, if anyone else is having this trouble.  In BIOS I reduced the AGP speed from 8x to 1x... this has had NO detectable loss of performance or quality in EQ (or anything else I've tried last night) and I haven't had a system lock-up since.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Setting that to 1x is a bit extreme... You should set it to 4x at least.<br />
<br />
4x setting shouldn't cause a lock up either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sylino</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Grrr, still freezing, although it took almost three hours for it to happen... when I next logged on, it froze instantly... then it froze after playing for 20 minutes...<br />
<br />
Guess I should invest a new card =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grubgrub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">my video card does it too and i got a ATI 9000 pro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">are you running latest nvidia drivers?  I think I read where the latest drivers have problems with EQ.  I know people who have downgraded the drivers and get better performance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>daemoness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've had a FX 5200 for over a week now and I'm not having any lock up problems.  Might want to look for another reason for the problem, or I'm just really lucky.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My guess would be the SB live, that one is notorius with locking up EQ.</div></div><hr />
