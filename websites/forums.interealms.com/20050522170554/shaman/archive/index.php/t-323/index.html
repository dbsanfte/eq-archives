<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did it!  I got canni 5!  I dinged lvl 84 (did the fasttrack) and learned the skill, made the hotkey and put it to work.<br />
I can tell you that this one skill is incredible.  It's seriously the best thing since sliced iron rations!  What I would like from other shamans are tips for usage.<br />
<br />
For example, I was hunting in Umbral with a full group, 60 cleric, 57 mage, 60 pally, 60 rogue, 60 ranger.  The cleric was wondering if we could do umbral without mana regen . . . <br />
I just torpored the mage a lot and he mod rod 2 up a lotta mana for himself . . . gave the cleric mod rods as well to use.  I also torpored the cleric some.  <br />
<br />
Basically every pull I was doing Malo and slow, epic, and Bane.  Plus all the buffs as they were needed including group regrowth and celerity.   Plus Torporing the mage all the friggen time.   <br />
And I STILL was FM most of the time!  It was really amazing how well that worked.  I think overall we had more available mana for the mage and cleric with me than if we had an enchanter along with KEI.  WHo says we don't get mana regen spells eh?  <br />
<br />
My usage was to use two blues of mana on buffs, spells, or whatever, then hit the canni key, torpor myself and canni 4 a few times, cast some spells, canni 4 more, cast more spells, canni 4, torpor myself, and by the time torpor was done, I'd be ready to canni 5 again.  <br />
<br />
Basically canni 5 fills up about two blues of my mana bar.  Which to me is incredible.  <br />
<br />
Anyway I'm recommending this skill highly, even saying that all that grinding might have actually been worth it!  Lookin for oracles out there with the skill and new ways to use it to great advantage.  So far, feeding mana to clerics via mod rod 2 mages is my newest idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Angryor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just as funny the 2nd time around. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">actually I find it most effective to torpor yourself first.  Then canni5.  Especially if you are fighitng a mob and you bang the key :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm yah i agree Wildaar.  I just tried some solo work in Umbral.  Boy canni5 really helps with doing solo big mobs.  I would torpor and then hit the canni5 key, seemed to work out good.  Canni5 gave me enuf mana to keep bane and pox on the target at all times, which greatly facilitated the kill in a reasonable amount of time.  If things went well I could do one in 6 to 7 minutes.  I believe those have about 20k hps . . the moktors i mean.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">if your guild can kill shei, get the shadowed sphere thingy from her. casts a 150 hp rune. nice for canning ;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Spitulski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Late Night Raids + seeing bar oom after rez + canni5...well, you know the rest.   Watch the suicide button, the guild never lets you live it down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yah but the good part is . . if you die and get an Aego upon rez, as soon as you've looted yer corpse you can hit that canni button and be about 2/3 mana (thx rez effects (lower wis)), Torpor, and be ready to go again.  It's an instant way to get back into the game after an untimely death.  <br />
<br />
My thoughts so far on this skill vs. MGB first go like so:<br />
1) MGB is a very visible skill, your guild knows you have it, it helps when racing other guilds to take out a mob.   Being able to MGB focus everyone in range as groups are still being made is very nice, and will let you get back to FM while groups are finished.  All around usefulness . . . eye candy unless that one particular situation comes up where you could have used it.  <br />
<br />
2) Canni5 is also visible, but usually in a &quot;OMG our shaman is DYING!&quot; sorta way heehee.   It does speed up group focusing, can get done faster for sure, as it gives almost enuf for another group focus just in itself.  All around usefulness is very very high.  <br />
<br />
I am still not convinced to go for MGB next . . . perhaps quick buff instead as it would help buffing and be more general purpose.  9 points with only one marginal reward just hurts . . .<br />
<br />
As it stands I can group focus 4 groups in about 2 minutes.  If any other shamans are present that should be plenty of time.  If I get quickbuff that time will drop substantially.  <br />
<br />
Thoughts?  things I've overlooked?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm with you, Landragoren, I'm going for mass cann, then increased buff duration, then quick buff, THEN (if I'm still playing the game) go for MBG. (then...if I can stand exping anymore, channeling!)<br />
<br />
MGB is great, but it's situational, the other stuff will be good in EVERY situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Canni 5:<br />
<br />
What can I say:<br />
<br />
Don't know how I lived without it all this time and I don't know how I live using it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shalara De'Tan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I love it, canna 5 is awesome.  I did get MGB first, even though I'd already done MC3, because I was asked to by my GL (and honestly, it IS handy), but c5 was next.<br />
<br />
The only problem is that I have 1921 hp unbuffed.  I also two box a lot, so if I am not paying the best attention to Shalara's screen and buffs fade... well... Yes, yes, I have killed myself with c5 at least 15 times.   &quot;Shalara has been slain by Shalara&quot; has become all too common.  Thankfully the hubby has a rez stick cleric and I can get a rez anytime ;)<br />
<br />
I've done things with my duo that I don't think woulda been possible without c5.   I've been working on the Garzicor quest (sanctum guardians earring) and I needed to kill cliff golems.  I was on at some ungodly hour of the day and no one was handy to help, so I decided, hey, its only death, maybe I can duo 'em.  I died the first time after blowing 75% of my mana trying to get it slowed (I even whipped out the tash stick!).  Not to be deterred, I went back and didn't bother with slowing, I just kept my rogue torpored, sic'd the pup, spear dotted, and spot healed with cblast when needed.  With torpor making my rogues DPS next to nothing it took a verrrry long time to kill it.  I went through 3 c5's, countless c4s and I still ended the battle with less than a bubble of health on both characters and not even enough mana for root.  Great fight =)<br />
<br />
I'm currently working on quickbuff.  I heard that spell casting reinforcement is still bugged, and only increasing buff length on the caster -- anyone know if that is still true?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bonestorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Canna 5 is a must before MGB and should be the first Class skill you get as it makes life alot easier.<br />
<br />
I really dont see why people bother with spell casting reinforcement. Most of the people you buff die before they wear off and you have to do them all again anyways.<br />
<br />
This is what I have so far and most of it is suck except for Run, Canna5, MGB, Quick Buff and Rabid bear (Jousted a 60 monk to death in Bazaar arena with my Facesmasher earlier);<br />
<br />
Run Speed 3<br />
Regeneration 3<br />
Mental Clarity  3<br />
Channeling Focus  1 <br />
Spell Casting Fury  1<br />
Spell Casting Mastery  1 <br />
Healing Adept  1 <br />
Healing Gift 1<br />
Cannibalization  1 <br />
Rabid Bear 1<br />
Mass Group Buff 1<br />
Quick Buff 3<br />
<br />
Think perhaps my next points will the pet hold or just save my AAXP incase they can be used in the planes of Power expansion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Personally I've gone run 3, regen 3, MC 3 and then cann v.  Cann V is the best all around shaman skill IMO. It helps out alot on raids and soloing. I get exp noticably faster soloing now with cann v and it's more useful in general than even MGB on raids IMO.<br />
<br />
Sure 1 cast yo buff out the entire raid would be nice but outside of a few select cases it really isn't that big a deal a shaman or 2 can buff out the raid quick enough already. Sure mass group buff is really useful for something like AoW if you fail and have a despawn timer to beat but in general cann v is better and it will help you get your other aa skills faster.<br />
<br />
Not sure what i'm going to go for next after mass group buff. Considering Quickbuff, casting mastery and buff reinforcement after MGB. Both healing aa's seem useless to me since they don't effect torpor and nuke crits seem useless since they no longer work on clicky items which is about the only nuke i ever use. Channeling focus might be useful but it's probably gonna be hard to test out to see if it actually does anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Are you sure fury doesn't work on clicky items?  Since when?  <br />
<br />
At any rate, I'd like fury for torrent of poison, too, not just JBB.<br />
<br />
Canni 5 is godly.  I have killed myself with it MANY times by now. :) I don't have 1924 HP after a rez, so when I've been tired or distracted and clicked canni 5, I've sometimes killed myself right after looting my body. :P<br />
<br />
I've also killed myself trying to use it while fighting mobs.  Shrooms in Fungus Grove don't seem to mind, and I can get away with it in Maidens End, but I tried it while fighting Tormax the other day...and he noticed.  No more using it while doing uber mobs for me.<br />
<br />
A good friend of mine is a 60 mage, and he and I get great experience together as a duo.  I torpor him almost every fight, and he can blast like mad, making modrods.  I've done that on guild raids too, and on corpse recoveries -- mage makes modrods so the necro can keep summoning fast, I torpor mage, the cycle continues.  Many people are set in their ways and for some reason would rather have the mage wait forever for more mana to COTH with instead of just having me torpor him while he modrods.  Go figure; lotta people can't deal with breaking their patterns, no matter how much sense it makes.  Maybe they just don't like anyone interfering in their own private preserve; I don't know.  <br />
<br />
When my mage friend and I duo shrooms in FG, I will usually pull three.  He will do rains and I will slow, put epic dots on each shroom, and then do torrent of poison rains.  I can usually get off one or two rains at least, and when his health starts to go down from his modrodding up more mana, I throw a torpor on him, then throw a torpor on me.  Then I just canni away.  We don't have a lot of downtime, and can handle two full patches pretty easily, and more sometimes if we want to work harder.<br />
<br />
One nice thing I've noticed, Landragoran -- the canni 5 recycle time of three minutes just about fits how long it takes me to kill a couple of shrooms in Fungus Grove with bane, epic, dog, and JBB.  A rather nice fit. :)<br />
<br />
When doing experience groups, after I'm sure that bane won't cause any further aggro on me or the epic won't suddenly flare up in its last seconds causing aggro, I run 50 or 100 feet away and do canni 5, so I don't disturb everyone's killing and make the mob chase me.  Not to mention, the mob might kill me sometimes if I'm cutting it too close.  My personal best using canni 5 was getting down to 8 health points afterward.  What's so &quot;best&quot; about it?  Beats me, but I get a kick out of it for some reason.  And it's funny to see people going, OMG heal Blarg! or Blarg dead!<br />
<br />
Canni 5 should be the first skill gotten because it powerlevels all your other AA skills, so it's really an investment.  Plus, it just makes your day to day life so much easier in the process.<br />
<br />
I got MGB right after canni 5, and it's a lot of fun.  I went linkdead in the middle of a fight once on a raid, and when I came back I was one of the few alive.  As everyone got rezzed back, I blasted once with MGB, the cleric did the same, a pally did the same with Brells, and we were good to go really really quickly.  MGB is not a must-have, but is very handy to quickly start a raid when you need to rush to a mob, or to quickly recover from a wipe-out.  It's kind of a fun ego boost too to see 50 or 60 people at a time spam your screen as focus hits them all at once.<br />
<br />
Not sure what I'll use the rest of my points in.  The rest of the abilities aren't super interesting to me.</div></div><hr />
