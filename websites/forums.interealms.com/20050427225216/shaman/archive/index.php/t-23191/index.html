<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blakcat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm currently on a crusade to get KT flagged. I'm in a great guild, but due to their focus on Elemental access, Smith Rondo raid is not an option. I have finished the first two sewers, Vxed and Tipt (ironically Vxed and Tipt were the easiest due to interest factor). I'm now planning on tackeling the Lair. I've seen the guide located here GoD Information (http://home.cwru.edu/~srp5/Gate_Tiers.htm) But I want to get some first hand knowledge from some of the shaman that have passed this trial. <br />
<br />
I don't have access to a rogue that has passed the first two trials so having a rogue do the hand in is not an option. My plan was to sort of do it like I did on the second trial and fight to the turnin NPC and leave a CoH mage in or close to flag NPC room. Then invis/paci/fight to the three rooms to get the tools and have mage CoH us back. This worked very well on the 2nd trial, although we did lose some DPS on the way to the named. Does anyone know of a safe area in or close to the flag NPC room? Please post if any of you have any other suggestions or how you may have done this. Any advise will be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

I've done this a couple of different ways. With a rogue for the hand in it takes about 25 mins, with a suicidal monk it takes about 35, with you as the trigger it will take a while longer.<br />
<br />
You will fight your way to the end, I wouldn't bother with a COH mage to be honest, it's just someone sitting there who could be helping out. Just invis/fight your way to the end room and skip as much as you can. When you complete the hand in 90 percent of the dungeon will de-pop. At this point you can either invis run back to the first room, or you can have 5 people quit the expedition and wait 1 minute to be kicked, then /dzadd them back in, wait for them to zone back in, leave yourself, get the /dzadd and rejoin them. I would prefer that option to having one person sit at ZI for the duration, but whatever works for you. (It means you don't need a COH to do it at least......).<br />
<br />
Ok, so you have the dungeon de-popped... simply kill everything in the entrance room until you get the emote. Then invis up, run to the room on the right and do the same. Then run back and along to the third room and repeat until the final emote. Logistically speaking I would do it this way because this room is the closest to the end.<br />
<br />
Invis/Run all the way back to the end room again and do the hail/handin.<br />
<br />
The MOST important thing to do here is give strict instructions to your group before you enter. This instruction will make your life a whole lot easier:<br />
<br />
&quot;NO ONE IS TO LOOT ANYTHING IN THIS DUNGEON, AT ALL.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trust me, looting corpses is bad, just in this expedition.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps, good luck.</div></div><hr />

Also, for a guild that is working on Elemental access, GoD has several non-keyed zone mobs that help a lot.  Rondo, Packmaster, and Zun in Ferubi all drop elemental loot and are not too difficult (though prepare to wipe once or twice while learning).  Pox in Barundi is a fast easy kill also.  I never understood the rational of avoiding newer zones that have content which a guild can kill simply because its new.</div></div><hr />

In sewer 3 if you loot any corpses you get repops. After the hand in is done you will see that there are about 30 mobs up total in the dungeon, if you don't loot any mobs as you kill you don't get any additional mobs in the tunnels. If you loot a corpse you will see a few pop, loot another you will see a few more..... it can add a lot of effort to a simple clear and run.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guess is the amount of time needed for the event.  It simply isn't worth it to have to:<br />
<br />
1) collect the pieces required to start the event<br />
2) bring everyone to ferubi<br />
3) plow to Rondo<br />
4) actually kill him<br />
<br />
The Risk/Time required for Rondo isn't worth the loot you get.<br />
If they were going for GoD Progression, then yes, the flags will make the event worth doing.</div></div><hr />

It isn't a matter that its new content or content we are not capable of. My guild is just not interested in GoD progression at all at this point. We are focused on spending all our raid nights on Elemental progression. If there were not any PoP targets up, then maybe I could convince those that have GoD to attempt Smith raid, but not likely. I agree it would probably be faster to do Smith, but its not an option at this time, so hence the post. <br />
<br />
I did attempt this trial last night. Classes I used were Shaman (me), Cleric, Paladin, Bard, Enchanter, and Druid (I would have preferred to have a wizzy instead of druid but none avail at the time). I did not immediatly inform group not to loot, because I was focused on moving the puller in the right direction and making sure everyone was informed on the tactics. This was a mistake. /em kicks himself in the arse!! Once I realized we were getting a large amount of roamers in the first hallway (at one point had 5 mezzed and 1 active) I then made it clear there would be no more looting the remainder of the event. This seemed to stop the wanderers, but we still seemed to have an insane respawn time and roamers. I found that we just didn't have enough DPS and bard was uncomfortable with the zone so wanted plenty of room to fade. We ended up wiping due to constant roamers after the under water section. <br />
<br />
I will defin make it very clear at the beginning of next attempt not to loot any corpses. What is the respawn time after the turnin? The reason I was thinking of the CoH mage was for the run back to turnin NPC not to CoH back to zone in. But after seeing the dungeon layout and need for DPS, I will have to agree that leaving one person anywhere and dropping the DPS is not a smart tactic for this trial. Thanks for the information Karshak  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You are welcome..... regarding the respawn time if you don't loot..... there isn't one.... Basically if you invis/run to the rooms and only stop to kill anything that you cant get past you won't have any repops.<br />
Glad this helped, good luck next time!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Be careful at the end when you do the turn in.  The last two rooms WILL repop on you as soon as you do the first turn in, and they are full of ghosts.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blakcat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">WOOT! Finally beat this dang trial! After wiping 3 times at the hallway entrance just after the swim, we tried again last night. This time after the invis swim, we stopped to the right of the steps just outside of the water, killed the static spawn and pulled all the roamers/statics at our leisure to that spot (there are easily 6-7 roamers in that hallway plus 5 or so static spawns). Not really sure why we felt it neccessary to rush the ghost inside the hallway on the first 3 tries, but once we realized that we just couldn't handle the roamers and respawn fighting inside the hallway with a low DPS group, we relocated and did well from that point on. Key is to find a spot outside of any hallways to pull all roamers too, but also don't want to stay at that spawn due to the quick respawn time. If you fight in the hallways without clearing the roamers you can find yourself with 5-6+ adds fairly quickly and one very uptight enchanter. Of course I like making my enchanter buddy work for his flags, so a few adds isn't a bad thing  :p <br />
<br />
Our setup (FYI minus the chanter guildie and cleric friend, this was a pick-up group) was Shaman (me), chanter, cleric, warrior, bard, ranger. <br />
Ranger actually got the expedition, but we didn't feel confident to have him do the suicide run for the hand in, so we fought all the way to the outside of the turnin room. Once there we mezzed the last two mobs, gave the ranger IVU, (this due to the turnin room is circled by undead only) and he did the turnin which despawned the zone. We then invis'd and ran back to each room killing till we got the emote. We got lucky and got the tool emote on the second or third kill in each room. Then the ranger zoned out, got SoE up, and invis/ran to the turnin mob for our flag. Was kinda of fun to watch the train he brought back though and he made it all the way back without dying which was amazing hehe. <br />
<br />
Now on to the 4th trial, and final flag for KT access  :D . I want to  thank everyone who posted their helpful advice here. (15 sewers trials, 9 Vxed trials, and 5 Tipt trials = only 2 Yiktu stones seen and won by damn rangers  :mad: Have not seen either of the other two stones. Talk about Rarity or extreme bad luck. Ahh well there is always tommorrow  :rolleyes: )  Good luck to anyone else working thier way to KT.</div></div><hr />
