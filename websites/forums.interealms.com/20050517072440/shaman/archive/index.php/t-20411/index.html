<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, so I did the quest twice, once with my shaman, once with my bard. Curiosity is getting the best of me, so trying to figure out if it's random or what. It's not based on class, not based on race. This has been eliminated. Looking at the &quot;item lore&quot; for both that I got, something tells me it's based on character's birthdate.<br />

65 Vah Shir Shaman, Birthdate: Dec 6 2001<br />

(Effect: Tormax Candle - Shoots 2 fireworks into the air)<br />
<br />
63 Half Elf Bard, Birthdate: Jan 5 2001<br />

(Effect: Trakanon Tail - Shoots 3 fireworks into the air)<br />
<br />
Anybody else have info to share?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">based on how old your toon is? /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorg Grimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">based on how many ldon adventures looks like by polling our guild...wonder if the effect will change as you go up or if when you got it it will stay that way.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BelegurthValar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's based on age of character.<br />
Pre Kunark = Nagafen Fire, which has three fireworks and a ring of blue.<br />
During Kunark is the Trakanon Tail, Velious if Tormax, Luclin is something i Don't know, PoP is Soulsek something and after that is Mirgual Rocket.<br />
<br />
Regardless, it's quite a fun item.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I doubt that. My shaman has about 20 times more adventures than my bard does. Shaman = 65 adventures (wins + losses, 61/4), Bard = 4 adventures (4/0). That wouldn't explain why bard got better firework than shaman. However, creation date, would explain it.</div></div><hr />

I don't know about that one actually... my bard was technically created during Velious, and my shaman Luclin (no choice on that one... Vah Shir = Luclin, couldn't possibly be earlier)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Huksh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">65 Vah Shir Shaman here. I received the staff with the Tormax Candle as the effect. Birthdate was right around Luclin release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">62 Shaman here and I got the Tormax version. Hal was created in March 2001. My 65 Druid mate got the same one. I'm not sure when he created his char.<br />
<br />
Even though it's got a 1.5 second casting time you can cast from inventory and see the effect whilst running . I bet that will get nerfed real soon.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hail,<br />
<br />
Could it be based on days played maybe? ;) <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My bard, born right after Velious got the Tormax Candle.  My GF's ranger, born right before Velious, got Trakanon Tail.  I think it's based on birthdate.  I guess days /played could factor in too, she has about 100 days and I have about 50 on the bard.  I should do it with my shaman too, just to see the difference (born right after Velious and ~120 days played).  My money is that he would get the Tormax Candle though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It does appear to be age/played related because if you look at the item lore they have different descriptions.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BelegurthValar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think it is just, as to be expected, minorly buggy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Mine is Nagafen Fire. Aruman has existed since day 1 of Veeshan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm not 100% sure, but I think it is based on birthday, but there's just one for each year of EQ's existence, so March 16 of each year is the dividing line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">May 17th 2002, and I got the Solusek one</div></div><hr />

I haven't done it yet, but I'm told you get it from your home town.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>BelegurthValar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Best place I found to start it was West Freeport.  The dude is in a tent accross the newbie area from the Gnome who sells the Fuzzlecutter drinks.  You get a bag and a hintbook, but, here they are (Out of order).<br />
<br />
Scythe off Specter in Ferrott<br />
Tooth off Shark in OOT<br />
Eye off Gnolls in Paw<br />
Doll off Cats in Kerra<br />
Gland off Skunks in Tox<br />
Ring off Goblins in Dagnors<br />
Granite off Gargs in Mistmoore<br />
Wisp Stone off Wisps in West Commolands<br />
Skin off Goblins in Sola<br />
Tounge off Undead Frogs in Lguk.<br />
<br />
All the items are No Drop, and have &quot;Collectors&quot; in front of the name.  Seems fairly common drops, I did it all in about two hours.  COmbine all the stuff in the bag, and hand it to back any of the people in the various town, for your wonderful spammy stick.</div></div><hr />
