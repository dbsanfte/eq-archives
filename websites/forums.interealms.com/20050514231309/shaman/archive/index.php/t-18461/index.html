<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am writing up a guide to guild trained skills for shamans for the Crucible site and need to pick our collective brain.<br />
<br />
1 - I've found that Iksar forage is capped at 50. Is it 50 to start or does it start at 0 and need to be practiced?  If it needs practice, is the formula the usual, (level*5) + 5?<br />
<br />
2 - Same as above for Vah Shir safe fall: is cap 50? Innate or need practice?  Practice formula?<br />
<br />
3 - What is the formula for channeling skill increases?  I know the cap is 200 until 51 and 220 after that. Is it the usual formula until lvl 50, with the cap, and then a different formula after 50?  I know I was getting skillups in my late 50s and I think into the 60s, so...I dunno.<br />
<br />
4 - What is the formula for meditation skill increases?  I know the cap is 252.  Is it just the usual formula, with that cap?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm fairly sure that Iksar forage does start at 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Innate skills like forage and safe fall start at 50 and are capped there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ganbor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Channeling is 200 up to 50, then 2 points per level up to 220 at 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the help!  I'm going to assume that meditation is just the standard for now.<br />

You can preview the guide here (http://home.fuse.net/verdandi/shaman_skills.htm).  The html is incomplete so browsers other than Explorer might not cooperate.  If you see anything wrong in it please say so.  Hopefully we can save Henora from having to make corrections once it's on the site.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you have Defense/Offense and weapon skills formulas transposed. Defense/Offense are 5 points per level whereas weapon skills are 4 points per level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dalarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Vah Shir and Iksar get Slam?<br />
<br />
Sneak missing for Vah Shir.<br />
<br />
Any skills available at level 1 don't get the benefit of the 'wait till 30 and get 30 points' IIRC - IE Piercing, your example.<br />
<br />
Meditate needs to be trained I think, although with the new 'newb friendly' lower levels that may not be right.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Thanks for putting this together, was just looking for skill caps the other day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think you have Defense/Offense and weapon skills formulas transposed. Defense/Offense are 5 points per level whereas weapon skills are 4 points per level.Sure about that?  I thought I remembered it being the other way around, as I've got it.  Course it's been a while....Vah Shir and Iksar get Slam?I know it's a large race thing and Vah Shir and Iksar are large races.  Do they not get Slam anyway?<br />
<br />
Added sneak for Vah Shir, thanks.  Is that an automatic 50 skill like forage or is it a regular, trainable one with a higher cap?Any skills available at level 1 don't get the benefit of the 'wait till 30 and get 30 points' IIRC - IE Piercing, your example.Hmmm I'm remembering otherwise on this one too, although again it's been a while.<br />
<br />
Adding a need to train meditate, that does sound right now that ya mention it.<br />
<br />
And you're welcome!  I found myself using a bunch of other classes' sites recently and was jealous of many of them.  I'd love to see the Crucible as thorough and ad-free as many of them.  We librarians thrive on free and open access to accurate information :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sure about that?  I thought I remembered it being the other way around, as I've got it.  Course it's been a while....<br />
<br />
Pretty sure. I have had 2 Shamans, 2 Clerics and a Druid over the last &gt;4.5 years and all of them gained 5 points of Defense/Offense per level versus 4 points in weapon skills. The only twist is that the weapon formula is (level*4)+4, so it's not intuitively obvious the first time you level a Priest class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sure about that?  I thought I remembered it being the other way around, as I've got it.

<br />
Iksars and Vah shir do not get Slam.  Technically, I dont think either one of them is a large race either (medium), but I could be wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The only twist is that the weapon formula is (level*4)+4, so it's not intuitively obvious the first time you level a Priest class.Okay good enough for me. :)  Could it be that Offense and Defense are both (level*5) without the +5?  My brain has spit that random memory out and I'm thinking it was for offense/defense.Iksars and Vah shir do not get Slam.  Technically, I dont think either one of them is a large race either (medium), but I could be wrong.Okay, removed them from the list.  Some races are two sizes, like barbarians are both large and medium.  That is why they can wear both large and medium sizes of many armors, esp old world stuff.  There are some inconsistencies, especially on LDoN armors, but that was the original system.  In checking I see vah shir and iksar can wear both large and medium banded, so it sort of holds true still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">For Iksar forage starts and ends at 50.<br />
We do not get slam. (unless we use an illusion of a class that dose.<br />
Swimming starts at 100.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Iksars and Vah shir do not get Slam.  Technically, I dont think either one of them is a large race either (medium), but I could be wrong.<br />
Yeah, this always bugs me.  I can look down at the bald ugly head of a barb, but I'm a 'medium' without slam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">sneak is 50 at level 1, cannot be increased for kitties</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Could it be that Offense and Defense are both (level*5) without the +5?<br />
<br />
That's right, Priests don't get &quot;+5&quot; for Defense/Offense, only for their casting skills. Easy to keep track, unlike, say, Monks, who get +5 in Offense at 15 and 30 on top of the regular increase, something that has confused many a Monk...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Super, all those updates are in.<br />
<br />
Still hoping for confirmation one way or the other regarding:Any skills available at level 1 don't get the benefit of the 'wait till 30 and get 30 points' IIRC - IE Piercing, your example.</div></div><hr />
