<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Depends on the gear of your friend - in theory, if his MR is low and you can land spells on him, I'd Snare/Root him, DoT, pepper him with arrows and joust him with a hig-damage 2Hander while waiting for your bow to refresh.  Hit hide occasionally so he loses targeting if you're successful and he doesn't have a See Invis item.  <br />
<br />
Sorry, got distracted in the middle of this, have to run. Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Capias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shouldn't be a tough duel for you.  Sow yourself, snare him, root also if it sticks.  Use your DS - that damage will really add up.  If you're losing in straight melee, just back up and bow kite him.  You can use your heals to get back to full health in between shooting arrows.  By then he should be softened up enough for you to finish him easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beolorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This should be a very easy duel the warrior in full crusty should be very simple to snare after that you have won the battle.  <br />
<br />
A few tips <br />
<br />
1. you can't go toe to toe get a 2handed weapon and joust<br />
<br />
2.shaman potions are your friend<br />
<br />
3.hide is nice if he doesn't have see invisible<br />
<br />
4.If you really want to destroy him use swarmcaller to proc a slow then switch to a really really high damge 2 hander tantor's tusk argent protect etc. and joust him with him slowed with his centi's hes not going to be hitting you much when you joust him<br />
<br />
5.You just about can't lose this fight my friend just be smart<br />
<br />
6. J-mans stick procs tash :P if you have trouble snaring</div></div><hr />
