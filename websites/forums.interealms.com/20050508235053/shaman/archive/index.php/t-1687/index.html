Shaman charm sucks...</div></div><hr />

Didn't think Tantor was soloable by any class other than Bards and Rangers. Being also that Stronghorn is red to 60, right ?</div></div><hr />

 it doesn't count if you don't get the full amount of exp from the kill.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">On the subject of druid soloing, I ran across this thread on the Druid's Grove today:<br />
<br />
http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=26909.topic<br />
<br />
The author presented the following mobs as challenges.  He said you could receive buffs from other classes (which violate my definition of soloing) but not use dire charm (which IS soloing IMO).<br />
<br />
---Mobs to test your mettle against---<br />
<br />
1) Hard standard mobs (You should be able to kill these mobs before even attempting the next level of mobs)<br />
<br />
Golden Efreeti in SolB.<br />
Sirens in Sirens Grotto (pretty easy but a start to it)<br />
Phase Spiders in Dragon Necropolis<br />
Renux from the Rogue epic.<br />
Disturbed Elysian remains in Umbral Plains<br />
King Akanon <br />
<br />
2) Easy summoning Mobs:<br />
Magus Rokyl in SolB.<br />
Corrupted Brownie in Lfay for Druid Epic<br />
Corrupted Cyclops in Ocean of Tears for Druid Epic<br />
That named undead gorilla in Burning Woods.<br />
The Great Saphoryte in Echo Caverns!<br />
Yvolcarn<br />
Estrella of Gloomwater<br />
Kael Arena Giants<br />
Phinnie(Phineanegel)<br />
<br />
3) Level 60 + mobs that do not summon that are a challenge:<br />
<br />
Tantor in Western Wastes <br />
Ice Burrowers in Western Wastes<br />
Warlord Tikki in Fungus Grove<br />
Shiknar Royal Guard in Fungus Grove<br />
A Thought Stealer from Maidens Eye<br />
<br />
Icehackle in Western Wastes (unconfirmed if he summons or not, I don't believe he does)<br />
Stronghorn in Western Wastes (unconfirmed if he summons or not, I don't believe he does)<br />
<br />
Non snareable mobs:<br />
Warden Bruke<br />
Spire Lord<br />
<br />
4) Summoning Mobs:<br />
Standard:<br />
Corrupted Eylisians<br />
Ydelma<br />
Doom<br />
Western Wastes AE Nest Dragons (Pantrilla, Bravi, Mazi++)<br />
<br />
There are some impressive kills in that list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Western wastes is messed up for solo killing. Mobs are exploitable as pets. You just need proper factions. People can solo ST key dragons.<br />
If it's a non summoning mob, then its trivial to kill things with just pet-kiting ala Priest of Discord. Many on the list are killable this way and really don't take much skill.<br />
<br />
Also not to hack on the druid too hard,and I am not familiar with ALL their buffs; but it looks like buffs in the screen shot are not all his ? <br />
My definition of soloing is self buffs only. Any dire charms, lifeburns, manaburns, etc all count as legal in my book though, they are part of the character's skillset.<br />
<br />
I like that list of things to try, excluding WW, the only one I find difficult though is Phinn, because of his guards, not him himself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">With NToV armor, FT items, KEI, and a cleric symbol, a druid can solo a summoning mob much like a shaman would.  The trick is that their spells are faster casting and highly damaging.  OK so Wildfire and Moonfire are a bit long casting, but there are some smaller nukes that cast quite fast.  In a zone with &quot;pet&quot;able mobs, even more is possible.  <br />
<br />
I duo with a high level druid quite a bit.  Our latest exploits were seahorses in SG.  I'd pull two with Malo, he'd assist me and charm the maloed one, then sic it on the other one which I'd malo and slow.  He'd then keep that pet until the next two pull.  We got a cloak and each got a bracer outta that deal.  Also we got those wizzie Giantbane herbs.  <br />
In chardok i help him have a permanent dog pet.  He's close to dire charm and man will that speed things up!  Or at least smooth things out a lot, what with charm never breakin at a bad time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Duffe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">it's not really soloing if you use buffs or any other kind of help from anyone else. also root,rot,egress is a really REALLY cheap way to do things. doesn't cut it in my book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Xican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Mmm...Not sure where egress takes you in WW...but in that zone root, rot, egress probly not a good idea.<br />
<br />
And, Landragoran, a friend and I have been doing something simlar (both Druid's though) he pulls with MR animal debuff, I charm 1, hop outta the water, let them fight...Wait for exp message.  Then, hop in wait for charm to drop, and nuke the last one down.  It's fairly effective, but in a night with bad resists on charm it can be frusterating.  We've only done it once, though it seemed to be working nicely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">In WW egress takes you to the entrance of the cave to Siren's Grotto.<br />
WW has cov assisting exploits.<br />
That kill shown above isn't anything special.<br />
It's even less special considering that Stronghorn doesn't summon.<br />
How hard is it to charm/kite for however long it takes?<br />
How hard is it to dot and run for an hour?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">no way is it soloing if you get buffs from other people....makes everything a LOT easier to have aego, kei, haste (for melee) etc.<br />
<br />
not trying to diminish the guy who solo'd strong horn, but i bet it's not very hard. just about running around for a LONG time, med-kiting and using effective, damaging spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If he got buffs from other classes in addition to his own, then he didn't &quot;solo&quot; the mob as such. Also, I don't remember whether it was posted here on these boards, or on some other shaman board, but there was a detailed report, with pictures, about a shaman soloing some dragon. Was even named, but I can't be sure about that one, as it was long time ago. He didn't even kite it, but really tanked it, used all his spells, his OWN buffs, and his pet as an additional &quot;DoT&quot;. He used Torpor a lot, I recall him using JBB as well, and I think he also had Manastone, but not sure about it..<br />
<br />
Eh, wish I would have tagged that post. In any case, beats that druid by far. Solo, self only buffs, NO KITING. Nah, druids can't ever do that..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Banadan - that would have been Yeldema, who was first solod by Nixx (famous (or infamous) test server shaman). These days (so I hear) Yeldema is getting pretty sick of all the Oracles who have just got torpor whacking her down :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Originally posted by Viscerator <br />
Western wastes is messed up for solo killing. Mobs are exploitable as pets. You just need proper factions. People can solo ST key dragons.<br />
<br />
Hmmm... which ST key dragon is soloable?<br />
<br />
I'd like to watch that fight... Although I don't think the fight is going to last that long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Tantor? Kael Arena Giants? Warlord in FG? Phinigel?<br />
<br />
No way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shamangod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Klandicar can be taken down by a bard probably who just keeps sending charmed mobs at him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Hmmm... which ST key dragon is soloable? <br />
Sontalak and Klandicar have both been solo killed. It's exploited and bannable, but it has happened. Maybe another reason they keep &quot;upgrading&quot; them.<br />
<br />
I think egress killing is legal in my mind. I would also consider root, zoning legal. The target dies and you get the kill solo.<br />
I use root zoning to break spawns all the time.<br />
<br />
I would consider those &quot;tactics&quot;<br />
<br />
I agree thought that half of their &quot;listed&quot; kills were with all kinds of help. Extra buffs, people assisting with spawns, or break. <br />
None of that counts. Has to be 100% yourself folks.</div></div><hr />
