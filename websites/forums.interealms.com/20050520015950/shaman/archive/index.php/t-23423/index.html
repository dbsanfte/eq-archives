<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ixoye1213</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't know if any of you recall the novel by Jack London titled &quot;Call of the Wild&quot;.  It is a story of a Siberian Huskie that is stolen and sent to Alaska to be a sled dog.  The whole story is filled with the Arctic and Wolves and Adventure.<br />
<br />
Call of the Wild seems more fitting for us as Shaman (especailly Barbarians with DogDog out) that for the Tree Hugging Bear lovers.<br />
<br />
I can just Picture Rezing a buddy in Everfrost with good old DogDog at my side...makes me warm inside!!<br />

Shandy tells the group, &quot;Fallen_comrade_01 will be here as soon as he answers his Call of Nature.&quot;<br />
<br />
Which, as it turns out, is generally what I do while awaiting resurrection.</div></div><hr />
