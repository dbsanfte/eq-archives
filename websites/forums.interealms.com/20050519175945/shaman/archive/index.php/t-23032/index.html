<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have prowled a little bit, but it has been about two months since my account ran out, and a month since I have checked on the boards here. From my brief review, it seems that the developers at SOE have not answered any questions about balance in the 8 months since January's big push to get some answers for shaman. <br />
<br />
So far they have provided shaman with no increase in blast healing or slight increase in dps (through hate modification on dots, no speed up on dots, or resist modifier on dots, or reduction in malos reuse timer, or innate dual wield for dog, or increase in blast dd). Basically we have RC3 and a slightly better slow for the new 15-30 second battles?<br />
<br />
Any rumblings that they are really testing any requested changes for balance, or just the usual don't bother us we are thinking?<br />

I sure wish I could stall like SoE does. I would still be sleeping with like three of my ex girlfriends while making a mint. (Sigh)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sony held a &quot;forum&quot; where they invited a lot of folks out to San Diego to talk about the &quot;state of the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
From those meetings, somethings happened. (don't ask me what)<br />
<br />
Oh and Sony also appointed &quot;Class representatives,&quot; in an effort to add some more layers of bureaucracy to the whole CS machine.<br />
<br />
Some Shaman issues were being discussed over on the Sony boards. <br />
<br />
IMPORTANT issues such as Alchemy prices and some other stuff.<br />
<br />
IOW, to summarize: status quo.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nothing changed .. the good 10 questions are still unanswered, the Top 10 shaman issues are 'being evaluated', they make posts on the SoE board disappear if you don't change your settings (nice way of censorship .. they stick to their rules of not deleting threats and posts, but found a new way for people to not read those posts), you still cannot patch heal very well in GoD (if you get a lucky crit you might).<br />
Oh, they refund the Call of the Ancient AAs today I think .. it stays a HP only heal.<br />
<br />
So long<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Honestly, I am giving them the benefit of the doubt, although they certainly dont deserve it, so I dont expect anyone else too. <br />
<br />
Here is why. They did bump up Quies and BoT considerably. They increased the regen on Replenish to a respectable amount, an amount that NOTICABLY hels up casters who take a couple pops. The increased pet abilities DID help us to some degree. Other gamewide changes have helped everyone.<br />
<br />
Now, here is my reasoning. They didnt do a TON of balance things, because, quite frankly, they would end up doing it twice. Now, and again when we all hit level 70 with our spells. OoW is bringing us better spells. We will have to wait and see what they are like, if they get adjusted, whatever. But I have to admit it makes little sense to make SWEEPING balance changes now, when another huge chunk of &quot;game&quot; lies before us. Especially when MOST of the balance issues lie at the top end (for example, your average BoT-LDoN Normal Shaman isnt NEARLY as bad off as your average KT-LDoN Hard Shaman). That is the section of the EQ population that will be 70 first, in all likelyhood, and at THAT point, we can see whether we are balanced against the content.<br />
<br />
As it stands, the changes to the HoTs pushed that &quot;wall&quot; back quite a bit.</div></div><hr />
