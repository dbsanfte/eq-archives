<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys,<br />
<br />
I'm so sorry it's come to this, but I have temporarily disabled open registration for these forums for a bit. All registrations will have to be approved, so there will be a slight delay before new members can access the forums.<br />
<br />
I was really hoping that some non posters would see the Proposal link and would want to come and register and show their support. <br />
<br />
If you want to register, you should receive a response within a couple of hours! (well, except for tonight).<br />
<br />
Thanks for your understanding.</div></div><hr />

Maybe you should sticky this post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's weird, but a lot of people miss stickies. I'll sticky it for a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I miss stickies all the time.  Its because you train yourself to ignore the stickied posts like &quot;Nominate Threads for the Medicine Cabinet!&quot; and &quot;Forum Rules and Board Info&quot; because you've already read them, and so your eye naturally gravitates to the first post below the stickies.  Dunno any real solution for this except maybe to bump those two posts everytime you add a new sticky post.  That way people could just ignore the first two stickies rather than all of them.  Or maybe there is some way you can control the sorting of stickies?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'll just unsticky it for a bit :)</div></div><hr />

Oh thank you for this, I thought it was just me :)<br />
<br />
This come so naturally to me, it took me more than a week to notice the proposal post, even after I'd read other posts about it, and looked for it !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yeah, true as all get out on the sticky thing.  You could sticky &quot;NAKED PICTURES OF JENNY MCCARTHY&quot; up there and I'm not sure how many would even notice.  (or care)<br />
<br />
It is too bad that the ignorant trolls have descended like the swarm of stupidity on this little haven of cyberspace.  But idle hands and vacant minds, combined with AOL lend themselves to wanna-be-heroes flaming anyone who disagrees with them under the protection of anonymity.<br />
<br />
Oh and {bump}</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">bumpage...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hey you guys!<br />
<br />
I really appreciate your patience. According to Sunmoon, I seem to be really good at turning the registration feature OFF and not so good at manually approving new accounts. <br />
<br />
I apologize if anyone is experiencing a delay in receiving their activation email. I'm working with Sunmoon to figure out what I did wrong.<br />
<br />
REALLY REALLY SORRY!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">'Tis ok Glori.<br />
<br />
Monkly-business had to do this too, around the time of the Big Nerf.<br />
<br />
For what its worth, we appreciate the time you put into this board; its guys (well, gals) like you that keep useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yeah, true as all get out on the sticky thing. You could sticky &quot;NAKED PICTURES OF JENNY MCCARTHY&quot; up there and I'm not sure how many would even notice. (or care) <br />
I would :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>zensation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Bump bump <br />
'tis important</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Okay! Everyone that attempted to register over the past several days please attempt to post! You can reply to this thread, or post in the test forum if you'd prefer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">If it was up to me and it ain't; more's the pity.  I would have a non member area for keeping pet Trolls and member area for super secret real Shaman discussion.<br />
<br />
What would be the requirements for full membership?  Not sure.  Maybe two weeks of civil posts without getting on the nerves of 98% of the board population.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Sionnach, that would rock :)<br />
<br />
If anyone is still having difficulty posting, please email me at shamantest1@hotmail.com !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Bumping it cause i just now saw it lol.</div></div><hr />
