(the order of importance: healing/debuffs/mana regen etc) will be determined via poll, so VOTE http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19072) I locked the poll. I am only listing the top 5 issues.<br />
<br />
To the Sony Online Entertainment Developers . . .<br />
<br />
The shaman community has been trying for the last couple of years to come up with some form of unified commentary to express unhappiness with the state of our class. This effort has met with failure a number of times, probably due to the sheer utility of the class. We can solo, group and raid—so people with different play styles have different views of the basic problems. The net result is that for the most part, we can’t agree on much of anything, other than the fact that the shaman, as a class, has issues. <br />
<br />
Shamans are plagued with the perception that we are being punished for the powerful combination of slow and torpor back in the Kunark expansion. Each and every expansion we fall farther behind other classes in healing and damage (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19149) <br />
<br />
Our healing and damage is now more closely compared to hybrids than other priest classes. Our two strongest points, debuffing and mana-regen have been reduced to no advantage over other classes. It is hard to understand our role in the game. We are no longer the best debuffer by any significant margin, nor are we a good healer or a good damage dealer. We aren't really a pet class and our buffs are less and less sought after, we are certainly no longer the best buffing class of either melee or caster.<br />
<br />
With the impetus of the current spells and abilities from Gates of Discord (“GoD”), discontent seems to have increased substantially. The general consensus is that we have reached our pinnacle of usefulness in Kunark and have wound up at the bottom of the heap in just about any measure of class balance. Mediocrity compared to the other specialized classes we can understand. Being dead last in basically all categories is a bit much of a penalty for utility.<br />
<br />
Another difficulty the shaman are facing is that we are suffering deficiencies in so many areas, that it looks like we’re asking for the world if we suggest fixes for them! However, in terms of balance, fixing one or two of the issues would effectively negate four or five others. For instance, addressing damage per second (“dps”) covers nukes, damage over time spells (“DoTs”) and pets concurrently. A fix in one of those areas might make changes in the others overpowering. Accordingly, we decided to post a list of problems we feel need to be addressed desperately. After all, you folks at SoE have to decide what constitutes balance in the end.<br />
<br />
<br />
Top 5 Issues as a result of the What do we need the most? (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19072&amp;pagenumber=1) Poll<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Healing   <br />
<br />
Shaman healing is extremely weak when we have to debuff mobs before each encounter. This weakness is compounded greatly with mitigation. It is most severe on mobs that have high dps but die relatively quickly. That is why PoP-type mobs, with high dps and low hp relative to older expansion mobs, have marginalized shaman healing and slowing ability. We often fall into the dreaded &quot;tnarg chain&quot; cycle: a slow is resisted and the main tank takes so much damage we can't stop casting tnarg long enough to attempt another slow.<br />
<br />
Shaman healing is way behind other priests even when slow is factored in. Healing needs to be re-evaluated in comparison to other healing classes, including paladins. This review should include cast time, mana cost and amount healed. Our heal over time spells need improvements and we need access to a group heal. Exp group mobs hit harder in one round than we can heal.<br />
<br />
-No group healing ability<br />
-Smallest direct healing ability<br />
-No upgrades to our amount healed in our heal over time line, which we received in Kunark.<br />
-No MGBable/AE heal, like other priest classes and our hybrid class, beastlords.<br />
<br />
<br />
Healing Suggestions:<br />
<br />
* Some sort of group heal or group heal over time (with MGB option).<br />
* Some sort of upgrade to or improvement of Quiescence.<br />
* Some sort of faster and more efficient quick single-target heal<br />
* Bigger quick single-target heal<br />
<br />
<br />
2.  Mana Regen   <br />
<br />
In the past, cannibalize and our ability to regen mana was blamed for shortcomings in other areas, such as mana cost and duration of our buffs and manacost of heals. With the new and widespread abilities in passive manaregen for other classes, an upgrade to cannibalize 4 needs to be implemented. We are the only class forced into a position where we have to sacrifice so much to regain mana. Most other classes simply use a buff slot.<br />
 <br />
* Other classes get mana regeneration methods that are nearly equivalent to shamans<br />
* FT and other enhancements increase mana regen rate across all mana using classes<br />
* Mana regeneration spells are widely available to other classes<br />
* Cannibalize is active mana-regen and has a large number of penalties when compared to passive mana-regen (can't cast any other spells while regaining mana, can't move while regaining mana, cannot engage in any social interaction while regenning mana due to constant clicking)<br />
* Permanent Spell Slot required<br />
* The current Canni upgrade is unsatisfactory and does not address any of our concerns.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mana Regen Suggestions:<br />
<br />
* New AA ability for Cannabalize. <br />
* An upgrade or addition to Cannibalization, allowing (at the same ratio), greater or more frequent conversions of HP to Mana.<br />
Alternately, some across the board adjustment in mana cost for our spells, considering the cost of similar spells to other classes<br />
* Upgrade Can 4 - bigger bites, less clicking<br />
* New Canni AA - hastened cannibalize<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Direct Damage Spells    <br />
<br />
<br />
Our nukes need help. Even with major improvements to our DOT spells, we need a better nuke. There is no reason that hybrids should be nuking on the same level us a pure caster class.<br />
<br />
* Under powered<br />
* Slow casting (especially velium strike)<br />
* Resist rates on rains are high.<br />
* No nuke over 1000 damage, rangers can nuke almost as well as shamans. All other casting classes have a higher DD spell (cleric, enchanter, mage, wizard, druid).<br />
* Highest level poison nuke is 675dmg (compare to hybrid nukes from POP expansion, RNG -700dmg, BST -675dmg, SK -660dmg)<br />
* No specialized damage increasing focus for poison nukes.<br />
<br />
Direct Damage Suggestions:<br />
* Velium Strike changed to casting time 6.5 seconds<br />
* Alternative, a new poison nuke. Suggestion:<br />
Poison based nuke, level 65, casting time 6.0, 1200dmg. 400mana<br />
* An upgrade to our FIRE based nuke line, introduced at level 1 but then abandoned, would be nice<br />
* Keep the poison/cold nukes, up damage <br />
* Better rain spells, ditch the 4 target limitation!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
4.  Slowing      <br />
<br />
In the past, it has been justified that many of the things we are lacking at (such as healing) are a result of the powerful nature of slow. This argument is no longer valid. Encounters are designed using slow mitigation and with full knowledge of the effects of slow. The difference in slows between shamans and enchanters is small, beastlords are close behind with their very fast casting slow. Other classes like bards, necromancers also have the ability to slow pretty well too. <br />
<br />
* New slow is not satisfactory, long recast, short duration - not worthy to replace a spell in most shaman's current line up<br />
* New spell isn't good enough to memmed along with Turgurs <br />
* Bst and enc slows nearly as good<br />
* Slow mitigation has decreased the advantage we have over other classes that can slow.<br />
* GoD Slow upgrade is no good. Recast times and short duration, when paired with a nerf in effectiveness of the slow makes this spell undesirable.<br />
<br />
Slowing Suggestions:<br />
<br />
Reduced agro, mana cost, resist rate, and/or recast time on (an upgrade to) Turgur's Insects, which has been in its current state since Kunark was released six expansions ago.<br />
<br />
<br />
5.  Buffing    <br />
<br />
Once the masters of melee buffing, the only class that could buff ATK, shamans have seen their buffs become less and less desirable since Velious with the introduction of weapons with avatar procs, the ATK buffs from other classes and the decreasing usefulness statistic buffs. Our hybrid class should not be buffing HP, ATK, resists, stamina and manaregen to higher numbers than we can. There is no reason that our buffs should cost more mana and last a shorter duration than other priest classes.<br />
<br />
* Stat buffs at level 65 are largely useless because of stat caps.<br />
* Our hybrid class can buff more pure HP than we can, plus more of the other relevant stats at 65, ATK and RESISTS.<br />
* Our buffs are shorter duration and higher mana cost than other priest classes.<br />
<br />
Buffing Suggestions:<br />
<br />
* Group FA<br />
* Stat buffs that are attractive to the stat capped<br />
* A new shaman buff of adding +10% to weapon skills, +10% dmg to procs, +10% to avoidance lasting 1 hour. As str/dex/sta is pretty much maxed by so many people at the high end making the only beneficial means of buffing being hp and resists<br />
* Endurance buffs! Logical choice for shaman<br />
* Buffs which go past the sta cap (For example: So is someone with 305 Stamina was buffed with Boar they'd hit 355. Same would hold true for people at level 60 with 255. They could reach 305 with our buffs. And at 65 with 280 you'd hit 340.)<br />
* Focus augmented with the following:<br />
+30 accuracy (lowers hit/miss ratio)<br />
+30 combat effects (increases proc rate)<br />
+2 shielding (lowers damage taken)<br />
+20 Strikethrough (You swing, they dodge, you strikethrough and hit them anyway)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When did druids pass us in melee ability?  Our skill caps are 25 higher than theirs, so our melee is (still marginally) better.<br />
<br />
I disagree on the healing aspect.  With slow (full slow) we are functional healers.  It breaks down as mobs start to mitigate slow, or be immune altogether.  Unfortunately, boosting our abilities in one also boosts the other.  Either we have no chance of healing against unslowable mobs, or if they boost that ability, then we almost never need a druid/cleric around when mobs are slowable.  I don't really see any way to fix it to leave both in a balanced state.  We are definitely not &quot;way behind&quot; when (full) slow is factored in.  I don't think pets should be bothered with, they are companions and like a nice extra dot, but I don't think they'll ever be (or should be) near the power of others.<br />
<br />
Definitely agree with the need for canni upgrade though, less hitting that button the better.  I don't know that passive mana regen would be in line at this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Glor, we're never going to agree on a fix.  I wrote the following as an intro to a letter to the Dev's if we choose to use it.  Any decent letter is going to have to be long.  We just have too much to put in it, I'm afraid.  I STRONGLY recommend we don't try to suggest fixes.<br />

Mediocrity compared to the other specialized classes we can understand.  Being dead last in basically all categories is a bit much of a penalty for utility.<br />
<br />

<br />
Problems:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I STRONGLY recommend we don't try to suggest fixes.I'm gonna have to second that.<br />
<br />
DRUIDS: &quot;WE WANT A PET!&quot;<br />
<br />
In other words...be careful what you ask for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Or we need to post very percise and realistic requests. Asking to have puppy upgraded to innate alpha and ~ 30-40 unbuffed dps  vs 60-65 mobs might be realistic. Asking them for anything higher and they'll be stepping on mage/necro toes. Our best chance of getting anything done will be to provide extremely well worded and most importantly realistic requests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Apothian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have to agree on most points stated in this discussion.  I feel we MUST pick the most important issues and go from there.  Simply stating everything we are unhappy about to the most minor detail will only make us look worse.  <br />
<br />
So, I chose 2 areas I feel we need the most improvement on.<br />
<br />
1. Healing - read your neat little EQ handbook that came with the game.  The install blah blah blah.  There is a breakdown of classes in this which states something along the lines of &quot;witchdoctor&quot;   and tribal &quot;healer&quot; as a MAIN ability.  I'll quote this later, perhaps we can send that into Sony and see what they think about it.<br />
<br />
2. Slows - makes me grind my teeth when I think of how contested our slows have become.   This will probably be more difficult to fix than the healing issue but in my mind needs to be addressed jsut as urgently.<br />
<br />
I trust the judgement of the Shamans here and have no objections to suggestions thus far.  I am just casting my vote for what i feel needs priority.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">1. Increase heals to equal a druids in effectiveness.  With mitigation/immune there was no reason to tip the balance in their favor.  Also reduce new Paladin heals somewhat.<br />
<br />
2. Improve Quiescence - The upgrade to torpor only removed the snare/root effect.  There was no increase to healing power.<br />
<br />
3. Improve Spear of Torment - increase damage received from this spell.  This was merely a reduced cast time/mana from the 54 version.  Change to around 840 or so.<br />
<br />
4. Improve Velium Strike - This nuke should be increased to 1020 or so damage and maybe a second off cast time.<br />
<br />
5. Improve rain spells - increase the damage from our top two rain spells to match how effective that level of spell should be.<br />
<br />
6. Increase pets - increase relative pet power to be a pet or two behind mages/necros.<br />
<br />
7. Overall detrimental spells - add resist modifiers as the other dot classes have.<br />
<br />
8. Melee output - Reduce cleric bash ability and/or give us some melee benefit(modifier, higher skill, etc.)<br />
<br />
Note: Not all suggestions should be taken as a chunk, this might cause balance issues.   The most appropriate ones would be reduction of paladin heals and upgrading of our spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grackal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am whole heartedly with this discussion. Primarily in my experience in groups and soloing lead me to agree with Apothian.<br />
<br />
Heals: More often than not I find my self as main or second healer in a group and am hardly ever quite fit for the job. Its not fun for me to constantly canni for 3 hours just to keep MTs alive. We need an upgrade there.<br />
<br />
Slows: In a world where other classes are a mere 5 percent below our &quot;class defining&quot; ability and where end game mobs make it a trivial skill with mitigation, our ability to slow needs to be re-thought.<br />
<br />
Vote cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">positng this in the sticky thread instead of the other.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, this isnt any shorter, but it is what I sent in last night.  I send one or more of these types of emails before each expansion, in the vain hope that something might be done.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Healing Power<br />
-No group healing ability<br />
-Smallest direct healing ability<br />
-No upgrades to our amount healed in our heal over time line, which we received in Kunark.<br />
-No MGBable/AE heal, like other priest classes and our hybrid class, beastlords.<br />
<br />
Healing needs to be re-evaluated in comparison to other healing classes, including paladins.  This review should include cast time, mana cost and amount healed.  Our heal over time spells need improvements and we need access to a group heal.  Exp group mobs hit harder in one round than we can heal.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Damage Abilities<br />
DAMAGE OVER TIME<br />
-Duration of DOTs make them unattractive for use in exp groups (especially the entire disease dot line).<br />
-Agro on DOTs make them unattractive for both exp groups and raids.<br />
-Resists on shamans DOTs are high, other classes have significant -resist mods on their DOT spells.<br />
-Critical DOT aa costs twice as much as Critical Nuke AA.<br />
-Small number of DOT damage increasing focus items.<br />
<br />
Make DOTs more desirable to use in exp groups.  Bane was a step in the right direction, remove the recast time and put on a resist mod, like other classes get.  Review and reduce the amount of agro generated by shaman dots overall.  Review the cost of Critical DOT aa compared to critical nuke aa.  Compare the number of DD enhancement focus items to the number of DOT enhancement focus items.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
DIRECT DAMAGE<br />
-Resist rates on rains are high.<br />
-Cast time on velium strike is too long.<br />
-No nuke over 1000 damage, rangers can nuke almost as well as shamans.  All other casting classes have a higher DD spell (cleric, enchanter, mage, wizard, druid).<br />
-Highest level poison nuke is 675dmg (compare to hybrid nukes from POP expansion, RNG -700dmg, BST -675dmg, SK -660dmg)<br />
-No specialized damage increasing focus for poison nukes.<br />
<br />
Our nukes need help.  Even with major improvements to our DOT spells, we need a better nuke.  There is no reason that hybrids should be nuking on the same level us a pure caster class.<br />
<br />
<br />
PETS, THE FAITHFUL DOGDOG<br />
-Lowest DPS of all pet classes.<br />
-Low HP, our pet is one rounded, with my buffs, when attacked by mobs in LDON hard adventures.<br />
-Can't use the summoners boon LDON augment.<br />
-Pet doesn't innately dual wield.<br />
-Only one specialized pet buff, at level 50.<br />
<br />
GOD AA seems to be very focused on pet AA.  Of all the classes these new abilities are available to we will benefit the least, since our pet is the weakest.  The very high point cost for these abilities makes them very unattractive for such small benefits for shamans pets.  We have no pet buffs like other pet classes.  Even druids get a nice pet buff.<br />
<br />
<br />
MELEE<br />
-While shamans traditionally had the highest melee skill caps, now clerics are far superior meleers with bash and their summoned weapons.  Some shamans are concerned with why our melee has fallen behind.<br />
-Even with the rabid bear AA our melee is unimpressive.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Buffing<br />
-Stat buffs at level 65 are largely useless because of stat caps.<br />
-Our hybrid class can buff more pure HP than we can, plus more of the other relevant stats at 65, ATK and RESISTS.<br />
-Our buffs are shorter duration and higher mana cost than other priest classes.<br />
<br />
Once the masters of melee buffing, the only class that could buff ATK, shamans have seen their buffs become less and less desirable since Velious with the introduction of weapons with avatar procs, the ATK buffs from other classes and the decreasing usefulness statistic buffs.  Our hybrid class should not be buffing HP, ATK, resists, stamina and manaregen to higher numbers than we can.  There is no reason that our buffs should cost more mana and last a shorter duration than other priest classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mana Regen Ability<br />
-Cannibalize is active mana-regen and has a large number of penalties when compared to passive mana-regen.<br />
--Permanent Spell Slot required<br />
--Cannot cast other spells when regaining mana<br />
--Cannot move while regaining mana<br />
-The current Canni upgrade is laughable and does not address any of our concerns.<br />
<br />
In the past, cannibalize and our ability to regen mana was blamed for shortcomings in other areas, such as mana cost and duration of our buffs and manacost of heals.  With the new and widespread abilities in passive manaregen for other classes, an upgrade to cannibalize 4 needs to be implemented.  We are the only class forced into a position where we have to sacrifice so much to regain mana.  Most other classes simply use a buff slot.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Debuffing<br />
-Slow mitigation has decreased the advantage we have over other classes that can slow.<br />
-GoD Slow upgrade is no good.  Recast times and short duration, when paired with a nerf in effectiveness of the slow makes this spell undesirable.<br />
-No upgrades to the Cripple line.<br />
<br />
<br />
In the past, it has been justified that many of the things we are lacking at (such as healing) are a result of the powerful nature of slow.  This argument is no longer valid.  Encounters are designed using slow mitigation and with full knowledge of the effects of slow.  The difference in slows between shamans and enchanters is small, beastlords are close behind with their very fast casting slow.  Other classes like bards, necromancers also have the ability to slow pretty well too.  There has been no upgrades to our cripple line in a long time.  Other classes got upgrades to their debuffs of this type (see druids).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Shamans are plagued with the perception that we are being punished for the powerful combination of slow and torpor back in the kunark expansion.  Each and every expansion we fall farther behind other classes in healing and damage.  Our healing and damage is now more closely compared to hybrids than other priest classes.  Our two strongest points, debuffing and mana-regen have been reduced to no advantage over other classes.  It is hard to understand our role in the game.  We are no longer the best debuffer by any significant margin, nor are we a good healer or a good damage dealer.  We aren't really a pet class and our buffs are less and less sought after, we are certainly no longer the best buffing class of either melee or caster.<br />
<br />
There are many intelligent posts at The Shaman's Crucible messageboards addressing all these subjects.  Not all of them are ideal solutions or good solutions, but it is pretty easy to scan through and find some damn good ideas from some players who sincerely care about their class and the game and who have extensive experience.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have been reading every thread on the topic of shaman's being out of ballance as of late, and the three largest issues that come to mind are these:<br />
<br />
Slows - we need some way of regaining dominance of slows.  I will leave it up to you all as to what that way is.<br />
<br />
Heals - The two largest complaints is our lack of group heals, and the slowness/ineffectiveness of our &quot;fast heal&quot;.  The two most frequent &quot;secondary&quot; issues adressed would be an upgrade to our heal over time spells, and a better &quot;big&quot; heal.<br />
<br />
Cannibalism - A problem expressed quite frequently is the closing gap between our regen and others, and the still existing (if not, widening gap&quot; of our spell 'handicaps' to make up for our &quot;superior&quot; mana regeneration.  Not only do our spells cost more, take longer to cast, and are less effective in order to &quot;ballance&quot; our dwindling advantage on mana regeneration, but we must also waste a spell slot, and a considerable amount of time in order for our regeneration to be effective.<br />
<br />
Edit: tweaked the list a bit.<br />
<br />
I have a long list of fixes to just about every one of these items, but everyone will disagree on exactly how to fix them.  In the end, the devs will make their choice anyway.  I just wanted to consolidate what looks like the 3 largest areas that need to be adressed.  Most would like a larger nuke, some major tweaks to our pet, and some sort of melee upgrade as well, but fixing everything at once would (1) never happen and (2) be arguably over powered.  Instead, I think it would be best to focus the e-mail on these three areas with a brief mention of the other areas (just to let the dev's know there are in fact other concerns).</div></div><hr />

I think we need to provide:<br />
<br />
1. A detailed bullet list of the problems<br />
Not the fixes, just the problems.<br />
<br />
2. A dialouge that explains each of the above problems in detail, why we think they are broken.<br />
We don't need to provide solutions like &quot;Upgrade our direct heal to 1700&quot;, we need to only explain why 1300 is to low.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Though several of the suggestions are reasonable, we shoud really try:<br />
- to focus on a very limited number of suggestions (&lt;= 6).<br />
- to focus on our main issues and leave away things like annoyances, minor problems or tweaks<br />
- to make suggestions possibly realistic to SoE. That means, the less SoE has to change with their current setup of spells and abilities, the better.<br />
- to not make suggestions that go against some of SoEs previous design decisions (no matter, if we agree or not). For example for some strange reason SoE cut away duration and overall efficiency of PoP spells, we shouldn't try to ask to take that back. Or obviously SoE thinks, it's a good idea to keep druids better healers than shamans, so no chance to get to equal level here. We can and should ask for a lessening of that gap though.<br />
<br />
Let me try:<br />
<br />
1) Healing<br />
<br />
Bring back Khura's mending (? the equivalent to druids big heal) and update it to 4.000 HP healed for 600 mana. Easy to do, the spell was already there.<br />
<br />
We could use a bit more update on Q, let's say 400 hp per tick for slightly higher mana costs. Again easy to do.<br />
<br />
I don't think, we are too bad on fast healing (though Tnarg's is mana intensive), group heals would be nice, but aren't a necessity, so i wouldn't ask for it.<br />
<br />
2) DPS<br />
<br />
Lower overall aggro on DoTs, lower the recast rate of fast casting DoTs (Bane line). A complete overhaul, how DoTs work (aggro, counters, duration - efficiency) would be in order, but i don't see that coming.<br />
<br />
Give us a faster casting DD (6 secs?) with a small resist modifier and damage in the 1.3 - 1.5 K range.<br />
<br />
When SoE wants to push shaman more towards 'pet class', give us a noticable more powerful high level pet.<br />
<br />
3) Buffs<br />
<br />
The relative lessening of our buffs importance is an issue caused by game mechanics (stat caps, mudflation, general EQ stat system). Honestly i don't see many substantial updates here. Maybe some AA, that improves duration of ALL avatar spells for 10, 20 and 50 percent? Would at least lessen the pain of constant avatar rebuffing a bit. But i would even leave that away to focus on the really burning issues.<br />
<br />
4) Slows<br />
<br />
Same as buffs here, problems are caused by game design and mechanics. I would settle for a new slow with noticable higher mana costs, a significant MR modifier and same cast time as Turgur's.<br />
<br />
This would basically split slows in two lines:<br />
The 'everyday' slow Turgur's for normal xp grind.<br />
The expert slow (shaman only) for challenging content and raid targets.<br />
<br />
5) Canni<br />
<br />
A true Canni update, that allows shaman to canni larger chunks of HPs once, for example 300 HP for 160 mana with a longer recast time than Canni IV (between 1.6 and 1.8 times as long). Overall two goals should be achieved with the update: the shaman does have to spend less time on canning and the overall mana/time regeneration rate should be increased slightly.<br />
<br />
Please feel free to tweak the numbers, as i really suck at number crunching.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Splitzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It seems to me that a shaman's strength and focus is in indirect damage/healing through buffs/debuffs and longer duration heals/DoTs.  Instead of copying the abilities and strengths of other classes, boost ours to a point where they're viable again.<br />
<br />
One thing that's being left out of most discussions is our buffs/debuffs.  Time and time again, we're referred to as the kings of buffs.  Nowdays this is simply because we have more buffs than anyone else since a very small percentage of them are useful at all anymore.  Melees would once quite literally cheer whenever a shaman joined the group.  Put us back up to that level with buffs to directly affect avoidance, dodge, weapon skills, mitigation, strikethrough, endurance, accuracy, etc. With disciplines being treated as spells now, I KNOW this sort of thing is possible.  Make these buffs long lasting like our stat buffs and have a very noticable effect on the buffed atribute (not one that requires logs and a parser to see). Give us a short term Avatar style buff that has a huge effect on offensive melee abilities, preferably as a group buff that can be MGB'd.<br />
<br />
Cripple just doesn't cut it as a melee debuff anymore.  Take some of the proposed buffs from above and use them as debuffs.  Make these debuffs have a noticable effect like the buffs.<br />
<br />
Instead of increasing our burst heals, our healing power could be greatly increased by giving us a massive duration heal.  Something along the lines of 650+ per tic for 4-6 tics.  We wouldn't be healing for boss mobs like a druid or a cleric can, but we'd make the cut for an xp group.  A group version of quies as it stands now (maybe toss in a pois/dis/curse cure as a nod to our supposedly superior curing abilities) as an aa that we could MGB is also highly desirable.<br />
<br />
A larger selection of fast-acting DoTs with the resist mods given to other classes and no extended recast time would make up for current lack of DPS.  Bring the agro from DoTs back in line with the agro from nukes and we'll actually use them.<br />
<br />
A larger spell-based canni and an aa to reduce the re-use timer on cannibalization would cut a lot of the tedium and detriments from our activated mana regen that is no longer superior to what other classes are capable of.<br />
<br />
As an upgrade to our level 51 slow, give us a fast-casting 70-75% slow with a resist mod equal to Malos.  Leave off any kind of extended recast and you've' got an upgrade that everyone would use.  Add in a n extra debuff or two just for icing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">As an upgrade to our level 51 slow, give us a fast-casting 70-75% slow with a resist mod equal to Malos<br />
<br />
That's quite a resist mod :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">What I saw them trying to do with our new slow is give us something to use in very specific cases where getting the slow in is critical. It is very similar in the idea behind the short duration, high recast mez (dazzel?) difference being the mez is (-1000) to resist while our slow is a pathetic (-30). Having a limited use slow wouldn't be bad if it had an ultra high resist mod instead of what a lot of other classes normal spell lines have.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hi,<br />
<br />
In the spirit of Chutoi's post, I am going to propose a whole bunch of upgrades/possible fixes to the problems he mentioned.  I am a 65 Time-enabled shaman, so my ideas are geared toward endgame play, for the most part.  I've tried to think of things that would be of general benefit to all shammies, however.  A lot of these aren't my ideas, either, but the effort of the entire shaman community that posts on this board, so kudos to ya... and here we go!...<br />
<br />
&lt;h2&gt;Slow&lt;/h2&gt;<br />
<br />
The core ability of the shaman class.  99.99% of shamans agree that we should be able to slow better than any other class.  That means our slow should dominate.  There should not be situations where you say &quot;A BST would slow this mob better.&quot;  BST, as a hybrid, should be able to fulfill the slowing role, but its slow should not 'step on' the shaman one at all.  Currently it does, and this is a problem.<br />
<br />
We need to either slow more (80%, which I don't think will happen), or get a slow that is at least as good as the BST (1.5 sec cast, 65%, easy to land).  I would propose a 1.5 second cast, 300 mana, 70% slow with a 5 second recast (same as BST) that lasts a bit longer than theirs (4 mins).  <br />
<br />
There are also more creative ideas, such as tacking slow onto something that is a disadvantage in some situations, i.e. slow+nuke or slow+DoT in a single spell (so you couldn't use it on adds).  A cold based slow+nuke could be particularly interesting and good for fast-paced situations.<br />
<br />
Might look something like:<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Frigid Cocoon&lt;/b&gt;<br />
1.  Decrease HP by 1100 when cast<br />
2.  Decrease attack speed by 50%<br />
Mana:  450, Casting Time:  5.0, Duration:  1.0 mins, Recast Time:  2<br />
<br />
A 50% slow would be about 125mana (imo) and Velium Strike 300, so 450 is a reasonable cost for something that isn't as effective as Turgur's slow-wise and nukes for more than VS.  The main thing you gain is *time*, which is one of shamans' principal problems atm.  Our spells are so slow that we don't have time to cast the fun stuff.  This spell gives us a bigger nuke but at a price (more mana, slow tacked on), but also would give us a new slow resist (cold).<br />
<br />
A cold-based slow DoT might look something like:<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Frigid Withering&lt;/b&gt;<br />
1.  Decrease attack speed by 50%<br />
2.  Decrease HP by 160 per tick<br />
Mana:  400, Casting Time:  4.0, Duration:  7 ticks, Recast Time:  3<br />
<br />
This would add some dps to our slow and work with our mana regen.  Again would add another resist check for slow (cold).  <br />
<br />
I do not think either of the above spells is overpowering, although maybe need some tweaks to costs/slow pct/etc to make the idea work.<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
1.  Shm should *always* be better slowers than any other class<br />
2.  Make a slow to surpass BST slow in all situations<br />
3.  Tigirs upgrade?<br />
4.  Different resists or combination spells<br />
<br />
&lt;h2&gt;Nukes and DoTs&lt;/h2&gt;<br />
<br />
I lump these together because these are our bread and butter DPS.  Our current problems are that our Velium Strike nuke only does 925.  Other classes may be getting nuke upgrades in GoD which will illustrate further just how poor our nuke is.  <br />
<br />
If clerics and enchanters get a nuke upgrade, we should get a cold-based nuke for *AT LEAST* what they *used* to nuke for, i.e. 1100.  I have proposed a creative slow/nuke combo above.  A straight-up 1100 nuke would be easy to add.<br />
<br />
As far as DoTs go, Bane was nice, but the recast time sucks and it is resisted way too often.  The aggro on Bane is about where a DoT should be, however.  Ultor is only a soloing tool.  We do *NOT* need more DoTs to solo with.<br />
<br />
If a DoT is added, it should be FAST (perhaps 4 ticks or less even) and FURIOUS (at least 500/tick).  Basically a nuke in disguise.  Remember, we can only do this once per mob-that-dies-fast anyway.<br />
<br />
Here is my proposal for a straight up DoT:<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Curse of the Kill-You-Fast&lt;/b&gt;<br />
1.  Decrease HP by 500 per tick<br />
2.  Increase Curse counter by 18<br />
Duration:  4 ticks, Mana:  500, Resist:  Magic, Recast Time:  6<br />
<br />
More mana, less efficient than bane, but more damage fast.  Although I propose this spell, we *did* get a magic-based DoT in LDoN, so maybe it should be something novel like cold, be evocation-based possibly?, or tack on other effects (as with Frigid Withering above).<br />
<br />
A long-lasting DoT (anything 1 min or more) does us no good at this point.  We got those nicely upgraded in PoP, and it is not a place where we need improvements.<br />
<br />
To sum up, we need burst dps, either a nuke of 1100+ or a 4-5 tick DoT doing 2kish damage.  If the devs find either of these overpowering, tack them on to a slow and make them cost more.<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
1.  Better nuke<br />
2.  Faster high damage DoT<br />
<br />
&lt;h2&gt;Pets&lt;/h2&gt;<br />
<br />
Our pet is, above all else, fun.  I think of him like the cute dog in Nethack that follows you around.  He is basically a constant baseline DoT dps of about 40.  I do not think the pet needs to be the focus of attention for new expansions, nor does most of the shaman community.  All we really want with dogdog is innate dual wield and an easier way to haste him.  Adding 1-2 minor aa abilities devoted to pet is not a bad idea, but it should not be the focus of attention.  I think most shammies can agree on that.<br />
<br />
&lt;h2&gt;Melee&lt;/h2&gt;<br />
<br />
We used to be a battle priest.  We are no longer.  Clerics have taken this role.  I, personally, am fine with that.  I don't think it's feasible to make shaman melee in high end game anyway.  This is probably a point that will divide the shaman community... but I'd say most of the high-enders (65 w/aa) do not expect to kill a mob by smashing its face in.  The one possibility here is to fix Rabid Bear to be a real source of burst DPS, but, again, this is so minor compared to the other problems with the class.  <br />
<br />
One way to fix rabid bear is to have the form itself provide a benefit.  My personal favorite would be that being a rabid bear makes your poison and disease DoTs and nukes do more damage, because you are, after all, RABID!!  This would be similar to the wizard Iceflame of E'ci spell effect.  I don't consider this overpowering for high-enders at all, since we all have damage/dot foci anyway which wouldn't stack... but for those that didn't have these foci, it might be a very nice damage improvement.  I would suggest 25% improved damage to poison/disease dots/nukes while rabid bear is in effect.  I'd also up the tainted bite to be at least a 75dd.<br />
<br />
&lt;h2&gt;Buffs&lt;/h2&gt;<br />
<br />
With high-enders all stat-capped, our buffs have taken on less and less meaning.  Focus and FA are all we have left.  Group FA has been proposed.  I think this is a great idea.  In addition, I would like to see a group 60% haste for shaman, just because only the lazy of us bother with Talisman of Alacrity... so right now we labor to cast Swift Like the Wind on everyone.<br />
<br />
I don't think there is much more that can be done with buffs, other than giving us the endurance regen (which it looks like has been done).  <br />
<br />
Group FA has got to be the most requested buff (that I see).  Even if it is an AA, shammies everywhere would rejoice at its existence.<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
1.  60% group haste<br />
2.  Group FA<br />
3.  Endurance regen<br />
<br />
&lt;h2&gt;Mana Regen&lt;/h2&gt;<br />
<br />
Along with slow, this is one of the core abilities of our class.  About all I can say about mana regen is, either seriously upgrade it or just leave it alone.  A half-assed upgrade would be the worst possible change.  If you're going to add a canni, I feel it should give the extra benefit of 10ish mana/tick when used once per minute.  In other words, an improvement of 60mana.<br />
<br />
My proposed canni spell would look like:<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Cannibalize VI&lt;/b&gt;<br />
1.  Decrease HP by 250<br />
2.  Increase Mana by 140<br />
Casting Time:  3.5, Recast Time:  3.5<br />
<br />
I lengthen the casting time and recast time a bit, keep the hp-to-mana ratio pretty much the same, but make a genuine improvement to the hp gained.  If this were an aa, I would be wary of canni4/canni6 toggle being overpowered, so I would give a reuse time of 10 seconds or so in that case.<br />
<br />
&lt;h2&gt;Healing&lt;/h2&gt;<br />
<br />
Healing is, in my opinion, the most difficult aspect of the shaman class to nail down.  With the inception of EQ, we were definitely healers.  Now, we really aren't.  We are identified more as &quot;slowers&quot;, an altogether different creature.  However, with the decreasing importance of slow in many situations (unslowable raid mobs, xp mobs that mitigate), it is important for a shaman to be able to keep up.  I'm not proposing that we ever be able to heal as well as a druid, but we shouldn't be ridiculously far behind them.<br />
<br />
Kragg's mending is just a bad spell.  No one uses it.  I would not propose any upgrade to it, as I don't see shamans as CH'ers, and most shamans on this board probably don't see themselves as CH'ers either.<br />
<br />
Tnargs is a pretty paltry fast heal.  Quiescence is nice, but other than healing our own canni, simply can't keep up with mitigated mobs.  It also doesn't help on raids when you need to heal someone outside your group.<br />
<br />
So, we need either a new fast heal or a new heal over time.  Group quiescence has been suggested, and I will take a stab at what that would look like:<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Sphere of Quiescence&lt;/b&gt;<br />
1.  Increase HP v2 by 250 per tick<br />
<br />
Mana:  1000,  Casting Time: 7.0, Recast: 2.25, Target Type:  Group <br />
<br />
The idea is not to step on ethereal elixir (300/tick). or HoT the group in a more mana-efficient way than a cleric.  Hence 250, and 1000 mana cost.  Even adding something similar as an aa would make shammies happy.<br />
<br />
A new single target quiescence should look like this, I think:<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Super Quiesce&lt;/b&gt;<br />
1.  Increase HP v2 by 400 per tick<br />
Duration:  4 ticks, Mana:  275, All else same as Q<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
1.  Better fast heal<br />
2.  Better HoT<br />
3.  Group quiesce<br />
<br />
My final caveat with respect to both heals and nukes to the developers:   if you upgrade the healing and nuking capabilities of other classes without doing the same for shamans, we will fall very far behind.<br />
<br />
&lt;h2&gt;Debuffs&lt;/h2&gt;<br />
<br />
AE Malos has been suggested as a way to more quickly slow hordes of mobs.  Perhaps this is too powerful, but I mention it anyway.  An upgrade to cripple is also a frequent request.  Neither of these is high on my list, but different shammies have different priorities.<br />
<br />
I do believe debuffs could be made more creative, i.e. debuff+dot, debuff+nuke, etc.  similar to the ideas I tossed out there for the slow+nuke/slow+dot above.<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
1.  Upgrade to cripple<br />
2.  AE Malos<br />
<br />
Well, that's about it.  I'm sure there will be lots of other ideas floating around in the next few weeks.  I've tried to mention everything I've ever seen anyone post on this board, even ideas that I am not personally a big fan of.<br />
<br />
Good luck, fellow shammies =)<br />

I'm sorry that I'm not able to give all the contributors credit, there is a lot of thought and passion about the game being shown!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Andal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Just some observations on the elements of style in the proposal.  <br />
<br />
To be effective, presentation is as important as content.  I feel this initial draft lacks necessary elements of both style and content.<br />
<br />
The proposal needs to be directed to an individual.  It is too easy for everyone in a group to passively ignore something generally addressed. A person named must ignore with volition.<br />
<br />
If everyone simply mass complains using the exact same text, it will become nothing more than spam.  Really, really bad idea.  Much better to have one representative, and many signatories, with only one document sent.<br />
<br />
Anything bearing an accusatory tone needs to be removed.  For example: &quot;through a medium of concentrated neglect&quot;.  The overall tone should not seem like a complaint, but rather a reasonable discussion of objective shortcomings.<br />
<br />
We do not know the motives of the balancing team as regards Shaman, to impute bad motives will not help our cause.  It would be unhelpful for us to proceed on the assumption that the developers have chosen to ignore or neglect, when in fact they may have ample and (to them) reasonable grounds for every decision they have made.<br />
<br />
Empty statements of objective opinion need to be removed, for example: &quot;There is no reason that hybrids should be nuking on the same level us a pure caster class.&quot;<br />
<br />
Perhaps there is a reason, perhaps that reason is the subject of great and lengthy deliberation by very important and influential members of the balancing team, whose professional reputation and standing are entwined within.<br />
<br />
How can it aid us, then, to make such statements which could very well insult or at the least irritate those responsible for such things?  There are better ways to word things.<br />
<br />
Broad and subjective declarations need to be made specific.  There needs to be objective data serving to fortify each and every complaint.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shaman healing is way behind other priests even when slow is factored in. Healing needs to be re-evaluated in comparison to other healing classes, including paladins. This review should include cast time, mana cost and amount healed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Have we any data to support this?  Does the data take into consideration all mitigating factors that might be relevant in issues of balance?<br />
<br />
Wouldn't it serve us better if it was *we* who did this evaluation using objective, repeatable methodolgy so we don't end up looking silly when somebody else shows us incontrovertable data proving we are wrong?<br />
<br />
Is it reasonable to lump all other priest classes together when making this comparison, or is it more relevant to make the comparison weighing the strengths and weaknesses of each priest class individually?<br />
<br />
I could play devil's advocate, and handily argue that none of the complaints in this proposal are accurate.  I can think of dozens of reasonable and plausible objections to every single point.<br />
<br />
To win at a game like this, you have to show more sand than just all getting together on a bunch of words.  You have to have solid, unarguable evidence.<br />
<br />
My opinion is the cart is going before the horse at this point, and much more work needs to be done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nebulous?  Remove accusation, direct to a person, don't spam, measure actual healing ability and include the numbers.<br />
<br />
The proposal is nebulous, and I'm not inclined to devote my energies to help someone who would dismiss me with one sentence sixty seconds after a post I clearly put a lot of thought into.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">1. Increase heals to equal a druids in effectiveness.  With mitigation/immune there was no reason to tip the balance in their favor.  Also reduce new Paladin heals somewhat.<br />
<br />
2. Improve Quiescence - The upgrade to torpor only removed the snare/root effect.  There was no increase to healing power.<br />
<br />
3. Improve Spear of Torment - increase damage received from this spell.  This was merely a reduced cast time/mana from the 54 version.  Change to around 840 or so.<br />
<br />
4. Improve Velium Strike - This nuke should be increased to 1020 or so damage and maybe a second off cast time.<br />
<br />
5. Improve rain spells - increase the damage from our top two rain spells to match how effective that level of spell should be.<br />
<br />
6. Increase pets - increase relative pet power to be a pet or two behind mages/necros.<br />
<br />
7. Overall detrimental spells - add resist modifiers as the other dot classes have.<br />
<br />
8. Melee output - Reduce cleric bash ability and/or give us some melee benefit(modifier, higher skill, etc.)<br />
<br />
Note: Not all suggestions should be taken as a chunk, this might cause balance issues.   The most appropriate ones would be reduction of paladin heals and upgrading of our spells.<br />
You have some solid ideas here, but dont try to strengthen our position by calling for a nerf on another; not only does it breed animosity between the classes, but it makes us seem more class envious than actually concered that we have short comings.<br />
I have said it before and will say it again, give paladins all the healing they want, if some vocal minorty of them feels that they need a 1 sec cast time CH with a 1 min refresh so they can main heal in BoT and they can convince the devs to give it to them, then /cheers. 95% of the Paladins you talk to are fine with their healing capability. I am as well. So should you be.</div></div><hr />

one thing we are missing is alchemy.  It had been touched on 1000 times before, but in all practicality it is worthless.  tinkering even has more usefull stuff, and at least you need tinkered stuff to make higher end items (stonewood compound bow).  <br />
Poison making is even more usefull.  <br />
i really think herb cost needs to be readjusted to make alchemy useable.  Not to mention it would be nice, due to the nature of alchemy and the low duration of the buff potions, to be able to do stack combines...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Splitzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">That's quite a resist mod :P<br />
I really don't think a -55 resist mod on a slow is asking for all that much.  All it will do is make malos a debuff option instead of a requirement and allow us to lead with a slow instead of having to wait for malos to cast and then slowing.  This would give us the speed edge we've been asking for.  Well, something like that built in, or a new version of malos that's faster casting.<br />
<br />
The idea is not to step on ethereal elixir (300/tick). or HoT the group in a more mana-efficient way than a cleric. Hence 250, and 1000 mana cost.<br />
Why shouldn't ours be more mana efficient than a clerics?  Our single target HoTs are much more efficient than the cleric's version.  Don't forget that duration heals were our thing long before clerics picked them up.<br />
<br />
A quies upgrade is, in my mind, the most attractive way to boost our healing.  If you look at torpor (1200) vs. a druid's top fast-cast heal at level 60 (Nature's Touch, 978), we have the more powerful heal by over 20%, while still 25% less than a cleric's top fast heal (Ethereal Light, 1600).  In PoP, every priest had their general-duty blast heal effectively doubled in strength.  We got the shaft on this one since our best blast heal at the time was Superior Healing at 583hps.  Compare the upgrade we got for our workhorse heal, Quiescence, to Nature's Infusion (1750, almost 50% more than quies) and Supernal Light (2750, 150% more).  To stay in line with where we were before PoP, quies would need to do roughly 2100hps, or 525/tic.  This would also leave our blast heal at about the same as it was pre-PoP when Superior Healing and Chloroblast was all we had to work with, each being vastly inferior to the equivalent spells given to clerics and druids.</div></div><hr />

The shaman community has been trying for the last couple of years to come up with some form of unified commentary to express unhappiness with the state of our class. This effort has met with failure a number of times, probably due to the sheer utility of the class. We can solo, group and raid—so people with different play styles have different views of the basic problems. The net result is that for the most part, we can’t agree on much of anything, other than the fact that the shaman, as a class, has issues. <br />

<br />
Don't get me wrong, I think it's a great idea for slow in an exp group, but it might be a bit over powering in a raid situation where debuffing the mob prior to slow is an important step. Malos THEN malosinia THEN slow (well, tash and HOS as well). Not to mention, a lot of mages take their malosinia role on raids very seriously. Of course, we malosinia for other reasons besides slow (nukes) so it's not like we wouldn't still have to do it.<br />

Casting the 65 Malos and the 51 Slow would still be advantageous, but that would give a faster alternative.</div></div><hr />

Lets get some realistic ideas here, and no I dont have any, but I think that any ideas that we present to SOE need to be to the point, realistic and time oriented.<br />
We should ask for a ~2k blast heal for 450 mana, Group Q as an AA (IE Paragon/Spirit of Wood) or as a spell, a broad upgrade to Focus and Q (add resists or ATK to Focus and upgrade Q to 350/tick) and a general upgrade to dogdog, either by revamping the level 61 spell, or making a new level 65 spell that summons a level 60 dog that innately dual wields and has a good atk.<br />
Dont ask for Phaser Technology when the best available is .357 Mag revlovers, its tackey and prevents us from getting any upgrades as it makes us seem greedy, full of class envy, and in general as pissers and moaners.</div></div><hr />

Instead of creating wish lists, we are outlining the top issues for the post 65 stage of the game.   A fair problems list along with companion reasonable corrections surely should get the Dev’s attention's who are struggling to create balanced spells while placating Shaman’s frustrations with past expansion spell’s post Kunark.<br />

At least to me it is something like a choice of following for GoD <br />
<br />
1). Healing<br />
Common suggestions: <br />
Either - Group HoT for the class - something like Group Quiescence (with MGB option)<br />
Or – Increased Direct Heal<br />
<br />
2). Damage Output – one of the following<br />
DD - Common suggestion: Upgrade to DD - something like Poison DD with 1.X k plus damage<br />
Dot - Common Suggestion: Upgraded DoT - something like fast damage DoT for 750-1k per tick, 2-3 tick duration, low resist, high agro usable for group encounters<br />
Melee - Common Suggestion: Major Upgrade to AA Rabid bear or Bear form spell<br />
<br />
3). Debuffs<br />
Resist Debuffs - Common Suggestion: Upgrade Cripple line<br />
<br />
4). Mana Regen<br />
Cannibalize line - Common Suggestion: Upgrade to Can 4 based on higher HP pool's post PoP Expansion<br />

Nah, I'm not suggesting to make it unresistable like Malos, just to give it a better chance to land as though we has cast malos already, not combine the two into one spell.  Malos would still be needed as a resist debuff.<br />
<br />
Lets get some realistic ideas here...upgrade Q to 350/tick<br />
I'll admit to picking out one point of your post and nitpicking, but adding 50hps to quies is NOT an upgrade worth asking for.  To keep us in line with the heal upgrades clerics and druids are getting in GoD (given the same ratio torpor had to druid and cleric heals at the time) it would need to do 575/tick for four ticks.  That's a 2300 point heal.  Yeah, that's almost twice the healing power of torpor.  For comparison though, look at Ethereal Light (1600hp Luclin era cleric heal) vs Holy Light (3050hps proposed GoD cleric heal).  Clerics have almost doubled their healing power.  Same goes for druids.  The fact that it seems over the top and unrealistic just goes to show how far we've slipped in respect to the other priests.  As an added bonus, the other priests' basic heals have become on average 1.5s faster casting.  Ours are still slow.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I like your idea of adding ATK to Focus.  Perhaps toss a bit more hps on there (nothing major) and throw in a (small) boost to mitigation with a Bulwark of Vie style effect.  Again, nothing big, maybe just 3-5%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Most every class that has a &quot;defining ability&quot; has many ways in which they can approach it.  Clerics can C-heal, quick heal, sacrafice group health then group heal, or heal over time.  Nuke classes get to nuke at least 3 different resists.  Melee classes can go ranged, 1 handers, 2 handers.  Hybrids can melee, nuke, or even assist with healing.  Enchanters can mezz, stun, charm or nuke (don't think they can root).<br />
<br />
<br />
   We can do quite a few of the above listed things in ONE WAY.  Lately that isn't a very unique statement though, EVERYONE can do most of those abilities in their own fashion anymore.  Let's face it, we are down to finally being no more the second-rate of each ability, we are now specialized as....<br />
<br />
  THE MAIN SLOWER!   So, since slowing is most definately our schtick, it is about time we had more than 1 way to do it.  We have Turgur, and we have Grummus.  Grummus is ONLY used when Turgur CANNOT be used, so this is not another option, this is another path.   Where are the other slowing methods that we can choose from?  Maybe a hiccup spell that is a &quot;stun over time&quot; giving the mob a guaranteed 4.5 second stun at the start of each tick (if the spell wasn't resisted upon casting).  This would in essence be a 75% slow, but the catch is it wouldn't be a mitigatable slow.  Mobs tagged immune to stun would of course be quite immune to this as well.  If it were desired they could go with lower duration stuns like 3 seconds (50% slow) and if mitigation is widespread enough we would still use it.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Or they could be less creative and just add Cripple to slow, add a DoT to slow, have slows that increase fizzle rates or any range of other small added effect WHILE LEAVING THE SLOW COMPONENT AT NO LESS THAN 70%.   Remember, as long as we have the option of a better percent slow, everybody in the group/raid will want that one, including the shaman (unless added effect is VERY considerable).<br />
<br />
  I can only see 3 reasons that we aren't getting upgrades.<br />
1) They are afraid to raise the percentage of any slow past 75% because it would trivialize all prior encounters.<br />
2) They are afraid to improve our healing because the better we heal the better we recover mana (even though we have little to spend that mana on anymore)<br />
3) They are simply out of ideas on what else we CAN buff and finally realize that we don't need 5 more to each stat.<br />
<br />
<br />
  So all in all, seems like it is time for some new ideas, or some EXTENSIVE testing on the test server to see if improving our healing ability or slow ability really would unbalance things.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:  I even thought of a semi-creative way to improve our buffing and once more make us the KING OF BUFFERS!  Why not give us at level 65 buffs which raise the STAT CAPS instead of the stats themselves?  Since the major complaint about the stat buffs is the fact people are OVER their max allowed, why not let us explore just how far over they really are?  That would make the stat buffs a bit more worthwhile to me personally.</div></div><hr />

A resist mod on a spell is one thing, but some people are advocating a slow that has 75% slow, Crippleish effects and Malo effects or any combination of the 2...which simply put, is idiocy.<br />
Now giving it -30 resist check or -45 resist check is fine, hell SKs have -300 to most of their resist checks for Lifetaps (and thats better than necros, most of theirs are -100), but making it a 75% slow that also debuffs all saves at -45 and is unresistable...LMAO, might as well wake up and smell the coffee guys and gals that aint happening.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  All I have seen in THIS THREAD so far is a request to put a resist modifier onto the slow that is equivalent to Malos (meaning that for the resist check against that spell, and that spell only, the mob essentially has 45 less magic).  Nobody has wanted unresistable, that post mentioning it was a mistranslation of the wording that they wanted slow with &quot;The resist check of Malos&quot; incorporated.<br />
<br />
  As for having a spell that does 2 of the 3 debuffs at once, how is that asking too much?  It'd likely cost 3 times the mana of doing them seperately to balance out quite nicely.<br />
<br />

<br />
Canny that takes a bigger amount of HP and gives a Bigger amount of mana ... The ratio dosent have too be TONS better than our current just work in a bigger chunk .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">My point of view:<br />
<br />
NO DD NOR DoT part to our slows!!!!!!! How do you want to slow a mezzed mob? Or do you want to load 2+ slows?<br />
<br />
Healing: I woul like to see KM removed from our spell list. Let the druids have the iCH line. Let shamans shine with HoT (move torpor to mid / upper 50s, Quies to 61/ 62 and make it 350 hp / tick for 250-300mana, add a new HoT 400-450hp / tick for 300-350mana at 65, somewhere a small group HoT) and fast (casting time 2-2.4 sec) spot heals (make TM 1400-1500heal at 63 / 64 and add a new spot heal spell to close the gap at 57-59 like 750-850 heal).<br />
<br />
Everything that does damage can critt now but only direct heals can critt. Add critt HoTs like critt DoTs are coming now.<br />
<br />
Slow: Hm, bards can give over haste. How about give shamans &quot;over slow&quot;. Like add few 5% slow that can't be metigatet to our slow (aka 70% v1 slow, 5% v2 slow). Would give us a slight edge over BST and ENC without throwing the whole metigation system away.<br />
<br />
Debuff: Cripple doesn't do much. The AC mod on it is nill compared to the AC debuff druids can do now. And the lower proc rate from the dex debuff... does that really exist?<br />
<br />
Buffs: Merge the 60+ sta and agi buffs into a combined buff like daiku for str / dex. I don't use sta / agi buffs alot but now and then I get a request for both. Or better add sta to focus line. Beside that... I hate FA becuase the 1min casting time sucks. I have to burn a spell gem for FA to keep the melees happy. I don't mind buffing all melees with single target FA that lasts 10min as long as the recast time is under 5sec. And for sure make our group haste 60%!<br />
<br />
A final thought about shamans:<br />
<br />
FACT We have good mana regen with canni.<br />
FACT Having good mana regen needs to balanced with higher mana cost of the spells.<br />
FACT Canni is an active mana regen (we have to cast canni to get mana)<br />
FACT We can't do anything while using canni.<br />
<br />
QUESTIONWhy are our spells so damn slow?<br />
<br />
Let as assume a caster needs 7sec cast time and 250mana to cast spell X. To be on par a shaman should cast spell Y (doing about the same as spell X) in 2.5sec using 310mana, wait 2.2sec (recast time), cast canni in 2.5sec. But spell Y isn't fast! It's has a casting time of 8 and use 400mana!<br />
<br />
Beside buffs shamans should only have very fast spells to have / get the time to use canni!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Banorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I answered &quot;other&quot;.<br />
<br />
Healing:  A group heal will not make everyone happy.  It will be another utility to add to an already condensed arsenal of spells. A better heal would be marginally useful, but not very creative or satisfying.<br />
<br />
Canni/Manaregen:  Could always be better, who would ever argue otherwise?  But again, not very satisfying.  I'm sure people are recommending an option for &lt;65 canni/manaregen because especially when you introduct c5 and some FT shaman are already effective mana machines, imho.<br />
<br />
Direct damage:  I'm sure everyone's nukes needs to be better.  But do you want more agro, mobs to die faster, what?  Seems to me this won't make anyone happy, it'll be just another incremental upgrade in a long 5 expansions long tirade of incremental upgrades.<br />
<br />
Slows:  75% is at the top of the game, with no peers.  If you want it better I have no idea what to recommend.  Maybe a slow with memblur (but then you'd have even more class envy).  Slow+Dot is implausible.  A better slow would imbalance the entire rest of the content everywhere.  Don't see that improving, unfortunately.<br />
<br />
Buffs:  Do you really want more buffs?  I don't think so, not universally (some do some don't admittedly).  And what kind of buff?  another incremental upgrade in stats (please god no) or hp (marginal)?  Focus of the 7.1th?<br />
<br />
Other debuffs:  See buffs.  I leave it to the devs to be CREATIVE however the debuffs in the shaman line are also without peer and therefore hard to improve upon without requiring new game balance for old content.<br />
<br />
Pets/Dots/Melee:  I'll lump this together and just say ... incremental is good but it's not something that will make anyone happy.<br />
<br />
Summary:  None of these are anything that will make the class happy as a whole.  I would recommend coming up with something new, shaman appropriate, that is not simply a incremental upgrade to an existing skill.  That's why I chose &quot;other&quot;.<br />
<br />
I do agree that incremental upgrades are still good though...<br />
<br />
What I see is a lot of comparisons.  Lots of classes heal, that's not a big deal, it helps the whole of the community.  Same for the rest.  However I feel that shaman need something new and creative in the form of a spell, discipline, or aa that provides a more unique shaman usefulness.  The key word being unique ... because everything else is a rehash of some skill that some class does better (except for slows).  That defines my reason for &quot;other&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">My input. Better heals is a given, due to the rampant state of slow mitigation. Better dps, dots that give us a reason to cast them over nukes etc. All this has been said.<br />

Since they arent removing slow mitigation, they need to up heals. Who gives a crap if this trivializes old content. So did level 60. And AA's. And level 65.

<br />
What hasnt really been said is buffs. Stat buffs are nearly useless. Clueless level 65 noobs might want them, but frankly I am tired of them having their input heard. But OTHER buffs might not be. Stuff that exists in terms of % mods on items could be put as a buff. Rather than +Agi, we should have % dodge mods, or avoidance mods. Stun resist mods. Strikethrough etc. A reason to buff at high end would be good. Hell, how about a spell called &quot;Warpaint of Zek&quot; that adds to the chance that Flurry/PB/Double Ripopste etc go off, and increases hate. Stat buffs were useless a year ago. I dont know why everyone is TRYING to be uncreative on buffs...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Healing (some slow stuff)<br />
First our heals our lower because of slow that is the reasoning we were given.<br />
I would like to put forth though that while that works in theroy that does not work in practice.<br />
All other healers benefit from our slows with us in the group.<br />
It would be like saying a Cleric can only heal others for full and themselves they can only heal for half of their max heal.<br />
With slow mitagation and immunity we do not heal as well.<br />
From levels 1-55 until Chloroblast Shaman and Druid healing is even.<br />
From 56-65 there is a decrease is Shaman heals but no increase in our slowing power.<br />
Fine if you want Druids to gain a needed heal boost but the basis of that was we can slow and our slow did not get any better and it in fact gets worse because the higher level you fight the more stuff that mitigates or is immune.<br />
Therefore that is not a valid argument.<br />
Druids may have needed a bonus I wont begrudge them that but the balance of slow vs heal/mitagation/immunity has not been found yet.<br />
We should heal better than Paladins which we really do not do now and less than a Druid imho.<br />
<br />
Slow mitagation<br />
As for mitagation. It was needed to tune encounters. Fine.<br />
The problem with that is is it closed the gap on our higher % vs our higher mana cost slower casting time and higher resist rates.<br />
Basically there is no real difference in slow % now and we have completely lost any edge we had as more and more mobs mitagate.<br />
Yet we still have all the penalties associated like crappier heals.<br />
<br />
Higher mana costs, slower cast times are what we pay for out mana regen.<br />
What do any other classes that have a high mana regen pay?<br />
Do clerics pay higher mana costs for their self buff?<br />
Do Druids, Enchanters, BL? Anybody at all but us?<br />
With all the passive regen available from other classes buff our active regen is basically on par. Ours is SELF only theirs is GROUP.<br />
As pointed out we can not be casting anything else or move while regaining mana this is VERY limiting and is enough to not have to pay an additional penalty of higher mana costs and longer cast times.<br />
Frankly our sustainable mana regen is not higher than any other class.<br />
Again this penalty to our spells proves out of balance.<br />
<br />
Debuffs.<br />
Again we see a penalty on our spells with the lack of resist adjusts on our spells vs all other classes that can debuff.<br />
Mage spells do not lack resist mods they have Mala and Malasinia as well.<br />
Druids do not lack resist adjusts and they have fire and cold debuffs.<br />
Same for Enchanters Bards or any other class that debuffs.<br />
Again we are unique in not having resist mods because of a debuff that all classes benefit from when cast and that other classes have as well.<br />
This combined with other penalties like higher cast times, higher mana costs, and slow mitagation proves a bit excessive.<br />
We end up with 4 times the mana cost 4 times the cast times to do the same thing.<br />
<br />
Buffs<br />
Our buffs simply have not kept power post 60.<br />
With new gear and such and diminishing returns on the benefits of stats over 255 our stat buffs are largely useless. Seriously do some parses on the effects of any stat over 255 you will find the benefit drops considerably. It is really noticable on sta. Look at hp per sta below 255 vs above 255 an you start seeing why stat buffs have lost their usefulness.<br />
Our main spells of Focus and Avatar lost a lot to other classes upgrades.<br />
Hybrids basically have caught us or passed us in both we have not kept par with where we were.<br />
<br />
Pets<br />
They want to give us all sorts of expensive pet aa in GoD but the fact remains we are left off things like summoner's boon and our pet while not the weakest is pretty weak. I do not feel our pet is a huge issue.<br />
We will forever walk the borders of pet class or not.<br />
<br />
Melee<br />
Why is it that even with RB we can not out melee a Cleric with a summoned hammer?<br />
Nuff said fix RB to be a PERM effect.<br />
Again I wont begrudge the Clerics a boost but there is something wrong that with a 41% haste item and a 99% haste/140 attack aa you cant outdamage a Cleric with a summoned item.<br />
<br />
Side Note: Slam for big races should work in bear form and have a higher cap than a lousy 1. All other racial abilities have a cap of 50 or 100 yet slam is capped at 1. More of a racial thing than a class thing hence the side note. Racial balances should be revisited as well.<br />
<br />
Dots/Nukes<br />
Our dots take too long to run for todays fights.<br />
We dont have effect nukes.<br />
Our rain spells resist too much.<br />
We do not have any effective way to add DPS to a group.<br />
Our nukes have fallen so far behind that even Rangers can nuke about as well. Disease DoTs are completely useless but for soloing and soloing is not our forte.<br />
Focus effects and aa for our dots are still lacking and rarer or more expensive to obtain.<br />
We have no poison specific focuses.<br />
Our poison nuke did not see a damage increase.<br />
<br />
Spells<br />
Our spells still number among the rarest and most expensive to obtain.<br />
Malo and Torpor continue to be too rare.<br />
Primal Essense though is nye impossoble having to share an ultra rare component for research with RGC. Please change PE to use another component than part of Yaeth's compendium 73 right.<br />
Missing several group spells.<br />
Group PE<br />
Group Avatar<br />
Group Heals<br />
We also generally and overall got a very poor power upgrade in PoP.<br />
If expansions are not about class balancing why did the Shaman not get equivelent upgrades to other classes?<br />
That last part though is what truly hurt us. They used PoP to try and balance our heals with Druids intoduced Mitagation to balance our slows etc. That is the real issue we are facing today. Well I guess they are right though expansions dont balance classes they UNbalance them.<br />
<br />
Basically we see a slow decrease in power starting at 58 at 60 things even out a bit if you can get a super rare spell called Torpor (Making Torpor a vendor spell would fix that maybe)<br />
From 61-65 all other classes abilities jump by leaps and bounds.<br />
We pretty much remain not much better than we were at 60.<br />
It is no ONE thing really it is the combination of all the penalties thrown at us and the decline of power from 61-65 vs other classes gains that unbalance the Shaman class.<br />
Every fix they made to encounters or game play has ultimately effected us poorly.<br />
By doing needed things to balance other classes and encounters the net result has been unbalancing the 61-65 Shaman.<br />
It is an OVERALL effect so just singling out 1 or 2 things doesnt work.<br />
Without looking at the overall big picture you cant show what happened and why we wont let this progress into GoD.<br />
<br />
There is such a large picture to portray of what has happened to us since Kunark and what becomes of a Shaman in todays world at 65 that it is going to be very hard to summarize any better than Chutoi already did. It was lengthy because it had to be in a way. We cant just say fix this and not explain why. Why is not a simple answer at all.<br />
I barely touched the surface of all the issues.<br />
<br />
Bascially the best we can do is submit to them our concerns as clearly and concisely for as much as we can agree upon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Change new slow to -60 resist check with 1.5 casting time 70% 6 recast and 300 mana This would put us back on top where we belong.<br />
<br />
Change new canni to aa and up the hp/mana ratio <br />
<br />
Just delete the disease dot.... disease dots are worthless.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Splitzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I'm pretty sure this isn't the popular opinion, but I for one really don't want to heal or nuke like a druid.  Blast heals and nukes aren't in line with how our class has been portrayed since the beginning.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, Tnarg's needs an upgrade to keep it in line with the new spells being given to the other priests.  Basically, we should all be able to accomplish the same tasks, but in different ways.  For us, a duration heal like quies that's big enough to actually be effective against LDoN hard/Ele mobs, combined with a 1500ish blast heal is more than enough, and doesn't blur the lines between the classes even farther than they already are.<br />
<br />
Same deal with nukes.  Ours could definately use some work to keep us a step or two above the hybrids, but they have never been and shouldn't become our primary source of damage.  DoTs have historically filled that role.  In a lot of ways, Bane was a step in the right direction to bring us in line with the faster pace the game has taken on. It has a ton of shortcomings (high resist rate and a horrible recast time) but it gives us an option for damage that's in line with the class.  If you look back at our DoTs, they compare easily to a wizard's nukes in total damage done.  Sure, we can't do a lot of damage in a hurry, but if you give us some time, we've always been able to put out some very respectable numbers.  To keep pace with the faster fights of today's encounters, I vote we get more options for fast acting DoTs.  A new poison DoT that takes 30 seconds to act, or a new disease DoT that lasts a minute at the outside.  Keep the damage on them the same relative to wizard's nukes, leave off the absurd recast times that discourage common use, and adjust the agro from DoTs to keep it more in line with a nuke of the same strength and you'll have a source of damage that fits our class.<br />
<br />
Basically what I'm saying is that while we definately need some work, simply handing us the exact same strengths given to another class is just an easy fix that does nothing to help the game as a whole.  Class abilities and strengths should remain unique; blurring those lines is what got us into our current situation with slows.  Advocate fixes that are in line our specialties and don't just mimic other classes.</div></div><hr />

It has absolutely nothing to do with most of the problems that have been brought up, but since it very neatly fixes a nearly universal irritant without introducing any ability we don't already have it deserves notice.

We have all wanted out-of-group shrink. Maybe we could have a spell that would summon shrink potions for groups. They could be lore and no-rent like mod rods and would be TGB-able and MGB-able.<br />
Along with a follow-up from Mamutoi:<br />
Make it like the mages mass mod rod. Summon an item with 2 or more charges of shrink on it that is put in everyones cursor that is in range. No Drop, Lore, No Rent.<br />
<br />
The item would work just like a shrink potion, no buff slot, lasts until you die or zone.<br />
<br />
Would solve the MGB shrink problem since you aren't MGBuffing shrink, you are summoning an item with shrink click effect it that everyone gets. If they want to shrink they can click, if they don't want they don't click. Problem solved.</div></div><hr />

Everyone can't agree to agree on a few major points. I'm sure the Dev's know some of them. Their attention however is not focused on our class and hasn't been for awhile. <br />
<br />
Presenting 4 Areas in which we need help, outline how we are balanced against other classes and list the issues for each area for groups and raiding.<br />
<br />
Giving suggestions to Devs will only clutter the issues... Make the points! Once they see the issues (not all the fluff), like that a Hybrid Class is getting a Group Heal over a preist class then... then and only then will they take the time to focus on our class. Maybe then they will sort through the posts here looking for suggestions.<br />
<br />
<br />
We have gone through 5 Expansions and 1-2 Preist Class rebalancings with no change to our class other then soft-nerfs. We are not broke but we are becomming the bastard class of EQ quickly..

<br />
How would I like to be a better me?<br />
Melee:<br />
- Raise our melee skills to 220ish.<br />
- Bit more reduction on Rabid Bear without all those AA please.<br />
- Give us an actual Bash skill.<br />
<br />
Spells/Heals:<br />
-  Unresistable slow for 50% would be neat for the big nasties.<br />
-  A Turgur's-equivalent that includes the aforementioned -45 resist check.<br />
-  Poison (or better, Disease) based nuke equal to Velium Strike but faster cast.<br />
-  Curse (magic-based) line of Dots equal to our poison ones.<br />
-  Flesh out our Inner Fire line, or add stacking AC or ATK benefits to our later Focus spells.<br />
<br />
I've always considered shaman and bards the 2 &quot;glues&quot; of grouping.  Group-oriented buffs would be a huge benefit.  Perhaps an AA (3 min refresh) that'd take the next spell and make it a group spell?  I wouldn't care about MGB.<br />
<br />
-  Upgrade to Bih'Li:  ATK, UV, 60% movement increase.<br />
-  Endurance regen line (or just let our old ones work again.)  I miss the real Acumen.<br />
-  A lev 61 version of Torpor, so all shaman can progress to 65 without a huge handicap.<br />
<br />
Pet buffs?  Maybe something that gives him a stun or DD proc.  I'd love to get a tougher pet at 65.<br />
<br />
That's all from me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That slow would cost 3000mana and had a build in metigation of 99.99%. There is no way I can see a balanced unresistable slow above 0.01% slow.<br />
<br />
<br />
-  Flesh out our Inner Fire line, or add stacking AC or ATK benefits to our later Focus spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
AFAIK the &quot;Inner Fire line&quot; consists of &lt;drum roll on&gt;1 spell (inner fire)&lt;drum roll off&gt;. Would be nice if SOE removed the AC OR the HP part of inner fire to put it either into our AC buff line or into our HP buff line. Adding some attack or melee type skill mod to any of our buffs would be welcome.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Beside avatar line, our self buffs and SLtW we have of any buff an equil group version. For what should I use this AA beside FA? Well, I forgot our HoTs / heals. Combined with HoT / heals it can be a damn powerfull AA. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
-  A lev 61 version of Torpor, so all shaman can progress to 65 without a huge handicap.<br />
<br />
<br />
Or just farm Kurnak dragons / GW / Sebilis more. On the other hand some kind of quest to get torpor / malos could solve the problem too and wouldn't break EQ.</div></div><hr />

My proposal:<br />
It would be neither unbalancing nor totally out of line if we got magikally put on some other fabulous dmg table when rabid bear is activated. It's all just dps really, where it comes from is pretty irrelevant, we could be nuking instead but with such a change it would be more fun... AND give the eleventeenth shaman on a raid the opportunity to do some good versus bossmobs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Well, I LOVE Henora's first post to this thread.  It explains all of my concerns.   You also have to keep in mind, EVERYONE plays differently and has a different style of approaching things.  The things I would really like to see changed are = <br />
<br />
healing - All I want is group quiescence.  It almost made it live from LDON beta.  Our direct heals are a bit low, but I seriously doubt it can be increased much without Druids complaining.<br />
<br />
Debuffing - Our effectiveness in a group has been dramatically reduced because of the other slowers being almost on par with us.  It would be nice to either see - a resist modifier, or a physical change in the spell without reducing down the slow rate.<br />
<br />
DAMAGE  - This is where I would actually like to see a big change.<br />
NUKES - I would actually like to see our nukes deal more damage then 2 or 3 ticks from a dot. (that doesn't mean reducing our dots)<br />
DOTS - Not really effective due to the agro vs damage dealt, and the time it takes for the dot to deal damage compared to time it takes to kill a mob (I can generally only get in about 3-4 ticks before a mob dies).  <br />
PET - Most shaman just think of it as an extra 35dps dot.  In all honesty, 35-40 dps is a bit low, even compared to dots.  And there is maintenance involved. Minimum, i would like to see - innate duel wield, innate SoW, and perhaps some type of pet enhancing item that shaman can actually use.<br />
MELEE - I get mad every time I melee against a cleric and loose with my sharkspine club.  Shaman were supposed to be the best priest melee class.  Our Rabid Bear AA is a joke.  Why don't we get something that is actually useful for more then 5 min every 1.5 hours.  - Perhaps critical hit AA,  or making Rabid Bear last as long as you stay in the zone (not that overpowering, due to the fact that most shaman have max haste with SLTW anyhow)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">these are just my thoughts<br />
<br />
firstly we a penilised 3 times, once in higher mana for spells, once with longer spell times and another because our regen mana is active it takes time to do, so another casting delay.<br />
i agree that possible our spells should have higher mana, but really our spells should cast quicker as we have to actively cast our mana regen spells, and at some point heal the damage  all that adds time to what a shaman can do. why they thought that making shaman spell long cast was balancing i dont know but it is definately unbalancing against shaman.<br />
<br />
healing .  i would like a new quick dd heal high mana but nice heal.<br />
and to be masters of HoT spells. removing krags mending is a great idea i glad sacrifice this for a 2k Hot and then a 5k Hot.<br />
<br />
buffs?  , just combine them more so 1 buff does hp,str,dex,stam,agil increase mana to compensate. last longer or not (happy if did but not to bothered)<br />
new line of buffs that add attack/skill focus sound good.<br />
<br />
debuffs , easiest way to u/g slow is a quicker cast or recast time and slightly lower resist. obviously cant make it higher than 75% but make it speedier, or as suggest  give us a slow that stacks with other slows by 5%, would mean 2 types slow classes wanted:)<br />
cant really have improve malos as it a level 65 spell, though maybe an aa to increase amount it decreases?<br />
<br />
dps/dots.pets,  new dd diffinately curse and or poison at 1200 which what cleric gets we alway (aprt from agiant undead) had similar or better nukes to cleric. checked abit more up to about this up till 49 we had better after this cleric start getting better who knows why.<br />
bane was a good step forward and way to go with dots.<br />
pet could use a slight u/g so it can help more in the higher planes but if this stoped any the other ideas i would rather have a weak pet.<br />
<br />
our own mellee? well againt mobs that riposte i wouldn`t want to mellee it ok againt normal lodn but not againt raid mobs really. would i like it improve ? hell yeah, but would i want it instead of other stuff? no. rabid bear is bad.. i hope they look at that and make it either more useful or remove and do a unique shaman skill? what that is? dont know but some sort of spirit interacton might be good.<br />
<br />
if we got this in spell or aa who can say it wouldnt make you happy?<br />
i know it would make me happy.</div></div><hr />
