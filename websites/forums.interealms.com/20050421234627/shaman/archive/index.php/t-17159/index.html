<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wickibet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi All - Thanks for the past information you have provided to me in previous posts.<br />
<br />
I was lucky to receive a Rune Etched Icewurm Fang(REIF) from a guildie who won it on a roll in Kael(for free). SOoo - I went in search of a new place to hunt. Just did a few /who all 43-49 searches, and sent a couple friendly tells, and this is what happened.<br />
<br />
A 44 paladin was in Katta, pulling from the graveyard and fear-undead'n the mob's.  Most times it was just myself and a paladin, sometimes there was a ranger there with us.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, I was 43 - halfway to 44 on saturday, and by monday at Midnight, i just dinged 45.  The exp was great, and with me hasted and my REIF, I was able to make GREAT exp at a wonderful pace.  <br />
<br />
I also was able to solo it without significant down time, as I had camped there and my friends from sat night weren't back on yet.<br />
<br />
I was told that there is one thing to beware - Coterie Assassin - he is invisible, and a baddie who wanders around.  He never caused any trouble, but I would keep see invis upu if you are alone.  <br />
<br />
Good Luck all - hopefully that helps someone else.<br />
