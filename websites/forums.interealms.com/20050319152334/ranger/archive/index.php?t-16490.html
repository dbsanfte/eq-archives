<br />
[COLOR=Green][SIZE=3]Trueshot Chainmail Quests[/SIZE] [/Color]<br />
<br />
Starting the quest: <br />
<br />
Samatansyn Flamecaller gives the quest for the Trueshot Mail quests.  Your opening dialogue should be similar to this.  <br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Samatansyn Flamecaller' <br />
<br />
Samatansyn Flamecaller says 'It is a pleasure to meet you Cyten, I am Samatansyn Flamecaller, Warder of Tunare and Guildmaster of Faydarks Champions. I have studied here for many of my years until recently when I took up teaching. I have many pupils that undergo my vigorous [training exercises].<br />
<br />
' You say, 'what training exercises?' <br />
<br />
Samatansyn Flamecaller says 'I have a series of tests that all new rangers of Kelethin are suggested to participate in. These tests will help you develop many of your skills including hunting and gathering and will also provide you with a chance to fashion your own Trueshot Chainmail. If you are a [ranger of Tunare] and are willing to begin your training I will be happy to explain to you how the tests work.<br />
<br />
' You say, 'I am a ranger of Tunare' <br />
<br />
Samatansyn Flamecaller says 'Excellent Cyten (name of my alt who was used to complete the quests), then lets get started! Here is your Trueshot Assembly Kit. You will collect various items from the Faydark and Clan Crushbone that will be necessary for creating your armor materials in your assembly kit. Once you have fashioned together a specific armor material you can then take it to a forge along with the applicable pattern to create your Trueshot Chainmail armor piece. Simply tell me what armor piece you [want] to craft and I can provide you with the material recipes and patterns for Trueshot Chainmail [Coifs], [Bracers], [Sleeves], [Boots], [Legplates], [Gauntlets] and [Tunics].'  <br />
<br />
Mr Flamecaller will give you a Trueshot Assembly Kit.  To begin your quests you will say “I want to craft (place name of armor piece here)”.  NOTE: you do not have to do the armor in order.  Depending on what piece of armor you have choosen you will receive a pattern for said piece.  When you have collected the pieces needed for teh quest combine them in your assembly kit and you will receive the mold for that piece of armor.  Go to the forge in Kelethin and combine the mold and the pattern to receive your Trueshot Chainmail armor.  You will not fail on the combine in the forge (atleast I never have).  However, you will raise your blacksmithing skill in creating the pieces.  <br />
<br />
The Sword quest is a little different than the armor quests.  When you ask about the Tunic Flamecaller will ask you for a favor and the reward for that favor is the Long Sword.  You do NOT have to combine the items in the assembly kit or forge the weapon yourself.  To ask about the sword say “what favor?”.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Armor:<br />
<br />
COIF<br />
'To create your coif material you will need to combine 2 Bricks of Crude Bronze, 1 Royal Jelly, 1 Spiderling Eye and 1 Ration in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material take it to a forge along with this mold to fashion your very own Trueshot Coif.'<br />
<br />
Bricks of Crude Bronze: These bricks can be found on any orc in Crushbone.  However, I suggest hunting centurions for the bricks as they are easier to kill.  The Bricks weigh 15wt. so you will need to make a few trips.<br />
<br />
Spiderling Eye: This can be found on Widow Hatchlings.  This MOB is only lvl 2 so finding this piece should be easy.<br />
<br />
Ration: The Ration can sometimes be found on orcs but to hunt them for the Ration would be a waste of your time.  This can be bought of the merchant at the top of the newbie lift.<br />
<br />
BRACER<br />
'To create your bracer material you will need to combine 1 Brick of Crude Bronze, 1 Skeleton Tibia, 1 Pixie Wing and 1 Gypsy Wine in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material take it to a forge along with this mold to fashion your very own Trueshot Chainmail Bracer.'<br />
<br />
Bricks of Crude Bronze: These bricks can be found on any orc in Crushbone.  However, I suggest hunting centurions for the bricks as they are easier to kill.  The Bricks weigh 15wt. so you will need to make a few trips.<br />
<br />
Skeleton Tibia: These can not (as far as I know) be found on decaying skeletons.  You will need to kill Elven Skeletons for this.  A good place to track them from is the newbie zone near Kelethin.<br />
<br />
Pixie Wing: Can be found on the Pixie Tricksters.  You should probably just keep one you get while exping in your lower lvls.<br />
<br />
Gypsy Wine: Can be bought at the various taverns around kelethin.<br />
<br />
NOTE: you will have to do this quest twice for two bracers.<br />
<br />
SLEEVES<br />
'To create your sleeves material you will need to combine 2 Bricks of Crude Bronze, 2 Giant Wasp Venom Sacs, 1 Large Widow Abdomen and 1 White Wine in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material take it to a forge along with this mold to fashion your very own Trueshot Chainmail Sleeves.'<br />
<br />
Bricks of Crude Bronze: These bricks can be found on any orc in Crushbone.  However, I suggest hunting centurions for the bricks as they are easier to kill.  The Bricks weigh 15wt. so you will need to make a few trips.<br />
<br />
Giant Wasp Venom Sacs: This venom sac can only be found on the Giant Wasp Drones.  (I have never seen it drop off any other wasp but then again it is sort of uncommon.  But why would you not kill the drones seeing as how they can be killed in 1 or 2 hits)<br />
<br />
Large Widow Abdomen: This can be found on the Large Widows or form the Widow Matriarchs.<br />
<br />
White Wine: Can be bought form the various taverns around Kelethin.<br />
<br />
BOOTS <br />
'To create your boots material you will need to combine 3 Bricks of Crude Bronze, 1 Severed Orc Foot, 2 Spider Legs in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material take it to a forge along with this mold to fashion your very own Trueshot Chainmail Boots.'<br />
<br />
Bricks of Crude Bronze: These bricks can be found on any orc in Crushbone.  However, I suggest hunting centurions for the bricks as they are easier to kill.  The Bricks weigh 15wt. so you will need to make a few trips.<br />
<br />
Severed Orc Foot: I have never seen one of these drop in Crushbone so it’s my impression that these will only drop for you from the orcs at Orc Hill outside of Crushbone.<br />
<br />
Spider Legs: These legs drop from either a Large Widow or the Widow Matriarch.<br />
<br />
LEGPLATES <br />
'To create your legplates material you will need to combine 4 Bricks of Crude Bronze, 1 Orc Fibula, 1 Orc Clavicle , and 1 Lightstone in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material take it to a forge along with this mold to fashion your very own Trueshot Chainmail Legplates'<br />
<br />
Bricks of Crude Bronze: These bricks can be found on any orc in Crushbone.  However, I suggest hunting centurions for the bricks as they are easier to kill.  The Bricks weigh 15wt. so you will need to make a few trips.<br />
<br />
Orc Fibula: This is a NO DROP item that can only be found on Orc Slavers.  The easiest way to get this is to dodge the orcs as best you can and get into the slaver cabin with the dwarves and priest for the Screaming Mace quest.  A slaver pops in this cabin and he is the lowest lvl slaver you will probably find.  Best to kill him at lvl 9 when you get snare so he wont run.  Also, make sure he’s near the door way so that the elven priest wont heal him.<br />
<br />
Orc Clavicle: Can be found on Centurions.  Just stick around the ent of the zone or a little farther out and you’ll get this piece.<br />
<br />
Lightstone: This is probably the hardest part of the quest.  This drops off a Wilowisp.  These creatures are magical and can only be hit by MAGIC weapons.  ShortSword* is not a magic weapon so I had to bring a wizard friend along.  The best place to track ofr them is around Orc Hill.  If all else fails try to buy one of a merchant.  They sell them for 1.1pp.  If you look at a few of the merchants near the Orc Lift you will find one.<br />
<br />
GAUNTLETS <br />
'To create your gauntlets material you will need to combine 3 Bricks of Crude Bronze, 1 Orc Ulna, 1 Orc Tibia, and 2 Orc Finger Bones in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material take it to a forge along with this mold to fashion your very own Trueshot Chainmail Gauntlets.'<br />
<br />
Bricks of Crude Bronze: These bricks can be found on any orc in Crushbone.  However, I suggest hunting centurions for the bricks as they are easier to kill.  The Bricks weigh 15wt. so you will need to make a few trips.<br />
<br />
Orc Ulna: This usually only drops off the higher lvl Orcs (Legionnaire and Emissary).  You can try to find a group hunting at the Courtyard outside the caste or a group inside the Throne Room itself.  If you’re not high enough lvl or there are no openings just wait around and loot their kills and you’ll find it soon enough.<br />
<br />
Orc Tibia:  I have seen this drop from slavers as well as from Scouts.  It will drop from any of the Orcs if you try long enough (except for pawns and maybe a rare form cents).<br />
<br />
Orc Finger Bones: Can drop form any Orc in Crushbone.<br />
<br />
TUNIC  <br />
'To create your tunic material you will need to combine 5 Bricks of Crude Bronze, 1 Orc Fibula, 1 Golden Bandit Tooth, 1 Pristine Forest Drakeling Scale, 1 Orc Ribcage and 1 Orc Eye in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material take it to a forge along with this mold to fashion your very own Trueshot Chainmail Tunic. Please return to me after you have completed your tunic, for I have one final [favor] to ask of you.'<br />
<br />
Bricks of Crude Bronze: These bricks can be found on any orc in Crushbone.  However, I suggest hunting centurions for the bricks as they are easier to kill.  The Bricks weigh 15wt. so you will need to make a few trips.<br />
<br />
Orc Fibula: This is a NO DROP item that can only be found on Orc Slavers.  The easiest way to get this is to dodge the orcs as best you can and get into the slaver cabin with the dwarves and priest for the Screaming Mace quest.  A slaver pops in this cabin and he is the lowest lvl slaver you will probably find.  Best to kill him at lvl 9 when you get snare so he wont run.  Also, make sure he’s near the door way so that the elven priest wont heal him.<br />
<br />
Golden Bandit Tooth: This can be found off the bandits in Gfay.  Take the path form Kelethin towards Felewithe and keep tracking.  Eventually you will see bandits on track and you will get to their camp which is close to the spires.  This drop is pretty common.<br />
<br />
Pristine Forest Drakeling Scale:  This is the bottleneck/timeskin of all the kelethin/felewithe newbie quests.  This can be found off the Forest Drakelings.  I was lucky enough to find one on a corpse once but if you aren’t that lucky you will have to kill them.  Helping a friend do his pally quests I had to kill about 10-15 of these guys.  Just keep tracking for them around the Kelethin newbie area and you will eventually get it.<br />
<br />
Orc Ribcage:  Usually drops off the higher lvl orcs in the Throne Room.  However, lately I have seen it drop off centurions twice.<br />
<br />
Orc Eye: Drops off all orcs except for pawns.<br />
<br />
LONG SWORD <br />
'I have received word that there are numerous elves being held hostage in the confines of Clan Crushbone, beaten and forced to perform slave work under horrible conditions. There is believed to be a specific Orc that patrols the jail cells that has a master key in his possession for all of the elven hostages. If you were to retrieve this master key for me I would possibly be able to make copies of it and distribute them to my task force so that we may attempt to rescue our helpless bretheren. Will you [retrieve the master key]?'<br />
<br />
Master Crushbone Cell Key: This drops off the Orc Warden.  He is around lvl 14 and can be found in the slaver caves near the slaver cabin.  2 or 3 slavers spawn with him so you will need a group or a higher lvl friend to do this.  I believe he drops it every time.<br />
<br />
Orc Eye: Drops off all orcs except for pawns<br />
<br />

<br />
Hint: It's very green.  I stopped doing these after making two Bracers, Sleeves, a Coif, and Boots.  The rest seemed to be very difficult items to get by an appropriate level - not that the mobs were here, but it takes forever to find a Pristine Drakeling Scale.  Eventually, I just started killing an occasional Forest Drakeling whenever I passed through Kelethin, and finally got one in my late 20s.<br />
<br />
p.s. That's the Coif and Sleeves in the pic below.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taldaas</div><div class="date">01-06-2003, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well the armor is not difficult at all.  It seems there is anywhere form 10-25 people in teh zone at once and usually someone 25+ who will help you out if needed.  Most of these items can be picked up off corpses that have already been killed by another person.<br />
<br />
ill try to upload a pic...  EDIT here we go.  I do have limited bandwith but oh well.  LOoks like Ivy in this pic but if you take it out in the light it's a really bright green.  <br />
<br />
P.S.  I do not have Luclin so these are using old models.<br />

That's the coif and sleeves in my sig.  I just picked up a Pristine Scale, so if I can ge the last piece I need, I'll post a screenshot for you.  No legs, but you'll get the idea.  The boots are nice, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aethien</div><div class="date">01-31-2003, 12:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, finally.  Twenty days later, after coming across the Pristine Forest Drakeling Scale, I finally got around to completing the Trueshot Tunic.   Now I have something to wear for weddings....<br />

<br />
Sorry, I took off my coif, and I haven't gotten around to the legs yet.  They're green.  But those are the boots, sleeves, and bracers.  They're also very green.  I don't know that I could bring myself to wear the whole set at once.</div></div><hr />
