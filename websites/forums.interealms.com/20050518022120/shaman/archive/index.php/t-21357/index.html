<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Now I know most of you have retired, in the process of retiring, or are busy doing other things.  I haven't seen too many posts dealing with thoughts of the new expansion, so I figured I would post some thoughts.<br />
<br />
-Increasing the level cap to 70<br />
<br />
     This might actually be a good thing because it breaks down the raid requirement for a lot of old content.  Yes, it trivializes old content which may annoy some of the casual player wanting uber items.  Bottom line, if items dropping from trivial content is better than what you are wearing- its a good thing.<br />
<br />
     SOE will take care of viable zones to level to 70 because everyone has a right to level to 70, so we have nothing to worry about with viable xp.  If its too hard, SOE will nerf it.  <br />
<br />
-Spells<br />
<br />
     Unlike GoD, we should see a significant amount of spells for the new expansion for all classes.  I expect we will see a system similar to the PoP style of parchments.  They will probably be tradeable in some form because there will be entirely too many spells to get out to the populous if they are no-drop.<br />
<br />
-Spells (shaman specific)<br />
<br />
     Spells we will probably see will probably be: <br />
     -new Focus/Stat buffs (you know they are going to raise the stat<br />
       cap)<br />
     -new dog-dog (they haven't stopped that spell line, so expect a<br />
      new one [FYI: check your spirit call aa's after patch- make sure<br />
      they raise the pet level]<br />
     -new dots/nukes<br />
     -new haste (they gave us a group haste before- expect them to try<br />
      to sneak a &quot;group SLTW&quot; as the &quot;new&quot; upgrade)<br />
     -new utility spells (imbue x, regen, etc.)<br />
<br />
      I am curious how they will handle our GoD spells with the new<br />
      expansion.  It is a little early to trivialize GoD spells, so I am<br />
      wondering if we will see a new heal/canni/torpor clone/slow.<br />
<br />
      To be honest, I doubt we will see anything revolutionary in <br />
      terms of spells right away.   Reasons are:<br />
      <br />
      -E3, not sure on the date of this and how much resources will be<br />
       pulled for it.<br />
      -Developers dealing with making GoD something other than &quot;Faces<br />
       of Death XVIII&quot;<br />
      -releasing of the new expansion and fixing it after it comes out.<br />
       (Releases are never perfect for any game- let alone EQ, so expect<br />
       resources focusing on fixing DTing Quest NPC's that only respond<br />
       to gnome rogues on every fifth Sunday when the moon is full.)<br />
<br />
       So, I wouldn't expect too many changes until after OoW release, it<br />
       looks like SOE is juggling too many balls right now.  Don't blame<br />
       Brenlo for it- he is the PR guy.  Blame SOE for trying to do too<br />
       much in a small amount of time.<br />
<br />
-Casual Content<br />
<br />
       - Expect a line of semi-easy to complete (read: Ornate 2.0) line of<br />
         gear.  Gear will probably be on level with the current Elemental.<br />
         :Note: semi-easy means some sort of flag/checkpoint list to<br />
          complete.  <br />
<br />
-Raid Content<br />
<br />
      -This should be interesting because they have already specified<br />
        new high-end raiding content.  The question is how they will treat<br />
        GoD in this regard- will it be reworked and required as a form of<br />
        progression or will it be thrown to the wayside like LoY, LDoN raid<br />
        content?  My guess is that GoD will become the new Vex Thal-<br />
        nice place to upgrade, but not necessarily required for OoW<br />
        progression.<br />
<br />
-Difficulty<br />
<br />
     -This should be interesting to see how the Devs work this.  Many<br />
       players today signed on to EQ after PoP, so they didn't see how<br />
       difficult Tier 1 planes were for the Thurg geared tanks.  Casters<br />
       should have an easier time due to hitpoints not being as important<br />
       as your tank classes.  Casual players may just shrug off the<br />
       content in lue of PoP being a more accessible form of xp.  (Anyone<br />
       remember people leveling past 60 in Velks?)<br />
<br />
-AA's<br />
<br />
     -I expect we will received at least 2 &quot;pages&quot; of aa's similar to what<br />
      we recieved in PoP.  The first page will be stat enhancements to<br />
      combat the new stat increases, while the scond one will tailor to<br />
      abilities.  AA's I think we will see:<br />
<br />
      -Lightning Reflexes/Innate Defense Mastery (tanks are going to<br />
        need it.)<br />
      -Healing Adept/Healing Gift Mastery<br />
      -Burning Affliction Mastery (devs will probably rework the aggro<br />
       issues of dots or there will be a lot of necros/shamans main-  <br />
       tanking mobs over 1k dot crits.)<br />
      -Natural Durabilty Mastery <br />
      <br />
       After this I dunno, we will probably get 2-3 toy/pointless aa lines<br />
       because the devs ran out of ideas, but expect a few new tricks <br />
       as well.<br />
<br />
-Itemization<br />
<br />
      -Hopefully the devs will go back to raid named having 8-12 items on<br />
       their loot table. There is a lot of hybrid gear/one class usuable gear<br />
       rotting in GoD, and calling the current loot tables &quot;tiny&quot; is an<br />
       understatement.<br />
<br />
     Overall, this was a long post and I tried to come off as objective as possible.  OoW looks to be an expansion for everyone, not just a second attempt at getting the &quot;Time guilds&quot; out of Time.  I will be buying the expansion because it looks to have enough toys to keep me occupied at least a little longer, and I think I will get more enjoyment out of it than I have with GoD.<br />
<br />
P.S.  For those farmers/alt-twinkers, (I only say this because there are quite a few of you) get it before it gets cold.  Trivialized content will be seen by SOE as trivial, so that nerf bat will start swinging about a month or two after OoW comes out.  The nerf bat is usually a stealth one, and they tend to target drop rates as opposed to difficulty.  Examples of this are/were PoHate,PoGrowth gem drop rate; Kael Arena armor drop rate; LDoN xp/cash drop rate....you get the point.  <br />
<br />
P.S.S. Looking for other thoughts on the new expansion and possible a few answers as well.  Does anyone know if there is going to be much beta testing for OoW?  How much time on the test server are players going to have before OoW will go live?  Class issues (all classes) that we might see with the increased level cap, etc.  Feel free to post your thoughts and correct anything I said if you see an error in my judgement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thats a whole lot of probablies, im sure they will's and most likely's.<br />
<br />
I think ill chose to wait on the fence, unexcited, till they release some real facts. Pressure is starting to come on to SoE's shoulders and if they dont start responding to it, they will be finished. Say all you want about how DAoC and AC and everything else said it was the EQ killer and it wasnt, but right now EQ is facing its strongest oponent ever in this field of online RPG's.<br />
<br />
Itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Why make spells tradeable if you want someone to buy your expansion?? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah EQ has basically eaten itself.<br />
<br />
I am sure that it would happen eventually but I think they have hastened self destruction.<br />
<br />
I am not playing CoH right now (thinking about getting it) and I will NOT play WoW, but I definately started to play less once Gates came out.  EQ has screwed itself.  The developers could have created content that satisfied all types and levels of gamers but it with went the easiest path.<br />
<br />
I don't care if Gates had never been released, the issue of Shaman stacking in raids has been a problem for a long time.  I think that it was just tolerated by Shaman since we had other outlets like exp groups and soloing.<br />
<br />
Luclin raid content sucked with the difficulty of getting keys.  I know many guilds got hung up at that point.  The flag system of PoP is less demanding than the keys of Luclin.<br />
<br />
I like LDoN, but I resent that it with BoT has become my only non-solo option in the the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Can't see anything good in OoW for now as our actual situation is pretty lame and I don't believe in miracles with SoE ;).<br />
<br />
Our spells will still cost way too much cuz we have a damn outdated Cani line.<br />
Our dots will still build insane aggro for barely no results.<br />
Clerics will still outnuke us, outheal us (ok, this one is normal), outmelee us.<br />
Druids will still outnuke us, outheal us, buff better (sorry, Nine &gt; Fo7 and statts buffs mean nothing, cap raised or not) and dot as good as we can.<br />
<br />
We will still be the king of slow by the so famous and huge 10% difference who will be mitigated anyway.<br />
<br />
Our pet still sucks and won't have innate DW (if we get any pet of course).<br />
<br />
Our DD still sucks because the casting time is way too long, cost too much for the damage it does.<br />
<br />
And I don't talk about the AA. GoD bring no good AA and I don't think OoW will.<br />
<br />
Pessimist ? No, I just don't have any faith in SoE ;).<br />
<br />
And you know what ? I preordered it. Even with all of the crap we suffer, I'm still enjoying the game when I log only because I have some good friends :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Toppo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Fenril , I have faith! I also agree with everything you said :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to nit-pick but it's PPS as in 'post post script.'<br />
<br />
And to answer your question, yes SoE has a stable of Beta-Testers. They're called the live servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Why make spells tradeable if you want someone to buy your expansion?? :p<br />
<br />
I think the title quests and the level 70 are enough that most people will find it necessary to buy the new expansion.  PoP spells were droppable in some form, and I have not met too many people that refused to buy PoP.<br />
<br />
Other than that, what really makes me wonder is the purpose of the new expansion.  The expansion release notice caught everyone offguard.  Did SOE lose more people to GoD that I (We) thought?  Is it just a strong knee-jerk reaction to new competition on the horizon?  Is it another try at clearing out the bottleneck that PoTime has become to the uber guilds?  Are we just seeing the other half of what GoD was supposed to offer upon release?  Or, is it just the usual 6 month expansion release that SOE seems to be sticking to now.  SOE has never released two high end expansions so close to each other, and by the looks of it OoW offers extensive high end content.  At the very least, it seems to offer me enough content to mess with as we await any changes that come to the shaman class.  We seem to be getting some agreement with SOE that &quot;shamans may be having some problems,&quot;<br />
so heres hoping.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I like LDoN, but I resent that it with BoT has become my only non-solo option in the the game.<br />
<br />
     This reminds me of a post a while back on whether Sol Ro should be opened up to the masses, and it also reminds me of when they opened up PoV, PoS, BoT, HoH, CoD, and Torment.  Before those zones were opened up, everyone was hanging out in PoN,PoI,PoD, and PoJ.  Zoning into anyone of those zones and your were slammed with the lag of 80-100 groupers/ks-ers/trainers/ooc'ers/and whiners.  When they opened up BoT, etc. it didn't solve anything- the crew of 80-100 &quot;moved on up&quot;  to inhabit BoT.  LDoN helped out because it scattered that number across 4 camps, thereby reducing the lag and giving the illusion that there wasn't a bottleneck on casual content.  In order to give the casual player zone options they will have to create multiple zones with roughly the same ZEM and loot rewards.  It sounds repetitive, but in all honesty if you had to choose between 4 zones with one having the highest ZEM and best drops- where are you and everyone else going to go?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I guess my post did make it sound like I was talking about individual (group) experience and advancement, but what I really meant was how content for casual guilds has been really lacking.<br />
<br />
LDoN Raids are a good example.  Instead of these raids being geared for your typical casual guild that has taken out AD, but still has not been able to get all their members Keyed for Ssra or VT, LDoN is geared toward Time ready guilds.  If any group of folks need LDoN raids it was casual guilds.  Powerguilds will always be able to make use of the difficult new content.<br />
<br />
I don't want the new expansion to just be an extension of Gates.  Predicus' point is well taken though.  I absolutely loved LoY to solo in and would have liked to get folks to to Nadox, Torg Mines and Hate's but no one wanted to go.  But honestly, I ZEM is not the great motivator for me, but I have to admit I am not normal.  I like adventuring places just for the heck of it, problem is I can't get others to go along.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Why make spells tradeable if you want someone to buy your expansion?? :p<br />
<br />
Easy .. they still have to buy the expansion to use/mem/scribe lvl 66+ spells.<br />
<br />
So long<br />

<br />
     Because slowing ability is flawed with the evolving world of EQ.  Basically EQ revolves around a few constants; one being that your dps/cc/healing ability has to out-weigh the dps of a mob.  You also have to set a mobs dps in increments, so that 1. the main tank has be able to survive the initial dps of a mob, and 2.  A mob has to still be challenging after it is slowed.  Here is where the developers hit a problem- a full slow on a mob drastically changes the output of dps.  They choose to add mitigation to allow them to further a mob's dps, without hitting the point where a mob could 1-round a tank.  This worked for a while- we see a lot of mobs in PoP, GoD, and LDoN hard with mitigated slow.  Unfortunately, it is only a matter of time before they will just have to make mobs immune to slow, so they can continue to up the difficulty.  Percents in an evolving game are bad, that's why we are having trouble healing- because it's based off a percent of the cleric's ability to heal-  the same applies to our slow.<br />
     There are a few abilities in the game currently that are &quot;over-powering&quot; as far as the devs are concerned, and I think they are slowly trying to phase them out.  The three abilities that come to mind are: slow, snare, and charm.  Slow and Charm have already been discussed, but many people overlook snare.  Snare changes a caster's ability from only having time to cast a really fast nuke to being able to cast: long cast time dots, long cast time aoe's, long cast time charm spells.  Druids/Wizards would have never been able to quad-kite without snare- there just isn't enough time to land anything.  Verant/SOE tried to nerf this by adding the &quot;you have been summoned&quot; to mobs, but that wasn't enough.  That is why we are seeing more and more mobs &quot;uneffected by run-speeds.&quot;  SOE should be running into a problem soon as more and more &quot;utilities&quot; become over-powered.  Adding more classes defeats the purpose if in the end are classes are nerfed to the points to where we become clones of one another.</div></div><hr />
