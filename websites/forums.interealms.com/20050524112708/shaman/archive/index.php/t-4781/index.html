<br />
Dispells and the inconsistancy's I see :<br />
<br />
Random dispells - not taking first buff. Sometimes this happens, sometimes it doesn't. Is this supposed to be this way? It seems to work both ways. I have dispelled myself before and had it take the second buff instread of the first. eh?<br />
<br />
Dispell not working at all - ever fought a caster and had it try and dispell you, you get the message that you were dispelled, but no buffs were taken off? I wonder if this works in reverse - ever try like mad to get a DS off a mob and not have it work? I have.<br />
<br />
And just to clarify - cancel magic: 1 buff, nullify magic: 2 buffs, annul magic: 3 buffs.<br />
<br />
Also noticed annul magic  doesnt always take 3 buffs, and nullify doesnt always take 2. Wth is goin on here?<br />
<br />
*also* Can someone check lucy and see if there is a resist check for these spells? Blocked cookies from lucy and she wont let me see spells anymore :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's screwy as hell.  Some mobs with AE will dispell you all over the place.  Best way I know to make them dispell a certain buff is to spam it on yourself right before the fight.  Or better yet, have a bard in the group and have his song slot be in the top buff slot.  The song will get dispelled every time instead of your buffs.  Well . . mostly.  Some dragons in WW seem to dispell almost at random.  <br />
As far as player cast dispells, those can be pretty predictable in PvP, but unpredictable if a groupie is casting on you.  <br />
Last in, first out for the most part tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dispells, like cures, work with counters. Cast a 6-counter dispell against a mob's 9-counter buff, and you'll need 2 casts to get rid of the mob's buff. Same when mobs cast on you. That is why a single dispell may not remove any buffs. Higher dispells have more sets of counters, giving them not only a chance to rid a buff on the first cast, but rid 2 or 3 buffs.<br />
<br />
I do not know why oftentimes a middle buff gets dispelled instead of the first -- I hate that.<br />
<br />
Dispell does not remove slow! You can cast slow on a mob, then do dispelling afterwards, and slow will remain in effect. Dispell does remove debuffs like Malosi and Root though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I remember reading somewhere that dispells are random now.  You never know whiich ones will be taken off I think.  <br />
<br />
I hate fighting casters now with all the dispells its so annoying and tedious, especially being a shaman.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I believe that dispels will &lt;b&gt;usually&lt;/b&gt; remove the most recently cast buff on you. This isn't guaranteed, but seems to work pretty well for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Why even bother buffing when doing EXP anywhere other than CT or Ssra? They WILL get dispelled... and when was the last time having ~500-600 hps saved someone in your group? If your answer is often, then perhaps you should consider taking steps to prevent that. When melees bitch, pull another mob, or 2, or 3. Keep them busy with mobs so they don't have time to complain. In the end, they will thank you.<br />
<br />
As for dispells, it's fairly random.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">After spending a bit of time chasing Myga I get the impression that certain mobs have a set random dispell while others will eat buffs down the line.  Some dragons are consistent with nailing your first buff everytime unless you are using a clicky and refresh it too close to the next dispell cycle.  Von is a bastard for dispells!<br />
<br />
I just assume that I will loose KEI and eggo before most everything else regardless of placement :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Groggog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I do not know if this is fact, but it is kinda what I have always believed about dispelling.<br />
<br />
There is a chance that you can resist the dispelling.  Sometimes a mob casts dispell on you, it says you feel dispelled, but you lose no buffs.  It could be because each buff slot has a chance to resist the dispell (based on your MR, level difference, or what not).  So lets say you have 8 buffs on, and none leave, all resisted.  Or your 3rd buff gets dispelled, the first 2 resisted the dispell, and the third one ate it.  <br />
<br />
While some AEing mobs have auto dispell, so it eats your first buffs, since they cannot resist it (hence the use of insta click in first slot or 2).<br />
<br />
I have no idea if this is true or not, but it's something I thought about while cursing out casting mobs from dispelling my aego in buff spot 5 instead of some lesser buff ahead of it.<br />
<br />
Of course this explaination faulters on things like WW dragons whom have am unresistable AE dispell, but do not always eat the first buff... maybe it checks each buff to see if it resists, and keeps going through the buffs until it does get one.  But that seems unlikely.  Oh well who really knows.<br />
<br />
Either way, it works for me for en explaination ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Whenever I get dispelled, it almost always takes something from the first 5 buffs.  My first 5 buffs are usually acumen (cheap), ultravision (click), bramblecoat (click), primal essence (cheap), voice of the berserker (cheap).  If any of it gets dispelled, I just put it back up with little mana loss.  When you are buffing tanks, always give them the worthless placebo buffs (agi) first, so you can take your time refreshing them.  This is the absolute only use that talisman of the snake has.</div></div><hr />
