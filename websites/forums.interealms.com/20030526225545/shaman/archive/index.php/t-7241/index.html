<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Bah, I'm getting sick of trying to slow dragons.<br />
<br />
Our guild has recently had the force to start doing Gore and Wuoshi (if they are ever up). I've now been on 6 dragon fights (4 Gore, 1 Talendor 1 Wuoshi) and NEVER landed a slow yet.<br />
<br />
I've been sat under their noses every time, most of the time we've had tash, malosini in and occasionally OOS if one of our two bards are on-line. Blown mana bar every time until I gave up or had to help heal. Still nada, nothing, zip.<br />
<br />
On Wuoshi I blew an entire mana bar on turgurs, ended up tanking it half of the fight. Luckily the dumb dragon spent too much time trying to cast root, it still got me just before it went into flee mode :(.<br />
<br />
So what do I have to do, I'm now level 60 - we have tash and malosini in, often OOS and I still can't slow them. I've got that desperate I even tried buffing charisma to have the same zero effect :(.<br />
<br />
But in HoT I have almost no problems slowing all of the regular mobs.<br />
<br />
Anyone got any suggestions, will even consider turning around 3 times and casting True North before slow if someone tells me that will help before a slow :p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zugzub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think i've ever killed woushi,talendor sev or whoever with slow. Actually, im not too sure if you can even slow them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Gore and Talendor are both listed as unslowable in the slowing guide. Woushi is listed as being slowable but I have never seen her slowed or tried myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/assist them and heal, or find start nuking.. might be able to land ice strike on talendor, no point in trying to slow them really, if's a VERY VERY small chance, if it's even possible</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Uh... I give Gore a hug whenever I see her up.  Never fought her.<br />
<br />
Same for Wuoshi.<br />
<br />
Never seen Talendor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Erm, did you maloSINI or malo Gorenaire?<br />
I guess you mean maloed as it's unresistable. If you landed malosini that'd mean you could as well have slowed it cos malosini and turgur have the exact same resist check.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've landed malosini and not slow before, it was on Tunare (post resist patch).  Just because you can sini something doesnt mean you'll beat the random number generator a second time.<br />
<br />
And whilst there have been scattered reports of people slowing Gore, Vox, Sev etc - I will only accept screenshots of these dragons yawning as proof for the Cruicible slowing guide and nobody has provided them thus far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hiho,<br />
<br />
I am pretty sure that Gore, Sev and Trak are unslowable. If they were it has been in the time they changed resist rates and messed them up.<br />
<br />
On the other side I have slowed Wuoshi numerous times. Malo, Tash, OOS, Slow. And he is such a wuss :-)<br />
<br />
So long<br />
Nirtox</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Aye you can have a happy Malosini land, but it means that you also have the chance to land Turgur.<br />
Another mob I've tried to Malosini for a full mana bar without luck, then Cannibalized and tried Turgur and it stuck. The random number generator is just too wacky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have seen Gore slowed once, both 60 shamans trying for the full fight. Slow landed when she was about 10% - not by me :). Thats why i thought she was slowable so kept trying.<br />
<br />
But I have seen malosini landed a couple of times, especially after malo.<br />
<br />
Guess in future we'll concentrate on heals/nuking :)<br />

Glad its just not me LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Never slowed Tal or Gore with either Turgur's or PoI, all the usual MR/PR debuffs.  Sev is on a long rotation on my server, so I've never fought him.  My guild doesn't kill Wuoshi cuz we &lt;3 her (and all other CoV dragons). :p  I still try on Talendor and Gore, even though I know it's basically an exercise in futility. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">A 25 percent slow is better than none.....<br />
<br />
So maybe hit him with Insidious Decay then Plague of Insects. No idea on what his DR is like though.<br />
<br />
Once that's in (or not) then try Turgurs.<br />
<br />
Can't wait to get my hands on the level 61 40 percent DR based slow /drool.<br />
<br />
Was doing NToV last week with no Bard to Occulude and had a hell of a time slowing some mobs... DR slow landed quite happily though, even on Glimmer Drakes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">They can be slowed and my guild does so on most fights.  I have slowed most dragons, up to Sontalak.  Greatest success comes for us from getting malo on straight away then tash, sini and occlusioning (get your mages doing sini to free up more shaman to slow).  After that spread shaman duties on turgirs and tigirs (seems tigirs has a greater chance of landing for some reason).  We normally get about 3 shaman alternating these and one doing insidious decay and POI.  Getting the slow on is not guaranteed on any fight.  But with a good debuff team it can be done on most fights.<br />
<br />
Unless u get the immune to slow client message u have a chance, no matter how small, of landing a slow.  Least thats the way i understand it :).<br />
<br />
Rest is luck.  This is just my experience, so try it and see if it works for u.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sometimes, the fight is just fast enough, and well covered on healers, that you don't really need to bother slowing.  These times are when clearing yard trash and fights are less than 1 minute long, and when fighting AE dragons where too many people show up for DKP or chances at loot.   I say on Gore/tal/Trak just heal and realize that while you COULD, POSSIBLY slow, you WILL land heals and nukes.</div></div><hr />
