<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zoggmak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, it has been a year since my last interesting stat post so I figured I would parse my log again and post the results.<br />
<br />
Useful info:<br />
<br />
- the start date on the log file is May 16th 2002<br />

***Disclaimer****<br />
These stats are a total of everything I have done in EQ in the past 2 years. That includes soloing, raiding, grouping, power leveling, farming tradeskill stuff, etc.... so keep that in mind when you look at the stats.<br />

<br />
<br />
Hmm, though keep in mind per cast you get 3 waves max. Is it it taking that into account? If it doesn't and considering sometimes only one or two if the mobs moves of course it'd be closer to around 5000 or so hitting the mob with 1312 hits resisting.<br />
<br />
If that's the case, a 25% chance of a resist per wave or so then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would have to agree. I suggest dividing the resists by 3 to get like 450 or so then you'd have like 1/4-1/5 chance of a resist per wave, so it is not as bad as it looks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Quiinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I want to say it was on either the druid or mages forums, but they parsed the rain spell line to almost a flat 22% resist rate, regardless of spell or mob resists.  The numbers above would be right in line with that.<br />

<br />
That probably has something to do with him gaining a TA. No mana burned while casting Turgur's = no need to canni.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Cloud of Grummus: 210 casts...107 resists<br />
<br />
Didnt we get Grummus to have a different, harder to resist slow?  <br />
<br />
The cumilative CoGrum resist rate is 49.1% according to these logs.  I dont see Insidious Decay anywhere in your cast lists; Apparenlty thats not in any common spell line up for you.  But still...50% resist rate is still a little silly.  <br />
<br />
By comparison, Turgurs resist rate was 23.52%, or just less than one in four.<br />
<br />
Another interesting tid bit was that when you melee, you never miss, and apparently, never get hit.  Odd...  Im assuming that you have those filters turned off server side and the results never make it to your sniffer.  Funny though, as my parses show a 68% cumulative miss rate for me, even on greens.  (maxed offense and melee skills except h2h)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Didnt we get Grummus to have a different, harder to resist slow? <br />
<br />
The cumilative CoGrum resist rate is 49.1% according to these logs<br />
<br />
I'd imagine that a good bit of that is due to trying to slow hard-to-slow mobs with it (he mentioned he's been in end game raiding situations for this period).  That's really the only time grummus is useful.  Turgurs casts would also be on similar mobs, but for soloing and exping your resist rate is generally a lot lower, which will bring down the overall number.  I'd imagine if you looked at turgurs casts in similar situations the ratio might be a lot closer (or even favor grummus).<br />
<br />
Imagine how much pain he'd saved his wrists if he got ancient: chaotic pain 2 years ago =)  Probably drop under 35k casts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I noticed that immediately too about the resists.<br />
<br />
When you consider that many of us malos things before we cast spells, just imagine what many of those resists might look like.  If Zogg slowed every mob in his group, his numbers indicate that he malo/malos'd roughly a third of them.<br />
<br />
But on things like cripple, tigirs, and grummus, high resist rates on those are more likely attributable to the type of mob they were casted on, rather than any innate resist checks in the spell itself.  Afterall, when do we cast cripple or grummus?<br />
<br />
The thing that irks me the most, apart from the crazy amount of canni IV casts, are the resist rates on our dots.  ~16% on Bane, ~13% on BoS.  And that with a 1/3 of the mobs being malos'd, and apart from any times mobs might have been debuffed in other ways!  That seems very high when you compare to the ~6% on Velium Strike.  Neither spell has a resist check, and while they're different resist checks, it still makes me wonder.<br />
<br />
Guess the only other thing I would note would be how many times he cast a disease dot.  We all know that we never use them, this just kind of solidifies just how rarely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Where can I find a parser like that to keep track of my stats?<br />
<br />
Edit.  The link in your old post to that parser no longer works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zoggmak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hey, <br />
<br />
Again, please remember that the stats above are a collection of all the spells cast no mater what mob/mobs i was fighting. That would include everything from farming lower guk for faction to raiding Time and GoD. <br />
<br />
Jentriken, like Jormal said, the reason i do not cani as much any more has alot to due with the fact that i now have a TA. Another would be that fact that i now have my FT maxed (been maxed since around the 4th month of PoP) You are right though, if i never had those things there would easily be a 2:1 ratio to cani and Turg's (that can be seen in the first stat posting)<br />
<br />
Thorzion, you are right about the misses for the melee stats, i have misses filtered out.<br />
<br />
As for everyones comments on slowing, the best i can do is explain my slowing style. Before i got a TA I would begin to cast Malos when the mob was inc and then wait maybe 1 or 2 seconds while the tank gained aggro and then cast slow. My style now with the TA is to cast slow while the mob is inc. Another major factor that has increased my slowing stats would be the fact that I now have enough HP to tank most trash mobs. This factors in a lot when clearing to raid mobs since 9 times out of 10 I will not cast Malos on a trash mob until slow has bounced 3 or 4 times. :) Does this pull the mob off the tank....sometimes, but remember if I have enough time to cast 4 slows on a mob it means that said mob is mezed and i always try to be beside the mob when mez is broken so the war does not have to chase it. I would be kinda shocked if most end game shaman did not use this style of slowing when it comes to trash mobs.<br />
<br />
Again, remember that these stats are a mix of everything I did while playing therefore of course some stats are going to be out of whack because of this. <br />

Mangler, the new link for the program is below:<br />
http://eqtools.seriouscybernetics.net/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yeah what Zogg said, when you get a TA it's like getting FT50 or something, it's an amazing difference. You can't easily use your mana any more unless you are main healing, if you try and increase DPS you will just pull aggro and start tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Thank you for the link.  Also I am not in a raiding guild and will probably never see the plane of time or maybe even the elemental planes.  I am also dumb when it comes to terms so tell me what in the heck a TA item is????<br />
<br />
Edit...Is it that Time Antithesis thingy or whatever in your main slot?  If so I am sure I will never, EVER, see that.  Hell I just got my first PoP flag every last week.  Carp is next and don't know when or if that will ever go down.</div></div><hr />
