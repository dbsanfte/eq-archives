You hear a voice from the woods asking about bows.<br />
<br />
I am slowly working my way to Endless Quiver and Archery Mastery, currently am 13 AA points from EQ.<br />
<br />
My present bow is this:<br />
<br />
Blessed Faydark Thunderbolt<br />
Dmg 30, Dly 38. Range 250. +5 Strength +5 Agility +5 Dexterity +5 Wisdom +10 Resist Magic +10 Resist Fire +10 Resist Cold +50 Hit Points +50 Mana<br />
<br />
I am looking to get an even better bow, but want to hear from some other Warders if it is better to have a higher damage longer delay bow like this:<br />
<br />
Ssraeshzian Longbow<br />
Dmg 39, Dly 45. Range 225. +10 Armor Class +10 Stamina +10 Dexterity +5 Wisdom +5 Intelligence +7 Resist Magic +7 Resist Fire +7 Resist Cold +10 Resist Poison +10 Resist Disease +70 Hit Points +30 Mana<br />
<br />
Or a more moderate increase in damage and lower delay bow like this:<br />
<br />
Bow of Doom<br />
Dmg 33, Dly 35. Range 250. +10 Strength +10 Stamina +10 Dexterity +10 Wisdom +8 Resist Magic +8 Resist Fire +8 Resist Cold +50 Hit Points +50 Mana<br />
<br />
With Swiftwind, Fleeting Quiver, and Haste buffs does that extra second make that much of a different?<br />
<br />
Safe hunting fellow rangers.</div></div><hr />

You cannot evade the bonk!  Bout time you joined the boards here!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lorekyllan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And they let you in Jarlax?   Sheeesh<br />
<br />
Haven't seen ya about in Norrath lately. Hope the new year finds you safe!<br />
<br />
No helpful info for me though, eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Paldaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">With regards to bows, I THINK that ratio is king.  There is no 'Main hand damage bonus' which encourages the use of low delay bows similar to low delay weapons in your primary hand.  If you are using trueshot the old belief was that you wanted to use the highest damage bow you could while still considering ratio to a certain extent, but I think that pure ratio would be more important than that.<br />
<br />
So, what I'd look for in a bow is ratio first, then look at stats.  The Bow of Doom is very nice, and there are probably only a few Rangers who have better with new boss-mob level PoP bows that are dropping.  That Ssra longbow would be pretty nice also.  All are probably better than the Thunderbolt, though that's still a nice bow, and probably better than any other buy-able bow depending on how you play your Ranger.  I know a lot of Rangers who equip the Thunderbolt as their regular range item, and one of the higher ratio bows for when they're actually bowing a mob.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>luterin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Don't forget to add the Arrow Damage aswell, which means a fast bow with the same ratio as a slow bow is actually better due to the arrows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>timcooper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">would think so, but that doesnt show in parses strangely enough, bah get primal/prismatic bow nothing like primal proc :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Roophus Gunthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/bonk<br />
<br />
<br />
look at the dmg, double it....then compare that and the delay (a 40/37 weapons turns into a 80/37 weapons with double dmg)<br />
<br />
Compare all of the ratios of those double dmg's and see what one is best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>entilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">don't have any of that cool am3 stuff myself but i hear that the high dmg - long dly bows are for the ooh ahh factor on crits.  efficiency however dictates that you keep the best ratio there, plus low delay = more arrows off during the trueshot duration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rajsy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Only ratio is important, but make sure it isnt too fast because shooting arrows is client side so lag can prevent you from being efficient with a very low delay bow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Darkdoc-Trib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Really from where i stand i would take the bow of doom for more arrows shot.. use eagle eye buff it helps missing less and have at stuff.<br />
<br />
ssrazean bow is probally very close in damage as the bow of doom would produce higher hits and crits to make up for the slower delay so either or really.. i imagine the ssra bow would slightly out damage the bow of doom with same equipment and maxed skill am3 eq combat fury 3 fury of the ages 3 and the wolf thing.<br />
<br />
I use a Primal velium reinforced bow myself same dam/del as bow of doom.. hits  high are non TS regular 548 non ts crit 940 ts regular 1112 ts crit 1898 with blessed champions arrow . all those are the highest possible hits of course for me with that equipment and 1616 atk.<br />
<br />
good hunting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Samanthie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Remember that second differnce, when the hastes are applied is trimmed down to about 1/2 a second when haste to both bows are applied.  A lot of it has to do with connection speed and how good you are at hitting the range attack key when it refreshes.  If you are slow, so is your DPS :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Suineko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">yep. Think about bow usage.<br />
<br />
You're potentially actually looking at (bow dmg + arrow dmg) * 2 (stationary mob) * 2 (am3) * 2 (trueshot) / delay<br />
<br />
so its not entirely as simple as it might otherwise seem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Planiar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">take the bow of doom</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kishin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">iirc, primal/prismatic bow ownzes.  with a 10 damage arrow and no avatar proc, it outdamages the AoW bow.  in fact, with a 14 damage arrow, you're looking at even the Bow of Doom outdamaging the AoW bow by a solid 6%.  thus? get the BoD.<br />
<br />
-K out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Greakan_VF</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Does anyone have a parse of War Bow of RZ versus Bow of Doom?<br />
<br />
Assuming no avatar, assuming AM3 and high damage arrows like 13 or 14 damage. <br />
<br />
I have Bow of Doom currently. Looking to trade sta for hit points over all and War Bow of RZ would be a nice hp upgrade. Curious what the real difference between the two are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>A_Ranger00</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">/em hides <br />
/em sneaks off into the woods to avoid bonkage <br />
<br />
<br />
Umm... what do you mean by hide/sneak into the woods? We ALL have tracking.... remember? :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
/em walks into the woods with THE shovel in my hands.... Tracking....<br />
There you are!!<br />
/bonk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kazaba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">/bonk<br />
<br />
Good to see you finally came in from the cold friend, and congrats on the EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Lythe Featherblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Go Doom.<br />
<br />
In the meantime however, spend 1-2K in the bazaar or just loot a twisted longbow, it's a decent upgrade over the BFT.<br />
<br />
BONK!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Doldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">You asked if anyone has parsed a Bow of Doom vs. War Bow of RZ. The answer is yes lots have becuase its same Dam/del as primal and tons have parsed that and yes BoD would outdamged WBoRZ.</div></div><hr />
