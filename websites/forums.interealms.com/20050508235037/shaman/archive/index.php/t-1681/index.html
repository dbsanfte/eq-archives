<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok I dinged my 6th AA point yesterday, I used it in regen3 (already have run3).<br />
Now I am wondering where to spend my next AA point..<br />
I have epic, jbb, all my Kunark spells beside avatar (means malo, torp, pox etc.)<br />
<br />
I want cani5 and MGB but.. I need to spend some more points before beeing able to get those kills..<br />
<br />
I don't really need the mana regen with torpor and cani4 .. I don't see the point of the crit on nuke and crit on heal.. and I was said that healing adept doens't improve torpor .<br />
<br />
Channeling Focus and Spell Casting Mastery worth anything ?<br />
Or only Spell Casting Reinforcement worth spending some points ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, I just started grinding for AA, my goal is at the moment.<br />
<br />
Regeneration<br />
Run speed<br />
Mental Clarity<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement<br />
<br />
I havent thought of the 59 AA as of yet.<br />
<br />
I would definatly do Spell casting Reinforcement and Mental Clarity, that every little bit of mana still will help I think but then again I dont have Torpor or even canni 4 yet hehe.<br />
<br />
Maybe Channeling Focus?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You say you want C5 right?  Well, the pre-req for this is Mental Clarity 3.  Grats 12 wasted points. :/  MC3 is pointless, but C5 makes it completely worthwhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Doh ! Forgot that (<br />
grrr<br />
well...<br />
I guess I ll spend my 12 point in mental clarity then (</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not gonna say mental clarity is worthless but sure wouldn't have been my pick if it wasn't required for Cann V.<br />
<br />
Personally I went MC 3, to cann V and then to MGB. If i had to do it again I'd do the same thing. Not sure where i'm going next but it doesn't really matter since I have slowed down on getting aa points lately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Any people here that havent gone/ planning to go:<br />
<br />
run3<br />
regen3<br />
MC3<br />
Cann<br />
MGB<br />
<br />
I like some of the skills themselves but I'm a bit disapointed that I havent been able to make my character more unique so far, that is the most cost effective use of points right there and I'm pretty sure it's what everyones gone for.<br />
<br />
I'll probably get to MGB and not bother alt exping anymore, its all got a bit tedious again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Laproaigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Dunno about MBG, so many don't like focus and with ppl dying and being late and all. I'm considering specialization mastery and quick buff in it's place. Maybe a bit of duration for torpor/regrowth/celerity when exping.<br />
<br />
The run3 regen3 MC3 (yuk) Can5 is pretty obvious though...</div></div><hr />

<br />
DOH! I had no clue about this as well, I guess I know what I will be doing now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I did run3, regen3, MC3, Canni5 - and I have 2 unspent points now.  I'd like to get my class title so I will probably do quickbuff next for faster torpor cast time.<br />
<br />
Then I will do reinforcement, I guess...  I don't raid much and never with big groups so unless circumstances change I won't be getting MGB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Karador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Torpor gets the haste from quick buff, but is it supposed to be considered a buff? or do you think that might change someday, so that quick buff no longer changes torpors cast time?<br />
a torpor in 3 seconds is very sweet, but I'm not sure it was intended to cast so fast.. <br />
 In the spell database file does it have the classes for files or something? I was just curious --<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I figure it will be changed the day I get quickbuff3  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Oogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It has a buff icon up and takes one of the 15 buff spots so I would assume its a buff...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">6 more points to go for MGB. I have just really slowed down the AAXP stuff after the first couple weeks. Needed a break from exping hehe. But, I gotta do it. I usually go in cycles like hardcore exp for a couple weeks, take 3 weeks off from doing exp. Anyhow, MC3, Canni V, MGB, SCM 3, quick buff 3...thats where I see myself going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Karador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Oogg, so do DoT's.. they aren't included in the quickbuff casting, unless I missed that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm only lv42, but is there a HOWTO on this AA stuff?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Since im Iksar i passed on the regen for Sta. I know silly, but with torpor and Vindi BP i dont need 3 more hps/tic as much as i like the add HPs  (which it wasnt much as much as i hoped :(  But Cann 5 is just awesome if ya have torpor!<br />
<br />
If ya dont have at least 1950 HPs fully dressed i would suggest not using it till ya get it! A lot of people still dont know that Cann 5 uses a set number of HPs (1924 i think?) for a set number of mana returned. I had the misconception it was a percentage of your current HPs till a guildy finally got the skill and told me. I personally still dont have it, i need 2 more points for MC3 so.....<br />
<br />
Now a question i have is based of a rumor i heard. Torpor is classed as a &quot;buff&quot; so does it benefit from Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery? I am still hoping for a yes on this :p</div></div><hr />
