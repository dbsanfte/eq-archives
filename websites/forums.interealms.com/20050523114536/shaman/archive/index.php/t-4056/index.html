<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zakalwec</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Howdy,<br />
<br />
I'm trying to get an idea of the manpower needed to take<br />
on Neh and Rak.  Can anyone tell me the recommended<br />
forces needed for a smooth fight?  Also, are Neh and Rak<br />
random spawns off reavers?  I've only seen Ghoisk spawn <br />
off a reaver and wasn't sure if it was random or off a reaver<br />
in a certain spot.  Any strategies or tips would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Here's some CoM Boss stuff I've posted previously:<br />
<br />
The trick to the reaver fights is the fact that multiple reavers may spawn, over and over again. All the basic reaver fights are the same. They are completely MR and cast blind. They hit very hard. Reavers are primarly a tank fight, make sure you have sufficient healing power and well managed mana (what if you get 9 reavers?) So, you pull Neh's reaver. Kill it, another reaver spawns instantly in its place, kill it, another reaver spawns instantly in its place, kill it, another reaver...I've heard of 12 spawning, but I've only seen 7 as a max. <br />
<br />
Neh isn't that tough at all. She is very MR and is mostly a tank fight like a reaver. Rak, of course, is a whole different ball game and really needs level 49 page pets (immune to his fire AOE) to get the job done safely. <br />
<br />
Remember, both Lords (Neh and Rak) can gate when low on health, they gate back to their spawn point (ie where their reaver died and they appeared). This gives us a great deal of power, since WE decide the spawn point. Utilize this to your advantage. <br />
<br />
There was a time when MULTIPLE Lords could be spawned (ie, a raid group came in, farmed some reavers for Jade Reavers and left the Lords spawned (only Ghiosk spawns aggro). Previously, if Rak was spawned and his reaver was also up, you could pop him again. This no longer works. If Rak is up and his reaver is up, killing Rak's reaver will not spawn another Rak. (or Neh) <br />

Rak Tips:<br />
<br />
* Rak's spawn point is where he spawns when his reaver dies, since he has a tendancy to gate back to his spawn point when nearly dead, it's a really really good idea to pull his REAVER where you want to fight the battle, gating/summoning Rak = bad <br />
* Don't fight in the temple. The risk of adds is too great and can lead to a mess. <br />
* Don't fight near water, if Rak falls in the water, it could be very bad. <br />
* Only the mage pets should engage Rak, this includes melee that like to &quot;helpfully&quot; shoot arrows. I personally witnessed a Rak fight that failed for this reason. (note: I'm sure a well equipped couple of groups could probably fight Rak without mage pets, but why risk it on your epic? go for what's safe). <br />
* My guild (which has never lost on Rak) always pulls Rak's reaver to the area we call the &quot;staging area.&quot; This is a small courtyard right before you go through the arch which leads to the pathway to the moat and temple. There are no roamers/spawns and there is a nice corner that the mage pets can push Rak into. <br />
* After you hand in the tear and Rak aggros, wait until the mage pets are engaged and Rak is on them, before you slowly step out of range. <br />
<br />
Lords and Reavers:<br />
<br />
Each specific reaver either spawns a Lord (Ghiosk or Rak) or a ghost. Each lord has a specific reaver.<br />
<br />
Generally it goes Ghiosk first (his reaver is closest), then either 3-4 (I can never remember if it's 3 or 4) reavers that spawn ghosts and then Rak's reaver (which according to a puller friend is &quot;up some kind of elevator&quot;. If a really good puller could get Rak's reaver out first, you could just kill Rak without having to fight the other reavers. <br />
<br />
Hmmm, I just read over that, did that make sense? Each reaver is specific and will always spawn either a Lord or a ghost depending on which reaver it is. The order the reavers are pulled is dependent on their placement in the temple, which is why Ghiosk's reaver comes first and Rak's reaver comes last. <br />
<br />
So, to sum up. Each reaver is specific and will either spawn a Lord or a ghost (hence, Rak's reaver, Ghiosk's reaver). If a Lord is currently up, the corresponding reaver will not spawn an additional lord, nothing will happen. If you kill the Lord, then the Lord's reaver, the Lord will spawn. <br />
<br />
So, if you kill a reaver and nothing happened, you killed a Lord reaver, but the Lord must already be spawned someplace in CoM. <br />
<br />

1. don't get to fuzzy about Neh tashing. She is easy, let her tash for god's sake.<br />
<br />
2. Read Gloriana's post .. all in there.<br />
<br />
3. Did the stuff a 2 days ago. Did not know that cure blindness works on Reaver blind now .. darn ;-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grimthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Did the Neh encounter about 3 months ago, and the Rak one a month or so ago (had trouble getting the tear).  I was surprised at how easy both encounters were.<br />
<br />
Neh:  We fought her on the walk way near the hut where her reaver is.  Was a piece of cake.  Did it with two 45-55 groups.  Like Kirn in the Hole, I reckon that if you can get to her, you can kill her.  No deaths on this one.<br />
<br />
Rak:  Was up when we got to him, but took out a few reavers anyway (the Ghiosk one respawned 11 times!) to avoid any adds.  I handed in the tear - our three mage fire pets tore through him.  I stepped away from him and gated to the zone in, and ran back to the castle.  In the time between him aggroing and me gating, he managed to do all of about 1000 damage to me (was in fire resist gear - about 150 fire resist).  One cleric died because she got too close to Rak while healing her assigned pet and copped a couple of AEs from Rak.<br />
<br />
Most dangerous bit was when everyone followed me to do the final turn-in to the dog in the lake, and one of my guildies, and a fellow shaman, turned off all the windows to take pictures, and didn't notice that he was drowning until it was too late.<br />
<br />
And I LOVE the epic.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're well equipped, you can do without.  If you're planning on trying it with a bunch of level 51 friends, then you probably need em.  High level tanks don't need fire pets.</div></div><hr />
