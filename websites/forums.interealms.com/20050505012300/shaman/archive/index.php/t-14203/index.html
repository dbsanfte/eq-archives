<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brettation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Now that they are changing the exp gain with the patch im sure alot of none used zones will open up hopefully, this also includes the downing of the amount of xp that is givin in PoP, sounds like all zones will be evened out. What places are you guys looking forward to, for me, that im 45, ill be in velks alot more in arena</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Unfortunately, it's not going to work quite like that.  PoP exp is going to be upgraded by a bit for full groups and gimped for soloists.  The net effect of this will not be positive for people who aren't to PoP level yet.  You'll find soloists and power duo or trios going back to some zones and raping them.  This doesn't mean that those guys will be looking to EXP with you, they're there to get as much solo EXP as possible or to get lots o PP while getting a little EXP.  The net effect to you will be that every once in a while, these guys will be getting in your way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trabayre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, if you enjoy Seb - watch out - the AoE clowns will be back ganking all your mobs :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When I'm looking to get more aa's, I'll be in a full group in BoT, Tactics, or PoV, they're still going to be on top for exp.<br />
<br />
Aside from that, I'll probably spend a little more time farming cash in sebilis (solo), and getting at least some aa while I'm at it.  Probably go back to CT again though, that'll be fun.  I always liked that zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brettation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I thought the patch will grant more xp per persons in a group 2 for 20% 3 for 30% ect. till 6 for 60-80% and excludes the 6th person in group?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i'll be in a full 6 person group in one of the planes :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm not a fan of the patch.  What I do like is duo'ing with a mage/sk friend.  Buffs are easy.  Just one other person and yourself.  I feel as though I'm more important to the group.  I mean, it's just you and that other guy, doing all the debuffing and DPS.<br />
Clerics make out like bandits.  Pure tank classes that have no shaman to duo with do well.  Classes that are less utility, and more single purpose oriented.  I rejoice for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well since PoV is already so full you can never find a camp (thats going to get a lot worse) and BoT is going that way, I'll be in PoS desert (usually empty because the exp blows compared to PoV/BoT) when I can't find a tank or Tactics when I can.<br />
<br />
This patch is going to make things really messy. <br />
<br />
PoV can only support about 6 groups <br />
Inner<br />
Outter<br />
Left<br />
Right<br />
NE <br />
NW<br />
<br />
BoT can support about 8<br />
South<br />
Deep South<br />
East <br />
Deep East<br />
North<br />
Deep North<br />
West<br />
CY<br />
<br />
(Thats how the camps are generally divided on Torv at least)<br />
<br />
Prime time those two zones (especially PoV) are almost always max occupancy. The only time I've even grouped in PoV in the last month was when a friend of mine held inner camp for me after his group broke up. <br />
<br />
Tactics supports even fewer groups, a few in the pit, one at zone, one in kennels. This hasn't been too much of a problem, but a lot of people are going to move there now. <br />
<br />
As other people said, I see very few people going back to the old world even after the change unless they going for plat or for mass kill groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kristofos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Currently doing Zone in in POI PLing Shaman.  If they open up zones will prolly head to rats in COD.<br />
<br />
Monk 65<br />
Shaman 57 ATM been there since he was 53.  Works out to about 1% AA for me to every 1% he gets.  So for every level he gets I make an AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think the planes will keep the same amount of experience given in full groups, just lower for soloers, How it'll work (I think) is:<br />
<br />
2 people - 20% more split between 2<br />
3 people - 40% more split between 3<br />
4 people - 60% more split between 4<br />
5 people - 80% more split between 5<br />
6 people - 80% more split between 5, &amp; given to all 6</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brettation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Fuudce thats what i thought, but that does seem it will help our exp gain in full groups by 2x right? Is it saying 80% more exp from the mob we kill and divided among group members? or 80% more xp split among the group, those make a difference if you think about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">full group exp:<br />
<br />
mob gives lets say 15000 exp points<br />
<br />
(15000x1.8)/5 = 5400 exp per person in a 6 person group</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>rezipps</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">From what they said earlier somewhere, it works out to be a completely whole new amount of exp. As in they are pulling exp out of thin air and giving it to you as a reward for grouping.<br />
<br />
So yes, you will be getting more exp then the mob actually gives out. They want you to group, so they are making it so grouping becomes almost a need, not a want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It is in NO WAY a need.  Good God, its a game!  If you wanna solo, then solo.  If you wanna group, then group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Sigh. Exp is WORSE for a 2 person group. People. Read the patch message.<br />
<br />
The ZEM modifier has been removed for pop. Verified number crunching on test shows the ZEM was 37%. Its now 0. So each mob yields 37% LESS exp than it did.<br />
<br />
So solo you get 37% less.<br />
2 you get 37% less, then add a 20% bonus. You get 17% less TOTAL, then split it 2 ways.<br />
<br />
A Group of 3 gets 3% more split 3 ways.<br />
<br />
People this is NOT a good thing. Its a nerf that SOE has wrapped up in cotton candy to make look good. Its a NERF that had to be implemented to facilitate upcoming expansions. Why would anyone go to a new expansion when the exp ZEM was better in pop? They wouldnt. Hence the nerf.<br />
<br />
Again this is a BAD thing. People seem to be rejoicing. Unless you ALWAYS want to be in a 5-6 person group, this sucks rocks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If you didnt hunt in PoP its a good thing.  People need to remember that not all the readers and poster on this forum are in their +60's. This adjustment lets me group with 5 other guildies, kill bad pixles, socialize with friends, have fun, AND still get some decent exp.<br />
Thank You Sony!!<br />
<br />
That being said, I wish they hadn't reduced the ZEM in PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If they hadnt removed the ZEM this is what would have happened:<br />
<br />
mob gives 100 exp  (7.3% aaexp).... assuming pop ZEMs at 37% (more or less not really important).  And lets say for the sake of argument this mob gives 10% aa per solo kill ( i.e. 137exp= 10% aa exp gain)<br />
<br />
Assuming you were in a 6 person group you got (137*1.2)/6 or 27.4 exp per person. this would be 2% aaexp.<br />
<br />
after the patch (assuming ZEM left in) mob gives each person in a 5/6 person group (137*1.8)/5 or 49.32 exp.  this would be 3.6% aaexp.<br />
<br />
You'll notice this is roughly half the exp the mob was originally worth, and more than 1/3rd the exp the mob is worth after ZEM is applied.  This doesnt even begin to account for whatever the bonus is for mobs close/above your level.<br />
<br />
currently, the sample mobs give (100*1.8)/5 or 36 exp per person in the 5/6 person groups. this would be 2.6% aaexp.<br />
<br />
 This is what happens when they try to encourage grouping, if they kept the ZEM in place and gave the grouping exp bonus; everyone would be 65/full aa's pretty quickly and we'd all cancel our accounts.  If they truly want to encourage smaller groups they could just increase the gain for lesser people so its at least the same as it was before the patch..this shouldnt be hard to implement...whether they will is debateable.<br />
<br />
Anyway to sum this up...you get  ~30% MORE exp now in a group of 5 or 6..i didnt do the math for lesser groups as i'm not completely sure what the bonus is for them, i'm sure its nearly status quo on 3/4 person and lesser exp for solo/duo.  The nerf was a by product of them wanting to raise group exp but not raise it THAT dramatically that it becomes problematic.  Everyone will still probably be able to get more exp solo than in a group, but now it wont be quite as much, and it wont be the same exp you got yesterday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">the result is also that mobs in any non-pop zones like places like ssra temple give 80% more exp in a 5 or 6 person group.<br />
<br />
here's the math:<br />
<br />
1 mob gives 100 exp the old way<br />
<br />
with 6 people it gives (100 x 1.2)/ 6 = 20 exp per person<br />
<br />
now it's,<br />
<br />
(100 x 1.8)/5 = 36 exp per person<br />
<br />
That's a straight up increase of 80% per kill in any non-pop zone. Non-pop zones which will be populated by dark-blue con mobs now. I don't know about you guys .. but a group of 6 people can tear though ssra, acrilia mines, or akheva pretty well nowadays. And now it's a whole 80% better than it used to be .. if ssra was close to about 1% of aa per kill . it's going to be closer to 2% per kill now .. and that's not too bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The patch message posted says PoP exp is being reduced a bit.  Was there a new patch message saying that the ZEM was being eliminated entirely?  Not sure why posts above are saying that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I am soooo looking forward to being able to Duo my 65 shammie and 63 rogue in CT again and actually get EXP :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dagor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">My understanding from a RL friend on test is that the ZEM is NOT entirely removed.  They just reduced it a to 37% or somesuch from 50% before they started tinkering.  The FIRST implementation was a complete removal of the ZEM.  The result was lots of complaining about penalizing folks that duo and trio, not to mention solo.  The second implementation, the one that made production, results in any group getting more exp than before.  Soloists will see a small, reportedly less than 5%, reduction in exp.  My friend is a necro, and he says the reduction is not really notable.  The nerf is there for soloers, but it is not the huge nerf some folks are crying about.<br />
<br />
If the necro community on test can find this change agreeable, the rest of eq community can't complain too much.  Necros, more than any other class, seem to base their enjoyment solely on experience gain.  Just my opinion, and a bit general, but I believe it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Nakukak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">VERY happy about the exp changes. Went into PoH for an enchanter piece, within an hour we got it including about 1.5 gold of an AA. That's great IMO. Also got half an AA in Ssra while camping shards/metals in about an hour. PoP isn't the end-all be-all anymore. Grats on a nice change, Sony.<br />

Well obviously group needed me to slow, so i did, i slowed mobs that hit for 300+hp, pretty amazing, but anyway, before the patch my xp sucked in a group of such which i did kael in. I got 1 blue per kill at 46 in veksar, it was amazing even with 60's in the group. I luve the patch</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I soloed a little bit on the Snakes and Cactorens in the PoS desert last night before my group arrived (darn slow folks) and didn't really notice any change in XP.<br />
<br />
Granted, I'm going 100% &quot;real&quot; XP right now, not AA, so small variations are less likely to be noted, but that's really what it is -- a small variation.<br />
<br />
I believe one of the recent messages said that even groups of 2 would be better off than before, so the drop in XP for a solo mob has to be less than 18% (the diff between old 2-man and new 2-man group bonus)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The bonus is noticable in non pop zones with a dou.

I plan to go on a long scenic cruise of places where shards drop, probably a little more long and little less scenic, but that's where I plan to go.<br />
<br />
I'm also psyched about checking out CT again, before this patch it was extremely tough to get anyone interested in going there, now it should be a lot easier.. thanks SoE!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Had a good chance to check out the changes in Tactics last night - spend an hour there, got 90% of an AA in the pit.  Usually took a bit longer than that, though it's always been nice exp.  Solo mobs up top in tactics usually gave me 5-6% solo, I'll have to go off a few quick tonight and see if it's down, but I'm gonna guess it's 4-5% now.</div></div><hr />
