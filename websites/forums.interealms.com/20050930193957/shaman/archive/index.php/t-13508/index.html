You Internet Exploder folks should try out Mozilla 1.4b or Mozilla Firebird (when it's released with an installer)<br />

I use mozilla , its really getting to be a strong browser, there is nothing that IE can do that mozilla cant. Basic draw is that its a cross platform project, i can use it in Linux and Windows without missing a beat. Opera is great, but they have a few annoying bugs last time i used it, nothing major, but enough to keep me off it.<br />
<br />
Besides, i like to support the open source guys.</div></div><hr />

The funny thing about folks who say things like this, is the fact that your alternate browser probably has 10 times the security holes, it's just that IE is in the spotlight because it's the big guy, and in such widespread use.<br />
<br />
Besides, what are they gonna do, exploit into your computer and discover your l33t pr0n collection? :p</div></div><hr />

In all actuallity, no, it does not have the same security issues. It's not directly tied to the operating system as IE is.<br />
<br />
Also, the underlying code for mozilla and firebird is open source. It is available to anyone to fix security holes promptly. I'm not saying they don't have security issues, but they generally get fixed rather promptly, and don't rely on security through obscurity as Microsoft often does. I WILL give them credit for patching quickly on IE these days. But, they have too.....<br />
<br />
And as to what they could get from my computer by gaining control of it through a web browser? How about my tax records, medical information, all my passwords that are stored for sites, put a keyboard sniffer on, use my machine as a denial of service node, use my machine as a spam node, etc etc.....do I need to go on?<br />
<br />
I actually use Firebird because I much prefer it's features.  IE is fast, and I give them credit for that. It doesn't allow pop-up blocking, tabbed browsing, etc.... Features are the number one issue for me, security is a bonus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't say it has the same security issues, just that it has them too. I'm well aware of how it works - I used to work at Microsoft, on the DS team, specifically the DNS client/server.<br />

<br />
Again, I'm aware that it's open source, and I have total respect for open source (in fact I would like to make my own contributions at some point) but the biggest problem with a non mainstream browser (this can be a blessing too) is that it will be less tested and less people will attempt to exploit with it. This is a blessing because you're less likely to come across code that exploits it, but it's a curse because if you do, it's a lot less likely that someone knows about how to get it fixed because it's less likely to be a known issue.<br />

<br />
Yeah, popups suck. I just use AdsGone and they aren't an issue for me, but if you prefer to just use a different browser, that's cool. I merely wanted to point out that people who claim security is a good reason to not use IE are not as right about that as they would claim - IE has issues (as does all software, I might add), but as long as you keep your patches up to date, will likely be just as secure.</div></div><hr />

i'm no experpert on browsers, but i know that is microsoft's excuse for the security holes, exploits, and bugs in their internet information server (IIS) software.  its all a big lie, many companies including my own run open source software such as apache on their public-facing servers, and it does not have anywhere close to the amount of secuirty flaws and vulnerabilities that the microsoft product does.<br />

Once again you don't know what you're talking about, other products have just as many if not more bugs, it's just that they have the entire community working on fixing them. Microsoft products aren't perfect - I 100% admit that. That said, neither are the other alternatives.<br />

I installed Avant yesterday after reading this thread. It's got lots of good features without being too different from what I'm used to. I like the ability to block pop-ups but still allow click-thru pop-ups in. I may give opera another look-see but propably not for a while as Avant has all the things that I want.</div></div><hr />

i don't appreciate your condescending tone.  yes, open-source products do have the entire community working on security holes and bugs, that is one  of the reasons apache security is a superior to m$ IIS.<br />
<br />
i prefer using an open-source product that runs on TOP of my OS as a nonprivileged user to one that is integrated into my operating system at the kernel level.  this goes for webservers as well as browsers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i prefer using an open-source product that runs on TOP of my OS as a nonprivileged user to one that is integrated into my operating system at the kernel level.  this goes for webservers as well as browsers.<br />
<br />
MS has recently changed most of the network services to no longer run in LOCALSYSTEM, I believe including IIS. They now run under the a limited privilege account. <br />
<br />
As for not appreciating my condescending tone, I don't really care, because you started it with your constant use of &quot;M$&quot;.<br />
<br />
I worked there, I helped design the product you are likely using right now - I know how much work we put into it, how much sweat, long hours, tears and constant testing we put into it. I know that pretty much everyone I've ever worked with at Microsoft has a passion for making the best product. They aren't out to take over the world, they aren't out to screw you over. They are there to make a quality operating system, applications, etc.<br />
<br />
Will there be bugs? Yes, it's impossible to release a fully bug free product that's not 5 years behind schedule. In fact I've even had some of my own bugs put off till next release for that very reason - but the fixes do go in, and frankly it's just as secure as the average *nix box when it's done, as long as all patches are applied. That said, there is no such thing as a totally secure box.<br />
<br />
So, if you want me to refer to you in a non-condescending way, try starting out without doing the same to me.</div></div><hr />
