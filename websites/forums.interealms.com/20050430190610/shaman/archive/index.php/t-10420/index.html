<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Golldor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just saw this on the EQlive website.  It's a breakdown of epics per class and how many are on each server.  Shaman made the 6th most epic'd class.  The breakdown is here (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/fippy_facts.jsp)<br />
<br />
Just thought I would pass it along</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wow, there is no such thing as a Ragebringer....<br />
<br />
Because then Rogue's would be number one if they really had an epic...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was surprised at the different numbers.  I would have thought there were more Shaman with their epics considering the ease of the quest.  What is truly sad is that there are almost as many Wizard epics as there are Shaman epics.  :\<br />
<br />
The Ranger number is skewed since it counts each sword as an epic item.  And the Warrior number seems skewed as well, if I understand the quest right.  Unlike the Ranger quest, the Warriors get both swords at once.  So I don't see how the numbers could be different....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">look at the bst epic, its scewed as well.  if they only have 1100 listed, thats really only 550 bst players with epics..pretty rare club to belong to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yeah too bad they forgot the most common epic out there heh.<br />
<br />
ragebringer, the rogue epic.</div></div><hr />

Makes me wonder how many wizards there are compaired to shamans in general.<br />
<br />
A more accuate tool of measurment would be to get the ratio of total shamans to epics.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">LOL I knew I posted that link request to the EQemu Somwhere, I have no idea how I managed to hit this thread though :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe. The labeling on the 1st chart combined with the fact that both the Ranger and Warrior epics have additional charts breaking them down into numbers for the individual components while there is no such breakdown on the BST epic rather heavily implies that only one piece of the BST epic was counted, not both. True, the message above the chart indicates otherwise but I would think they would have listed the names of both in the chart (as was done with RNG/WAR) if they really did count both halves seperately.<br />
<br />
1106 or 553 (whichever it really is) is a pretty cmall club to be in, but it will continue to grow and will surpass many of the others soon enough. After all, the Beastlords have only had about a year while everyone else has had several years to build up thier epic numbers.<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, they have now added numbers for the Ragebringer (11923, 2nd right after the combined ranger numbers and slightly ahead of the druids) and Singing Steel Shortsword (3674 - between the enchanter and mage).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Epics have always been flawed. Both in design (Ragefire in SolB - C'mon) and efficacy (Warrior), and ease of completion v effect (Rogue).<br />
<br />
I always thought the Shaman Epic was one of the better balanced in terms of the three parameters I've listed. Monk is too, and builds nicely.<br />
<br />
Rogue otoh is a cakewalk. <br />
<br />
And looks? Spear of Fate &gt; Necro Epic. Seriously. Necromancers are supposed to inspire fear, terror, dread, and loathing. NOT laughter.<br />
<br />
But, such is the nature of EQ. One man's MQ fest is another man's trip to the 7th island in the plane of sky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Looks like they updated it.  Has all the epics on top, then a breakdown of the multi-piece epics, rangers with 1 sword, other sword, both swords.  Warriors using both single blades, warriors using just the 2h.  No mention of the beastlord claws though, hard to say what that number really is, but bst's in general are pretty rare.<br />
<br />
They also have server numbers up.  I'm amazed at the Zek numbers.  Vallon has just over 1000 and Vallon only 800 some?  I guess with the population numbers gone, you can't really tell just how much less of a population is on the zek's than the other servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">80% of vah shir are beastlords :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">One thing I really dislike on epics is the Ranger to Bst comparison.  The items returned are pretty similar (though the bst ones are better).  But while the ranger epic requires 2 planar raids, all but the last encounter in the bst epic can be done w/ a single group.  <br />
<br />
Now dont tell me that getting siwftwind is easy because thats only half our epic.  Getting them SEoC from hate can be a near impossibility.  There are rangers out there who have killed well over 100 minis+inno and never seen a drop.</div></div><hr />
