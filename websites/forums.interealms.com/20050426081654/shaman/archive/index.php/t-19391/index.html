<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lvl 1-10 Any place with a lot of Aggro mobs <br />
Buff with the best buffs you can and then Sheild of Thorns, Run around and gather about 15 mobs.  Make sure You (the 65 Shammy) also has thorns on.  Have n00b_01 cast AoE until they get aggro.  Cast Big heal Rinse / Repeat.  1-10 in about an 1-1.5 hours.<br />
<br />
Lvl 11-20 LoIO <br />
Repeat Buffs as above, collect about 15 Goblins from the fort near the FV zone.  Rinse / Repeat.<br />
<br />
Lvl 21-30 LoIO<br />
Repeat Buffs, collect 10-15 Sarnaks from the Sarnak Castle near the Frontier Mtn Zone, front of Castle.  Rinse / Repeat.<br />
~~Alternate Method~~<br />
HHK Basement same as above but go to lvl 35<br />
<br />
Lvl 35-43 Mistmoore Castle<br />
Same Buffs, Have Shaman Run in with dmg shield on collect 10 or so mobs.  Same method as desribed above<br />
<br />
Now here is why I posted this in the 40-50 Thread...<br />
At 43 You could have them join your group, but WHY??<br />
<br />
PL 3 More lvls in MM and then group them, take them to PoJ or the Hole and take them to 55 or 60<br />
<br />
Note: This can Be done with ANY healing class and a Class with Dmg Shield.  Dmg shield potions are a bit pricey for this method.  <br />
<br />
As of last night my wifes cleric was lvl 39 in under 2 Days of played time.  This may not be the fastest you could do it but knowing that she will be able to group with me in LDoN within a week will be very nice.<br />
<br />
Be sure to let them practice their skills along the way.  While the mobs are dying to thorns, she is casting Yaulp, Small Heals and celestials to control aggro.  She is also sitting on her horse keep med maxed out, and every other fight she will swing her 1hb  weapon.  Her defense, Offense, 1Hb, and casting skills are maxed out for her lvl which is VERY important in leveling a new Toon fast.<br />
<br />
Hope someone finds this guide usefull.  Good luck!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i have been trying to PL my wizzie to 46 so i have my personal gater / TLer.<br />
With the almost non existing AC and low HP the wizzy has its impossible to PL him like a melee.<br />
<br />
any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

If you're using a single Shaman to PL a wizzy, it gets a bit more difficult and slow.  What you'll prolly have to do is buy/make damage shield potions for your shaman.  Get aggro with the shaman and let the DS take the mobs down.  Use your wizzy to pbae nuke a small nuke after the Shaman builds up sufficient aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">im using a 65 chanty and a 65 druid ATM but could switch to a 58 Cleric instead of the chanty.<br />
ill give it another try in Sol B =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">as a sidenote:<br />
<br />
i did lv 3 to 29 or 30 in Unrest.<br />
This zone plain rocks for 2 reasons:<br />
<br />
A) all mobs are undead and they dont run cept for some ghouls. all the rest beats on you for 20 damage max and die on DS.<br />
B) The zone is small but LOTS of mobs, no need for long pulling<br />
C) Old world zone allows the usage of manastone (if needed)<br />
<br />
i leveled several chars there you can make it from 3 to 20 in like 4 to 5 hours. Its really amazing. Its really fast exp til 25 but slows down at that level, but still easy to get to 30.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I used a single 65 Druid to PL my bard.  My method should work just as well for your wizzy.  <br />
<br />
What I did was ungroup and start buffs.  I gave him Skin Like Nature series while I used Pot9 on the druid.  Regen'd us both.  Hit myself with Brackencoat and gave us both a DS.  I'd sit him next to where I will be pulling to.  I memmed Bonds of Tunare for snare and quick heals.<br />
<br />
I switch over to my druid and start pulling.  I usually start my first pull with the noble spawn side.  Grab close to 10 kobolds (or less depending on druid gear).  I would run by them and proximity aggro.  Sometimes I have to sit there for a couple of seconds before they notice me.  Once a sufficient amount of kobolds have been gathered, I would run back to the camp spot and position myself against a corner wall (so they cant push me all over).  <br />
<br />
To gain aggro, I Bonds of Tunare them about 3 times and spot heal myself.  When the mobs are down to about 50-75% health, my bard(wizzy with a low level pbae in your case) would sing a single AE dot song and back off immediately.  It does about 30 damage to each mob.  The less damage the better so bard doesnt gain aggro and die.  The bard needs to do at least 1 damage to each mob to gain exp.  Once bard damage is done, I would switch back to the druid and heal as nesessary and make sure snare doesnt fade.  If any try to run, finish them off with the Bard.<br />
<br />
I stopped pulling greater kobolds when they turned light blue and concentrated on solusek kobolds, sonic bats, and lava beetles.  Lava duct crawlers have too much hp to be worth it.  I stayed in Sol B until level 50.<br />
<br />
Since you have a 65 enchanter, you can also try the enchanter + druid combo.  The enchanter can use arcane rune and legacy of the bracken.  Enchanters get hit more often and gain amazing aggro with ae tash, but the damage shield on them would be lowered since brackencoat is a druid self buff.<br />
<br />
edit: I'm now stuck at level 52 on my bard and xp is going slow.  I miss the 40% exp a pull lol.  I think I need to learn how to swarm kite.. =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Larns:<br />
<br />
thanks, actually that worked. I used the druid as meatshield and AE nuked with my wizzie when they went below 70 %. Snare causes enough aggro so i didnt have to hold myself back *grin*<br />
And thanks god, Sol B is oldworld dungeon so i used my manastone excessively heh.<br />
The wizzie is at lv 48 now, the exp in sol B slows down, at least for killing kobolds. They start getting light blue. Maybe i stay there til 49 and move to bats then, they are better exp, but with my lv 44 AEs it takes too long to kill them and costs a good amount of mana. My wizzie has a manapool of 3100 and just FT1. Damn FT3 boots are required lv 51 ;(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Galgor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Forget the druid. Go make some Kilva's skin of flame potions. 33 pt DS on a level 65, not bad. <br />
<br />
Also, the gnomes in SolA are very, very good experience. Level 30-40 in a few hours time.</div></div><hr />
