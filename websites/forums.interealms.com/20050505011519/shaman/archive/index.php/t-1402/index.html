<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Uloff Bonecracker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Basically, I don't think I'm going to do it anymore. <br />
<br />
A few months ago I was in Sebilis doing the crypt (Emp, blood, crypt) where I lucked out and won another JBB. Thinking I could use this to fund my missing spells I began to auction these wrist wonders at the bargain price of 8K. I’m an Australian, so I don’t play at peak times so there wasn’t too many shaman around. Anyhow, after a minutes I received a tell from a fellow shaman – lvl 49 – saying that he would be interested in purchasing the item, but he didn’t have the cash on him. He joked and asked if he could “pay it off”. I thought to myself.. Sounds fair enough, at level 49 I would have killed for a JBB. So, I bought a port and handed him the JBB… After a few days I thought to myself if he contacts me to tell me he has a payment I’ll just give him the item without having to pay a cent. Fast forward to about a month ago, I see him online so I send him a tell to say hello and not to worry about paying me back. He thanks me and I continue on with whatever I was doing. Fast forward again to last night, I see him again in the bazaar. I find out he’s only a level higher and he sold the JBB for some cash……. If I had have known he’d do that, there’s no way I would have given him the item in the first place especially after I’d made it clear in the first place I’d only give it to him IF he used it. Anyhow, this isn’t the first time I’ve seen this happen but it’s made me very jaded. Anyone had any similar experiences?<br />
<br />
** edit: BTW, I would have given it to a guild shaman in the first place and not even contimplated selling it if it wasn't for the fact that all our guild shaman have JBB's ***</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>FloppyDisks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have given a few valuable items away before.  The difference is though, they were people I had known for a good long time.  Wraith Bone Hammers, fine steel, other low end gear I give to strangers.  Nice items are either sold, or given to friends only.  Greed just takes over strangers to easily in EQ</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There's a difference between being nice and being dumb.  Giving a total stranger your JBB is classified under the dumb category.<br />
<br />
I myself usually don't give *anything* away to strangers, because I've run into a lot of greedy, self serving little ****s.  If I were to give something away, it would have to be a junk item that wouldn't even sell for 500pp.  For my good friends and people that have earned my trust, sure I wouldn't mind giving them something expensive, that they would use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Uloff Bonecracker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Jilariz, I didn't give away MY JBB.. I still have one. I call it a &quot;random act of kindness&quot; that blew up in my face. I will be refraining from giving items to non-guilded people in the future. To call me &quot;dumb&quot; because I had a little bit of faith in the shaman community (It's not like a lvl 49 shaman is a newbie) is sad IMHO. 'tis sad times I tell ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I always give away items..but never anything of value over 1kp. I normally give away all that vendor crap you get on Kael raids like berzerker swords etc. I myself have been given generous gifts and whenever i get better I always give them back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mordrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have found that being a kind person is far more fun than being a jerk.  So I try to help people when I can.  In everquest or real life.  In EQ i helped pl newbies in the guild and would help lowbie groups by buffing and healing, then maybe giving handouts.    In real life I was blessed with above avearage size and have worked up my strength, and I rag on bullies till they leave people alone.  Though in eq it is best to get to know the people you are helping a bit.  Some people deserve kindness and others should be left to the wolves.  Dont stress Uloff, the person you met up with will eventually come across trouble that only happens to people of that character.  In short, bad things happen to bad people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The usual policy I adopt has been that whenever someone asks me for items or money, they come away with nothing. Whenever a younger one contacts me asking for something else, advice, I give it freely....and frequently with other items that I have that I no longer need. <br />
<br />
What I love to do this most is if I see a lower level someplace offering to do SoW or other shaman buffs for free, but accepting donations if folks can, I will go up and hand them whatever cash i have on me. This has been a range from 50-300pp. Just because I HATE to see the &quot;Casting SoW and other buffs for donations&quot;...thats not a donation, that is a fee. If they offer it free and accept donations if they come, none if they dont, I like that way of handling themselves, and I take it upon myself to make it be rewarding for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">his loss, youll see him auc'ing to buy one here in a little while</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kieran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm very much of the &quot;you get what you give&quot; philosophy, but it's also very true that if things do come to people easily, they don't appreciate them. It's a tricky balancing act, partucilarly since even at 8k you were doing the guy a HUGE favour.<br />
<br />
Personally, I simply can't get into the auction system in EQ - I just hate doing it, so I give most stuff away. I really doubt that most recipients appreciate what it took to get the stuff, either, or will do anything other than sell them rather than pass the items on in turn. But on the other hand, a gift should really BE a gift; once I've given something on, I really don't have any claim to what they do with it.<br />
<br />
For an item as valuable as a JBB, I would still give it away - but not to someone I didn't already know well. I'd have started with something smaller, and if over time they appreciated my help then I would have been able to give them the JBB without feeling any residual attachment to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, on the plus side, your postitive karma hit was HUGE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">When I was a newbie I didn't have anyone giving me items, 56th level clerics to give res's and I sure as heck didn't beg for items from everyone I saw that was higher level than me.<br />
<br />
If people beg me for items I ignore them.<br />
<br />
If I see someone actually playing out in the wilderness or in a dungeon, I will occasionally give items away that I collect while I am out and about.<br />
<br />
No one who sits in a city begging deserves anything for free. Especially when that person could be some greedy individual who begs items then sells them to others just to get some platinum.</div></div><hr />

Jilariz, I didn't give away MY JBB.. I still have one. I call it a &quot;random act of kindness&quot; that blew up in my face. I will be refraining from giving items to non-guilded people in the future. To call me &quot;dumb&quot; because I had a little bit of faith in the shaman community (It's not like a lvl 49 shaman is a newbie) is sad IMHO. 'tis sad times I tell ya. <br />
<br />
Uh, no.  You did give away YOUR JBB.  It may have not been your ONLY one, but it was still yours.  :P<br />
<br />
Random acts of kindness are helping a newbie get his body from an area with a lot of mobs higher level than him...tossing out some buffs, healing someone up.  Stuff like that..some simple help.  Giving a total stranger an item that can sell for 10k or more, with a promise from them to pay you back, that's not kindness, that's just dumbness.  SoE puts up Message of the Day's specifically saying NOT TO DO THAT.<br />
<br />
I didn't call you dumb, though I certainly could have worded it better.  You did a _dumb_ thing.  Glad you learned something from it though.<br />
<br />
Also, I don't think it's such a good thing to be giving lower level players TOO good of stuff.  JBB is quite the item, one that I'm sure a lot of us feel should be earned on their own, not given to them.  Sort of a Rite of Passage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Okay, lemme tell my sad story (I hope I remember it!)<br />
<br />
The details are getting hazy...I was playing my cleric, Amalthea (created at the same time as Gloriana and *not* a twink) and a friend gave me a platinum tiara.  I was replacing a Zaharn's coronet (I think, it's been awhile) and I was in Freeport, so moved by a spirit of generosity I shouted for a low level non twink to come meet me at the gate.<br />
<br />
Shortly, a little dwarf cleric ran up and said he was interested in my gift.  I did a /who and he was anon, I told him he had to be non anon.  I inspected him and he was wearing little bits of leather.  When I found out he was really a needie newbie I was sooo happy!  A friend had gifted me, I would gift my old hat and share the kindness.<br />
<br />
I handed over the hat, and asked him to try it on.  I congratulated him on his spiffy appearance, and with a glad heart I left Freeport.  5 minutes later in EC, I see the same little dwarf auctioning to buy &quot;good cleric gear.&quot; I found him in the tunnel and he was wearing decent starting gear (nothing special, but not a naked leather wearing newbie either).<br />
<br />
The experience had a long lasting effect on me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">One of the signs of a true newbie is asking a lot of questions and NOT begging. I look forward to this as I spend a lot of time sitting in Grobb just chatting.<br />
<br />
The first thing I do when I get a good question is answer it, then I buy the person a full suit of leather and a normal weapon and later run over to Rathe and pick them up a fine steel weapon of their choice from the giants. If it's a Shaman I'll get them their early spells too.<br />
<br />
This is money well spent I think, especially from my old school thoughts of the days when it wasn't so easy on newbies.<br />
<br />
Any true newbie can't thank you enough and the twinks and begging scammers just laugh. It doesn't ruin the game for them either as early leveling of the FIRST character is actually fun and a learning process that should be gone through.<br />
<br />
There are/were more than a few high levels on Xev and Innoruuk servers that got some goods from me when they were newbs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I enjoy helping out people when I can (especially low-level shamans).  However, there's a limit to my kindness as well.  If I have an extra copy of Torpor or a CoF or something, I'm not going to just give it away to some random person.  It's going to go to a guildmate or close friend.<br />
<br />
Just tonight, a low-level shaman asked me for directions around Shadowhaven in tells.  Just so happens we crossed paths a few minutes later and she thanked me for my help and I remembered &quot;Hey, I have some old equipment sitting in my bank . . . why not?&quot;<br />
So I tell her that I have some items she can have and we run to the bank.  I gave her JB Gaunts, that necklace that casts our lvl 34 pet, and Talisman of the Rhino.  Yeah, nothing to get excited about, but it sure made her day (she was lvl 23)! <br />
<br />
So there's nothing wrong with gifting; I think it's a good thing to do.  But there should be a limit.  After a point, you will have to start looking out for yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Every time I head to Halas to get spells and train, I always make sure to bring back a couple packs full of file steel/shiny ore weapons and some minor loot (been hunting giants so lately lumberjack caps, etc.) to hand out.<br />
<br />
One benefit of Halas- it's easier to see who the truely needy players are- they're the patchwork/rusty weapon equipped ones running from the train of three gnoll pups.  :)  I make a note of who I see in Everfrost before I go to Halas, go to Halas, and on my way out (back in Everfrost) if any of those guys are still around, they get something.  <br />
<br />
Also, Blackburrow is great for handouts and buffs- what beggar is going to go to all the trouble to get to 8th level, run almost naked to Blackburrow, wander down to the underground area, and whack on gnolls on the off chance that someone will come by and give them something?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I rarely have anything of value as I don't roll on stuff unless I can use it as primary gear, but Uloff, ya did a nice thing.  I feel bad it blew up on ya.  I still give stuff away (there are about 3 twink shaman in the guild mostly decked out in stuff I gave them, 2 others partially twinked out in my stuff, not including a guild twink who got all my old stuff when I quit, still I'm decked out ok now that I've returned thanks to the guild).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I still find Halas/EF on of the last zones to find true newbs (maybe because they all played barbarians in Diablo).  Was PL ing a mana vial chanter on orc mounties and shm last week, and ended up with a full suite of raw hide armor. Watch the newbie zone, ask one fi you can inspect. Rusty weapons and tattered - he was really happy. I never forgot the iksar necro coming back from a ice giant session and handing my level 3 newb a FS mace. I was the terror of gnoll pups! And thet wizard that dropped a ringmail tunic on me a while later, 'cause I looked so naked.   But I also remember the lvl 2 idiot whom I gave a dwarven ringmail tunic in EFP and who thanked me by telling everyone in shout what ****ty stuff I was handing out. Oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I used to be nice and hand out stuff to lowbies.  Then they would put me on their friends lists and send me constant annoying tells and try to wheedle more stuff out of me, or get me to help them with quests that were 30 levels too high for them or something.  It got to be really annoying to the point I almost had to put them on ignore.  <br />
<br />
I learned my lesson.  <br />
<br />
Never gave away a JBB tho.  wow.<br />
<br />
I only give nice items to RL friends.  I only loan nice items to guildies or RL friends.  I twinked my buddy's wife's druid out to a tremendous degree with just the **** i had in the bank.  I'm talkin some pretty nice **** here too.  So it's not like I don't give stuff to people.  But the qualifier is they have to be people I know.  Otherwise . . . nah I'm not interested in working for some faceless person who I'll never meet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">You did a nice thing, it's too bad that guy did not realize it was so valuable and a huge gift.  <br />
<br />
I give/loan stuff to my friends but I don't give things to random newbies anymore.  Newbie stuff gets vendored or sold cheap on EC bargain days.<br />
<br />
The reason I stopped.  I was level 45ish or so and I had been out hunting in the DL and got a full suit of bronze off the drovlags.  I had some random low level newbie weapons in my bags and was heading to give stuff away.<br />
<br />
I found a level 4 human warrior wandering around killing things at the edge of EC.  <br />
<br />
So I walk up and say hello.   He says hello.   I say &quot;I have a few extra things in my bag that I think might fit you, would you like them?&quot;    He says &quot;wow really?  that would be great!&quot;<br />
<br />
I proceed to hand him a full set of bronze and some kind of weapon better than a newbie shortsword.  Then he goes... &quot;oh... thanks&quot;  and turns around and runs off.  I was like what the...So I invised and followed him.   <br />
<br />
He ran over to the zonewall.  Sat down and dropped everything I gave him on the ground.  He then camped out.   I picked up all the stuff.   A few minutes later a level 54 epic druid runs over and looks all over the area, then OOCs if someone has picked up some stuff that belonged to him, he said he would reward them, as it was worth good money.  (bronze is so valuable, you know)  /sigh.   <br />
<br />
Anyway, now I just sell that stuff to the vendor, hell with trying to find some twink in disguise to give it to.<br />
<br />
Funny though, my first char on Terris was a necro.  Someone gave her a Blackened Iron Medallion when she was level 4.  She in turn gave it to Henora, who wore it far far longer than I would like to admit.  Then my druid portbish wore it... then last night I gave it to a friend of mine for his new mage twink.   Give me a gift and I will keep it forever, then gift it on down.   Even a mega-newbish item like a Blackened Iron Medallion.  :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Remember when the Langsaxe was THE weapon?<br />
<br />
I do this quest every now and then, for the heck of it (I run across WK a LOT) and hand it to somebody that looks like they can use it.<br />
<br />
Last 2 times, it seems, the morons just turned right around and sold 'm to vendors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Like Henora, I had a beloved piece of equipment that was lovingly passed down to all my characters and was finally gifted to a real life friend that started playing the game, my wonderful compass.  Purchased by a friend for me at great expense when my very first character was in her teens, it was a precious item for someone that got lost as much as I did!<br />
<br />
It cost a whole plat!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">doh Uloff, that sucks.  i used to be nice and give stuff away to random folks who looked like they could use it, but i simply dont do that anymore.  only people i know get stuff from me...theres too many people out there who only see a monetary value when you hand them something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Heh .. What she said .. Nice Karma boost!<br />
<br />
As you put it &quot;random act of kindness&quot; - SImply put . You did a nice deed, and felt good about it.. What he does with it is of no consequence(sp?) to you... The best you can be is a bit disappointed that a fellow human being wasnt as kind...(but you can't be disapoointed in the JBB specifically)...<br />
<br />
Whatever happens in the past should not be of concern when moving forward.. Be yourself.. If that means handing another freebie out to some greedy freeloading scum.. then so be it.. <br />
<br />
As it was put .. At least your karma went up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Arorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Well that sucks what happened, giving away a JBB ....Well i gave it once to a RL friend as well. They kept it for some time then either lost it (how does one lose an item in EQ with drop confirmation msgs and what not ?) or sold it and didnt want to fess up to it.I feel your pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I've been thinking about this off and on today.  When I was a true newb, the things I wanted most in the game were some armor pieces (mostly so I wouldn't look naked!), and a nice weapon (fine steel was a distant dream.)<br />
<br />
I think next time before I head to Halas (I just can't make myself give to newbs in non-remote locations) I'll have my smith-mule whip up a backpack or two of banded tunics, and another of banded leggings.  They cost like 1 pp each to make, they're not worth it to sell back to vendors, for the cost of one minor item I can fill packs and packs with them, and truely new players will absolutely love them.  Maybe hand out a pack of each in BlackBurrow on my way... then once I get to Halas, get two more packs from the bank and and them out in Everfrost. :)<br />
<br />
Neat way to hand out stuff to tons of people for very little cost, I think.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I see it like Gheff.  You made a gift.  Once given, there really shouldn't be strings on it.  Who knows what decisions were weighed by this person as he sold it.  <br />
<br />
Maybe he was thinking &quot;I really want to get something for my dear friend, but I have nothing of value except this jbb.  This item is special to me because it was a gift.  I think the shaman who gave me this would be happy with me doing something special for someone else though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Who knows, and without knowing there's little point in negative speculation. You got the pleasure of giving.  <br />
<br />
Of course, you were nuts to give away a jbb ..... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I remember the first thing I ever had given to me, still -- a fine steel mace.  I was shocked -- stunned!  This was the kind of thing you had to be in your 30's to get, maybe when fighting in Cazic, not something you get at like level 10, like I was, without a plat to my name.  It wasn't the kind of thing you just give away, and I could never afford to buy one.  I was thrilled!<br />
<br />
It takes very little to thrill a real newbie, because ANYTHING to a real newbie is huge.  <br />
<br />
I never give anything to anyone who asks for stuff, because to me that's 99% confirmation that they are not really a newbie, but instead someone experience at the game.  Why the heck should those guys get freebies that rightly should go to REAL newbies?  Should be ashamed of themselves, the punks.  I don't wander into shopping malls and ask for free merchandise, or sit down in the office lounge and ask people to fix me a snack.  I wouldn't even think of it -- same in the game.  You have to be taught that kind of bad manners, or teach them to yourself; they don't come right away.  Real newbies are often very polite and even intimidated, wondering what the heck is going on -- not on the greed patrol.  A lot of them even take a long time to learn how the channels work; they're not spamming /shout and /ooc with begs or sending tells begging, because they usually wouldn't know how to do it even if they wanted to.<br />
<br />
However, I have given lots of stuff to real newbies.  I like handing out greater lightstones to blind people, giving people quest components, etc.  Back in the day when that fine steel mace was really great, I used to port my first character, a druid, in to west commons from cazic, or run all the way to kelethin, and pass out lots and lots of fine steel I would loot from there.  Back then, my losing the five plat from not selling the FS actually felt like something, too.  But it was payback for the guy who gifted me when I was young, and it really thrilled the newbies, which was fun for me too.  <br />
<br />
That's what it's like with REAL newbies.<br />
<br />
Nowadays, I don't think there are all that many real newbies around.  You hear level 7 people /ooc'ing what they think about COCW vs. COF, etc.  And you get begged constantly.  I dread going into Cabilis with my monk because there's always some &quot;newbie&quot; camped at the bank waiting for people to show up so he can beg for money or items.  Our old ancestral newbies, the real ones, almost NEVER did that.  Now most of them do, it seems to me.  A lot of us old-timers who were cooler newbies have turned into jerkier elders.  Then again, so many people are twinked and powerleveled these days that a lot of people hit high levels who normally would have been winnowed out by the time demands of the game and the effort level it USED to take, at least for the non-twink/PL's.<br />
<br />
I've mostly been broke throughout my EQ career except for very rare spurts of being flush with cash, but I've enjoyed helping friends complete quests or kill epic mobs or mobs that drop something special for them.  That's the main way I help out these days.  I just twinked a friend's level 20 shaman with some nice stuff because he's an old friend, and he's broke too, and doesn't really know what he should buy or equip, or why or when.  He has a 60 monk and is working up a shaman; I have a 60 shaman and am working up a monk.  That kind of helping is cool and fun; helping out some random beggar just turns me off.  I'm on my third post-50 character now, and if I could get this far without begging, so can they.</div></div><hr />
