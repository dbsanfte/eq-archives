You are aware that you can be whatever you want with any race, right? Those were merely suggested roles that their starting stats were well suited for.</div></div><hr />

Iksar wis is higher than int and our str isn't that hot either but agi looks nice. Not sure how they came to those suggestions, really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I read the manual.  Starting stats are wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Seriously, just play what race you like, because it won't matter.<br />
<br />
As a Barbarian Priest, my Wis wasn't very good to start with, but 27 levels later it makes absolutely no difference at all.</div></div><hr />
