<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gin_juice68</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok so my play time has been on weird hours lately so id figure i might as well grind out some AAs solo. I have been in Dulak, which is most of the time quiet and i get 1% a kill goin 100% AA ( Normal xp stinks there ) But can pretty much keep the armory clear with very little down time almost none . Was just wondering if there is a better spot or if this is ok for solo AAxp? Oh yeah im only 55. Thanks ahead of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1-2% is about as good as it gets solo for a while. your alternatives open up somewhat when you hit 60 and get torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gin_juice68</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i figured that was as good as it was gonna get just didnt know if anybody knew of any other places that i coudl do it at</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LachdanonColdpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Im 60 with torpor, please list some &quot;alternatives&quot; =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">at 52 or 53, some of the best experience i can remember is in hhk killing nobles and bards.  past 53 and the aa experience becomes kind of crappy.  stayed there till 56 for regular solo experience (nothing beats it till then).<br />
<br />
the hole, down deep, might be really good aa experience at 60.  i seem to remember it being pretty decent for old world content at lvl 65.  ugly cr's though.  mage duo is perfect down there.  there's a great xp modifier down there, and i know it's great starting even in early 50's.<br />
<br />
in dulak, by the forge (which is located between some buildings), if you pull to the forge, mobs don't run away from you when they're low on life.  not sure if that helps, but it saved me from having to root every stupid mob i pulled.  should help speed up kills if you're not already using it.<br />
<br />
speaking of loy, if you're low 50's, lava dudes in nadox (?) might be decent aa.  there are a couple really good posts in this area that can you help you out with specifics there.<br />
<br />
at 60, i remember fungus grove being pretty decent.  might want to go 61 so you get next pet.  epic really shines here.  pull a bunch of mobs, root all but one, slap epic on them, and then refocus on one.<br />
<br />
obviously there's adventures.<br />
<br />
apart from that, i'm drawing blanks.</div></div><hr />
