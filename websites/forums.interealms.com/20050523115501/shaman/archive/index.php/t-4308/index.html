<br />
It used to be a proc. <br />
<br />
As a shaman we do melee and it would benefit us more as a proc.<br />
<br />
Put is back as a proc or make it equal  to or more damage then JBB.<br />
<br />
That is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Inc angry iksars!<br />
<br />
On a serious note though, I only got this item because of the proc, and it sits in my bag 24/7 now that it was changed.  I want my 5 points back!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i also banked mine when it was changed from proc to casted. annoying change</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Stay away from my clicky.<br />
<br />
Besides for just poking holes in things this is a great spear.<br />
<br />
Asking for this to do more damage to a JBB is &quot;druidish&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kikak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have this thing also. It's clickable.<br />
<br />
It's 180DD but it has a shorter casting time.<br />
<br />
I havne't worked out the ratios but Taraddar told me the JBB was still better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ahem, i'll take it :)<br />
<br />
No **** it sits in ya bag when you already have a JBB!!<br />
<br />
If you didnt already have one im sure you'd perfer it to be a click.<br />
<br />
Only thing that would be cool about a proc is crits work on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">never fear israi, there is an iksar usable right click DD nuke.<br />

*drumroll*<br />
<br />
yes! the ceramic band!  made with a pottery skill of 225 you too can be the owner of unlimited procs of Burst of Flame - our lvl 1 nuke.  <br />
<br />
*soft announcer voice* not equippable until lvl 20.  please no yelling or cursing at your local friendly potter.<br />

<br />
<br />
If you're a JBB equipable shaman, and are in a guild capable of doing THO, and don't already HAVE your JBB, you should be shot, and /guildremove'd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Purtyoogly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">great rabid bear weapon i bet :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i think its a nice lil item for the iskars . its lower damage but like 4 seconds shorter on cast time . it equals out to be very close to the same thing , just more clicky .<br />
<br />
would be more fun as a proc though. hey atleast VI is trying , cause you know the only reason its right click is to &quot;try&quot; to make the iskar happy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sheesh, take what you can get! If you are going to whine about it, then frankly you don't deserve a right-click at all! :p<br />
<br />
The different on damage is negligible. Be thankful you get one, not that it is &quot;slightly less effective&quot; then the JBB.<br />
<br />
The grass is always greener on the other side, eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">if it is a 4 second cast time and does 180 damage, then in 8 seconds it will do 360. don't see how that's less than a JBB.<br />
<br />
PLUS a smaller chance to get interrupts, and the effect of an interrupt is mitigated since you only lose 4 seconds (or 180 damage, depending on your point of view).<br />
<br />
More of a chance of partial resist, but again a resist will have less of an impact on your DPS.<br />
<br />
Oh, and it's a ratio-1 piercer and frees up your wrist slot for better armor than the jbb.<br />
<br />
but, hey, who am i to say it's still a good item...<br />
<br />
EDIT: i don't actually know what the clicky cast time is since i'm about eight years away from ever seeing one, someone just said it was 4 seconds quicker than the 8-sec JBB. A 5.33 second cast would make it have the exact same dps as a JBB; a 6-second cast would make it slightly worse, doing 1440 damage in the time that a JBB does 1620. Again, though, that's assuming no interrupts. If it has a 6 second cast time and you get interrupted twice every 48 seconds, Winterstorm is still better on the nuke output (and of course your JBB won't stab things for you, either).<br />
<br />
second edit: okay, proof that i've never used either of these items, didn't think about recast times :p from other less-reputable fora it seems that you can use about 3 winterstorm clicks per 2 JBB clicks, making the damage damn near identical (3 * 180 = 540 &gt; 532 = 2 * 266, and still not counting interrupts or resists). Sooo whatever, the point is that it's still real damn close... take it back out of the bank, sell me your jbb for 1k and quit whining =P</div></div><hr />

actualy i didnt know it  did 180 in 4 seconds .. what the heck is the complaint , this does more damage then the JBB :confused:<br />
<br />
not to mention your half into another cast before the JBB lands one !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It's 180 in 6.5 sec, slightly less DPS than JBB.<br />
<br />
I use mine depending on mood, wearing Extended Affliction 3 and Affliction Haste 3 bracers and Winterstorm is a nice exp group setup, but when soloing it's JBB, Extended Affliction 3 on wrists and a Facesmasher in Primary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">just to clarify JBB is only 266 damage max. You cant figure in crits and crap cause most people dont have that, dunno where 380 came from... I wish it was 380.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>HerkeeLees</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">JBB is 263, and I have this weapon. 6.5 seconds for a 180 nuke, not very usefull considering I have a JBB but it does have slightly more HP then epic and doesn't have the annoying 405021k watt light feature.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">crits dont affect clickables, 180x2=380=2 casts, thats where 360 came from :)</div></div><hr />

Winterstorm (http://magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=28851)       :confused:           Jaundiced Bone Bracer (http://magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=4532)      <br />

Compare and make your own decision! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hmm...<br />
<br />
JBB: very common, almost every non-iksar shaman has one. Jury says easy to get.<br />
Winterstorm: drops off THO ...<br />
<br />
and we tailed folk do not get the screw?<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Robin quick, the logic gun!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
False assumptions are great.</div></div><hr />

- ROFL. I personaly know 3 level 60 non Iksar shamans without one. And 2 of them are living in the Sebilis crypt camping their rare spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Ok so its not so true, but if you saved up its much more easier to obtain than the spear IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ryasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I would have to say it still isn't easy to buy. I look for it daily and I have only seen it for sale once since the bazaar went live. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Last I recall, right clicky IS affected by crit aa skills. They are not affected by focus effects however. I know at one point at least the wizards were thrilled with their rend robes because of the mana free crits :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was stealth nerfed 4 months after SoL release. I have Critical Spells level 2 and never crit on JBB anymore. Used before. If I only could get the 6 wasted points back ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">If it's 6.5 casting time on winterstorm, than jbb is definatly better damage output.  6.5 seconds just slightly exceeds the pause between 2 rounds of melee from a slowed mob (not factoring in the bashes/kicks).  Therefore, winterstorm and JBB have just about the same chance of being interrupted.  If winterstorm proc was 5.5 seconds casting, then it would be very worthwhile.<br />
<br />
Good for iksars though since they can't equip JBB.  Has slightly more hp too and a high level shaman raiding ToV+ needs all the hp's he can get.  And by freeing up JBB slot in the process, there are much better bracers out there, like even more hp hehe.  Artificer ain't bad even though you take a 2 ac dive, but gain 35 hps.  It has mana and resists too, so I'd say it's a sweet combo.  <br />
<br />
Damn, I really want that spear now :D</div></div><hr />
