<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ramma2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If this has been done before, I'm sorry.<br />
<br />
I'm about to ding 61.  I had planned to do so, then use my new pet and farm aa's in Dulak.<br />
<br />
However.<br />
<br />
Friend of mine just told me that there's a 20-25% penalty on aa exp once you hit 61. <br />
<br />
So my question is, do I stay at 60 and aa, or will the new pet make it so much nicer that I won't even notice the penalty, if it even exists?<br />
<br />
Finally, is there a good aa exp spot with semi nice loots that I could do on a daily basis?<br />
<br />
Thanks all!<br />

PS - Fast response if you can!  I'm in a PoS group now, and 61 is just a few kills away.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The new pet is a HUGE upgrade.<br />
<br />
There is a large difference in amount of experience per kill you get between level 61 and 65, which is due to the level difference bonus.  I 2-box a 61 warrior/65 shaman combo (troll/barbarian).  I make about 2:1 exp on the warrior:shaman.  I'm holding the warrior at 61 until he finished up the AA I'm working towards, then I'll level him to 63, and do it again.<br />
<br />
My recommendation would be to level to 61 and get True Spirit and the rest of your 61 spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is no level based xp penalty.  What does exist is an xp bonus for killing mobs near your level (within 5 levels of you) or higher level.  <br />
<br />
Levelling to 61 before the recent xp change patch used to make a lot of old xp grinding spots go light blue/green due to the decreased blue range, which further diminished the xp you could get for killing the same mobs at 61 vs. 60.  <br />
<br />
If a mob cons light blue, the xp you get for killing it is reduced from it's &quot;normal&quot; value.  Normal in this case being a mob that cons dark blue and is more than 5 levels lower than you.  If the mob is dark blue and 5 levels or less below you, then you get a bonus to xp.  The closer to your level, the higher the bonus and it continues to increase as mobs become even con and higher.<br />
<br />
Every time you level you will get less xp for killing the same mobs as the prior level.  If a mob goes from 5 levels below you to 6 levels below you, the drop may be quite noticeable.  If the mob goes from a dark blue to light blue, it will most definately be very noticeable.  <br />
<br />
The idea being that as you level up, you should be fighting harder mobs since you're gaining in power.  Think of it as incentive to challenge yourself and not bottom feed for xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">2 very nicely written and ACCURATE posts! as far as advice goes pet is HUGE if you solo non pop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I went thru same problem..60 or 61 for AA?  Most of my guild is 52-61 so I have no incentive atm to move further.<br />
<br />
I dinged 61 and LOVE the new pet.....it really is HUGE improvement.  I personally would say ding 61, try the new pet.  If you do not find it helps you you can always unding.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">AA exp seems to be the same no matter your level lvl 61 and up.  But at 62 and up you can go to the 2nd tier planes and make better exp there than the 1st tier at lvl60</div></div><hr />
