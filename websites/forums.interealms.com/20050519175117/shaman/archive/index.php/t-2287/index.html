<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sardak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok.. so some of these questions may be laughable to you experienced shammies out there, but I gotta know :)<br />
<br />
What is a JBB? what does it stand for and what does it do?<br />
<br />
Also.. I'll be starting a new Vah Shir Shaman with a buncha friends of mine who are getting into this game now also. Alahkazams magical realm has lots of armors but is there anything that can be suggested i work towards without having to randomly search those huge lists? Perhaps whats good for level 1-20, 20-30, etc..<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Jaundice Bone Bracer which has a right clickable direct damage spell (winters roar, does 263 damage per cast).<br />
<br />
I would say that ry'gorr armor is the thing you want, its cheap and pretty decent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xhosa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Can the Vah Shir use the JBB ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes Vah Shir can wear the JBB, they can wear all the JB armor. Only thing they can't wear is a Fungi Tunic. <br />
<br />
They can wear a Fungus Patch Vest but can't wear that until 51.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As far as armor progression (assuming you have no or little starting cash) I would suggest:<br />
<br />
Patchwork/Leather while you get started.<br />
<br />
Banded (sells for about 1 platinum piece per point of AC) Banded is respectable up to the 20's (or higher) for a non-twink.<br />
<br />
Ry'Gorr or Totemic around the mid twenties. Totemic can be quested, ry'gorr is very cheap to buy and equally good.<br />
<br />
Jaundiced Bone around mid-30's to 40's. Drops in various Kunark dungeons. Certain pieces are ultra-rare and difficult to get (bracer, chestplate, and greaves) the rest are fairly common.<br />
<br />
Late 40's to 50's you can start to think about Velious quest armor (Thurgadin is probably the easiest to accquire).<br />
<br />
Of course if you have the cash, upgrade to the next teir of armor as soon as you are able.  HP's and AC are very good for a shaman.<br />
<br />
Note: there are hundreds of comparable armor pieces at each level that I listed above. This is just one possible upgrade path. You mileage will vary :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The clickable effects on all of the Jaundice bone are not usable until lvl 45.<br />
<br />
Jarsath Scale is no drop and is found in Karnor's Castle - generally better AC than Totemic, has some wisdom and other stats on it.  As long as you're not rude and obnoxious and dont' get anyone killed tyring to loot it, many people will let you loot it off their fights.</div></div><hr />
