<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, now that kittie shaman spiritstones are in-game, I'm looking to buy one.  There are no GM potters in my guild so I'm going to be contacting tradefolk on my server or in bazaar.<br />
<br />
What's the going rate for Spiritstones on your Servers?  <br />
<br />
I 've seen some Halas spiritstones on sale for 1K but the only Shar Vahl one on Torv. this past week selling for 3K.  <br />
<br />
There cannot be a huge market for them, not that many +50 Vah Shir Shaman on Torv (guessing under 20 of us).<br />
<br />
Any idea what going prices are?  <br />

Uggums seez dat Katstone fer sail in da bizarr fer 2500pp.  Allways da same sellur.  Luks lik hee iz da onlee wun makkin dem.  Nobuddy evvur sels da Swampstone tho.  :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The problem with the spirit stone is it trivials &gt; 250.<br />
<br />
A potter with 250 skill plus geerlok will succeed about half the time.<br />
<br />
Each try takes about 350pp in supplies.<br />
<br />
Each sucess costs another 600 plat in iron oxide (my server's prices) to fire.<br />
<br />
Each failure in the firing process costs you 950 plat. (And you can fail in firing. It's heart breaking).<br />
<br />
So I bet the one selling the grobb stone is trying to get rid of it. 3k is a good price on my server for them, but they are rarely for sale. I only make them, at 222 skill, if you provide all the parts and I do not guarantee any successes. I group with them to let them see the outcome. <br />
<br />
I think most potters do this... you can't skill up well on these babies, so it's &quot;do I like you enough to drop what I am doing and try this horrible combine&quot;.<br />
<br />
For myself, I failed on my first try, succeeded on my second.<br />
<br />
But I really wanted mine.<br />
<br />
My barb friend is on her 15th try with a 215 potter friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the highest i see spirit stones on my server for now are around 3500 EXCEPT one bonehead who is selling the shar vahl ones for 10k. i hate price gougers. get the ingredients together yourself and save a ton of money. iron oxide drops in the hole off random mobs.</div></div><hr />
