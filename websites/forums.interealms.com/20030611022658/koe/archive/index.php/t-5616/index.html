<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Atokal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The Canadian Women's Hockey team acquitted themselves with class determination and an UNBENDING UNYIELDING spirit. Beating not only a great USA team but a very loudly pro American crowd and an incredibly biased referee.  What I found most disappointing was the treatment of the Canadian flag being placed on the American women's dressing room floor, they say it was to remind them of who they were playing and for respect I SAY HANG it on the WALL then.<br />
<br />
Congratulations on a great tournament and GRATS again to the Canadians on an inspiring win.<br />

Cheers</div></div><hr />
