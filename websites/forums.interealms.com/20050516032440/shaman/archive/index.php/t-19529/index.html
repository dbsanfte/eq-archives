<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caelum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not happy with GoD and the fact shaman get NOTHING useful from it?  Sickened by the fact that Paladins out heal us and Rangers out nuke us?<br />
<br />
Don't buy GoD.<br />
<br />
At least LoY and LDON had come useful spells.  GoD is garbage.  So what if your guild does GoD.  Sorry I can't come, GoD had nothing useful for me.  None of the other shaman can come, they didn't buy GoD either.  <br />
<br />
Now suddenly you have a lot of guilds without shaman if they want to raid GoD.  <br />
<br />
Maybe then when it effects EVERYONE will they actually fix us.<br />
<br />
But I doubt it.<br />
<br />
Seriously, for the first time in years, I am actually considering quitting EQ.  It's gotten that bad.  I'm tired of being passed up.</div></div><hr />

You were burned out on shaman 3 months ago according to one of your own posts - way before we had any real inkling into how good or bad GoD would be.  Heck, you only started playing last April. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
If you want to quit, quit.<br />
Most of the rest of us will still be out there slowing in GoD, albeit it will likely STILL be with Turgur's Insects...<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

The new slow looks good.<br />
The new cannibalize looks amazing.<br />
The new dot sucks, I'll admit that.<br />
New AA look ok, everyone is pretty much getting the same stuff.<br />
<br />

Go for it, one less whiner.<br />
<br />
edit:  One last thing: WHY DONT YOU AND EVERY OTHER WHINER OUT THERE WAIT AND SEE WHAT KIND OF CONTENT THERE IS IN GOD BEFORE SAYING IT SUCKS.  There is more to an expansion than AA and spells.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I look forward to this expansion.  I always look forward to new stuff (AND PATCHS WEE! :D)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i did not buy LoY because i saw it as mid lvl content.<br />
<br />
currently lvl 63, and will not buy GoD untill i am lvl 65 (with better gear) and if i think it is worthwhile.<br />
<br />
if you asked me today?  i would say i don't see it being worthwhile to my play style and the shaman improvements.  in 6months i might</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think the best part of GoD is going to be getting VT a few times in a week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, not for me there isn't. I haven't finished the PoP content yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'll probably end up buying GoD for my main account, although the return of Ancient Spells (especially such a needed and intergral spell like the new cannabalize) makes me furious.<br />
<br />
However, I have three accounts. SOE could have made 90 bucks off me for a decent expansion, oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hmm, could any mod take all these whiningpost and merge them or something? search on Dont buy and Dont support SoE or something :p<br />
<br />
lol /agree<br />
<br />
that was my first thought when i saw the topic before I clicked on it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">it's obviously a whine from the title, if you don't like the SOE hate, find another thread</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">do we know for sure that &quot;ancients&quot; will be ancient the same way they were in luclin?  they may be just ancient in name but obtainable fairly easily.</div></div><hr />

Official word is they will be just as rare as the last set of ancients (still missing my ancient poison). It is in some other thread around here but I'm too lazy  :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wouldn't it just be easier at this point to rename this forum &quot;The other Grey&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Actually, they said there would be the return of ancient spells.<br />
<br />
The didn't say if they would be as rare, rarer or more common.</div></div><hr />
