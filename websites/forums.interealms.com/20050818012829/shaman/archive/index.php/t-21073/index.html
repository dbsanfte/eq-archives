<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was thinking about why GoD is not as fun as some of the previous expansions, why I don't just anticipate logging on and hitting an expedition or two. I think I know why I don't like it at least. It's just PoP on mega super steriods. PoP was okay, considering it was the first expansion of it's type. Mobs hit hard as hell, you tried to get singles or got a mezz class. Only the tanks tanked. People died tons but we kind of adjusted. Now with better gear it doesn't seem so bad but still you try and mainly get singles thus making it kinda boring to me. But hey, it was the first expansion of this type. Skipping ahead a couple expansions, we have GoD. Mobs not only hit hard, they DESTROY you if you are not a tank class with 9k+ hps. And even then they lay a beating in fast on tanks. So you HAVE to get singles or die. Or have damn good CC. If you get a roamer in say Vxed and he sneaks up on a caster, it's all over for him and if he latches onto another caster, well he is most likely dead too before you even realize it. This is not really fun to me. I like the chaos of multiple mobs in camp, fighting for your life, but actually having a chance to fight for it. When you lose 2 or 3 of your party in the first 10-15 seconds, it kinda takes the wind out of your sails. They should really tone down the amount mobs hit for down to PoP levels (500ish-700ish) and make them virtually unsplittable so you always get multiples. Bring some survivable chaos back. Another thought I had was ok so they want hard hitting mobs. What about what I said above, but their damage ramps up over time. So they start out hitting 500s but every 10 seconds the damage increases another 100 to a cap of what they hit for now. They would make it interesting and survivable. Mostly you die in the initial onrush before things get controlled so this would give you the window to get things under control yet punish you if you failed to do so relatively quickly. Anyways just some random thoughts I had last night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes Litch, it's interesting how they have in a way once again opened up a knight vs warrior problem. While I do feel for warrior's not feeling useful, the game benefited a lot from sk's and paladins being beefed up to where they could be main tanks, and in GoD it's not as possible for most groups.<br />
<br />
Mainly, GoD was dumb from a business point of view, it had very little for most of its customers. I guess we were supposed to all go roll a berserker twink while the best-equipped folks had fun in GoD.<br />
<br />
I know I'm overstating it a little, it isn't quite that bleak, but it's too much in that direction.<br />
<br />
Most of my 65 friends never go there anymore except when forced to about once a week for a guild raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think one of the biggest problems they have now is a combination of mob damage and charming.  Chanters can put out so much dps now it's rediculous.<br />
<br />
I agree completely with the first post...multi-mob pulls are fun...singles are boring (even if they are &quot;challenging&quot; due to the dps of the mob.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I totaly agree with you Litche,<br />
<br />
Seems like the feed back that came from the fan fair was that &quot;players don't like long fights&quot;.  While lots of 20 minute longs fights are tedious, it seemes to me that the pendulum has swung to the opposite extream, and these crazy dps short fights are also not very fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They're ok fun.<br />
<br />
The problem is, they're not going to be fun if you're not there.  For short fights, our class doesn't need to be there.<br />
<br />
I guess we can always define our roll as putting malos on chanter pets though. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Honestly, they need something in between LDoN Normal and LDoN Hard-Gates. LDoN normal can be FUN when you pull 6 or 7 mobs, but its so trivial that it gets old too fast. LDoN Hard and Gates, on the other hand, force single, as the thread-starter said.<br />
<br />
Where are the zones with 2-3 pulls that hit in the 500s? Stuff thats dangerous if you dont lock it down, but still doable, and doable a number of different ways (Tank mezz, Chanter mezz, Caster Root, etc etc). THIS is where the fun 1-group stuff is, not 1K hitters than are half dead before slow lands and wipe out half your group in 10 seconds if you get an add. <br />
<br />
I gotta wonder . . . are they chasing us out? Shaman arent the only ones with problems in Gates. The spell situation there is utterly ridiculous. Do they WANT us all to be &quot;ready to quit when EQ2 hits the stands&quot;? If this is their market strategy, they are REALLY not too smart, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For fun and decent xp, we've been doing CoD lately.  I usually pull with my warrior, so it's often 2-3+ mobs at a time - all in the 300 to 600 hit range.  It's been good practice for everyone on handling several mobs in camp at once...and they hit hard enough that they can still cause real problems if you're not careful - at least for a grp of non-EP geared 65's.<br />
<br />
Note:  CoD can be a boring camp, so you need to conciously pull agressively to make it challenging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Blazz:<br />
<br />
I totally agree, re:  something between LDoN Normal and LDoN Hard.<br />
<br />
LDoN Normals are becoming almost trivial.  Wait, they are trivial.  There should be something more, maybe a sliding scale from 1 - 10 where 1 is what the current LDoN Normal is and 10 is where LDoN High Risk is now.  This can't be hard . . . can it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yes, yes, yes ... an LDON Medium setting would be perfect. LDON Normals are trivial to the point where they're not fun. You're just grinding points. Even on a multi-pull, it's trivial, and is hardly a challenge. LDON Hards, on the other hand, are by no means trivial for me (at least not yet, heh). But they force single-pulls, and they're simply boring. I'm no dev, but if they can toss together such a poorly-thought-out expansion as Gates, they might could toss together some Medium adventures for us to experiment with.<br />
<br />
My ideal Medium? Put in a mix of slowables and partial mitigaters ... mix them so some trash and named are DB and some con even ... make some unmezzable, etc. etc. Put mob damage in the 500-600 range as Blazz suggested. <br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">One thing about medium ldon's is they would have to create a drop table that's a reasonable midpoint between normal and hard.  No idea how hard this would be, but I can see it being difficult when you have to consider the long term game impact in terms of balance and the other ldon level types.  (i.e.:  you don't want everyone to quit doing normal/hard adventures and just do mediums)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, I think the real problem is that the difference in difficulty between Normal and High Risk changes over levels.<br />
<br />
Having basically LDoN'ed my Shaman from 30 - 50 I can remember the &quot;normal&quot; LDoN's being quite challenging early, but as I got higher in level, they became more and more trivial.  Not sure if this is actually true or not, I am simply relating what my experience seems to bear out.<br />
<br />
As far as the loot goes, d#&amp;$, I think that needs to be looked at anyway.  When my L59 Shaman is getting +Mana/HP rings (Band of Bloodguard Assasin for instance) for killing Named something is wrong.  Dreadfully wrong.<br />
<br />
I think a new setting should be rather easy to do.  The hard part was creating the themes and coding instanced dungeons . . . we're just asking for a different set of mob / loot tables.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">One thing about medium ldon's is they would have to create a drop table that's a reasonable midpoint between normal and hard.

<br />
Honestly, I dont see this being a problem. Lets take boots. You have those Blood ones with 40 hps, and Aged Mystic with 90. Thinking there is a middle there. <br />
<br />
Pointwise, normal is 51, Hard is 104, gee, not rocket science. <br />
<br />
Normals take 30-40 mins average (yeah yeah, dont wanna hear about your 17 minute collect 23 with 5 wizards and a druid, ok?), Hards average about an hour, hmm, think we can find some compromise in between eh (this is in reference to the kills/minute on slaughter and drop/minute on collects average here, does anyone even bother with Rescue or Assasainate anymore?)<br />
<br />
Heck, if they wanted, they could just put the same loots on the Mediums, just make the Hard loots the rares, and the normal loots the commons. 1 in 30 runs you get Aged Mystic boots? Seems reasonable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Honestly, I don't even care about the loots.  It amazes me how long people will wait around camps for everyone to zone back to the merchant and sell and split just to get their 80pp or whatever.  At 65 at least, it seems ridiculous.<br />
<br />
I don't really mind the supposed triviality of normals, either.  It just means you can goof off a little bit more and do stupid things like overpull for fun and see if you all can handle it.  <br />
<br />
But, I wouldn't mind a medium setting, too.  Sometimes I have a group I wouldn't consider a hard with, but that I think could romp normals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You know something is wrong when people still prefer to exp in BoT.<br />

<br />
Aint that the truth. The thing about SOE having a tough time making a new loot table, is probably not that accurate. To be honest, I don't know how hard they work at making loot tables at all. Add hp, add mana, make items more uber, make the game worse, they all run into the same thing for SOE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The problem with that comparison, is that I know people (and am one) who insist that LoY was a damned good expansion, for a grand total of five zones, anyway... it's nice challenging content with good rewards for it's target levels.<br />
<br />
Now, reading the original post, an allusion popped into my head... EQ is quickly reaching the point where mobs are so lethal and gear so insane that an encounter is decided by a coin toss, rather than skill. It's pure luck of the draw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">One of the reasons the hoards stay in PoP is because PoP is now trivial. Go to BoT, sit at a camp for several hours. Occasionally things might go a little wrong, but then you zone back in (having bound in PoT of course), invis up and head back to rez, or get someone in your group to drag your corpses to the nearest cleric if you don't have one.<br />
<br />
GoD is not easy, it's not trivial. The mobs hit hard, yes, but moreover it's a pain in the arse to CR in. Even if you've bound as close as you can, you're talking several zones of running (past occasional see invis mobs) to get to your corpses. The cleric has to somehow get hold of lev and invis on the way back. If you've wiped in a trial, you'll often have to restart the trial, or find a rogue or necro/SK to go in and help out.<br />
<br />
This is why people don't go to GoD. It's a pain, and they're used to the easy levelling route.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">This is why people don't go to GoD. It's a pain, and they're used to the easy levelling route.<br />
<br />
SPOILED is what I call it.<br />
<br />
Super easy XP. Graveyards. All the zones within 1 zone of each other.<br />
<br />
Spoiled, plain and simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">PoP didn't have the best design...<br />
<br />
But GoD is hardly an improvement. So glad I didn't buy that POS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">PoP didn't have the best design....<br />
<br />
PoP dumbed down the game to the lowest common denomiator, Gates has jacked that back up to Veliuos level, where you had to run a bit to get to ToV, or invis into the Arena, or find the right strat for Vindi, etc etc etc. PoP put the entire world of the game 1 click away. It gave us &quot;Win by Sheer Numbers&quot;. It put XP at a level where grinding dindt seem as tedious. It created a massive gap between the hardcore and the casual, both in gear and avaiolable zones. <br />
<br />
I am not saying all these things are bad, just pointing out the things that PoP brought to the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hmm the term Pop dumbing down the game suggests that there was something challenging mentally in the first place when this is not the case. I think it robbed the game of the largeness and the feel of the game. It also made more of a pronounced division of the game, and too readily rewarded the raiders. The zone design was also cheapened compared to the rest of the game. And although the exp rate was much nicer and much more fair, I think that it made it too necessary to hunt in pop for exp. You can't really blame SoE that much though, I think they were confused as much as anyone at that time about the appeal of the game and where to progress the game for the most revenue which was a risk/venture. They made mistakes which are irreversible in the scheme of things, and some misforesights- Pop was designed for 60 people apparently and not as many as it turned out to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The problem with GoD is that if you never did some time in Time, you might not be LFG in KT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I guess what you mean by that is that to move to GoD you needed to get equipped properly for it by going through a keyed/flagged zone, that being Time. So, non-time-flagged people are shut out in GoD due to being undergeared just like people were shut out of Time by not being flagged?<br />
<br />
I guess so.  <br />
<br />
To be fair, the design of the game is that without high level gear, you're not ready to handle high level GoD zones anyway, so what's the difference if you can't get into high zones that would just wipe you out anyway?  There wouldn't be any point to your getting in them anyway.<br />
<br />
But that doesn't address a feeling of being excluded, perhaps.   <br />
<br />
Which means, if you want to get into high level GoD, you would want an alternative to going through Plane of Time or, by extrapolation, any zone or series of zones that required flags that are hard to get.<br />
<br />
I'm not a fan of flags, myself.  You didn't need any flags to get into Guk, or HoT or NTOV, or Ssra,  or Kael.  The keys to get into Sebilis and HS were pretty trivial.  And those expansions are still probably regarded by a lot of people who actually were around back then as the high points of EQ's game design.<br />
<br />
The game has put in place starting with PoP huge roadblocks in the form of flags which cannot be done without large numbers of people.  The keys you needed to get to sleepers or veeshan's peak or HS or Sebilis, contrarily, were individual efforts or could be done by smallish numbers.  The game became Raid or Die, and not just for goodies -- for the permission to even get near the goodies.  And there are alternatives; the same ones that worked in the past.<br />
<br />
It would be nice if you could slowly work your way up to high level gear and spells and abilities the old fashioned way again, just with you and some friends, or you and a fairly casual guild.  Doing everything 72 people at a time and more can be a stultifying, uncreative routine.<br />
<br />
It would be nice if some creativity came back into the game such that there was really more than one way to play without getting left so distantly behind.<br />
<br />
And gear inflation ratcheted up so insanely in PoP as a result of those flags, that the disparity between the hard core and the people who just want to play a game at their own pace with other people of like mind has become way too glaring, making people more unhappy than they have to be.  People play the game to get improvement, but they don't need to get gear that diverges insanely in utility from one expansion to the next.  Ornate gear having 100 hitpoints less than elemental gear is swell enough for the elemental folks, but really, they would have been absolutely thrilled with far, far smaller leaps too.  <br />
<br />
The game has become near incoherent because it's hard to design for, say, warriors that are both 6k and 12k at the same time.  The bright glittery candy of upgrading 100 hp at a time may enrapture players like shiny car keys amaze your cat, but really, games like this just need to give people the feeling that they are progressing while having challenges, not that they are hitting the lottery.  And when nobody is hitting the lottery, the vast majority of players who come nowhere near the lottery don't feel like they are so impossibly far behind they will never conceivably catch up.  Slow and steady wins the race would be a far better conception of how you keep players going and interested in gear and playing than making some strike it rich and the others go suck an egg.<br />
<br />
Even if a lack of understanding makes Sony unbalance their game by creating a gaping disparity between the equipment levels of even the dumbest hard core raider and the cleverest player who doesn't want to be part of a 72-player zergfest every night, they could still not compound the problems for the casual gamer by forcing them to either accept a single style of gameplay or accept no real advancement at all, even including the ability to see just for a moment the majority of zones in expansions they pay for.  Sony could make alternative ways to do things, like they did with the quests that let you get into tactics for experience, and COD, etc.  Or they could just add a lot more content into the game so the casual player could finally play just as big a game as the hard core raider.   Or so the hard core player who didn't want to get wrapped up in a hard core guild could just do things with small groups of friends, people met at random.<br />
<br />
My way or the highway is kind of the way things stand now.  Yes, you won't get into high end GoD if you haven't been through plane of time first, or if you do, you won't have the gear to survive there anyway.  It would be nice if people would buy the game and find that it was really like stepping into a big wide world with many ways of doing things and plenty of rewards for pretty much all of them, depending on how hard you worked and how clever you were, instead of being funneled down a narrow chute if you wanted to get anywhere at all.<br />
<br />
There definitely should be more than one way to do things in a game.  It being a game, and all.</div></div><hr />

BlargX, you are the man.  I couldn't say it better myself- I really wish we could progress on single group content no matter how long it takes and wind up the same as the raider at the end of the day.<br />
<br />
Pointwise, normal is 51, Hard is 104<br />
I like LDoN, but this is still a gripe of mine.  We're at the point now where we win normals w/ no healer.  We're at the point yet on hards where we fail:win about 4:1.  We basically look at hards as a chance to go after nameds for upgrades and normals as farming points.  The fact that a hard only gives you 2x the points of a normal for about 4x the difficulty is ludicrous.  It's sad when the PoTime+ guilds on my server grind their points in normals because it's more efficient than hards, and they're the crowd the hards were aimed at in the first place.<br />
<br />
In my world: 51 pts for L65 normal win, 205 pts for L65 hard win to reflect the difficulty.  This will happen the same time they finally let you choose your adventure type instead of having to try again and again and again to get that collect adventure, ie, never.<br />
<br />
Edit: alternative to upping the points for a hard win is to up the time to 2 hours at least, ideally 2.5 hours.  W/ as often as we wipe 90 mins is not even close.  Gotta love the 6.5k tank eating double 990's, yeah, that's certainly only worth 104 points.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Qinimi Ferubi Barindu sewers riwwi and vxed all need to be easier... instead of mobs hitting for 1200 they need to hit for 900 and so forth.  Basically 90% of eq's population has NO REASON AT ALL to go to god.  I have had guildies on a failed god mission for the 6th time pull the plug on their computer and delete eq.  its f**ked up to see that happen.  Give people a reason to go to these zones.  Make experience worth while... atm its not even good enough to justify going if mobs hit for 300.  The drops are nice.  Basically leave the ultra raid content for uber guilds, but give the rest of eq a reason to go there.  This is the worst expansion in eq's history.  Even LOY for being the craphole it is was at least cheap and not portrayed as a full expansion.  <br />
<br />
Sony devs i hope to god you read this.  I know im speaking to a wall but you should allowed for regular people to go there.  Put content thats fun and fairly challenging for the non ubar people.  Give reward and they will come.  But leave in place the high end content.  Right now god is a cluster f**k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Couple things:<br />
<br />
First off, Qinimi and Ferubi are a joke, Tactics nameds are harder.<br />
<br />
Second, Veeshens Peak key was FAR FAR from trivial, even well into Luclin (2 FULL expansions later). You still needed to kill a nasty dragon DEEP inside a large unfriendly zone where most of the mobs are still dark-blue to a 65. VP started the seperation. NToV and HoT continued the trend (not key-wise, but content wise. You just didnt bring a single group there). Then came Ssra and VT, the Emp and the Candyland. SOE merely expanded on this &quot;already in place&quot; system with POP. <br />
<br />
My solution? Open up VP. Open up VT. Open up Sol Ro. Open up the EPs. Make them keyable with a single group of fairly competent 65s (like OS and HS). I am ALL in favor of this, honestly, even though I am one of the ones who did them all &quot;the hard way(?)&quot; if you could call it that. <br />
<br />
Blarg, outstanding post, though. I agree that there SHOULD be a way for casual players to advance, especially after a new expansion hits. Gates has SOME content with upgrades, but not nearly enough. Opening up some other possibilities would help a ton. If they want to continue to keep the casual players paying, they need to start adding content for them. If that means opening up zones already in the game, so be it. Seems like an easy way to keep a large section of the game playing (and paying)</div></div><hr />

I agree about the EPs having issues with single groups potentially messing up raids, but I dont think it will be a MASSIVE problem. There is some damn good 1-group loot dropping in the EPs, the FT3 belt, class pet weapons, nice weapons and shield in Water, mini-minis in Earth have good stuff (FT2 ring, 100 hp/mana cloak, etc). Those mobs arent automatic either, they can get hectic if you get adds or a resist. But casuals SHOULD be able to have a shot at these, maybe not this minute, but certainly before the end of the summer. <br />
<br />
My suggestion. Difficult yet doable quests similar to the Tactics backdoor flag. Sol Ro now, EPs in September. Small guilds could do Sol Ro minis for decent drops. Ornate would flow better and start coming down in price for the &quot;even more casual than casual&quot; players, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Otoole Frostypants</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Sony could make alternative ways to do things, like they did with the quests that let you get into tactics for experience, and COD, etc. Or they could just add a lot more content into the game so the casual player could finally play just as big a game as the hard core raider. Or so the hard core player who didn't want to get wrapped up in a hard core guild could just do things with small groups of friends, people met at random.<br />
<br />
If this were to be implemented...wouldn't those paths be overrun by the hardcore? What I mean is, if there is an &quot;easier&quot; (relative term) path to gain the items then raiding, don't you think the raiders will opt for that plan instead? How do the casuals benefit, then? Do all such &quot;options&quot; have to be instanced zones so that there aren't arguments about KSing and who &quot;owns&quot; which camp?<br />
<br />
I'm serious when I ask these things. Do you think the &quot;hardcore&quot; player is going to remain in the hardest path to upgrade if relatively similar items are available for an &quot;easier&quot; method of obtaining them? I'm not certain that they will. I think the casuals will just see more people in &quot;their area&quot; and now they can't get where they want because the round the clockers just keep the spawns under their control. Didn't that already exist before in EQ?<br />
<br />
I really wish we could progress on single group content no matter how long it takes and wind up the same as the raider at the end of the day.<br />
<br />
But that's just it! If it all pans out as the same in the end....there will be NO RAIDERS. Everyone...and I mean everyone, will just get their gear doing it that way. Why sit on a 40 - 65 person raid to have some &quot;other guy&quot; get the upgrade you were hoping for when you can increase your chances exponentially by remaining in 6 -12 person content for a SIMILAR item?<br />
<br />
Do you understand what I'm asking? Do you really think the raiders will remain in their nightly raid mode with such an exact match to what they doggedly achieve now?<br />
<br />
It's sad when the PoTime+ guilds on my server grind their points in normals because it's more efficient than hards, and they're the crowd the hards were aimed at in the first place.<br />
<br />
OK! Now we're getting somewhere...<br />
<br />
This is what I'm talking about. You notice that the hards were aimed at the &quot;hardcore&quot; players and they don't do it because it's.....EASIER....to do it via the &quot;normals&quot; path. Such will be the case if the item drops remain &quot;doable&quot; by less than 40 players but are close to equal in benefit obtained by 6 - 12 players. People gravitate, quite naturally, to the path of least resistance.<br />
<br />
In my world: 51 pts for L65 normal win, 205 pts for L65 hard win to reflect the difficulty. This will happen the same time they finally let you choose your adventure type instead of having to try again and again and again to get that collect adventure, ie, never.<br />
<br />
I don't know that this would &quot;fix&quot; the problem with the hardcore players doing normals to farm the points. Why would they still want the hard for the &quot;possibility&quot; of 205 points with a certain risk factor when they can ASSURE themselves 51 points with no risk in very little time? Maybe over the course of the added minutes it would look good on paper, but in the reality of the situation, a LOSS in a hard = wasted time in their mind. Better to take a few extra minutes &quot;nickel and dime&quot;-ing your way up to 205 points with certain success than trying for the same with possible failure.<br />
<br />
My solution? Open up VP. Open up VT. Open up Sol Ro. Open up the EPs. Make them keyable with a single group of fairly competent 65s (like OS and HS). I am ALL in favor of this, honestly, even though I am one of the ones who did them all &quot;the hard way(?)&quot; if you could call it that. <br />
<br />
I'm in favor of that, too. However...as per usual, people will STILL complain because it's not &quot;Time quality&quot; uber loot. I don't have ONE PIECE from Vex Thal and yet people call that loot &quot;crap&quot;? It's not crap to me...cuz I don't have any of it. It's an UPGRADE for me. :)<br />
<br />
Case in point: I went with a guild into NToV (about 3 1/2 groups of folks). They brought their twinks to gear them up because their mains are elementally flagged and working toward getting into Time. I'm along for the fun because I didn't get to do a lot of NToV content before I took a break from the game. NToV loot is &quot;twink loot&quot; to these folks. It was a shiny new toy for me--a main. Is it &quot;Time quality&quot;? No way. But it's better than what I had when I went in, so who am I to complain? I was actually pleased to get 2 new items.<br />
<br />
I don't think it's the CONTENT that is the real problem, here. It's the attitudes of the players that's the issue. If the zones that were once &quot;closed off&quot; are opened, it's still not good enough for &quot;some&quot; (a relative number) people because the loot isn't &quot;the highest end&quot;. It wasn't that long ago that someone who hasn't even been into Vex Thal yet called that loot &quot;crap&quot; because that individual was comparing it to PoTime loot. Where does the dissatisfaction end?<br />
<br />
I honestly think that game manufacturers are damned if they do, damned if they don't.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Otoole:  there would still be raids.<br />
<br />
The system should be thusly:  raiders get loot, casuals get content.<br />
<br />
You raid to get the loot.  The casuals do the quests for alternate entry for access to the zone.  Yes, they get access to any mob they can conceivably one-group, but do you see a single group in an elemental plane taking down a raid mob for uber loot?<br />
<br />
Besides, raiders would raid because they like to raid.<br />
<br />
It works just thusly in Tactics.  People who did the PoStorms alt quest do Tactics for xp and some attainable loot (the piggy, for example), while raiders go in to kill the Zeks.<br />
<br />
Yes, people who are alt-flagged for Tactics can go on the raids to kill the Zeks, but it should not be that way in the EPs.  They should code the alt keys so people who gained access to the plane via the alt method cannot zone into &quot;b&quot; planes, and cannot join a raid.  They can just set up what they have for Nagy and Vox:  if you're not fully flagged, the raid mobs banish you to the zone border if you get too close to them.  They can set it up so even a raid mob's CORPSE banishes you, so you can't ninja loot gear off raids.<br />
<br />
Another option is an &quot;Elemental Lite&quot; option, a different instance of Elemental planes that lack all raid content, which you gain entry to by doing the alternate quest.  Yes, SoE would have to put more servers on the system to accommodate the new set of elemental zones, but that completely separates the &quot;raider&quot; from the &quot;casual&quot; in the EPs but gives everyone access to the same content--the same zones.  They can easily code the game so it checks your flag when you zone in.  If you have the &quot;raid&quot; flag, or you're in a raid full of flagged people via the normal &quot;back door&quot; method, you get into the normal plane.  If you have the &quot;alt&quot; flag, you go to the alternate instance.  The alternate instance has everything that the normal instance has except full-blown raid targets and raid triggers.  Minis that can be one-grouped would be there, but not raid mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Binter, that's not what was being addressed. It's kind of important to see the quote before my response to understand why I'm stating things the way that I do. Izmalis is the person who stated the following quote:<br />
<br />
I really wish we could progress on single group content no matter how long it takes and wind up the same as the raider at the end of the day.<br />
<br />
Izmalis wants to end up the same as the raider. If Izmalis can end up &quot;the same&quot; by taking the casual path, why would the raider bother to raid? That's my point! :)<br />
<br />
Yes, they get access to any mob they can conceivably one-group, but do you see a single group in an elemental plane taking down a raid mob for uber loot?<br />
<br />
Not yet, no. Maybe in another expansion or two we could see something close to that, though... :)<br />
<br />
Besides, raiders would raid because they like to raid.<br />
<br />
Raiders will no longer like raiding if they can get the SAME (or similiar) LOOT by not raiding. Raiders raid because the reward for raiding makes raiding worthwhile. If the reward for not raiding is the same or similar for raiding, raiding will disappear.<br />
<br />
It works just thusly in Tactics. People who did the PoStorms alt quest do Tactics for xp and some attainable loot (the piggy, for example), while raiders go in to kill the Zeks.<br />
<br />
Does the piggy ever drop the Blade of War? Not according to Allakhazam's. However, the raider has a chance at receiving the BoW because they do RZtW. According to the request of Izmalis, who wants to be THE SAME AS THE RAIDER at the end of the day, his casual groups should have a shot at a BoW, or something close to it, in order to be THE SAME. The piglet drops the War Marshall's Bladed Staff which is not the same or similar as RZtW's 2HS drop. This is the issue that is brought up time and again and THIS is the issue I am addressing with my comments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Ive enjoyed every bit of time Ive spent in GoD (except the graphics issues Ive had).  I mostly like the challenge of it all, its taken some adjustments on how my groups have done things as we arent uber, very casual guild (if you look at my magelos and say he is doing fine or great, Im one of the best equipped players in the guild) but we have adjusted and been successful at xping in Ferubi and trials 1-4 so far (including farming the Fly).  As an example to the original posters complaint, that includes things like having a group member watch everyones back so they arent cut down before anyone notices a wanderer in camp.<br />
<br />
It is difficult to get others there though (we just became Elemental a few months ago and havent explored it enough yet) and I much prefer the option of going to zones even if I shouldnt be there rather than all the trials and locked zones.  I almost feel like Ive run out of content in GoD and wont be able to go much further at this point and I would like to see more, a lot more.  But PoP started for us this way as well and it took a while, but we are only locked out of Time now, so I figure itll just take us a while before we can go more/most places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Elharina Lokhem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">One thing always gets me with this issue<br />
<br />
But that's just it! If it all pans out as the same in the end....there will be NO RAIDERS. Everyone...and I mean everyone, will just get their gear doing it that way. Why sit on a 40 - 65 person raid to have some &quot;other guy&quot; get the upgrade you were hoping for when you can increase your chances exponentially by remaining in 6 -12 person content for a SIMILAR item? <br />
<br />
To me this is a game, a hobby something to do when I'm not working to earn the money to live. I always assumed that those who raided chose to raid because it is the way they enjoyed playing the game, whereas those who grouped and at most stuck to small groups played that way because it was the method they chose to enjopy their recreational time in EQ.<br />
<br />
I used to raid, and have no problem with their being something of a gap between raid gear and non raid gear, raiding does in general take more time and dedication and that should have it's dividends, however the gulf that has formed currently is simply too great to my mind. It has resulted in many perfectly good zones being inaccessible for no other reason that unless you are extremely well equppied (and that really means raid equpiied I guess a gazillion LDoN points could get close tho) there is no way on earth that you are going to survive the encounter. Your tank will get one rounded, your dps will be under half that which would be required, your healer will run oom, you know the stuff.<br />
<br />
Now if my assumption was right that people actualyl play this game mainly to enjoy themselves (and I hope to god I am) then if there are two routes to the upper end of the game (one providing a better reward albeit) then will raiding really die a death, I can't see it honestly. Make sure the 1-2 group stuff is good and challenging and require damn fine play, give the raiders their extra glory but the game should end up with for 90% of zones all players of the required level (and advancement grouped or raided) could experience.<br />
<br />
I actually rather like a lot of GoD the bits I have experienced have been challenging to say the least, I love the look of the zones and mobs too, I just wish there was a way without doing the whole POP thing (which I haven't the inclination to do not actually enjoying the huge raid thang anymore) that I could experience more of it.</div></div><hr />

I am not suggesting that Sol Ro and the EPs be &quot;opened&quot; like BoT, no way. A quest, harder than the Tactics back-door, yet still doable by a single group. This would weed out a lot of the BoTers, trust me. You dont see anywhere NEAR as much of that crap in Tactics, at least not on my server. <br />
<br />
My whole point here is to give casual players a shot at upgrades they NEED to be semi-functional in Gates. Contrary to statements like this . . .<br />
<br />
Yes, they get access to any mob they can conceivably one-group, but do you see a single group in an elemental plane taking down a raid mob for uber loot?<br />
<br />
. . . there is a LOT of one-group camping in the EPs. Fire has a belt as good as the one off VZ, a &quot;raid&quot; mob. Many of the one groupable weapons are as good or better than the lower PoP boss drops. Heck, there is a whole post on One Grouping PoW: <br />
<br />
http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=18718<br />
<br />
Other zones have similar one-groupable situations. My guildmates clear crap in the first yard in Fire quite often, to get the FT3 belt guys to spawn. Since they fixed the Pris Gator spawn, I cant get the rangers to leave Earth. <br />
<br />
This isnt rocket science. I think there needs to be a bridge for the casual players between PoP-LDoN and Gates. Time will never be opened. Neither will VT, VP or ST. Ornate is so substandard compared to what is basically &quot;standard issue&quot; for middle-Gates that its a joke. LDoN helps, but its not enough.<br />
<br />
I dont want this content opened too soon after the next expansion, but it SHOULD be opened in some fashion. Especially if they wish the casual players to continue to play this game. As it stands, the wall is MUCH MUCH closer to the casuals than it is to even the &quot;casual-raider&quot; type people that only raid a couple times a week. Once they hit that wall, why should they continue? LDoN gets old kinda fast. It just makes sense. A nice, long, difficult quest, you get Sol Ro. Another similar quest, that includes Sol Ro-only loot, and you get Air, Water and Earth. Another quest, with drops from all, and you get Fire. In order to ever enter Time, you MUST be fully flagged for all zones. I seriously doubt this would hurt the overall server populations in any way. Raid mobs are still raid mobs, and still have the BEST of the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">&quot;If this were to be implemented...wouldn't those paths be overrun by the hardcore? &quot;<br />
<br />
Doubt it.  Two reasons.  One, the hard core raider is busy raiding.  Second, it's not worth his while.<br />
<br />
For instance, some examples of the kind of loot we might expect on alternative paths to advancement that don't involve big raids and big guilds -- the FT2 rings and the 100 HP cloaks that drop off earth one-groupable nameds.  Well, I got my ring and it's lore.  I got the cloak just to have a disease resist on my back, but wouldn't have camped it just for that, and wouldn't care if I got it or not.  Same with everyone I group with.  How about the POF mini-nameds?  A regen2 ring dropped the other day, but I didn't even bother rolling.  FT3 belt?  I have better.  POW stuff? Everyone hates POW.  POA? Almost never done with a single group on my server; pretty much a raid-only zone.<br />
<br />
There's just not a lot of stuff that casual players would want that the raider feels he just has to have.  Most of it is lore and of lesser value than what a hard core raider will have himself or will get very soon, so it's not compelling to swamp the easier stuff for the most part.  For instance, I don't get terribly excited about this stuff, and I'm in full ornate, hardly uber, though I definitely am a hard core raider.  <br />
<br />
You'd think the exceptional stuff might make the difference -- sharkspine club, pet swarm weapons -- but it doesn't, not on my server.  That stuff remains completely uncamped.  People just mostly experience in POE and get their loots on raids.<br />
<br />
How about ornate?  Got it, and everyone I know pretty much has ornate or better.  EVERYONE hates BOT, and they already have their chance to go there.  That's a good example -- nobody I know wants to go there if they can possibly help it.  Sol Ro for ornate or the minis?  It's there, but not exactly swamped. Pretty empty really.<br />
<br />
Uber people doing GoD right now are letting Vxed and Tipt loot rot -- stuff that would be huge upgrades to people who are not raiders.  If they're letting it rot now, why would they go and try to get more of it in the limited time they have outside of raiding?  When they get past Vxed/Tipt, the gear becomes even better.<br />
<br />
Sure, there are twinks, but the hard core raider twinks his guys with elemental gear or even time gear and GoD gear that's rotting in the course of regular raids and groups.  Or he finds ornate cheap enough that he can just buy as much as he wants.  He really doesn't need to go hang around what to him are &quot;lowbie&quot; zones at all.  <br />
<br />
What's a waste of an uber's or hard core raider's time is a boon to the guy just can't raid or doesn't want to be pigeonholed into that one and only way of playing.<br />
<br />
If they made 40 more zones with 100 more FT3 belts and the like -- I wouldn't care.  And I'm so uber I don't even have one piece of elemental that fits in an ornate slot.  And if they made 10 more zones that dropped elemental-level gear -- I work full time and raid most of the rest of the time.  I'm getting that level of gear(or better) anyway sooner or later, and don't have the time to run around looking for more.<br />
<br />
Besides, it only needs to be possible to get decent gear via not raiding, not easy.  Mini-nameds that can be spawned or spawn randomly, mini-events like the piglet stampede in tactics, mobs that could be triggered via quests -- there are many ways to get mobs and loot into the game besides large raids, and neither the mobs nor getting the loot off of them have to be particularly easy to get -- they just have to be _possible_ to get and not a gigantic timesink, to be a fun, workable option.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Otoole, you provide a perfect foil for my argument...  <br />
<br />
So basically you're saying people won't raid if they can upgrade via the casual path?  Or conversely, are you saying why would the casual play if they are forced to raid?  Or wait, wait, wait- are you saying the game would naturally force people into one and only one playstyle?  Well, then, seems to me if you don't like it you shouldn't play EQ then, eh?  Or leave your raid guild and join a solid group of friends if you want the best gear and to access all the content in the game.  Hey, if you have too much time to play or you don't like being forced into the casual playstyle TOO BAD.<br />
<br />
Hahahahaha, I have to stop, I'm choking on the irony, I can't take it.  There is nothing funnier than hearing raiders use the very arguments casuals have been making for years to describe the horrors of a game that forces you into a single playstyle to progress.  Too delicious.<br />
<br />
But let's have more fun: I've taken a bunch of your quotes from your last two posts and reversed &quot;casual&quot; and &quot;raider&quot; where applicable to further prove the insupportability of the point of &quot;Forced into one playstyle (raiding) = good, Forced into one playstyle (single group) = bad&quot;. Enjoy:<br />
<br />
<br />
If a raider can end up &quot;the same&quot; by taking the raid path, why would the casual bother to play? That's my point! :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Casuals will no longer like playing if they can get the SAME (or similiar) LOOT by raiding. Casuals play because the reward for casual play makes playing worthwhile. If the reward for raiding is the same or similar for casual play, casuals will disappear.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you think the &quot;casual&quot; player is going to remain in the hardest path to upgrade if relatively similar items are available for an &quot;easier&quot; method of obtaining them (raiding)?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If it all pans out as the same in the end....there will be NO CASUALS. Everyone...and I mean everyone, will just get their gear doing it that way. Why sit in a 6 person group to get the upgrade you were hoping for when you can increase your chances exponentially by raiding content for a BETTER item?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">By the way, I neglected to mention or maybe emphasize properly -- I think raiding is &quot;easier&quot; than doing tough single groups.  Raiders trying to opt for &quot;easier&quot; things usually find they are not easier at all.  Sharkspine club and pet swarm swords are great examples.  &quot;It's too hard!&quot; is the refrain.  All you have to do for a raid is show up and don't screw up too noticeably.  And, sooner or later, you will get your loot.  Heck, good attendance can be the biggest determiner for a lot of people of how much loot they get as raiders.<br />
<br />
In single groups, it doesn't work that way.  You have to do things right, and nobody is there to cover your butt or put blame on if things don't work out.<br />
<br />
I don't at all think raiding is any harder when it comes to getting loot.  Not for most of the people there, most of the time.  <br />
<br />
Heck, except for a few key players, like the main tanks for instance, you don't even need as much AA to be productive.  There are plenty of low AA players in many guilds doing elemental planes and time, but you don't want a tank without his defensive AA's tanking mini-nameds for you (or even much of anything anywhere) in even moderately tough single group content.<br />
<br />
Most raiders I know are like most any other players I know -- fairly chicken and conservative.  Aside from the loose cannons who will try to drag people on suicide runs, they don't like taking reasoned chances that require skill and concentration -- at least, not when not backed up by 70 friends.  Almost everybody who is not raiding that I know tends to experience in one place -- Plane of Earth.  That's it.  <br />

No, the raiders aren't about to swamp tough single group content anytime soon.  They're not swamping it even now; they would be even less visible doing so if the amount of it were drastically increased.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">GoD is definitely a very challenging environment, and can be frustrating even to the well equipped player, especially if shaman are asked to heal.  Progression is mainly single group based (at least as far as we have seen so far), and doesn't have any prerequisites.  Drops in Kod Taz are time level, so even casual players can reach this with a dedicated group.  But you need to be dedicated, while you don't have to raid for 5 nights a week you need to be willing to put in 4 h for most trials. If you compare that to the progression in previous expansions, GoD is actually less geared towards raiding then Velious, Luclin or PoP.  There was basically no single group content in the higher level zones.<br />
One problem is that too many people are 65, and there needs to be some way to separate the people from preventing everyone to congregate in THE zone.  GoD makes progression gear dependent instead of the often maligned keys and flags - and the casual players still don't like it.  Sorry, some kind of effort is required to reach the top in this game.<br />
Opening the elemental planes would be useless for the casual player, they couldn't kill the mobs that drop elemental gear in the first place, since those are raid kills, at least at the beginning.  You do not fight a mob with a 2000 dmg AoE with some random group wearing ornate.  And, at least on our server, 10 guilds are EP flagged, meaning 700 odd players are allready trying to cramp into 4 zones for experience.  Combine that with 4 guilds in time, and it becomes rather difficult to get your weekly clearing in, making me thanksful for some new uncrowded zones.<br />
Now I aggree that GoD has very little to offer to the low level player, but then, LoY was a washout for the top levels.  You can't make everyone happy with every expansion.<br />
What disappoints me in GoD are the very limited loot tables.  Bloodlink Chainmails are going to alts and apps, ranger swords rot, but 3/4 of the raid has to fight over the few all/all pieces.  But since these are Quarm level, we still run the same ikkinz raids over and over.  Maybe Uqua will improve on that, but they should have realy put more variety on the mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I'm not so sure I'd like the elemental planes opened, but I do think there should just be more content, period, for non-raiders, that gives reasonable upgrades and solves the whopping loot disparity that has made differences between level 65's by this point absurd.  Elemental level zones, at least, but not necessarily elementals.  Nothing wrong with reserving something for people who have earned it -- unless you have basically zip for people who can't play the raid style game.  Which is basically where we're at right now.  We need a parallel track.  <br />
<br />
GoD is ok, but if even time-geared people are mostly getting through by having multiple healers and/or chanter pets, it's not really a viable route for people with far lesser gear.  That's more a problem with GoD's treatment of players than anything; the fundamental idea of GoD could work if it had an equal place for all classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Oops this thread has derailed onto that other argument again. I just want to add this, when I played I was both a casual and a raider. When i raided the most annoying component of it was consistently backflagging, it was not rewarding and was a complete pain in the ass. Sure the end result is raiding places like plane of Time and getting the better loots, however the way SoE did it turned out to make flagging work. So while the concept of working for flags may seem absurd it was so. Again, you may argue but the raiders get loot, the loot would only benefit the new people on raids with backflagging. Yeah it does pay in the long term when you go to Time and get loot dropped in the loads, but in the meantime the sessions are boring, repititious and monotonous. So I think if they opened up the zones, there could be a certain element of resentment. Not towards the casual players, but to the &quot;work&quot; involved to get those flags.<br />
Part of the reason I hated Pop, the turn into the hardcorism of raiding and the continued necessity to keep backflagging which really got moods great aggravated in the guild at times, as well as the annoyingly high numbers. Imo, raiding should be more of a casual thing, and instead of the argument where loot is much better, there should be different types of loot which I said about in another post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Oops this thread has derailed onto that other argument again.<br />
<br />
I dont think its really a de-rail. One of the BIG reasons its not fun for a lot of players is that their gear isnt up to snuff to survive there, and the reason its not is because the &quot;casual&quot; player who does not raid has a very limited pool of loot. <br />
<br />
Players can usually XP in the EPs while there are raids. In Fire, you can pull the minis just about anywhere from the Birds to the Tables. In Water, you basically sit in one spot and pull every one. In Earth, there are little coves and side ledges all over that a group can XP on while another guild is doing Rings. Air isnt really an XP zone option anyway, so it doesnt count. <br />
<br />
My point is that the casual player can find EXTREMELY nice upgrades off 1 group mini-minis in these planes. 100 hp cloak, FT2 ring, class Pet weapons, Sharkspine, shields, hammers, Plankton sword, FT3 belt, 100 hp range item, a ver nice Knight shield, etc etc etc. There is also the Talisman of Gate neck item to finish, the 3rd one is quite wearable for a casual player. <br />
<br />
This stuff would certainly make most of Gates more accessible to more people. I dont want to see Fire turn into the &quot;Newest Karnors Castle&quot; so make it HARD to get in. Sol Ro has its own issues (namely no ZO) so I dont see opening that as being something that would create a big congration of tards and asshats. On my server, there is a HUGE difference between Tactics and BoT. Tactics is pretty good XP in a lot of places, and has very good loot mobs as well. But people dont swarm in there off the PoS backdoor quest like its BoT. Why? Because most of teh BoT crew is too lazy to bother with the PoS Tactics quest. I think you would find the same thing if quests were created for Sol Ro and the EPs. Make em hard. Make em rare. Make em long. But make em doable by the dedicated casual player, so he can get from where he is now to what he needs to go to Gates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Otoole Frostypants</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Now if my assumption was right that people actualyl play this game mainly to enjoy themselves (and I hope to god I am) then if there are two routes to the upper end of the game (one providing a better reward albeit) then will raiding really die a death, I can't see it honestly. <br />
<br />
But that's NOT the issue that is being brought up by the person to whom I addressed the comments. The person I was addressing wants to be THE SAME as the raider without the raiding. The person I am addressing doesn't want there to be a better reward/dividend for the raiding time put into it. They want the reward/dividend to be THE SAME regardless of what path you choose to get there. That's what I'm speaking to and that's what seems to go over people's heads...for what reason I can't comprehend. If there is the SAME RESULT with varying paths to reach that result, then when people find the path of least resistance...THAT is where they will go.<br />
<br />
Human nature, Watson.<br />
<br />
&quot;If this were to be implemented...wouldn't those paths be overrun by the hardcore? &quot;<br />
<br />
Doubt it. Two reasons. One, the hard core raider is busy raiding. Second, it's not worth his while.<br />
<br />
Exactly what will the hardcore raider be raiding for? The path that you suggested as implementation is what the hardcore player will opt for! That &quot;big game&quot; that you say the casuals want that is &quot;on par&quot; with the raider....well, that's right up his alley! C'mon...think about it.<br />
<br />
There's just not a lot of stuff that casual players would want that the raider feels he just has to have. Most of it is lore and of lesser value than what a hard core raider will have himself or will get very soon, so it's not compelling to swamp the easier stuff for the most part.<br />
<br />
Why would the raider take the &quot;harder&quot; path for this &quot;big game&quot; that the casuals want when the raider can have that &quot;big game&quot; for less effort? I can see that this concept isn't getting through to you guys. You SAY you want it to be &quot;the same&quot; but then you have to admit there HAS TO BE A DIFFERENCE in order to keep the raiders off &quot;your turf&quot;, so to speak. Raiders ARE NOT going to raid just for raidings sake. If there are 60 people to equip, they are going to splinter off and do that &quot;big game loot&quot; 6 -12 man camp and get it &quot;quicker&quot; than if they have to keep doing the same raid mobs until all 60 people get their loot.<br />
<br />
Consider what could happen instead. the 60 people who used to raid have now &quot;set up camps&quot; and they kill their mobs with their well built groups and when a loot item drops that someone from another camp (of their friends, mind you) needs, they are going to send him a tell to loot it. Those splinter groups are going to be held by the round the clockers....not the casuals. I recall this being an issue in EQ already where the Ancient Crocodile was concerned way back when. lol. When they devour that loot, yes, they will move on to the next rung, but the casuals are going to be &quot;locked out&quot; (not by keys nor flags, but by PLAYERS) from the &quot;content&quot; they want access to. It's the same thing wrapped in a different bow, really. And it doesn't really sound unfamiliar.<br />
<br />
Uber people doing GoD right now are letting Vxed and Tipt loot rot -- stuff that would be huge upgrades to people who are not raiders. If they're letting it rot now, why would they go and try to get more of it in the limited time they have outside of raiding? When they get past Vxed/Tipt, the gear becomes even better.<br />
<br />
It appears that you aren't understanding what I'm trying to say here. EQ, right now, keeps the raiders away from some areas of content simply because they've already devoured it. Now, the casuals are hitting that content. You are saying you want there to be &quot;big game&quot; content for casuals but saying there also needs to be a difference in content for raider vs casual so that their worlds don't collide. That exists already! The only thing I keep hearing is that the casuals don't like that there is a place where raiders end up so that they stay out of the casuals way. Then the casuals complain because their path is &quot;so different&quot; than what the raiders end up doing. It's not making sense anymore.<br />
<br />
Sure, there are twinks, but the hard core raider twinks his guys with elemental gear or even time gear and GoD gear that's rotting in the course of regular raids and groups. Or he finds ornate cheap enough that he can just buy as much as he wants. He really doesn't need to go hang around what to him are &quot;lowbie&quot; zones at all.<br />
<br />
And yet he does. NToV, while lowbie twinkie crap to the Time+ sect is still a place to &quot;go&quot; if the Elementals and Time are &quot;full&quot;. Or, it's a place to spend an &quot;off night&quot; and lots of guilds take those nights as a break from raiding...<br />
<br />
What's a waste of an uber's or hard core raider's time is a boon to the guy just can't raid or doesn't want to be pigeonholed into that one and only way of playing.<br />
<br />
Except that's MY point your making. :) MY POINT has been and continues to be that casuals should stop getting gray hair over the fact that they can't get into PoTime and go do VP, NToV, or Vex Thal. Those places do not suck if your gear doesn't reach that quality yet. It's an UPGRADE even if it isn't Time quality.<br />
<br />
So basically you're saying people won't raid if they can upgrade via the casual path? Or conversely, are you saying why would the casual play if they are forced to raid? Or wait, wait, wait- are you saying the game would naturally force people into one and only one playstyle? Well, then, seems to me if you don't like it you shouldn't play EQ then, eh? Or leave your raid guild and join a solid group of friends if you want the best gear and to access all the content in the game. Hey, if you have too much time to play or you don't like being forced into the casual playstyle TOO BAD.<br />
<br />
Oh, Izmalis, you're just so darn funny I don't think I can take anymore!<br />
<br />
I have stated OVER and OVER to you, but to no avail, that casuals who DEMAND that raiding and non raiding be EQUAL have no respect for the raiders playstyle. And you prove my point time and again. You don't care about there being DIFFERENT STROKES for different folks. You want there to be SAMENESS and EQUALITY and you don't comprehend the actual impact it will have. You just have this fantasy idea that raiders raid only to raid and nothing else. There is NO REWARD for raiding if the time spent doesn't amount to something practical in the end. Thus, if the one group content is going to be &quot;uber&quot; then that is where you will find your ubers.<br />
<br />
The truth is that casual players DO fit into the world of Everquest and always have. They general reach certain aspects of content at a later time than the hardcore player and that is what they actually resent--doing it later rather than doing it &quot;now&quot;.  In one sentence you state that you don't care &quot;when&quot; but then you complain about not being there &quot;now&quot;. You don't really know what you want is the problem. You just want to complain. Nothing will actually satisfy you.<br />
<br />
By the way, I neglected to mention or maybe emphasize properly -- I think raiding is &quot;easier&quot; than doing tough single groups. Raiders trying to opt for &quot;easier&quot; things usually find they are not easier at all. Sharkspine club and pet swarm swords are great examples. &quot;It's too hard!&quot; is the refrain. All you have to do for a raid is show up and don't screw up too noticeably. And, sooner or later, you will get your loot. Heck, good attendance can be the biggest determiner for a lot of people of how much loot they get as raiders.<br />
<br />
In single groups, it doesn't work that way. You have to do things right, and nobody is there to cover your butt or put blame on if things don't work out.<br />
<br />
That's a cop out and I don't buy it. I have yet to hear of the zerg guilds getting their props for being zergy. In fact, I hear constant mockery of such guilds. There are plenty of guilds who don't zerg, so they have to use strategy and if something goes wrong, they wipe out. It happens all the time. Zerging, in general, causes way too much lag and makes it harder not easier to raid.<br />
<br />
And as for just &quot;showing up&quot; and eventually you will get your loot, that's sort of my point. EVENTUALLY is the key phrase. I might covet a particular chain drop but if only one drops off a mob at a time and there are several chain classes to whom it might go...as well as several member of my own class, that means I might not get it. So guess what? I'm redoing that same content over and over and over until I get one with the guild or we move on cuz we can't stand to be there anymore. I might not EVER see that item I coveted. So what?<br />
<br />
Raiders have similar issues with content appearing &quot;old&quot; after having camped it so many times. It's the same exact thing that casuals face only on a bigger scale. If you have done both types of play, you recognize it.<br />
<br />
Most raiders I know are like most any other players I know -- fairly chicken and conservative. Aside from the loose cannons who will try to drag people on suicide runs, they don't like taking reasoned chances that require skill and concentration -- at least, not when not backed up by 70 friends. Almost everybody who is not raiding that I know tends to experience in one place -- Plane of Earth. That's it.<br />
<br />
Don't forget Plane of Fire. That's how Innoruuk is divided atm. Most Elementals exp in Fire and Earth. Water and Air are pretty much raiding only.<br />
<br />
No, the raiders aren't about to swamp tough single group content anytime soon. They're not swamping it even now; they would be even less visible doing so if the amount of it were drastically increased.<br />
<br />
They are not doing it NOW because there is BETTER items to get from raiding...so they raid. If the single group content and raid content has = items, expect raiding to disappear. That's the point. Expect single group content to be overrun with what used to be the raiding crowd.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Things have to be divided. The high-end raiders play 12+ hours a day because they have the time and the inclination. Most casual players wouldn't commit the time even if they could.<br />
<br />
I am a casual player. I watched a guild take down Hoshkar in VP. They were one of the first to do so; by the time I saw them at it, VP was &quot;old news&quot;. They wiped no less than 6 times while I watched; talking to my friend the next day, yes they killed him in the end: total time was 11 hours. This is what the &quot;Raider&quot; does, day after day.<br />
<br />
If content wasn't divided, the same ppl would still be on camping the loot: Because they can, and want to.<br />
<br />
The problem I see, is that casual players now can't even think about &quot;tagging along&quot; on a raid. Without flags you just can't get there. Without the gear, you'll listen to the raid on channel from your bind point.<br />
<br />
So much for curiousity, so much for exploration. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since when do raiders have respect for the casual playstyle?  With a few notable exceptions, all we've been told since the release of PoP was &quot;if you don't like it, quit!&quot; or &quot;join a raid guild, newb!&quot; and other pointless insults.  But that's besides the point- why, exactly, do you care if casuals respect you as a raider?  Personally I couldn't care less if raiders respect me or not- I'm not so insecure that I'm desperate for their approval.<br />

Tell you what: do a search and see how many times I bring up the stupidity of forcing players into one playstyle. I'd love to see which point of yours I'm proving. <br />
<br />
Only one way to play a game as big as EverQuest is foolish at best. It makes even less sense  when you lock out the mass market from your game by requiring them to play 4+ hours a night, 5 nights a week in a raiding guild. I've also said I want equality of opportunity (no flagged zones, not now, not ever), not equality of outcome.  I'd like to earn my own gear, which for the most part I can no longer do other than doing 1354 exciting LDoNs.<br />
<br />

<br />
Raiders raid for loot, pure and simple, with a secondary objective (a distant second) of seeing new content.  There is little different in their objectives than there is for a casual- we both play the same game and want the same things.  <br />
<br />
I'm still waiting for you to explain how it's okay for raiders to be rewarded with exponentially better gear than casuals for the same amount of time spent earning their gear.  Why should one playstyle be more valued than the other?  Don't people have equally valid ways to play?  Why aren't you concerned that no casual players will be left if the casual, single group content is removed?  Where's your &quot;respect&quot; for the casual player?<br />
<br />
It's probably located in the same place as SOE's, ie, nonexistent.<br />
<br />
<br />
The truth is that casual players DO fit into the world of Everquest and always have.

You just want to complain. Nothing will actually satisfy you.<br />
<br />
Casuals will never see the elemental planes, just like they will never see VT, unless it's opened up.  And no, leeching flags by tagging along w/ your buddy's raid guild backflagging doesn't count.  Casuals once fit into EverQuest, but that is no longer the case.  They are left with the following zones when they hit 65:<br />
- BoT<br />
- HoH<br />
- Tactics<br />
- PoV<br />
- LDoN<br />
<br />
<br />
You don't really know what you want is the problem. You just want to complain. Nothing will actually satisfy you.<br />
<br />
Actually I do know what I want.  <br />
1- Not another flagged zone ever again.  Get rid of anything other than instancing that separates the playerbase.  If my friends in raid guilds want to hang out with us tonight, why can't we go anywhere we want instead of forcing them to come to our plebian zones?<br />
2- Little to no disparity between the gear you can get raiding and single group content.  Why? So that the designers can write one size fits all content and not have to tune it for the top 1% of players wearing gear the vast majority of players will never see.  In addition they can release one expansion with something for everyone instead of having to seesaw between raid expansion, casual expansion, raid expansion, etc...<br />
<br />
Do those things and I'll be satisfied.  Believe or not the validity of this issue will be borne out when competition arrives as casuals will be leaving this game in droves.  I do give you props for not immediately labeling it as &quot;whining&quot; as so many others do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look Iz, I respect the fact that the casual player has a sucky road with regard to zones and gear, and I would sincerely like to see that adjusted, but I am sorry, your demand for equality is just plain wrong. Were you around pre-Kunark? Were you around when Jboots were in Najena? What about FBSS in LG? Remember those camps? What exactly do you think would happen if all the very best items were 1 groupable? Seriously. <br />
<br />
I am fully in favor of a closer gap for casuals. I favor opening SOME content after new expansions start becoming deserted because the &quot;hardcore crowd&quot; has moved on. But I really do not think that having every bit of gear one groupable is in the best interest of this game, and certainly having it tradable isnt. But there has been, and always will be, and always SHOULD be a seperation. Honestly bro, do you WANT 700+ guys who play 5 hours a night swarming into the 1-group content you are looking for? Do you want to see them farming it for twinks, for pp, for RL cash with Yantis? Be careful what you wish for Iz, seriously. <br />
<br />
And while I think some zones should eventually be opened to the general population, I think that there are some that should never be. Each expansion has a sort of &quot;signature raid zone&quot;. VP for Kunark, ST for Velious, VT for Luclin, Time for PoP, and now Uqua for Gates. These should remain closed. <br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong with differnt gear for differnt styles of play, IMHO. One path has one set of rewards, another has a different set. I will certainly agree that the casual player should now have easier access to Luclin level gear, but I will never agree that the raider and the casual should be on the same loot table, or we will be back to &quot;lists&quot; and guilds shuffling their own people into the better camps or guild totally dominating the &quot;best&quot; areas. Think about it Iz, and be careful what you wish for.</div></div><hr />

This is disingenuous.  The difference in playstyles is numbers and contiguous time, not difficulty and skill or anything more esoteric.  Both the casual and the raider are killing monsters for loot.  Nothing more, nothing less.  Therefore I fail to see why the rewards for those with more numbers and contiguous time should be so much greater than those putting in the same amount of time (over a span of weeks and months) but without 72 people carrying them.<br />
<br />
<br />
 I will certainly agree that the casual player should now have easier access to Luclin level gear, but I will never agree that the raider and the casual should be on the same loot table, <br />
<br />
Or in SOE's grand scheme, not even sharing the same zones.  Ssra/VT gear smokes anything casuals had, have or will ever have access to and nothing will change.  SOE agrees with you 100%, I merely raise the issue these days hoping devs from other games do not go down the same path.<br />
<br />
we will be back to &quot;lists&quot; and guilds shuffling their own people into the better camps or guild totally dominating the &quot;best&quot; areas. Think about it Iz, and be careful what you wish for.<br />
I have thought about it.  I can't remember the last time a raid player stole my camp in LDoN.  Instancing, which is proven technology, can handle overcrowding. <br />

Fabled mobs were a throwback to the bad old days- I was continually amazed people were willing to wait 20+ hours for fabled jboots when you could buy run5 w/ aa's.  Eh?</div></div><hr />

I think that single group encounters should contain the exact same opportunities to aquire gear that raiding does.  Raiding was a mistake created because the devs (at the time) didn't know how to make the content challenging for a single group without being trivialized by some group combination.<br />
<br />
Cheers.<br />

Who from SoE has actually said that raiding was a mistake? Is there a quote or article?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Anjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Other important differences at the moment between raiding and doing single group encounters are pace and experience.<br />
<br />
When raiding, you often spend lots of time sitting on your hands, waiting for people to get rezzed and buffed, waiting for clerics to get mana back, waiting for the pullers to bring you something to kill, etc.  I find that I spend FAR more downtime during raids than I ever do during regular experience groups.<br />
<br />
The other difference that many people overlook is experience gains.  During a typical month of raiding, I MIGHT have gained one or two AAs during that entire time.  Experience during a raid is almost non-existant.  During many of the expansions, raiding the high end zone (PoH, PoSky, VP, VT, etc) meant that you were hoping that you didn't lose your level.  Forget any experience gains.  You were aiming for losing only 25% of a level.<br />
<br />
If single groups got the same reward as full time raiders, I would expect that the content that gave them the rewards would give each person a usuable drop once every 200-300 hours spent playing and would only give those individuals a couple of AAs during that time.  For casual people that play 10 hours a week, that means they'd get an upgrade every six months.  Increase the rate at which the highest quality items enter the game and the raiders would swarm all over it, quickly outfitting themselves completely in the gear and then quitting the game when they had nothing left to do.<br />
<br />
A large part of EQ's success has come about because of the timesinks, the time invested in characters.  Make it easier and SOE loses money.</div></div><hr />

I assume that the &quot;hardcore casuals&quot; would be happy to fight yellow/red cons for a month or four getting little to no xp as they quested their way to a nice piece of gear?<br />

How soon would that get boring I wonder, but if you want equality, it's got to be across the board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Casuals will never see the elemental planes, just like they will never see VT, unless it's opened up.<br />
<br />
I guess it depends on what you mean by casual, but I consider my guild casual and we are mostly Elemental now.  We raid on average probably 2 times/week but there is no requirement or pressure to raid and we have no requirements to join us except that you have a good attitude.  We only have one night that is pretty much a guarantee that we will be raiding.  Everyone said we couldnt do it and time after time we beat the next challenge, we set a goal and went after it, but we are not a raiding guild, we do have a few hard core players, but most are very casual.<br />
<br />
There are also raids on my server that have been doing planar progression for a while now that are pickup (called Barbraid for whatever reason) and they recently downed RZ (twice) and got a bunch of non-guilded people in the Elementals (think they have a level requirement of 60 now since a 55 ninja looted one of their BoWs).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">I'm in a 'family raiding' guild. I will not put in the number of hours per week required to participate in an elemental guild. That's okay. <br />
<br />
And no, I don't deserve elemental loot if I'm not willing to do what it takes to get it. Nobody is locked out of anything - we essentially lock ourselves out by how much we are willing to put into it.<br />
<br />
Top-end vendor and hard drop LDoN, Tier-2 PoP, and perhaps someday  Ssra HP/Blood/Emp probably the best I'll ever equip. I'm kidding myself thinking about VT, but hey, maybe someday.<br />
<br />
But I accept this, because I only have so many hours a week that I can set aside for this game. Anyone unwilling to put in the time is not entitled to the loot, period. Heck, I remember when I never thought I'd get my Epic. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Khulgore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">I do not like the terms &quot;raider&quot; and &quot;casual player&quot;.<br />
<br />
I do not like them, because I am a hardcore non-raider.<br />
<br />
That is, I play on average 5+ hours per weeknight, and at least 10 hours on a weekend day.  But I am not part of a guild.  I play with my real life friends.  I have been part of a raiding guild and have had characters with top end loot (for the time).  I began to realize that I despise raiding.  Frankly, I am NOT going to get along well with 70+ people.  In any guild there are going to be people that I don't get along with, and that don't get along with me.  And I will be damned if I'm going to shell out cash each month, just to be forced to interact with people that I don't like, just to improve my character.  Call me anti-social or whatever, I just have my few close friends and that's who I want to spend my leisure time with.<br />
<br />
I mean in real life, I don't have 70, or even 30, &quot;friends.&quot;  I might have that many aquaintances, but I don't interact with them on a daily basis, the way I do with my friends.<br />
<br />
Now I will wager that I play more than MANY end game raiders.  There are no doubt college students are the unemployed that have more time available than me, but I play a LOT of EQ.  And I have played a LOT of EQ for a very very long time (since release).<br />
<br />
My point is this:  I've put in more time than many many raiding shamans, and their gear is (and unfortunately always will be) better than mine, ONLY BECAUSE THEY ENJOY OR ARE WILLING TO RAID, and I am not.<br />
<br />
That, in my opinion, is crap.  Their gear is better not because they put in more time, not because they are more skilled, but simply because they enjoy (or choose to) raid, and I choose not to.<br />
<br />
But don't think that just because someone is not in a raiding guild, that it necessarily follows that they are a &quot;casual&quot; player.  And it certaintly doesn't follow in my book that a non raiding player should be weaker, character wise, than a raider.<br />
<br />
AA's help some with this.  I have heard raiders claim they wish they had time to get the AA's like non-raiders do.  I would even be happy, as long as I had access to all the CONTENT (read: zones) that raiders do.  I do not.  Raiders get more for their time and money from SOE than non-raiders do, and that's the cold hard truth.  LDoN was a huge step in the right direction, I will give them that.<br />

- Khulgore (long time lurker)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Anjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Partially true, Khulgore.  You presumably get a lot of experience from doing experience groups that much.  You almost certainly have far more AAs than the individual who spends the same amount of online time as you but only raids and never does experience groups.  That's one of the tradeoffs of only raiding - better gear but lesser AAs.<br />
<br />
I agree that the gains / hour for raiding are greater than that for doing experience groups and I'm not sure that's fair.  I'd prefer to see it much closer.  I'd like to see extraordinary gear drop from single experience group mobs (they do in GoD), but to keep people interested in the game, they can't drop like candy.  A drop every three or four weeks with your play times would probably be appropriate.  To balance things out, I'd also prefer that raiding provide experience commesurate with experience groups.<br />
<br />
Now, I don't know how many AAs you have or get, but to balance the scales as they stand now (time versus reward) would you be willing to forego all AA and adventure point gains for three or four weeks in order to get a single piece of elemental gear for your character or double or triple that price for a piece of Time gear?  That's the current price paid by raiders.</div></div><hr />

That's the current price paid by raiders.<br />
<br />
Sure, it's not about time, it's about options, and what I have to do during that time to get the rewards.  I am not willing to spend time with people I don't know, or don't like, to get better loot.  I have to do that at my real life job already.  I get along fine with my co-workers, but I don't want to spend my leisure time with them.  I want to spend it with my friends of many years.<br />
<br />
Hardcore raiders complain about how much the LotY expansion sucked because it offered nothing to them.<br />
<br />
I disagree.  It may have offered no upgrades to them, but they still had the option of enjoying that content.  I will concur that the loot from LotY was craptacular (for non-raiders, especially for raiders), but the other content was not terrible, in fact, I found it quite enjoyable although that is surely a subjective opinion on my part.<br />
<br />
Part of my beef is that non-radiers like me are denied content available to raiders, but raiders have ALL content available to them.  Some of them choose not to experience it, but they do have that option.  I can not even zone into the EPs.  I am pretty sure those with Time Gear can zone into say, Torgiran Mines and go about freeing the slaves/killing the taskmaster.<br />
<br />
Another way to look at it is like this.  Let's suppose the uberest of the uber raiding guilds, had gotten all the raid loot they wanted.  Every member of the guild had the best piece of equipment in every slot they could want, and yet a new expansion has not yet come out.  These people still have the option at that point of going out and grinding some AA's that they want, but could not get while raiding.<br />
<br />
Now take me on the other hand.  People complain about the high cost of GoD AA's but I can guarantee you that I will have all GoD AA's that I care about, long before the next expansion comes out.  Will I then have the option of going to work on upgrading my gear to raid level gear status?  No, unless I join a raiding guild...<br />
<br />
Think about it.  How many people do you know, only joined a raiding guild because they ran out of ways to improve their character?  This was very true pre-Luclin, as level 60 was the cap, and there were no AA's.  People got level 60, got all the loot they could get from single group encounters, and found out that the only way to improve their character was to join a raiding guild (this is in fact what happened to me).  These people didn't actually enjoy raiding, they just had no other options for improving their character.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against raiders, I just sometimes wish I enjoyed raiding as much as they do so that I could also reap the rewards.  Again, I will say, things have gotten a LOT better over the years, with the introduction of AA's, instanced zones, and so forth.  Yet, the potential power of a character is still limited by his (or her) choice to raid, or not to raid.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">And thus we come full circle back to the topic of the thread. Why does Gates suck? I dunno. It would SEEM to be the answer that the casual players are looking for, as well as a nice set of options for Raiders. Lets take a look, shall we?<br />
<br />
1 groupable decent (better than VT) loot. Yup, its in there. <br />
<br />
Instancing so no &quot;hardcores&quot; can come swipe camps or dominate zones. Check.<br />
<br />
So whats the problem? Well, the problem is there is no &quot;bridge&quot; of gear available to the casual player to be at LEAST semi effective in Gates. <br />
<br />
Honestly, I look at Gates as an attempt by SOE to give the casual players some solid One Group content that has SERIOUS upgrades in it, but thats hard, and requires a LOT more effort and work. <br />
<br />
So why isnt the casual population taking advantage of this? Honestly, I am not sure. There are a number of reasons, I guess. Its a LONG dangerous run to the Vxed/Tipt trials. The mobs there hit VERY VERY hard. Certain group compositions are REQUIRED, practically. Oh, and it has &quot;flags&quot;so Iz and his friends refuse to buy it, despite the fact that every &quot;flag&quot; is a 1 group thing (Iz, didnt you ASK for content like this? A way to access the better zones with ONE GROUP SITUATIONS?? What EXACTLY do you want to gain access to these zones, again. Totally Open a la BoT?)<br />
<br />
See, I think you casual players are missing the boat here. I see the game HEADED that way. I am willing to bet that a single group of skilled players with the right class make up and wearing only Bazaar and a few LDoN upgrades CAN make it to Kod'Taz.<br />
<br />
But its too far.<br />
But there are flags.<br />
But there are no graveyards.<br />
But its hard.<br />
<br />
OK back to my points now. Open Sol Ro and the EPs via a difficult quest that requires dedication but is doable by a single group. There is gear available there that will &quot;put you over the top&quot; to be more effective in Gates. There is Tribute for the focus effects you are lacking. There is LDoN for decent upgrades. There is lower Gates zones with DAMN SOLID loot dropping in them. <br />
<br />
Gates is a work in progress. We are seeing changes. The spells are changing. The way zones spawn are changing. I think this expansion is a GENUINE attempt by SOE to make 1 group content with good loot, EXACTLY what most of the &quot;hardcore casuals&quot; are asking for. <br />
<br />
The old content isnt going to be changed that much. I bet the EPs will be opened eventually, but never Time or VT. Get over it. But the new path to advancement is in front of you. Why arent you on it, you &quot;casual&quot; players?</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are on it. I gave up my Shaman and made a Bard.  I am now level 57, goal is 63 and Fading Memories so that my group of friends and I can pursue GoD.<br />
<br />
We are not casual, we are the target market for GoD: hardcore non-raiders.  Unfortunately, as you mentioned, without the bridge, and without the correct set of classes for the six man group, we can't do the content.  So we are doing what is necessary to be able to do it.  My entire group of friends has done almost nothing but help powerlevel the bard, just so we can enjoy GoD (with occasional breaks in LDoN to break the monotony).  I just think it's crap that I have to do this.  I always did CC with root and slow before, but it doesn't work in GoD anymore (and it didn't really work in hard LDoN's either, but we had the option of doing normals)<br />
<br />
My normal group as info:<br />
Shaman (Me)<br />
Warrior<br />
Cleric<br />
Rogue<br />
Magician<br />
Wizard<br />
<br />
As you can see, we lack (and have always lacked) a crucial group element: crowd control.  We always made do before with CoH pulling from the mage and then I would handle it with root and slow.  That just doesn't cut it in GoD, or hard LDoN where there is a time limit.<br />
<br />
And apparently we're not the only one with the bard idea, since the bard twink population has quintupled in recent times, when once before they (bards in general) were quite rare indeed.<br />
<br />
I wonder if in the future, we will once again have to level up another class to make content enjoyable (or even available).  But now I am really taking this thread somewhere I shouldn't, since that topic is being discussed elsewhere on this forum.  But basically, the Shaman functions I provide in our group are (were):<br />
Slow<br />
Buff<br />
Backup Heal<br />
Crowd Control<br />
Haste<br />
<br />
A bard provides all of those except backup heal and buff, and as others have noted, Shamans aren't doing so well in the backup heal department anyway.  And bard crowd control is far superior to a Shaman's, and that is our current weakness atm.  The only buffs we are losing that people care about are focus, boar, and fer avatar.  We are gaining mana regen for the other casters, more haste (due to bards providing all kinds of haste options), and of course the far superior CC.<br />
<br />
My point is this, despite all my griping, despite having to level up another character, my group of friends and I *are* looking forward to GoD with great anticipation.  It does seem like exactly what we have wanted, even if the mighty ogre Khulgore will not be there to share the adventures.<br />
<br />
But I'm going from being a lurker to a full time poster, and Iv'e got to get back to earning my pay!  I have however thoroughly enjoyed reading and participating in this thread.<br />

&quot;It appears that you aren't understanding what I'm trying to say here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes, what you are saying is very complicated, and has never been said before.<br />
<br />
Or, perhaps every comment on every thread isn't directed at you in particular, and maybe some people even disagree with either some of your posts or some related points.<br />
<br />
Some of your remarks after my quotes don't even go with the quotes they're commenting on, but the overall gist of them seems to be that you're almost panicked at the idea of raiders not raiding.  I say, who cares?  If they don't want to, why should they be forced to?  In a free market of ideas, why choose the least attractive one just because it's become routinely accepted as the only one in a closed market for so long?  If raiding is so darn good and you're so concerned it will not survive, maybe it's not so good in the first place?  If it is, it will certainly get along fine.  Many people LOVE raiding.  LOTS.  Many people do NOT like experiencing or single grouping, and long on only for raids.  Raids will take care of themselves.  The only problem is, the other styles of playing take care of themselves by people just finding another game.<br />
<br />
I did want to comment on your remark that &quot;And yet he does. NToV, while lowbie twinkie crap to the Time+ sect is still a place to &quot;go&quot; if the Elementals and Time are &quot;full&quot;. Or, it's a place to spend an &quot;off night&quot; and lots of guilds take those nights as a break from raiding...&quot;<br />
<br />
I never, ever, ever see people of any high level or good gear level going to NTOV anymore.  Not for, oh, I dunno...years?  Same like you say raiders won't raid if there are alternatives, I have to think you are playing on a server that's night and day different from mine -- maybe from anyone else's?  What's the point of going to NTOV at this stage of the game?  It boggles my mind you could even suggest it.  Then suggest that &quot;lots of guilds&quot; go to NTOV as a break from raiding?  Holy cow.  <br />
<br />
Raiding guilds I know raid five nights a week or more.  The off nights are for sleeping, household chores, begging apologies from your family, working, whatever.  For those still able to play, for experiencing.  The last thing anybody I know of any real high level or gear is going to do is go to NTOV.  They might as well go to City of Mist.<br />
<br />
We are playing such different games that I find it hard to even comprehend we're playing the same one at all.  I don't agree on your fear that raiding will be lost OR that even if it were, it would matter -- people's choices being free, or they should be anyway, in a game that's a good game -- and I don't find instructive some of your examples of how you see the game being played, at least as some sort of back-up verification for your ideas.  Because, on my server, what you say is &quot;lots of guilds&quot; do is not done by anyone.  I find your fears either misplaced or irrelevant, and your examples seem to come for a completely different world.  If you're extrapolating from them to get to your ideas, no wonder we don't see eye to eye.<br />
<br />
Which is not to flame you or be purposely negative -- I just find myself really unable to imagine where you're coming from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Otoole Frostypants</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Since when do raiders have respect for the casual playstyle? With a few notable exceptions, all we've been told since the release of PoP was &quot;if you don't like it, quit!&quot; or &quot;join a raid guild, newb!&quot; and other pointless insults. But that's besides the point- why, exactly, do you care if casuals respect you as a raider? Personally I couldn't care less if raiders respect me or not- I'm not so insecure that I'm desperate for their approval.<br />
<br />
If you think this discussion is about &quot;approval&quot;, Iz, then you really haven't been following along. lol.<br />
<br />
Personally, I haven't said, &quot;Join a raid guild.&quot; I've stated that I have managed to gain many flags without being guilded and without putting in 12 hours a day. What I have said is if you want to get into that content NOW, then you have to do what it takes---go on some raids. There are pickup raids. There are guilds who will let &quot;guests&quot; in to get flags. If you want to be in certain zones at this time, Iz, you will have to do a few raids. Period. You do not, however, have to JOIN A RAID GUILD to get them. That's just not true.<br />
<br />
Tell you what: do a search and see how many times I bring up the stupidity of forcing players into one playstyle. I'd love to see which point of yours I'm proving. <br />
<br />
Only one way to play a game as big as EverQuest is foolish at best. It makes even less sense when you lock out the mass market from your game by requiring them to play 4+ hours a night, 5 nights a week in a raiding guild.<br />
<br />
Your assumption is that the &quot;mass market&quot; is the casual player base. I stated to you before that you can't PROVE that is the &quot;mass&quot; market. I suspect that the split between the hardcore and the casual isn't as wide spread as you assume. It's probably more even than you think. If the market of the hardcore were so &quot;small&quot; as you assume, then there wouldn't the amount of focus they currently receive. I'll use a made up figure to illustrate my point.<br />
<br />
If only 20% of the market is the hardcore player base and 80% is the casual base, wouldn't it stand to reason that 20% of the game's content would be designed for that 20% of the market? Here's the problem with that design mode---the 20% of the playerbase, being hardcore, is the one who spends MOST of the time IN the content, Iz. The 80% casual market isn't going to run out of content because they haven't touched most of it based on their LIMITED play. The game is built around he who spends the most time IN IT. That, hands down, is the hardcore player. Even if only 20% of the playerbase is hardcore, they probably make up something more like 50 - 75% (again, made up figures) of the people ONLINE at any given time. That is what makes the market far more EVEN than you think. They are the ones ONLINE, therefore they are the ones who NEED content. Thus, the game designers have to keep up with them...so they do.<br />
<br />
I've also said I want equality of opportunity (no flagged zones, not now, not ever), not equality of outcome. I'd like to earn my own gear, which for the most part I can no longer do other than doing 1354 exciting LDoNs.<br />
<br />
That's not been the case since Kunark and you want it implemented 4-5 years later? Get real, Iz. <br />
<br />
Kunark introduced zones you can't access without a &quot;key&quot; (translated into a flag later on) which required that you do something OTHER than simply level to get in. VP was the first zone that kept &quot;you&quot; out unless you camped for endless hours the annoyingly rare pieces you needed to get the key. Oh, and you had to gather a raidforce (40 - 50 people) to acquire the tooth from Trakanon back then. Now, if you would like to enter VP, you still have to collect the painfully annoying pieces...but killing Trakanon won't require 40 - 50 people. That doesn't mean that VP entry changed, it just means that our power as a player has increased such that it no longer requires a &quot;raidforce&quot; to gain entry. The same might be said about Elemental entry several expansions into the future (should that actually be the case). That's been my point all along when anyone makes a claim that they will &quot;never&quot; be able to enter. The people who thought they &quot;never&quot; would be able to enter VP &quot;could&quot; enter now if they were willing to do what it takes. As I already stated, what it takes to enter hasn't changed. It's just that they COULD accomplish the key now without a raidforce. If they wanted to enter THEN, then yes they needed to suck it up, join a raid, and kill Trakanon in hopes of getting a tooth. Not everyone got a tooth the first time they were on a Trak raid. Sometimes you had to go more than once. Oh the horror!<br />
<br />
Raiders raid for loot, pure and simple, with a secondary objective (a distant second) of seeing new content. There is little different in their objectives than there is for a casual- we both play the same game and want the same things. <br />
<br />
That's a load of crap. Steaming pile of dung. The &quot;new content&quot; isn't really all the &quot;new&quot;, Iz, so that secondary objective isn't really present except in your imagination. It's just the &quot;old content&quot; on stearoids! The zone may &quot;look&quot; different, but you are still hacking and slashing npc like spiders and treants and suits and golems and armadillos, etc. You're just doing it with a &quot;different&quot; background which you will tire of when you've done it multiple times just like you're tired of the scenery you currently occupy. It's not all that &quot;different&quot; when you really get down to it. It's a &quot;grass is greener&quot; mindset and it's the only thing that really makes the game not fun for you if that is what you focus on. As Blazz has tried to tell you, if you can be satisfied where you are, you can find it to be fun again. It's the assumption that it's &quot;better in there&quot; that makes you dissatisfied with where you are now. Once you're in there...the next place will be &quot;greener&quot; in your imagination while the place you are at that time is now the new &quot;suck du jour&quot; for you to complain about.<br />
<br />
I'm still waiting for you to explain how it's okay for raiders to be rewarded with exponentially better gear than casuals for the same amount of time spent earning their gear.<br />
<br />
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T PUT IN THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Iz, wake up. Your &quot;casual&quot; 5 years of play does not equal the &quot;hardcore&quot; 5 years of play! Your hours spent are not equal, so your gear should not be equal! The one who actually has a bone to pick is Khulgore. Khulgore puts in similar hours as the raider but doesn't have raid quality gear. I can see Khulgore's point much, much better than yours, Izmalis. However, I have to contend that if Khulgore WANTS the gear that the raiders have because they raid, then Khulgore has to learn to cooperate with people, even the ones that (s)he doesn't necessarily like. It has to occur in society anyway if there are goals one wants to achieve. Not every person you come into contact with along the way is going to be &quot;your kind&quot; of people. I base these statements on Khulgore's own explanation for why (s)he despises raiding:<br />
<br />
I began to realize that I despise raiding. Frankly, I am NOT going to get along well with 70+ people. In any guild there are going to be people that I don't get along with, and that don't get along with me. And I will be damned if I'm going to shell out cash each month, just to be forced to interact with people that I don't like, just to improve my character. Call me anti-social or whatever, I just have my few close friends and that's who I want to spend my leisure time with.<br />

That's cool. It happens. However, Khulgore didn't state that (s)he hates raiding (the entity) due to the raid strategy. It's having to be with people (s)he doesn't necessarily care for that makes raiding a drag. I have that same problem at work. I don't get to spend 8 hours of my day with people I adore. I have to endure people I don't necessarily like--if I want to get paid. That's the &quot;economics&quot; of the situation. Rewards/earnings are based on such a system. I expect that some people are going to take my &quot;work&quot; analogy too far and say that EQ is supposed to be a &quot;game&quot; not a &quot;job&quot;, but well, if you want to &quot;earn&quot; your loot, then you will have to CO-OPERATE with others. You might just have to encounter people you don't necessarily like, in order to do that because that is how EQ has ALWAYS been designed from the ground up. EQ was designed to make the classes interdependent so that grouping (no one guaranteed you that ALL &quot;groups&quot; would be 6 people total) would be the &quot;best&quot; way to accomplish something. Again, that's a personal issue for Khulgore, not necessarily a game issue. <br />
<br />
Let's take it a step further. If (denoting a hypothetical scenario) Khulgore only had 3 friends--total--with whom (s)he chose to associate, then they would be shut out &quot;1 group&quot; content due to their not having enough friends to make a &quot;full&quot; group. So, should EQ become a game where EVERYONE solos/duos/trios in order to fit Khulgore's needs? Not really. Khulgore needs to find a game that fits his needs (where solo/duo/trio is &quot;optimal&quot;), not change a game's design just for him like he is the only type of player out there.<br />
<br />
EQ is not designed for &quot;raiders only&quot; (one style of play) and there is nothing you can say, Izmalis, that proves your point. There IS content for those who do not raid. The types like you just aren't satisfied with it, that's all. They want &quot;raid content&quot; without the raid. Sorry, no go. Raid content = 40 - 72 people camping a spot for loot (be it equipable or a flag). Group content = 6 people camping a spot for loot (be it equipable or a flag). It's the SAME GAME, different numbers. That's all. Raiders get just as tired doing PoWater over and over to get loot for all those people and Coirnav killed for PoTime entry as the nonraiders do camping tables/eplat/splat, etc in BoT.<br />
<br />
If you want certain loot, Izmalis, then you have to do what it takes to get it. If you aren't willing to do what it takes, then don't expect to see the loot. That the NATURE OF EQ and has always been. No one was getting Naggy/Vox loot unless they raided to get it back in the genesis of the game. Countless Naggy/Vox raids without receiving an item was not unheard of! I raided and nothing to show for it but the screenshots. :)</div></div><hr />

By the way, I neglected to mention or maybe emphasize properly -- I think raiding is &quot;easier&quot; than doing tough single groups. Raiders trying to opt for &quot;easier&quot; things usually find they are not easier at all. Sharkspine club and pet swarm swords are great examples. &quot;It's too hard!&quot; is the refrain. All you have to do for a raid is show up and don't screw up too noticeably. And, sooner or later, you will get your loot. Heck, good attendance can be the biggest determiner for a lot of people of how much loot they get as raiders.<br />
<br />
In single groups, it doesn't work that way. You have to do things right, and nobody is there to cover your butt or put blame on if things don't work out.<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a cop out and I don't buy it. &quot;<br />
<br />
I couldn't care less if you &quot;buy it&quot; or not.  Whether you do &quot;buy it&quot; or not has no bearing on how true it is.<br />
<br />
And it is.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but if you think everyone in a guild, even the top guild, needs to be that bright in this game, you're pretty deluded.  I've played with as close to all the best and best equipped players on my server over the years since I started in 1999 as anyone on the server, and some are exceptional and some are very good, but most people in EQ, like elsewhere, are not the world-beating genius go-getters some of the more egotistical among them(usually the real young inexperienced ones) like to think themselves.  <br />
<br />
People who develop new strategies, I respect, whether they are raid strategies, solo strategies, or group strategies.  Just being part of a guild, no matter which guild where, does not make you an alert, clever player, able to make the right decisions under pressure, etc.  It very often means nothing more than that your big brother knows an officer.  You ever group with the really high level players?  I have, hundreds more times than I can count.<br />
<br />
Please, let us not reserve our praise only for the already exalted, or chop them down.  People in guilds are what they are -- ordinary joes.  Maybe from a distance they look more impressive, or if you haven't spent much of your life out of the house or accomplishing anything yourself.  But most people are followers, not innovators, no matter what guild you're in, and it's more than possible to play at a mediocre level no matter what guild you're in.<br />
<br />
If you're insisting that raiding means you play on a high level or are really accomplishing things that set you apart and raise your skill as a player, you're knocking on the wrong door when you turn in my direction.</div></div><hr />

I guess it depends on what level your at but more time wouldn't make the people that should be doing hards do them, aka the elemental+ geared people. It would helpful for those who are actually interested in the gear upgrades.<br />
<br />
Personally the biggest reason for me to do normals over hards is that they both count for 1 completed mission for maxing out the charm augment. Normals I can pretty much grab any 5 guild mates and go do a run in 30-45 minutes and don't really have to worry about what type of mission we take. A hard on the other hand still needs a descently balanced group and tends to be more selective on the missions taken. None of the gear from either interests me, I don't need any of the ldon gear and not really interested in any of the augments currently. Maxing out my charm augment on the other hand wouldn't hurt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Khozik -- no way raiding is harder than casual play, unless you're the typical chicken that raiders are probably even more so than casual players, because they're used to doing everything in well-fortified crowds.  Casual players may or may not be adventurous or try difficult things, but in my experience they've been more adventurous.  They seek out other content besides that which is used either for pure raiding or the safest possible experience grinds(preferably right by a zoneline).  They have the time to do so, not being raiders, and need to do so, to find some scrap of a chance to have some fun and improve in a game which has little place for them.  They're most assiduous in seeking out new opportunities and taking risks.  <br />
<br />
I think of raiding as painting by numbers.  Very few make up the new strategies or are in charge of implementing them properly by assigning duties; the rest of the guild just follows in lockstep and does what they're told.  And when they're done, the casters try to get a tables group in POF and everyone else zergs on over to group in POE.<br />
<br />
Raiding is just NOT brain surgery.  Not for almost anyone, ever.<br />
<br />
O'Toole -- &quot;I've stated that I have managed to gain many flags without being guilded and without putting in 12 hours a day. What I have said is if you want to get into that content NOW, then you have to do what it takes---go on some raids. There are pickup raids. There are guilds who will let &quot;guests&quot; in to get flags. If you want to be in certain zones at this time, Iz, you will have to do a few raids. Period. You do not, however, have to JOIN A RAID GUILD to get them. That's just not true.&quot;<br />
<br />
This much I will agree with, but only depending on your server.  Some servers have open raiding guilds that have gotten all the way up to Time.  I got elemental for two of my characters a good while ago through open raids, and many open raids are done on my server.  Someone I know got to full elementals in a matter of months and then very quickly started leading his own raids and got his shaman alt full elemental at level 47.  At present I raid generally five nights a week in a very successful open raiding organization that's been operating for well over a year, and beat a number of guilds into the elementals.  If we weren't on perma-farm mode, we could probaby beat them into Time, too.<br />
<br />
Really depends on your server, though.  Some have the opportunity, and some don't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Otoole Frostypants</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Some of your remarks after my quotes don't even go with the quotes they're commenting on, but the overall gist of them seems to be that you're almost panicked at the idea of raiders not raiding.<br />
<br />
LOL. Now that's funny. Have you been following the conversation at all?<br />
<br />
Izmalis is the one with UNREALISTIC expectations and I am addressing those. You jumped on the bandwagon, apparently without understanding what the POINT of contention was between Izmalis and I so I've tried to explain it to you. He (Izmalis) wants everything to be one groupable and loot to be even. Blazz has also picked up on this because Izmalis says it so much. It's not my imagination, here. It's what Izmalis repeatedly says. Then he tries to back up his &quot;vision&quot; with how the game is currently for &quot;raiders only&quot; who don't care about non-raiders and it's complete crap. If the game becomes what Izmalis wants, there will be no raiders because there will be no reason to raid. Everything will be one groupable and HIS style of play will be the only kind there is. He claims that raiders don't care about non-raiders and from the onset of my confrontation with him (on multiple threads) I stated that non-raiders (such as him) don't care about the playstyle of raiders when push comes to shove. Nonraiders (like Izmalis) don't care if raiders still have something to do as long as Izmalis gets what HE WANTS. He is simply asking for the imaginary pendulum to swing in his direction because he thinks that it is in another direction. He's wrong. <br />
<br />
I say, who cares? If they don't want to, why should they be forced to?<br />
<br />
That's just it...THEY ARE NOT &quot;FORCED&quot; TO RAID. They can opt NOT to. They just won't get the loot that raiders get nor enter the zones that raiders enter. There are PLUSES to this even if they are not readily apparent. Plane of Tactics is a place where raiding and grouping (and even soloing) can take place. If there are groups hunting in the pit when a raid for RZtW begins, those people &quot;lose&quot; their place to play. No single group wants to be in there and possibly aggro RZtW. For this reason, it is GOOD to keep raiders and nonraiders &quot;separate&quot;. Why have the interruption to single groupers? It's GOOD to keep the raiders in their own &quot;content&quot; where they can't disrupt the single groupers and it's GOOD to keep the single groupers in their own &quot;content&quot; so that they can't disrupt a raid.<br />
<br />
If raiding is so darn good and you're so concerned it will not survive, maybe it's not so good in the first place?<br />
<br />
Blarg, pay attention, bud. Raiding has it's good points and it has it's bad points. However, if EVERYTHING in EQ is one groupable (as per Izmalis' request)--WHY would you gather more than a single group to do it? That's just stupid! If everything can be one grouped....then all that will exist is ONE GROUPING. Where's the raiding suppose to be if you don't NEED a raid to get the task done? lol. C'mon. I know you're brighter than this.<br />
<br />
Raids will take care of themselves. The only problem is, the other styles of playing take care of themselves by people just finding another game.<br />
<br />
Because the &quot;other&quot; styles of play are comparing apples and oranges, Blarg. Nonraiders are wanting raid quality loot without the raid. If you aren't up against mobs that quad for 1500, immune to slow, have unresistable AE, and 75 of their level 65 minions swarming you while they can hit you from anywhere in their lair, what do you need with that kind of gear anyway? To make High Risk LDoN's easier? Izmalis is under the impression that high risk LDoN's &quot;require&quot; (loose term) Elemental/Time loot to do them. They don't! I am not uberly equipped and I have completed high risk LDoN's succesfully with players no better dressed than I am (Velious quest loot). I've also failed some missions. Crap happens. :)<br />
<br />
Really depends on your server, though. Some have the opportunity, and some don't.<br />
<br />
I know. I agree. I've mentioned that before, too. Such cases, where people don't have access to open raiding have a &quot;server&quot; problem, though, not a game one. It sucks and I feel for those people. However, it's not accurate to blame EQ devs for this problem when it's a non-cooperative community issue. I admit to being glad that my server actually open raids for flags across guilds and nonguilded alike. Such cooperation (from the community, not the developers of EQ) is what made it possible for me to get the flags I have. My point is that's it's not ALWAYS the fault of the game developer. Now that characters can be moved to another server with history and loot in tact, the &quot;options&quot; for the player have opened. I met a guy this week who did a character move to Innoruuk simply because he couldn't get access to elemental planes on his server because of the very issues you mention. He had a few RL friends on Inny, so he switched to enhance his playtime and complete his particular game goals. There ARE options and I do understand that not everyone has the $$ to do a /movelog, too. I'm not unsympathetic, I just think people don't see they have alternatives should they have the means to make use of them.</div></div><hr />

What really pisses me off though is not the fact expansions are released mainly with raid content in but the fact that SoE dont bother to say so before hand.(I know GoD isnt mainly raid content but from what ive read you need EP or better gear to do well in it.Which comes from raiding :))<br />
Lets face it if youve got a Time equipped shaman the only place he is going to need that gear is in Time etc.<br />

<br />
Define fun, Wulfbane. Would it be &quot;fun&quot; to raid with a force of 40 a mob that can be killed by a group of 6? Bear in mind that I am speaking from a &quot;level appropriate&quot; perspective here. Will you advocate a game with it's design being around something akin to raiding Emperor Crush with 40 level 1's? It can be done. The trouble is, by the time all those level 1's gain Emperor Crush's loot from his drop table for having raided him and the raid experience along with it, they will have outgrown &quot;raiding&quot; him. That's just poor planning for &quot;raid&quot; content. That's why Nagafen and Vox weren't built to be like Emperor Crush when there were only 50 levels in the game. It took raidforces of level 45's - 50's to take them down. Level &quot;appropriate&quot; raiding of Nagafen and Vox were not outgrown when one reached level 50. Nagafen and Vox were not &quot;one groupable&quot; even in the genesis of Everquest. Everquest has not been a SOLELY &quot;one groupable&quot; game. PoF, PoH, PoA---raid force---when there were only 50 levels in the game. <br />
<br />
Izmalis wants the design of EQ, 5 years later to become something it has NEVER been...one groupable in every facet of the game. I'm sorry, but Naggy, Vox, and Planes loot was not &quot;equal&quot; in comparison to Lguk,/SolA loot. It was better and that's how it has always been.<br />
<br />
So what if its harder its fun they say but that doesnt seem to apply here youre stating that raiders raid for gear.<br />
<br />
That's not the SOLE reason raiders raid but I'm being honest here. Raiders who raid boss mobs and find their loot tables to &quot;suck&quot; don't raid those mobs anymore. They move onto mobs where the reward is worth the risk/time spent. If the risk isn't worth the reward, they won't take the risk nor waste their time. Don't pigeonhole raiders into having to raid just for raiding's sake. It's not a very realistic view. There's nothing &quot;fun&quot; about raiding and winding up with -0- at the end of the raid for anyone in the raid. That's part of why people who raid PoTime and find that most of the stuff that drops is rotting, move on to GoD. They've devoured what is there. If they wanted to raid purely for raiding's sake, they wouldn't have moved...and game developers would have had no reason to introduce expansions. We'd all still be level 50 hanging out with Naggy, Vox, and the Planes of Antonica.<br />
<br />
My whole outlook on this is if it means raiding to get FT15 etc etc then ill do without it.<br />
<br />
Good for you. That's fine. And I'm fine with that, too, believe it or not. However, IZMALIS is the one who wants FT15 and he wants it without a raid. You see, Wulfbane, IZMALIS wants EQ to be something it's not and I'm tired of people like Izmalis saying that it's the &quot;raiders fault&quot; that he doesn't have FT15 from one gorupable encounters. Well, I can't really understand why someone who isn't in a raid encounter would NEED FT15. FT, yes, but 15? You and I both know that the kinds of content that are one groupable do not &quot;require&quot; FT15 to make them &quot;doable&quot;. High Risk LDoN's can be done with less than FT15 magic casters and 9k HP tanks. I know this because I've done them with people who do not have raid quality gear.<br />
<br />
What really pisses me off though is not the fact expansions are released mainly with raid content in but the fact that SoE dont bother to say so before hand.(I know GoD isnt mainly raid content but from what ive read you need EP or better gear to do well in it.Which comes from raiding)<br />
<br />
I don't believe that is true, though. I think that is the kind of complaint heard round the message boards by the Izmalises of the game. I think you CAN do GoD content just like you CAN do high risk LDoN's with less than EP or better gear. You might be a little limited at first, but as you DO get items, augments, and spells, you can progress into &quot;more&quot; of what GoD has to offer even if not ALL of it. This is no different than any other expansion. Whenever an expansion comes out people cry out....only those with XX gear and loot stand a CHANCE at enjoying this expansion...or only uberguilds will be able to play here, this isn't for us casual folks! <br />
<br />
The only difference between the other expansions and expansions since PoP is that PoP had a greater number of &quot;restricted&quot; zones than any other expansion. Other expansions were limited to essentially 1 &quot;restricted&quot; zone that required a lot of effort just to enter it. And once you got there, required a lot of effort to play there. In PoP, it spread that group of guilds (which had swollen in number) around rather than cramming them all into one location known as &quot;the end game&quot;. In Kunark it was VP. In Velious it was ST. In Luclin it was Vex Thal. Multiple guilds &quot;fought&quot; over those zones and raced to the named mobs on server reset. With PoP, once they did their &quot;work&quot; to enter the Elemental Planes, they had 4 places to devour for raid and exp content and then Time added a 5th zone for them spread out in. And, due to the way the bosses are set to spawn there's &quot;less&quot; of that server reset race to the spawn. It still exists, but it's not that same frantic scramble that I recall in days gone by.<br />
<br />
I admit that I didn't experience the lockdown that existed for BoT and HoH and other zones. I came back to the game after that had been &quot;fixed&quot;. I think that it was an idea that sounded good on paper, but in reality turned out to suck. It happens. When it was determined that it was too limiting, it was rolled back. However, just because there was one roll back doesn't mean there SHOULD be more. Conversely, just because another rollback hasn't occured yet, doesn't mean it never will. I'm with Blazz on this one. At this moment in time, I think it's a rather &quot;fair&quot; balance because I don't want to see the BoT asshats training PoE/F/W/A zone in anymore than anyone else does. The point is, if the staunch casual players who are so opposed to raiding DO raid to get the flags to enter EPlanes, there is no law that says they must remain a &quot;raider&quot;. Once you've got your flags to enter, you can repent from your raiding transgressions and return to the one grouping game because the content exists for single grouping.<br />
<br />
Lets face it if youve got a Time equipped shaman the only place he is going to need that gear is in Time etc.<br />
<br />
And you and I are in agreement on this. The key word being &quot;need&quot;. &quot;Wanting&quot; Time level gear and &quot;needing&quot; Time level gear are two differen things. I disagree with all of my strength that GoD is off limits to anyone without Time level gear. All one has to do is read this forum and see the people explaining which zones they are in and they are in only ornate...or lesser gear. THEY do not have Time gear and THEY are in GoD. That means the sky is falling cries I heard on THIS particular subject were bogus yet again.<br />
<br />
It's one thing to hear the Time equipped shaman expressing that they are having issues with how zones are &quot;tuned&quot; and that encounters were not appropriately designed for a shaman's presence to be worthwhile. That's one thing. It's a different thing to spin that into----don't go to GoD unless you are Time equipped because GoD was only built for the Time equipped players. It wasn't. :) It's not for the timid, but lesser than Time equipment IS doable. Class balance is the thing up in the air.</div></div><hr />

Why would people wait and wait and wait in raids for their chance at a BoW dropping when they could just &quot;quest&quot; for it like the casuals? RZtW doesn't always drop the BoW, Snoww. And just because it dropped, it doesn't mean that all the classes that wanted it got it. Only one player did. That means the raiders have to keep doing RZtW to get that BoW if they want it for everyone who can use it. However, if the quest you suggest is in game, why would they do it the raiding way? Sorry, it still doesn't add up. If you have a choice between questing for it or raiding for it, your guild would tell you to quest for the damn thing. It's EASIER than raiding for it. Like I've been saying, people will choose the path of LEAST resistance, not greater resistance, to obtain the SAME THING. That's why the &quot;things&quot; are different to begin with.</div></div><hr />

And if you don't want to converse with me about things that I've stated, don't quote what I wrote as the preface to your comment. <br />
<br />
You gotta step outside of your own skull sometimes and realize people are NOT fixated on you, and if they aren't, it's not because they're at fault somehow.<br />
<br />
I don't think people are fixated on me. I made the mistake of thinking you read the conversation between all the parties involved. You took things that I said, quoted them, and then commented in order to counter the points I'd made. However, you did not take into consideration what I was addressing. Just like now. <br />
<br />
By the way, you still refuse to really address other people's points and just repeat your own. That's not making or advancing an argument, it's just repetition.<br />
<br />
What point haven't I addressed, Blarg? People want another vehicle to get the SAME thing as the raider and it's just not practical. You made comments about just such a path that you wish existed in the game and I have been stating why that is not a good idea. You keep repeating why it is a good idea (to you) but I'm not allowed to repeat why it is a bad idea (to me). Yes, double standards are fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">Why would people wait and wait and wait in raids for their chance at a BoW dropping when they could just &quot;quest&quot; for it like the casuals? RZtW doesn't always drop the BoW, Snoww. And just because it dropped, it doesn't mean that all the classes that wanted it got it. Only one player did. That means the raiders have to keep doing RZtW to get that BoW if they want it for everyone who can use it. However, if the quest you suggest is in game, why would they do it the raiding way? Sorry, it still doesn't add up. If you have a choice between questing for it or raiding for it, your guild would tell you to quest for the damn thing. It's EASIER than raiding for it. Like I've been saying, people will choose the path of LEAST resistance, not greater resistance, to obtain the SAME THING. That's why the &quot;things&quot; are different to begin with.<br />
<br />
Not everyone likes questing.  Look at the Coldain Shawl quests.  The final reward is a really nice FT3 + focus effect shoulder item.  I would guess that 50% of the classes that can use it will never see it.  Why?  Because the quest to get it is long and, frankly, a pain in the ass.  <br />
<br />
Many players want to log in, go somewhere, kill something, loot something, and log out.  That is fun for them.  If you can get 69 other people like that together, you have the makings if a raiding guild.  True, there are other skills required, but having a group of people that like to play the game the same way is important.  There are also players that find it intensely satisfying to scour the Bazaar for weeks and spend hours camping spawns in order to collect materials for a single click of the combine button.  That is their fun.<br />
<br />
What I see that EQ has done is to make only one sytle of play profitable.  If you arent willing to dump 30+ hours a week into a video game then you arent worthy of the mystical drop or Ubertude.  Alternate entry quests allow players access to zones that they might not normally have access too; why cant there be simmilar provision made for items and weapons?  Im not saying that everyone who does the quest should have access to a Blade of War, but why not something close?  Sure, there are ornate drops that I can buy in the Bazaar, but I dont have 150K to dump on a BP mold, nor do I have an easy way to get it.  Why cant I quest something that is close, but not quite?  Sure, it might take me a month to quest, but thats certainly less time that it would take to farm the cash for a BP pattern in the Bazaar (and thats provided that there is a pattern to buy once I have the cash).<br />
<br />
I dont see a problem with trying to use quests to help narrow the gap between the haves and the have-nots.  After all...it is EVERQUEST...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">O'Toole, I'm only one of a number of people who disagree with you  that you repeatedly accuse of not paying attention to you in this thread alone.<br />
<br />
It's really quite possible to disagree with you without being inattentive or in someway not following; in fact, your own posts are not shining examples of attentiveness, as you are just tending to repeat yourself ad infinitum while often refusing to address what anyone else's concerns or bringing up straw-man false arguments so you can then easily defeat your own constructs.<br />
<br />
Example:  you repeatedly stress that nobody would raid for items if they could be gotten in a single group without ever acknowledging the bleeding obvious:  things don't have to be any easier to get in a single group than they are in a raid.  You can make the drops for a single group just as rare as the drops for a single raid.  You can make quests just as tricky or time consuming as raiding.  (Which begs the question:  how hard IS it to get raid gear that's astronomically better than single-group gear anyway -- answer, often not very hard at all). <br />
<br />
Another example:  you repeatedly make it sound like raids will cease to exist if there are alternatives, without giving much thought to whether raiding really should be the be-all and end-all that it is in the game today in the first place.  Despite your protests to the contrary, it clear was not always this way.  Getting a VP key was TRIVIAL compared to getting elemental flag for a great many people, as an example.  And if you couldn't get there -- there was still excellent experience AND loot both in places like HS and Sebilis and, after the revamp, Chardok.  It doesn't have to be raid-or-die.  And if there becomes less pressure in the game to even raid or quit, there are a lot of people that are not panicked about that at all.  Huge raids are just not the only paradigm for how a game should work.<br />
<br />
Only a determined argumentativeness or lack of imagination could make them seem so.  I wouldn't blame you for one, but think you bear responsibility for the other, especially since you seem to be skirting issues so much and constantly telling people that they're not paying attention, don't follow, or are somehow just not at your level or logic, alertness, or argumentation when they sinply disagree with you or hold different values than you do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">And thus we come full circle back to the topic of the thread. Why does Gates suck? I dunno. It would SEEM to be the answer that the casual players are looking for, as well as a nice set of options for Raiders. Lets take a look, shall we?<br />
<br />
1 groupable decent (better than VT) loot. Yup, its in there. <br />
<br />
Blazz, with all due respect please link me the Gates equivalent of the Goldenrod for a casual sk.  My new sk just got a Goldenrod (2+ years old from Ssra I think) and it is the most incredible weapon I've ever seen.  My sk is a blender now and the double-crit 600 pt lifetaps are insane.  I can state with confidence I now have a weapon better than any casual player had, has or will ever have, no matter if EQ lasts another 15 years.  The difference between this 2 year old weapon and the best droppable weapon (which I was using on my previous sk) is a massive difference in dps, stats and proc.  It is flat out insane.  I have no clue what sk weapons are available in PoP but if the Goldenrod is any example I think my jaw would hit the floor.  It is so much fun, my only regret is that I didn't get to earn it myself.<br />
<br />
<br />
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T PUT IN THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Iz, wake up. Your &quot;casual&quot; 5 years of play does not equal the &quot;hardcore&quot; 5 years of play! Your hours spent are not equal, so your gear should not be equal!<br />
<br />
Erm, yeah.  If a raider spends 100 hours in 2 weeks and a casual player spends 100 hours in 2 months, that's not the same amount of time?  The casual player's time is worth less why exactly?<br />
<br />
O'Toole, it's clear debating with you is pointless as you tend to use as much white noise as possible to cover the inadequacies in your arguments. BlargX has creamed you repeatedly with cold, hard logic and a cool demeanor that all your static is not going to refute any time soon. Blazz and I have an ongoing debate on this issue but at least I respect him despite our differences of opinion on the subject.  I'd have more entertainment debating a brick wall than continuing this futility with you.<br />
<br />
BlargX, you seem to understand more than most what the &quot;hardcore&quot; casual player wants with single group content.  We don't have the luxury of 72 other people, all well equipped with full spellbooks, to carry us through every encounter.  If my friend screws up the cc on his chanter, we wipe.  If I can't hold aggro on my sk, we're going to wipe.  If I blow the healing on my cleric (formerly shaman), we're going to wipe.  If we wipe we typically don't rez until the end of the night (no epic cleric yet) and deleveling is not uncommon.  The satisfaction of winning on our own against the odds and equipping ourselves on our own is great- this is why we play.  Pity you're on another server and a raider, we'd love to have you in our crew.  Take care.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">Thanks for the kind word. :) <br />
<br />
I'm full of respect for people who have the guts to go out and try hard things and figure them out and take risks doing them.  Now that takes guts and initiative.  I've died so many times and taken so many unrezzed deaths while exploring EQ and trying to figure out how to get places and kill tricky mobs, and then often share the knowledge with friends who can't believe the things I've paid the price to figure out, that it blows my mind how many people refuse to take risks and are outraged at a death or too terrified to even try anything.  (GoD and PoW certainly come to mind right away these days; Chardok and Cazic Thule[in both its incarnations] were interesting zones separating the gutsy from the bok bok's in earlier days.)  And I certainly find more of the chickens to be raiders than casual players.  Casual players HAVE to get out and about in order to get the plat that people in top guilds or with all their flags have falling out of the sky for them like mana from heaven.  <br />
<br />
I bump into people all the time who freak out that they die even in elemental raids, and I think, what are you smoking?  I remember back when HoT was new, I would literally often die EVERY PULL.  You had to get right up under the belly of dragons to make debuffs or slows stick, meanwhile eating up AE that were very scary for their day and melee that would eat you more or less instantly if you got aggro.  I remember when Plane of Sky was so dangerous some people would lose two levels while there!<br />
<br />
When people point to some guy in some guild and say, well, he's in guild X that's doing content Y, therefore he's gutsy or deserving or smart or knowledgeable or a good player, I think, well, either you're one of the least observant people around, you're full of baloney, or you're very new to the game.<br />
<br />
If it's true this game is not brain surgery, then it's all the more true that being one of 72 or more is no diploma of any sort.  I can't even begin to count how many people I've known and known of who got into top guilds because of a friend or relative, who had all their spells before they started their first character in EQ, etc.  <br />
<br />
I raid five nights a week and am an officer myself, but please, let's not get carried away singing the praises of raiders, or talk about how hard they have to work.  <br />
<br />
Please, 95% of them plus are followers, not leaders or innovators.  <br />
<br />
They're just people who chose ONE PARTICULAR PATH.<br />
<br />
They're people with the advantage of being able to play contiguous blocks of time and/or quite often people with the advantage of in-game connections.  They may also be people willing to put up with the crappy dynamics of dealing with a bunch of jerks who don't really care to be around for any other reason but their own self-improvement and self-interest.<br />
<br />
And that's one welcome thing the person who doesn't devote himself to the mass-raid game has over the person who thinks or proclaims that mass raiding is the only way a game could or should be -- when he does meet up with the people he meets up with on a regular basis, he can be pretty confident they're friends, or as close to friends as you're going to get online.   I've always found that anyone and everyone is very capable of asking for favors of your time, energy, plat, whatever.  But if you want friends who really come through for you and are legitimately cool to be around, one guy you bumped into somewhere random in the game, perhaps as a casual player, is worth 100 guildies any day of the week.<br />
<br />
Guess I worked myself up a bit there, but really, this constant turning of everything a raider does into some sort of magnificent accomplishment or proof of worth has just been so over the top for so many years!  And positing what a  raider does as being of so much value in comparison to what other people do who just play differently is a crock.<br />
<br />
I think, in fact, one of the sad things I've seen over the years is how friendships dry up once people get in one guild or another, and feel compelled and pressured to hang only with guildies, or just too lazy or fearful to maintain old friendships or start new ones.  They get told who their enemies are, and learn what it is they're supposed to bark if they want their leaders to throw them a fish or a ball they can balance on their nose.  They go from real friends to becoming just another cog in the wheel, a number, an anonymous player_01 doing task_01 at time_01.  Sometimes you can really feel the loneliness of the crowd.  <br />
<br />
People are people; time spent is time spent.  <br />
<br />
Games shouldn't reward playstyle choices.  They should reward ability and cleverness, and innovation, and maybe, in a social game, sociability.  Great heaping gobs of players going against super mobs don't necessarily do anything like that, not for most of the players.</div></div><hr />

That's not the SOLE reason raiders raid but I'm being honest here. Raiders who raid boss mobs and find their loot tables to &quot;suck&quot; don't raid those mobs anymore. They move onto mobs where the reward is worth the risk/time spent. If the risk isn't worth the reward, they won't take the risk nor waste their time. Don't pigeonhole raiders into having to raid just for raiding's sake. It's not a very realistic view. There's nothing &quot;fun&quot; about raiding and winding up with -0- at the end of the raid for anyone in the raid. That's part of why people who raid PoTime and find that most of the stuff that drops is rotting, move on to GoD. They've devoured what is there. If they wanted to raid purely for raiding's sake, they wouldn't have moved...and game developers would have had no reason to introduce expansions. We'd all still be level 50 hanging out with Naggy, Vox, and the Planes of Antonica.<br />
<br />

<br />
.<br />
<br />
Hey believe it or not i was actually agreeing with most of your post :).<br />
<br />
What you posted above is actually a refreshing change to hear a raider state that he raids for gear.<br />
Look back on a lot of these previous types of post and you'll see an awful lot of raiders stating that its not the gear they raid for but the fun,social interaction etc.<br />
As for there being nothing fun about raiding Time and most stuff rotting that also applies to casual players.<br />
What do i get from 3 hours in BoT ? Exp basically thats it and its no fun which is why i tend to start lots of new chars off.<br />
There is not a lot of FUN left in EQ once you hit 65 and get AA's its just a grind.Yes i know its a grind to 65 but at least you get to experience new zones etc.<br />
Problem is lvl 65 was introduced with PoP and PoP is really the only place to get to 65 pre LDoN,GoD.<br />
What i think sony should do is to actually upgrade old zones rather than them just turning into places to farm or be left empty.<br />
<br />
I am actually pretty poorly equipped but i get by fine in LDoN Normal and Hard (Although no way as main healer in Hard).BoT I can do fine in etc etc if i want to get better gear i realise i need to raid for it but like i said not my scene.<br />
<br />
I shall probably get slaughtered for this next comment but ***.<br />
One of the biggest problems in this game is jealousy :(<br />
Some raider links for example a Times Antithesis and someone else sees that and thinks ooh i want but im not willing to put in the hours and hours of playtime to get it so EQ should let me get it in a group setting.<br />
So then we get the type of thread that this 1 has turned into.<br />
If you want the gear go raid if you dont want to raid then youre not going to get the gear as simple as that.If youre not going to raid then you wont NEED (notice need not want) the gear.<br />
Although you could argue that a lot of raiders dont help themselves in this arguement by whining when people get reasonable gear out of LDoN.<br />
Also a guilds using for example a Shaman to tank Fennin *** was the point of that ?<br />
EQ i dont think was originally designed as a raiding game but thats really what it has turned into you just have to accept that and live with it or hit cancel billing.<br />

Simple, someone put &quot;uber&quot;, &quot;raid&quot; and &quot;casual&quot; in the same sentence.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">Nothing exists in isolation.  When you talk about a zone and a style of play, it gets compared to other styles of play and zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">Raiding does have a place in the game. By logic items from raidable mobs should be distinct items. (won't say better but using the term distinct instead or special) Since if more than one group is needed to take down a mob, then that mob should arguably drop a &quot;better&quot; sort of reward than the groupable mob. <br />
<br />
What the problem is though with pop, raiding has the monopoly of all the stats and effects.  Since raiding has such a required hardcorism to push through the content, its seen as justified that it does have the monopoly over all the stats and effects. Expansions have used a method of restricting content so people keep playing until the next expansion. What that means is a artifical stop to progress like flagging, or this is how they have done it. With this has come the coming of more hardcorism. <br />
<br />
As a side note, methods like flagging have been used in the past, ie to restrict access to VP the undead sinew I think dropped of Trakonon. And in Velious Sleepers tomb required a kill of each Velious dragon per person. <br />
<br />
The problem isn't that zones are restricted, its just that raiding and the zones to which raiders get access to hold the monopoly over all stats and effects. It causes a divide between the raider and the grouper. To get access to the 100 hp items it requires raids or tackles with the barriers which SoE implemented in the past to slow down progress. Massive hp mobs for example. My thought of a solution to this months ago was some sort of group progress infrastructure. However, from what it sounds like on these posts it sounds like all is needed are options to upgrade gear to the standard of doing GoD.  A medium Ldon, or a tone down of the hard ldon, or a removal of the time limit on hard Ldon could be the solution. Hmm I guess that makes sense why they are releasing new Ldon dungeons perhaps on Legends. Only speculating not played in a while.</div></div><hr />

A casual player can get to this, eventually, and its indisputably a 1-group deal.  <br />
<br />
It's always been my opinion that GoD is a step in the right direction for the non-raiding player.  However, it's still not nearly enough content. <br />
They need to beef up LDoN with more difficulty options with better rewards, scaling up to Ikkinz trial difficulty, and even beyond if you like.  This would give non-raiders a lot more options, while providing tough meaningful content for raiders in their off-time.<br />
<br />
as far as scaling the loot goes,  Raid targets need to have better drops than single group stuff.  But not by very much.  The real balance between raid and single group drops should be in the frequency and difficulty, not the quality.</div></div><hr />

The problem with scaling LDON up or past Ikkenz is no non-raiding tank would live there.  If a 11k warrior (in Elemental/Time gear)  gets shredded there, how would a 9.5k warrior do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well, the point of scaling it up that high, is that it gives that single group something to work towards.  If you put the best gear on anything easier than what the best group struggles with, then it will over-balance things in favor of the non-raider, like what i think O'Toole was trying to say.<br />
<br />
Someone else stated that the problem with GoD is the level of gear it takes to survive there, and how that type of gear doesn't really exist outside of raid situations.  Scaling up the difficulty of LDoNs would help solve this problem.  A group could fight at the difficulty they can handle, and get gear upgrades accordingly.  They could move up in difficulty as they grew stronger.</div></div><hr />

Stick a quarter in, get a boring instanced zone that appears out of the void and is mass generated, and kill xx number of creatures, get a requisite named and leave.  Zone &quot;disappears&quot;.  <br />
<br />
There's a boundary, and at some point the game crosses from an &quot;adventure world&quot; into a soulless design more typically the product of bean counters and code monkeys than game designers.  <br />
<br />
I don't like game design by code monkeys and bean counters.  <br />
<br />
Neither LDON or GoD has appealed to me for this reason.  <br />
<br />
I miss exploring EQ like when Kunark came out.  Folks were so juiced about expansions then, and it really was a big wide world with massive new content all over.  Nothing seemed off limits.  The only limitation was your ability to avoid getting squished by content.  The one zone with a key quest, VP, didn't stand out much, and that quest was far more tolerable than PoP flagging (I don't count HS and Sebilis - those quests were insignificant even then).  Esp. since most of the VP quest could be soloed.  I enjoyed that quest.<br />
<br />
Things are so different now, and I think it sucks much more as a result.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At any rate, its certainly not 1-Groupable. Just because there isnt a comparable 1-groupable drop in Gates doesnt mean my point is wrong Iz. <br />
<br />
Right, that's my point, it's a weapon that's TWO YEARS OLD raid content that a PoP+ raider wouldn't lean over to loot yet it smokes anything a non-raider will ever have access to via the current single group content.  And yes, your point is wrong if there's no upgrade path for the non-raider.  Great, you can link me a few 100hp+ slots out of Gates that may or may not be 1-groupable depending on your gear.  <br />
<br />
Believe or not, some of us play melees and use weapons as well.  Ever wonder why you see so many people running around with Windblades and WMBS's?  It's because they're the best droppable weapons in the game for those classes and they have no other upgrade path.<br />
<br />
Sorry Iz. Your nose is STILL lying on the floor, bud. Sigh, and all to spite your face. Still, though, its fun to do a little raid here and ther and score a nice item isnt it. <br />
<br />
/snicker<br />
Call it spite all you want, Blazz, I'm simply sticking by my principles. They want to create another expansion where the casual player only has access to 8/16 zones? That's fine, just don't expect me to buy it.  I like experiencing content as well as the next person and subsidizing someone else's enjoyment at my expense isn't very productive.  I pay for the entertainment value it will offer my friends and I and thus far it doesn't sound like we're missing much.  <br />

Keep singing its praises though, maybe others will buy it and drive up sales so that SOE continues to think flagged expansions are the wave of the future.  No one makes money selling to the mass market after all...</div></div><hr />

I can raid and I do raid -- five nights are week if not more, for a long time now.  But you know what?  It's a bore.  I'd much rather just be hanging with a handful of friends, each one of us vital to the outcome of a battle, than  yet another raider or even an officer in a big machine.  Unfortunately, if I want to see more than a small shadow of what the game is and what its rewards are, there's only one predetermined path to get there.  You could plot out on a graph exactly how to get there, and like most things where you only have one outcome and you know what the ending is before you start, that path is dull and the stops along the way are pretty homogenous.  EQ has fetishized one-size-fits-all gameplay; it can be like trying to cram a square block in a round hole.</div></div><hr />

Look up in the thread Iz, folks are posting pretty nice stuff dropping in 1 group trials. If you examine it closely, Gates is directed MORE at single group content than raid content, really. <br />
<br />
This doesnt mean I like the expansion. Its kind of &quot;over the top&quot; in many ways. It IS a long way to run. It IS hard. The mobs ARE beasts that shred you if you make the tiniest error. They hosed a lot of classes, no denying it. Its a long way from a solution. But its a step in YOUR direction, if you look closer and stop being so obtuse.<br />
<br />
And there isnt a reasonable upgrade path for casual players to compete in Vxed and Tipt. I understand that, Iz, and I AGREE WITH YOU. THATS why I have been saying its time to open up the EPs (or at least Sol Ro, for now). So casual players can gear up and hear to Gates. You think SOE wants the casual players quitting in droves because Gates is too hard and they cant compete there? Come on man, this company that pretty much just created &quot;PL yourself to 60, and heres the path of zones&quot;. The put it in the patch message.

wake up Iz. They want the Top 5 or so guilds on each server to move out of PoP for the most part, so its freed up for the rest of teh people. Then, it opens.

<br />
I haven't seen a 1-groupable weapon yet that beats Goldenrod, that was just the example I chose.  I realize there is some nice gear dropping in Gates if you have the gear to take the pounding already, which we don't and won't for a long while if ever.  Gates is worse than LDoN hards as far as difficulty goes, right?  Well we're struggling to beat those as is, which is why my shaman is bye-bye and replaced w/ a cleric.  If we're not geared to the point yet where we can win LDoN hards I fail to see what good Gates is for us.  There is no upgrade path to go from bazaar -&gt; Gates-ready.<br />
<br />
You think SOE wants the casual players quitting in droves because Gates is too hard and they cant compete there?<br />
<br />
Rational thought would say, no, that is crazy.  But SOE is anything but rational.  These are also the people that thought giving shamans a rare 1500hp healing spell would solve all their healing problems.  The anecdotes about SOE's cluelessness about their own game are legion.<br />
<br />
You REALLY think they are gonna leave the casual players hangin out to dry man? <br />
<br />
Yes, actions speak louder than words.  I'm not in the design meetings at SOE nor do I get to talk to their sales and marketing people.  They appear to be trying to corner the hardcore niche market in much the same way that Apple tries to corner their own tiny niche w/o ever succeeding at going after the mass market.  It makes no sense to me whatsoever but that's their goal as far as I can tell.<br />
<br />

No, it's idiotic marketing because once you've lost a customer most do not ever come back.  If someone screws you over (perceived or real), you're likely not going to give them your business again.  <br />
<br />
I'm not buying Gates (or any other flagged expansions) and when we &quot;win&quot;, we're gone forever. I won't so much as look at EQ2 strictly based on the awful design decisions they've made in EQ1. The window of opportunity SOE has to try and salvage what casual players are left before WoW is closing fast.  And this presumes that their niche market (raiders) will all stay, which I think is a naive and highly optimistic assumption.<br />
<br />
<br />
Principles? Wait a sec, didnt you ASK for 1 groupable CONTENT. What are these flags man? They are NOT raid event flags. They are basically SINGLE GROUP MINI QUEST ADVENTURES!<br />
<br />
It's flagged content, the majority of which I will never be geared well enough to succeed at reliably and have fun doing so.  The 1 groupable part is great, the flags are a bad idea continued from PoP that is just pure laziness on the dev's parts and sheer stupidity from a marketing standpoint.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">There is too much anger here. Chill folks. The EP's won't be opened up. Get over it.<br />
<br />
The flaw in the argument that they need to be opened up is shown by guilds on every server chasing progression. Perhaps if no guilds were killing mobs and seeking to better themselves the devs would wonder..... but why should they if the system in place is working? It is providing challenging content for guilds that enjoy raiding. Whether raiding is a good thing or not is not the argument. Raiding is here, and it is a part of EQ.<br />
<br />
So, there is progression, it works, and a large number of people are taking advantage of it. SoE is under no obligation to provide either EP gear or EP access to the casual-non-flag-chasing-non-raider. This includes Sol Ro Tower.<br />
<br />
Why? It's been said 45 times, but because pretty much prior to those zones Ornate isn't a necessity. Better equipment is needed to survive in the EP's, not pre-EP-PoP.<br />
<br />
/shrug. It's like the blind arguing with the deaf, but I did want to put my point across. You can flame away, but arguing about it isn't going to resolve what you perceive as issues.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">I think it's very fair to say that Gates trials are way harder than hard LDON's.  Even the sewers ones.<br />
<br />
Plus, there's even less variety in the few Gates trials that people without elemental or VT flags can hope to complete.  Unless, perhaps, they get themselves a chanter.  But it's just as much a design failure to require poorly equipped people to use a chanter to pass trials as it is to require time level people to use a chanter(or else increase their chance of failure tremendously).<br />
<br />
With their comparatively great difficulty and extreme lack of variety, the few GoD trials that non-flagged people can get through do not really serve as either a good route for advancement or a particularly good time for the non-flagged.  <br />
<br />
Even in the top guilds, many people are refusing to go to GoD and either leaving EQ or getting kicked out of their guilds because they find the trials just too hard to too dull or feel their class has no place in them; that of course applies all the more to people with nowhere remotely near their level of gear.<br />
<br />
Now, there ARE some few mobs in regular GoD zones that can be killed for some pretty decent loot.  I would recommend those over trials for a great many people, as many can be done with just a small group or less than that, and sometimes the reward is not bad at all.  For instance, I'm wearing boots and sleeves I got in Riwwi(bagged my ornate sleeves and boots) that are at a halfway point in hitpoints, etc. between ornate and elemental.  <br />
<br />
I would also recommend getting spells and items from Bot minis, which are one-groupable without superior gear, and pretty fun to do with one group.  You can also occasionally get together with a few groups to try the BoT towers.  That 100-ish HP hat with FT2 is nice!  And that's where the greatstaff drops that I think Litgruv was talking about.  Plus 100 hitpoint shoulders, etc etc.  It's one thing to not like raiding MUCH...but just a little here and there, at whatever your tolerance level is, is probably doable by most anyone.  Who knows?   Could pay off now and then.<br />
<br />
Another idea -- if you can get at least flags up to the Sol Ro level, not only can you start getting ornate(which has some very good focuses, even though the hitpoints are a joke compared to what flagged people get), you can try some Sol Ro mini bosses or minor nameds.  You can one-group Galremos for some nice shoulders that have, oh, 100 hp or so, I think, and can farm him by spawning him over and over.  This is quite doable once you're flagged.  You can also kill Xuzl with pretty low numbers of people.  I killed him in a little raid of 14 people.  Nobody had a BoW, few of us had weapons worth much crowing about at all, and only one guy had armor worth a darn.  A cleric and I were the only healer!  And I still wear the shield.  It has my favorite focus in the game for shamans -- detrimental haste, which gave me a big immediate boost in how fast I could malos and slow things.  It was HUGE for me, and doable with 14 people.  The Sol Ro zone does require quite a few flags, but it's just one alternate place to get things.<br />
<br />
And there's no law that says you have to get every flag in a month or do it at a pace that makes you miserable.  It's a very nice place to shoot for, though, because ornate is a very big deal when you don't have any, and the Sol Ro zone is the one where healers finally start getting a number of drops -- the flags on the way there don't cough up much for us shamans generally.  But the Sol Ro zone has lots of healer goodies, and ornate for all.<br />
<br />
Anyway, there are ways to get some reasonably decent gear here and there in scattershot ways, and it can be fun and a challenge to do it.  But, it would be nice if there was more of this in the game.  As it is now, on some servers, BoT towers and minis are perma-camped, and it's pretty easy to have Sol Ro minis down(though not all the ornate droppers down!) and have others camping the mobs you want in GoD.  You really have to do a bit of searching and have a bit of luck to gear up if you're not well-flagged.  The game could use some more opportunities for people to do that.</div></div><hr />

Karshak, I do not think you are correct here. I think they will open up the EPs via a &quot;back-door&quot; quest eventually. Its just the natural progression of the game.

Quick question for you: who got the attention of the devs for a perceived class balance issue that resulted in a real fix to the class: Warriors or Shamans.  Better keep quiet, I'm sure they'll fix you eventually...<br />

The major surprise to me is that they apparently think if they anger enough people to quit that they'll leave and come back for EQ2, which I find incredible.  Sales and marketing people that foolish need to go on a speaking tour.</div></div><hr />

Don't play a melee much eh?  The only thing better about the CoO is that it's got a very slight advantage in ratio.  The hp, mana, stats, AC and proc on the GR are superior.  The proc alone on the GR makes it superior for an SK.  150 hp lifetap proc that has 2 chances to crit heal for 300 and can even combine for a double crit heal of 600 when wielded by an SK w/ the SCF/ToL aa's.<br />

This is EXACTLY how MANY people feel.<br />
<br />
I for one could certainly be considered a &quot;hardcore&quot; player if such a thing is judged simply by how many hours per day you play.  I've had so many offers to join Guilds that I lost count.  I've been on raids . . . successful raids.  It's just not that fun.  I know that these raids would have been successful had I not been there.<br />
<br />
However, the folks I normally play with on an every day basis . . . each of us can look back over the last couple weeks and pick out situations where our presence was the difference in winning and losing an encounter.  That to me is where the &quot;fun&quot; is.  Making a difference.<br />
<br />
Should my access to high quality gear be any less because I choose to put myself in a situation where I actually affect the outcome of the battle?  I feel the answer should be no, but I fear that the true answer will wind up being yes.</div></div><hr />

I think to an extent this is right, however, it is without a lot of effects of elemental gear, and the amount of time to get all that gear and augment<br />
it is obscene. Plus, when elemental people augment their gear it is again a jump better.<br />
<br />
I think the only thing a bit unrealistic is wanting all zones released, sure its following the SoE mentality however its been that way since Kunark, where some zones have been locked. The GoD thing sounds actually pretty good if they have a group progress thing via flagging. I would have stayed if  instead of the Ldon thing, you had like 20 dungeons which were handcrafted (with imagination) that you had to unlock to see.<br />
<br />
I do see the argument though from the casual players that the entry point to doing these GoD grouping things requires the standard of gear of perhaps VT raiding, which the bazaar does not match and neither does ornate. All is needed is the addition of perhaps the addition of new  Ldon dungeons which drop some of these 100 hp items, or a tonedown of the hard adventures, via removing the time limit or making them hit 600 max.<br />
Then the problem is that it then perhaps obsoletes VT level guilds starting out. Perhaps though if most guilds don't need VT, that could be revamped as a groupable area.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd much rather just be hanging with a handful of friends, each one of us vital to the outcome of a battle, than yet another raider or even an officer in a big machine&quot;<br />
I agree, the 72 man raids in pop suck. Guilds are much more impersonal and too hardcore orientated because of the content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u113"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p113">Don't play a melee much eh?  The only thing better about the CoO is that it's got a very slight advantage in ratio.  The hp, mana, stats, AC and proc on the GR are superior.  The proc alone on the GR makes it superior for an SK.  150 hp lifetap proc that has 2 chances to crit heal for 300 and can even combine for a double crit heal of 600 when wielded by an SK w/ the SCF/ToL aa's.<br />
<br />
<br />
Um, this is one handed, so you are adding a shield. Don't start in with the 1H vs 2H DPS either. SKs are not a big DPS class, and we both know it. Taking the stats of the shields into account, even the &quot;bazaar&quot; ones, this is a far better weapon, man. Please. I am not a n00bie. This proc is a 125 dd with a stun component. Its huge.<br />
<br />
Gimee a break Iz, ok? You are losing these arguements, dude, and do you know why? Because I am MOSTLY on your side, I really, really am. Thats why Blarg isnt shredding my posts. He may not 100% agree with me, but he can see that I am OBVIOUSLY in favor of expanding the potential gear/zone limitations for casual players. <br />
<br />
Please, lets just drop it ok? I honestly think your a great guy, and I would LOVE to be playing with you on my server. I would group with you constantly man, I can tell you know the game and the classes you play. But you cannot EXPECT a miracle change overnight. Its adjusting, its shaping, can't you see that? They have already adjusted the Ikky trials. I think Gates is a &quot;work in progress&quot;, like every expansion. We are the Beta testers. We have ALWAYS known that. <br />
<br />
Soon I imagine you will see more oppertunities for a casual player to advance. And I will bet my account that at LEAST Sol Ro will be &quot;open&quot; (one group questable flag) by Labor Day. Until then, don't be so quick to dismiss the oppertunites to advance that already exist. <br />
<br />
I am NOT a huge Gates fan, because at MY level in this game, a Shaman is a serious 6th wheel. But for you, some of the early trials, some of the earlier zones, there is gear there for you. Gear that will allow you to advance. Did you go into Old Seb the day Kunark came out man? Of course not. Even when you got your key, if you were under 50, did you go there? Of course not. Why? You werent ready. The reasons you werent ready for OS then, and the reasons you arent ready for Tipt now are different. Then it was levels + gear. Now is straight gear. SOE has practically taken levels OUT of the picture when factoring in stuff for its content. AAs and Gear. Thats EQ now. I am not saying this is good, or right, but its the WAY IT IS. But to sit there and say &quot;I wont buy Gates because the ONE GROUP content is too hard&quot; is a ridiculous excuse for a guy CRYING for more one-group content.</div></div><hr />

I miss where he's giving raiders a bad name.  I totally agree with him on that.<br />
GoD is an expansion that does not only add more of the same content, but actually new, more difficult then before content.  And yes, only the top 10 % of players will most likely see it right now.  Wait a couple of years, and even the casual crowd will get there, same as it happened with ToV, Sssra/VT, and the higher planes.<br />
Half of the players by now probably have a 65 character for whom 90% of &quot;old&quot; EQ is trivial.  So new stuff has to be challenging to be of any use.  And for once SOE has decided to devote 80 % of the expansion to tricky stuff, not 20 % like in Luclin, or 50% like in PoP.<br />
What I don't understand is why Iz even bought the expansion since it so quite obviously is not playing to his interests.  A lot of this sounds like buyer's remorse to me.</div></div><hr />

We're hijacking a hijack of a hijack here, but I'll bite.  I didn't see it was 1 handed, that makes it not even worthy of consideration.  The dps hit you take wielding a 1hander is huge.

As for the dps comment, most people (esp. devs) are way out of touch w/ the bazaar game.  I parse constantly both in LDoN and on stuff w/ my guild (epic hits and the like) and I'm always in the top dps w/ my old sk.  Weapon itemization is so bad at the bazaar level that epic rogues, epic monks and just about anything outside of AM3/EQ rangers w/ a stonewood bow I can meet or exceed on my old sk (in sig) w/ no offensive AA's other than spell crits and 1 level of melee crits.  This is while both pulling and tanking btw.  It doesn't make sense but like the devs have a clue.<br />

I fail to see why you think I'm losing these arguments- my point is simply to raise the issue and get people thinking &quot;this isn't fun and it doesn't have to be this way&quot; instead of &quot;it's been this way for 2 years, it should always be this way!&quot;.<br />

<br />
I wish I had an account worth anything to put up as collateral on your bet but since I don't raid, I don't.  Like I said in another thread, if SOE ever does this I will come back here even if I'm already in WoW and post a big mea culpa.<br />
<br />
Now is straight gear. SOE has practically taken levels OUT of the picture when factoring in stuff for its content. AAs and Gear. Thats EQ now. I am not saying this is good, or right, but its the WAY IT IS.<br />
You're dead right, but things needn't be set in stone.  EQ is supposedly a dynamic world, there's no reason things can't be changed.  We're not talking something really earth shattering or game changing like a 2k fast heal or fixed-length invis for shamans after all.<br />
<br />
<br />
 But to sit there and say &quot;I wont buy Gates because the ONE GROUP content is too hard&quot; is a ridiculous excuse for a guy CRYING for more one-group content.<br />
The main reason we're not buying it is that the content is flagged- this is a dealbreaker.  Don't market an expansion as having 16 zones when in fact there's only 8 for the non-raider, maybe 10 if they can pass the trials.  The fact that there's no clear bazaar -&gt; Gates gear progression makes it an easy decision.  <br />
<br />
Also, don't cast aspersions on my crew that we're &quot;crying&quot; that something is too hard- I'm tanking LDoN hards w/ less than 7k hps raid buffed and &lt; 1500 AC and my only major complaint is that the time limit is rough on us because we wipe so much.  But we get right back up and keep trying because we're determined to win and we enjoy beating things people say we can't.  Tonight a friend and I are going to try and 2 box the King in Chardok for my cleric's epic.  Yeah, yeah, that's way easy until you try it in bazaar rags.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all, this is exactly what this thread is about, &quot;Why Gates isnt fun&quot;. Available loot comparisons is a valid part of that debate. Second of all, I would SERIOUSLY like to see some parses on GR vs that Cudgel. Seriously. I bet you would have MORE AC, MORE hps, and do VERY NEARLY as much damage with that 1HB. And arent you a DE SK? Thats what your magelo says. Now, you probably have the 2H Bash AA, which is fine, but still. Even if you end up with 10-20 less DPS, isnt the increased HPs and AC worth something? I mean, its not really your JOB to kill the mobs. You stand there and take damage, and keep the mob from damaging the rest of the group, right? But whatever, /shrug, let someone else argue this at this point. I asked a couple SK-PAL types in my guild which they would rather have, and they ALL said the big 1HB + shield. Many PALs switched to that Mace when they got one, from WAY WAY better 2Hs than GR. Of course, we have access to the nice Knight FB 120 hp shield off the mini-mini in Fire (I think thats the stats), maybe that makes a difference. Also raid Knights arent a big DPS class, they tank. Aggro generation isnt a problem for knights, either, so damage isnt that big a deal. Whats 10-30 dps when a Wizard is blowing big holes in stuff and a Rogue is BSing for 2k. Even in single XP groups or LDoN, the Knights arent relied on for DPS. I don't think its THAT different at the &quot;bazaar-plus-a-couple-raid-items-cause-I-decided-I-wanted-em&quot; level. (/snicker again, this just cracks me up, Iz with an item off a Ssra Raid mob, in fact, a whole event, Cursed cycle, LOL, kills me)<br />
<br />

Don't market an expansion as having 16 zones when in fact there's only 8 for the non-raider, maybe 10 if they can pass the trials.  The fact that there's no clear bazaar -&gt; Gates gear progression makes it an easy decision..<br />
<br />
So . . . let me get this straight. If the zone access was enabled through Tactic-style back-door quests, you would buy it, but since they are &quot;flagged&quot; you won't, even though 90% of the expansion is progressed on a SINGLE GROUP BASIS??? This is killing me Iz. Seriously. I wanna hear you say the following to me, ok?<br />
<br />
I won't buy Gates because I cant get into 1 or 2 zones (out of 16? 18?) without a &quot;raid level flag&quot;. <br />
<br />
Because that is your excuse. As far as I know, nearly the entire expansion is based on ONE GROUP FLAGS. This flagged content you are dissing is EASIER than camping Diaku for a Tactics flag (not the content itself, the concept. No drops, no camping, just finish the trial, one group, and your &quot;flagged&quot;). They are one group deals. Instanced. This isnt PoP. This isnt the EPs. You dont need 71 other people to kill Rallos Zek the Warlord to get these flags.<br />
<br />
WHAT IN GODS NAME DO YOU WANT IZZZZZ!!!!!<br />
<br />
See Iz, I think you don't buy it because you THINK that you CAN'T do the content. Well, you probably can't, right now. Fact is, it will be a while before you can, at least some of the more advanced stuff. Another fact is that &quot;current raiders&quot; can do the content. Is THIS your problem? You cant do the content THIS SECOND, and others can, therefore you WONT try it? You can only get into &quot;8, maybe 10&quot; zones RIGHT NOW and be competitive, and THATS why your upset with this expansion? You don't wish to progress through the expansion? You wanna be &quot;rushed&quot; straight to Baal Hell Mode? Explain your logic please. <br />
<br />
<br />
As for the rest of you, Wulf, etc, I use the term &quot;dude&quot; on occasion. Not &quot;d00d&quot;. I am a 41 year old white guy, father of 3, rurally located, T-Ball dad. I am in a mild raiding guild. 6th on my server to the EPs. We have no &quot;raid requirements&quot;. I raid a couple nights a week these days. Some daytimes I play some LDoNs. I am not &quot;L33t&quot; or &quot;Ub3r&quot; or any of those things. I enjoy raiding, I enjoy casual one group content. I solo. I farm loot. I tradeskill. I am an &quot;averge&quot; EQ player, seriously. <br />
<br />
Say what you want about me. If my posts suddenly have &quot;less&quot; value to you because I used the term &quot;dude&quot;, well, thats on you, not me. I am not here posting to try and impress anyone. I am having a debate about an issue, and sometimes, my fustration comes out in my posts. My point with those comments you quoted Wulf was just that, fustration with Iz for asking for a certain style of play, then refusing to acknowledge it when it comes along. Not only does he refuse to acknowledge it, he COMPETELY misrepresents it as &quot;raid flags&quot; when that is simply not true. <br />
<br />
There are none so blind as those who refuse to see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u122"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p122">I'd take the Goldenrod.  Lifetaps are great for SK's, and the delay of only 28 on the one hander means eating a lot more ripostes, which puts more strain on your healer's mana(or your own, if you're having to lifetap more to keep healed).  Plus, as Iz noted, knights have AA for two-handers that make them overall better weapons to use.  And you get a better damage bonus with slower delay weapons than you do with fast ones(which generally is going to mean more damage bonus on a two-hander).  Finally, that better damage bonus means your OWN ripostes will be generally be for more if you're using a two-hander.  (Warriors have a disc that take advantage of the power of riposte very nicely -- sorry, tangent.)  Anyway, put it all together, and you have a powerful reason to stick with two-handers. <br />
<br />
Now, you can sometimes get great one-handers, but you'll be giving up some things noted above to use them, and the outfit isn't complete without a shield, either.  Most of those really good shields and one-handers are going to come from mobs you have to be flagged to get, or they drop from mobs you kill in the course of flagging.<br />
<br />
So I think Iz is on some reasonably solid ground here.<br />
<br />
One reason many knights get enthused with good one-handers is that by the time they drop, the knights are in groups with adequate gear and AA and FT to handle the extra ripostes and low DPS that come with them, and also by the time they get those good one-handers, they are also starting to look at some seriously good shields too, which there really isn't all that much competition for among the melees.  At that point, pretty good one-handers and shields become not too hard to get -- they even start to rot pretty quickly for regular raiders.  The average joe who doesn't raid isn't going to be with groups that are as strong and well geared, so not only will he not be getting the really good one-handers or the shields, but won't be with a group that can afford his DPS loss when he uses a one-hander or the extra healing that comes from his eating many more ripostes for using one.<br />
<br />
Also, many knights get into the elemental planes without very good weapons.  Windblades and war marshal's bladed staffs are quite common on knights getting into the elementals, sometimes for quite a while as they spend DKP or merit gearing up on armor and jewelry while, say waiting for a chance at getting a stone etched war sword drop.   So an elemental one-hander is quite a big upgrade for them.   The rot factor on knight one-handers being so huge, doesn't hurt either.<br />
<br />
At any rate, I don't see many knights I know replacing a SEWS for your standard elemental one-handers, or spending DKP on a one-hander unless they're way down the line of merit when it comes to getting a SEWS.  The one-handers are for when that's the best you can get.  And I sure wouldn't want to try to offtank things in GoD with a weapon that has a 28 delay.   <br />
<br />
Which all comes around to justifying the choice, I guess, of first a two-hander and second of a lifetap weapon.  It seems a pretty fair decision to me.  The only knights I know who replaced a two-hander with a one-hander had a pretty crummy two-hander.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u123"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p123">On another subject, Iz, your AA from your magelo was only 83, I think.  You are missing a LOT of defensive AA.  Most knights would probably agree that knights don't really even begin to truly come into their power until at least 100 AA, some would say 150, and they would definitely include all the defensive AA in that.  But I'm not so much criticizing your AA choices as saying that basically you need more of them.  I don't find it surprising that hard LDON's are rough for you at this stage; that seems about appropriate, I think.  Get some LR5 on you and I think you'll really be delighted how much easier things become.  I know from my cleric friends how much easier it is to keep a group going when their tank has full defensive AA's.<br />
<br />
Also, another suggestion -- there are a bunch of ghosts on that island in Natimbi.  The named there drops a 20 HP aug, and I don't think they're lore.  Lots of well-equipped 65's solo there, so I'm sure if you and a few friends spent, say, a few days there, you could easily handle the camp and get some really quick, nice upgrades via those augs that don't take the achingly long time LDON augments can take.  And you can turn the other drops there in for tribute or try to sell them in the bazaar, or maybe you know someone who would use them.<br />
<br />
Do you have an allakhazam account?  I think you need to be a paying member to look up some stuff, but look up Riwwi, if you can.  Some really very nice stuff drops there that I soloed, and like I say, I'm just a guy in full ornate, though I do have an elemental cloak and a few other nice things.  Anyway, your group could get a few pretty darn nice pieces every day there.  I really think you would find at least some parts of GoD worthwhile enough to make it worth the purchase price.  Look up some of the links below, maybe talk about them with some of your friends for their reactions.  I found this stuff tempting, and honestly it isn't too hard.<br />

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=27404<br />
<br />
Now I soloed all this stuff, getting every one of these drops, myself.  Sometimes I brought my SK along to snare, which made things more pleasant and less scary, but sometimes not.  At any rate, I've killed these mobs many dozens of times as a solo 65 shaman.  If I can do it solo wearing full ornate, there's no way your group can't do it.  Not that I'm saying you can tank some of these, which can hit for 1200.  :) But get someone with roots and DOTs, add your own SK's DOTs and snares, and you'll be fine.  My level 54 druid's drones of doom stuck on these guys, by the way, without any debuffing, as did all my SK's DOTs and all my shaman's DOTs, though some of them needed some debuffing to land.<br />
<br />
Anyway, say hi in the serverwide channel sometime if you are curious about any of this stuff.  I would seriously highly recommend GoD just for this stuff alone, especially as you don't have as many alternative ways of gearing up as raiders do.  I got my SK an upgraded sleeves and legs and myself an upgraded boots and arms, and gave a cloak and gloves to a pure caster friend, and pocketed 600k from a few weeks in Riwwi off and on in between a five day a week raiding schedule(and I work full time and travel three hours a day to and from work).<br />
<br />
I am definitely of the opinion that you shouldn't have to raid to get good upgrades, or do 10,000 LDON's...but there are some alternatives here and there.   I hope these links convince you of that -- the items were well worth my time to get.  And like I say, if I could solo them, you sure could do them with a group!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u124"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p124">And arent you a DE SK? Thats what your magelo says.<br />
I finally got around to updating my sig to my new sk (the one a raiding friend who quit dropped in my lap).  I lost some AC and FT but gained in areas for which there are no upgrades (weapon/41% haste for exampe).<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean, its not really your JOB to kill the mobs. You stand there and take damage, and keep the mob from damaging the rest of the group, right?<br />
In single group content, everyone has to pull their weight. The more damage I deal out, the faster we earn exp.  And as they always say on the sk boards, dead mobs don't hit back (best defense is a good offense).  On the king in Chardok last night, I outdamaged everyone in my crew which included a 65 wizard, a 65 rogue and a 65 mage.  Even subtracting the big HT, I still dished out 2k more damage than anyone else.  It is noticeable dps.<br />
<br />
<br />
I won't buy Gates because I cant get into 1 or 2 zones (out of 16? 18?) without a &quot;raid level flag&quot;. <br />
<br />
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I can't get into 8/16 zones.  I admit to not understanding in detail how Gates trials work.  From what I do understand, it is unlikely that we will get beyond the first few trials and hence only unlock a few more zones, call it 10.  So I'm still locked out of 6/16 zones- plenty more than 1 or 2.<br />
<br />
<br />
WHAT IN GODS NAME DO YOU WANT IZZZZZ!!!!!<br />
<br />
I've posted what I want ad infinitum, search this thread or the many others in which this discussion has arisen.<br />
<br />
You can only get into &quot;8, maybe 10&quot; zones RIGHT NOW and be competitive, and THATS why your upset with this expansion? You don't wish to progress through the expansion? You wanna be &quot;rushed&quot; straight to Baal Hell Mode? Explain your logic please. <br />
<br />
As I understand it, 1 or 2 zones will be the extent of our progression.  I know you believe SOE will wake up and realize casuals exist, but I do not, hence I don't see us ever getting to that content w/o some serious mudflation or them opening the zones.  By that time WoW will most likely be out and we'll have moved on.  We have enough goals to finish as is w/o spending money on Gates, particularly for content we will probably never see.<br />
<br />
<br />
On another subject, Iz, your AA from your magelo was only 83, I think. You are missing a LOT of defensive AA.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info, it was enlightening.  Yeah, I def. have plenty of AA to work on even on my new sk.  I gained a bunch but lost CS3/ToL3 which hurts.  I also lost all my LDoN augs (bleh) so I have a lot of LDoNs ahead of me to earn my FT/armor back.  On the upside w/ a better tank and a cleric instead of a shaman we stand a more reasonable chance of success doing hards, which we're pretty pumped about.  My only concern is that it looks like they may have nerfed LDoN collects based on our experience last night, but I want to do a bunch more before I jump to any conclusions.  Anyhow, thanks for the great info and take care.<br />

Do you mean you cant zone into 8 zones if you bought it TODAY because you don't have the flags? Or are you reffering to the fact that no matter how good your gear gets, as a non-raider, you will never be able to beat the trials for certain zones. See, I think you misunderstand this expansion Iz. <br />
<br />
As I said, I do not like it much. I The expansion is completely dominated by WAR-CLE-ENC-(snareclass) leaving little room for &quot;non essentials&quot; in the groups. At least with Raid flags, I could be a 6th shaman, and while not completely useful, I still wouldnt have to beg for the group to get the flag. Here is a progression chart for Gates:<br />
<br />
http://lancedragon.nexenservices.com/azra/god/god.htm<br />
<br />
I see a HELLUVA lot of one group content here Iz. And its hard. Its harder than LDoN Hard, most of it. Its challanging. Its a long way to run. But there are rewards. Blarg linked up some NICE looking loots. Hell I am gonna go after some myself, and I am close to Time. This is the point I am trying to make. You say you cant get to certian Gates zones because the trials are too hard for your gear, but you wont get gates to get the gear because there are certain trials that are too hard. Its like some Joseph Heller nightmare. But I see MAYBE 4 zones at the end that you wont be able to &quot;flag&quot; into with your singe group. And not much is even known about these zones yet, so it COULD be different.<br />
<br />
My point here is you are asking for changes. Here is an expansion that offers SOME of the things you asked for, yet you refuse to utilize it based on some twisted backward retrubution on SOE for hosing the Casual players so baddly in POP. Honestly man, and I say this with HUGE sincerity, I think if you got Gates, started gearing up in the suggested places, stuck with LDoN hards as you go for that gear/points, etc etc, then you would find a nice little set of progression goals DESIGNED around 1-group content. SOE IS trying man. Yeah its hard. Yeah currently all the best gear is on Raiders, so they are the only ones advancing. But sheesh, do you want to solve the WHOLE DAMN EXPANSION in a month? Thats not EQ, will never be EQ, and should never be EQ. Hell Rushing and then buying all the best gear is Diablo. Spending time with your character and your friends and progressing along a difficult path, thats EQ. <br />
<br />
Changes arent gonna happen instantly. Its a process, not an event. There isnt going to be some sudden &quot;OK Everyone, We are not going to have Raids and Flags anymore, all the best items are now One Groupers&quot;. SOE has put out an expansion that has SERIOUSLY nice gear achievable by single groups. You probably can't get to any of the REALLY uber stuff . . . yet. Do you really think you should be able to? First month, best stuff dropping in your single-group trials? What kind of game is that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u126"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p126">Also, many knights get into the elemental planes without very good weapons.  Windblades and war marshal's bladed staffs are quite common on knights getting into the elementals, sometimes for quite a while as they spend DKP or merit gearing up on armor and jewelry while, say waiting for a chance at getting a stone etched war sword drop.<br />
<br />
I dunno what mobs you all killed to get to the EPs Blarg, but my guild killed so many mobs that dropped killer 2Handers for Knights its not ever funny. I think over half of the bosses in the flag progression have a 2H in his loot table. AD, Saryran, etc, all have strong 2H weapons. So do a bunch of the Minis in Sol Ro. There is a serious glut of 2Hs in the PoP pre-EP zones, and any knight that gets EP flagged with a Windblade should be ashamed of himself (unless he is a pure pick-up guy). Even BoT tower guys have a couple 2Hs that are quite usable. <br />
<br />
I will concede the point about the 1H vs 2H arguement for now though. 2H is better, no denying it. I still wanna see DPS parses on the Cudgel vs the GR, and damage taken as well (with more ripostes, etc). I am willing to bet you would be suprised how close they are. That Cudgel is pretty badass.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um, that SK is pretty well decked out in raid-level gear Iz. You shuoldnt have ANY problems with LDoN hards, seriously, not with a competent group. Nice character, actually.</div></div><hr />

Both, but mostly just the continuation of a bad policy (flagging).  As for difficulty, we're struggling to beat hards though admittedly we haven't finished getting the cleric up to speed and haven't used my new sk there yet.  A good friend was sending me tells from Gates trials last night telling me he was getting quadded for 1200.  Needless to say that would destroy us in short order in our gear.<br />

Adding class balance issues to casual issues is not going to help your cause convincing us to buy this expansion. :P<br />
<br />
<br />

I guess we'll see how we fare in hards and what SOE does for the casual player who has no prayer of absorbing quad 1200's w/o defensive or a charmed pet.  I gotta say when I saw Brenlo's post about gimping the Gates content based on having a knight in group instead of a warrior I was pretty upset.  Why not just come right out and say &quot;knights are as useful as shaman&quot;.<br />
<br />

We've been waiting for 2 years for change, basically since Luclin when the gear gap became a chasm.  Time is running out for them because viable competition is imminent which will compete for our entertaintment dollars.  The ball is in SOE's court but based on their customer service in every aspect of their company we're not holding out hope.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u129"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p129">I'm not either.<br />
<br />
Sony made a big mistake making the difference between raid gear and casual gear so astronomical.  It wasn't necessary to motivate raiders to give them gear that was 3x better in elementals; just making it better would have been sufficient.  But I think they wanted the rewards to be spectacular, to get people extra excited and to make sure that their new idea of flagging virtually an entire expansion and what they viewed as the entire future for the game for a long time to come would be compelling to the customers and not just make them say, screw all this flagging, this is completely different from the old EQ and it stinks.  Not that it didn't do that for an awful lot of people anyway, but...  Whatever their reasoning is, the gigantic gap between raiders and non-raiders started up, and it turned out to be a bad decision that was undertaken a little too lightly.<br />
<br />
In doing so, they made it so that future expansions became almost impossible to design for their customer base because anything the ubers could do would be impossible for non-raiders to do and anything non-raiders could do would be destroyed almost instantly by raid-geared people.  You basically have to design for two different games with every expansion, and if it's hard to please one customer base, it can only be harder to please two of them.<br />
<br />
Leaving ridiculously overpowered chanter pets in the game looks like their present strategy to deal with that, as both nerfed classes and people with horrible gear can do things that the by now basically poor design of the game doesn't normally let them do -- IF they have a chanter with all his charm AA. (If not, tough luck -- one of the many flaws of that strategy.)<br />
<br />
Making it so that most all of the game, if you really want to get halfway serious upgrades, requires flags and big raids does theoretically cut way down on development costs, though.  IF...you get everyone on the flagging/massive raid path.  And they don't burn out too quickly.  You only have to design one set of content, and providing content for 72 people at once means a lot less work than designing content for twelve different groups of six people each.  But when a large part of your customer base does either not like massive raids and endless flagging and reflagging, or burns out on the somewhat mindless machinery and repetition of massive raiding, the effort to save money and have a controllable, easily directable game reveals its negative sides.  <br />
<br />
People are herd animals by and large, but they don't all belong to the same herd.  Make it so that too many are not served by your strategies, and you start losing customers.  At a certain point, your strategies to save money lose their virtue when you find out that those same strategies are losing you customers.  Cost savings only makes a noteable positive impact on the bottom line when when your income level stays the same or rises; when you start losing customers too quickly, your cost saving strategies may wind up coming to nothing, or even costing you money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u130"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p130">Honestly, I am not argueing these points Blarg. You are very correct. They definitely &quot;overgeared&quot; themselves and left very little room to maneuver. Thats not the point of my posts though. <br />
<br />
My point is simple. Iz wants 1 group content. Gates provides it. Its hard. Its a long way from PoK. It can be fustrating. There are considerable class balance issues. <br />
<br />
Wait, I just described EQ, guys. For the past 5 years, you could apply ALL these statements to the WHOLE game. They gave us PoK, then LoY. Fastest way there? Run through 4 zones. /shrug. Any idea how far it was to run back to Upper Guk for a melee class of a good race back in the &quot;old game&quot;? Freeport to Innothule, sheesh. How far is it to CS without a port? Before PoM, it was a HAUL. OS is WHERE AGAIN??? People sure dindt have any problem swarming in there. <br />
<br />
These comparisons are just one example of how EQ is VERY similar now to the way it ALWAYS has been, with the exception of PoP. <br />
<br />
Gates kinda sucks. It really does. The issues from PoP are still there, I understand that. BUT . . . its a STEP in the &quot;More One Group Content&quot; direction. Isnt it? <br />
<br />
Sick of the list of excuses why you dont buy it Iz. I am not SOEs marketing rep. Heck, for myself, as much as I have been there so far, I shoulda saved the 25 bucks. In fact, I BARELY recommend it at ALL until some of the more glaring problems are resolved. HOWEVER you need to look at it as a STEP toward what you wanted. None of EQ is perfect. It never has been. Don't expect so much perfection, don't expect your ENTIRE wish list in one big package. <br />
<br />
Cant take a 1200 quad? Get some better stuff. Where you ask? In the zones BEFORE the 1200 quadders. <br />
<br />
I am really all done with this arguement, and this thread. I have said what I have to say. Buy it, dont buy it, I could really care less. Spin it any way you want too, justify your decision with any excuse you can, whatever. <br />
<br />
BTW, WoW isnt gonna be the &quot;perfect&quot; game either. If your expecting it to be, then I bet you won't like it much.</div></div><hr />
