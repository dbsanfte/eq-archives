<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How would a monk and shaman duo do in Dalnir.<br />
<br />
The monk is level 29, and the Shaman is level 26.<br />
<br />
The monk has around 1.1k hp, not too great but he doesnt have a bunch of money I am going to throw some more gear on him soon, and my shaman has 1k hp.  The monk is using a Delightful Orb of Forgotten magic because I am 2-boxing him and I got DoFM for cheap (Trade for a Thunderous Drum of Karana)<br />
<br />
How would this duo do in Dalnir at this level, or should I wait til they are higher?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Unless you have some really nice resists on the monk, (or a fungi would sure help a bit) you'll get eaten alive by the casters.  The ratio of casters to melee mobs is insanely high on the first level, and a bit more resonable on the second and third, and they can nuke for 300+ damge if my memory serves me correctly.  If you don't mind eating a death or so, take the monk in there solo and play around just pulling mobs - I guarantee the number of times you get rooted / FD broken by spell / killed will help make up your mind.  The mages in this zones are some of the meanest NPC mages I've come across... really makes it feel like you're the xp mob to them.<br />
<br />
Mob density is also pretty high, so you have to be very on the ball to root runners. They all run if they're single (and if you get 2 casters at once, it's zone time - the easy way, or the painful xp-loss type way)<br />
<br />
IMO this is not a 2box zone for leveling.  Take a full group with an enchanter or bard in here and you will have a fantastic time, not to mention it's a great learning experience for dungeon crawling the way it 'used to be'.<br />
<br />
Really nice xp as well is a bonus :)</div></div><hr />
