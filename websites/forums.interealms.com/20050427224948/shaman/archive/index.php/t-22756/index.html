<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Amarusia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been looking for a place that my hubby and I (62 beasty and 63 shaman respectively) can duo for decent exp.  Loot as always is a plus..we both have very expensive spells coming up, but not the biggest concern right now.<br />
<br />
I have heard that Tactics would be a good place for us, but know nothing about the zone.  Canyone have a link or any helpful hints?  Or better yet, any other spots that would be better suited.  Neither one of us are elemental flagged, yet have above average gear and decent resists.<br />
<br />
Thanks to anyone that might have something to offer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Piglet hall is the place to be.<br />
<br />
Zone in. and Lev. Invis up and head straight up the stairs. <br />
<br />
Keep going straight keeping an eye out for Bat undead or Wraith undead. They will break invis and make you suffer.<br />
<br />
Fly out over the pit and angle slightly left and down. At the base of the pit On the far wall from where you are is a door off to the left. And right. <br />
<br />
Head into the left door. and Scooth on back until you see a very large room with a rough hewn cavern in the left hand wall. This is the camp spot off to your direct right as you enter the room.<br />
<br />
There is one timeable wanderer that will path through here. But you can pull diaku and put easy enough and if in the corner it is mostly safe to camp out there any time.<br />
<br />
If you hear a zone wide emote saying. You hear the pounding of hooves. <br />
<br />
Then rejoice and get the heck up agasint the wall Pronto. That means teh stampede is coming. I will leave you to find out about the stampede, but there is a little tiny piglet romping about in there he drops some good loot. <br />
<br />
Tons of Xp and alot of fun in this area. And it can support a group as well as a duo just fine. Just keep pulling pit. <br />
<br />
Enjoy!<br />
