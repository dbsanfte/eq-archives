&quot;PET RESIST CHANGES COMING, JULY 19, 2002 <br />
Source: EQ Necro Forums.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hi, <br />
<br />
We've had a change up on Test for about a week, and I wanted to share it with you guys and see what you think. Here's the basis of the change - <br />
<br />
When a pet is hit with a spell, it uses the resistances and level of it's owner to see if it resists the spell. <br />
<br />
This means that if you're a level 60 magician for instance and you've got on various buffs and gear that raise your resistances, your pet will save vs. spells as if it was also level 60 with your exact resistance scores. <br />
<br />
Using the owner's level is going to make a huge difference in how well the pet resists harmful spells, and should make a noticeable difference in how well the pets can survive AEs for instance. Allowing the pet to also benefit from your items and buffs means that it will be living a lot longer when fighting casters. <br />
<br />
There is a drawback to this, although I think the good outweighs the bad. If we go with this new scheme, it will mean that the pet always uses the owner's saves. Some types of pets currently are highly resistant to poison or disease for instance. Going with the new scheme would mean they will potentially not resist those types of spells as well, depending on the owner's resistances. <br />
<br />
Overall, this change would mean that pets are much more resistant the vast majority of the time. I think this would be a very positive change for pet classes, but I'd like to see what people think before we go ahead with it. <br />
<br />
Thanks for your time, <br />
<br />
- Rich <br />
<br />
And later after players responded to the proposed downside...<br />
<br />
Thanks for the feedback, I think there were a lot of good points made and I appreciate the time people took to post. <br />
<br />
In the next Test patch, pets will use their owner's resist scores and level ,except when they have better scores of their own. If the pet's own resistance is higher, than it uses it's innate resistance against that type of spell. If the owner has a higher score, the pet uses that instead. <br />
<br />
For example, fire elemental pets have incredibly high fire resistance, but low resistance to other type of magic. If someone tries to cast a fire based spell on this pet, it will use it's innate fire resistance because it's so high. If someone tries to cast a poison spell on the pet, it will use it's owner's current poison resistance score instead. <br />
<br />
Note to necromancers - Pets that were immune to fear before are still totally immune to fear after this change. <br />
<br />
Thanks again for the comments and opinions, I think this change is going to be very positive for pet owners...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have been slowly working my way towards resists and AC for my gear, and with buffs my magic/fire/cold resists are all well over 100.  For fighting caster mobs I've typically had to melee alongside dogdog while mobs exhausted their mana on my scaly hide.<br />
<br />
Now I can just med through and watch doggie kick their butts...:)<br />
<br />
This is going to be a very nice change, and will result in more doggies surviving raid-level encounters (Can't wait to try doggie on faydwer(sp?) next time we do a druid epic).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Faydwer = continent<br />
Faydedar = dragon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's a nice change... it really does very little on raid level encounters for the Shaman as our pets are not of much use there against a level 65+ Mob..<br />
<br />
Mind you, I think this will REALLY improve the performance of Mages, Necros and Beastlords in a raid setting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">it does cause problems for all those shaman who have not gotten their epic.  yes, I read that Rak is doable for a high level group with good resists, but if the mage fire pet goes from invulnerable to fire spells to having the same resist as the mage who summoned the pet .... there are a lot of mages around who do not hit 255 in Fire resist ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>snt_asher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I dont think Rak will be a problem thay did say that the pet would use the resist that was the highest so if the pet has higher reses in fire it will use it but if the player has a higher resist in say Desies then the pet would use that resist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Will be nice for solo'ing ae dragons in WW, dogdog should live at least twice as long resisting as a level 60 shaman w/ 150+ fr/cr than he does as a level 40 dog with none.  Any more help you can get on those is always appreciated =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think it will be a good change, particularly at the high end game. We did the Ring of Ooze in CT tonight and my pet lasted exactly 14 seconds against the Acidic Ooze's spells. Long ass fight with only one rogue and no monks BTW, with 22 people it took us 37.5 minutes hehe.</div></div><hr />

Dear Mr Absor<br />
I am writing this in hope of a response to my question..<br />
<br />
With the upcoming changes to pets that Mr Rich posted about on the mage/necro class boards, i am left wondering that although the changes will be benefical in some aspects, i am puzzled about this:<br />
<br />
Will pets lose there (near) immunity to spells of same type eg. Fire pet getting hit with fire spell...<br />
Because if thats the case this is a bad bad change, some mobs (like the one in CoM) REQUIRE fire pets because of the nasty fire AE it casts which can kill players in seconds.<br />
<br />
Although i genurally like the changes this is puzzling me, will the pets lose there immunity<br />

All of this is still in testing, so when all is said and done none of it, part of it or all of it may go Live.<br />
<br />
Right now it’s working like this.<br />
<br />
Summoned pets will use his owner’s resists and level against NPC spells unless the pet has a natural resistance that makes them immune or mostly so. Note: This only affects summoned pets and it will no affect spells cast by PCs - we don’t want to make a change that might dramatically change PvP until we know more about the effect it might have.<br />
<br />
For example, fire elemental pets have incredibly high fire resistance, but low resistance to other type of magic. If someone tries to cast a fire-based spell on this pet, it will use its innate fire resistance because it's so high. If someone tries to cast a poison spell on the pet, it will use it's owner's current poison resistance score instead.<br />
<br />
We’ve also added a bit more information to the /pet report health function. It will list the pet’s current effects along with its health.<br />
<br />
And what’s with the Mr. Absor? My dad is called… no, wait, he isn’t. He’s called Mr. VanCouvering…<br />
<br />
Oh well. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Crap, I forgot about PvP.  If this change DID affect PC spells, then here's the deal: No more slowing necro or mage pets or rooting them out of the way.  No, you must tank the hasted pet while fending off the horrific nukes and dots and trying to cast something.  We are gonna get owned.  Oh and they will now have big PR and big CR so no nuking or doting said pets.  They will have to be meleed to death or possibly epiced to death . . . . while tanking them.  <br />
<br />
Yuck.  <br />
<br />
Good thing they thought of that eh?  Mages and necros would be practically unbeatable . . . <br />
<br />
Abuses . . . well my dog aint gonna be slowed by those pesky NPC shamans anymore.  And he ain't gonna be DoTed.  My resists are fairly high unbuffed with regular gear.  Most spells bounce.  Might look into that pet hold AA skill.  That could make solo a lot easier with more things possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeh for PvP, mages and necros going to own.  Only thing I can think of is the bards using the charm thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I don't think I've seen it mentioned yet, but I do hope our dogdog will be included as a pet.  As someone mentioned before, we are not a pet class, per se.  I do hope it does affect dogdog but sometimes I'm not too sure about VI's wording.<br />
<br />
Edit: The comments on mage and necro pets are what concerns me, and the lack of mention of shaman 'pets'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just to clarify... he said it was NOT going to affect spells cast by PCs. As in it won't come into play in PvP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">... we don’t want to make a change that might dramatically change PvP until we know more about the effect it might have.<br />
