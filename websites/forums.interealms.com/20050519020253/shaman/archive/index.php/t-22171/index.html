<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Conaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It would appear to me that SoE is blowing off class balance issues yet again.  They seem to be stalling, by feigning to gather the same info over and over, refusing to outline what they have “in the works”, refusing to reply to good questions or enter into honest discussion and working on any other issues so as to delay real solutions.  I suggest they want to stall until the release of OOW so that SoE can then charge for the changes that should have been fixed for free.<br />
<br />
I think we should all just say NO.  Together we can assure that SoE will not sell another expansion (make money at it anyway) until the game is fixed, classes are clearly defined, tuned and balanced.  Many of us have years invested in our toons and in game friendships.  We have a lot at stake and drastic action is justified to protect that investment. As we the Shaman community, in my view at least, are the most broken class in current content and beyond, I think such a movement should start here with us.<br />
<br />
Tonight I stopped billing on my 2nd EQ account and I vow to not purchase the OOW expansion until I see real changes in the game, SoE customer service and Shaman class balance issues.  In short, until I once again experience more enjoyment than I do frustration.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heard from a friend tonight that the 2 top officers in his guild quit EQ today. Total damage is around 3 officers, with one considering quitting. BTW this is the top Solusek Ro raid guild, so you know that if they're hurting, other guilds are as well.<br />
<br />
I know you hate to hear it, but EQ is holding on by a thin thread, the release of a few more MMORs will break the raid game, and the casuals can only hold on so long, imho.<br />
<br />
I don't think SoE could release another expansion and make worthwhile money off of it, much less devote the manhours to class balance and such without taking a hit in profits. We all know a cut in profits is the bottom line, so unless you plan on buying up the EQ accounts being cancelled each day, don't count on major changes.<br />
<br />
This is all my opinion, do what you want with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm not going to buy OoW - but it has nothing at all to do with shaman class issues.<br />
<br />
I'm not buying OoW because I have ZERO desire to grind any more levels and because I'm bored with this game.  I've been playing for years, and it's not new any more... each expansion doesn't feel &quot;special&quot;... it's just more of the same bullcrap.<br />
<br />
So, I'm praying that WoW won't suck... because if it does, then I won't be playing ANY online games.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vittra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I didnt purchase GoD, nor do i plan to for OOW.<br />
My playing is a mix between raid and for fun.<br />
I agree shaman really needs a lot of tuning.<br />
( Note: Last night, we engage a Mini named in BoT ( Shm, Rog, Bard , Cleric and Bst ). My slow got resisted 3 times and by the time it sticked , the named was at 75% ; with the MT being a bard. Cleric wasnt having any problems with heals also. ) <br />
So ya..if i have to pay to see slapshot improvements to the shaman class. I'll quit direct.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I bought Gates but have yet to really play in it. I will buy OoW. I like EQ. Its the best game I can find for the type of things I want from a game. When I find another, I will play that instead. <br />
<br />
I hope WOW is good, too Uggy. But I am not getting my &quot;hopes up&quot; if you know what I mean. I have a shelf FULL of EQ Killers. <br />
<br />
My personal feeling is that Vanguard will be the game that finally unseats EQ for me. And here is why.  Part of the problems of EQ, and MUCH of the problems of other games, is that they have been designed more and more for &quot;mass appeal&quot;. So much of this industry seems focused on commercial success that I think there is a LARGE chunk of gamers who are getting pushed into the fringes. And I think I am one of those guys. Sorry, I am not of the Playstation Generation. More like the Pong Generation, heh. I dont want 5 minutes of satisfaction from a game, I want MONTHS of semi-aggrovating, yet ultimately rewarding game content. Here is an example. <br />
<br />
I recently did the Aid Grimel-Signet of the Arcane Quest. You wanna talk about hair-pulling, stupid, bull**** camping, farming, start stripping your twinks for cash, long boring . . . but then I finished it. The feeling of satisfaction I got from finishing that WOULD NOT HAVE EXISTED if it wasnt for the PITA bullcrap I had to go through to do it. <br />
<br />
EQ is melding into an Arcade game. Someone said it on another thread, that EQ is basically &quot;PoT is the hub where you spin and pick your Arcade Game for the evening&quot; or something. How true that is, and how utterly sad. Diablo 2 was fantastic, played it for hours and hours, loved it, . . . then I was done. <br />
<br />
I am not looking for another shooting star game to occupy my time until the next shooting star comes along. I want substance and depth, and regardless of what anyone says, EQ has those two qualities in abundance.<br />
<br />
Oh, and as for the original thread topic, the Devs arent blowing us off. They just gave us a bone, a fairly nice tasty one. They dont DARE do much more balancing until OoW, honestly, because then they may end up RE-BALANCING stuff they just balanced, and THATS a waste. Bug fixes are what I am hoping is the priority now, and when OoW ships, I am hopful the &quot;Balance Book&quot; will be re-opened. In case you dindt notice, Shamans arent the only ones with issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Warren Maguson Emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have ZERO desire to HAVE to buy an expansion (Omens of War) in order to balance the Shaman class that should have been balanced before entering a new expansion.... This is EXACTLY how Verant (before they became SOE) handled class balance issues the first major time it came up in 2001.  They patched a few things, paid lip service, waited a year or so and released a new major expansion which made most outstanding issues moot.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Awww, have a problem with a green pet?  Look at your nice shiny blue pet True Spirit... isn't he keen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't heal with Chloroblast?   Looky, looky, Tnarg's Mending for 1300!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?  We can't fix Torpor to have no side effects, that would be unbalancing!  But we'll give you Quiessence!  What?  Unbalancing?  Of course not, new expansion, new rules!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Problem with Alchemy?  Er... We'll look into it......&quot;   &lt;months later&gt;  &quot;We've solved your problems!   Look at the shiny new potions in Planes of Power, mana regen, etc, everything you asked for!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound familiar?  And what I find even more aggravating than that... SOE all but admitted their mistake with Gates of Discord, the CEO even took personal responsibility for the SNAFU and apologized.   Besides the people that went to the Summit, has SOE compensated the players that PAID for an expansion they admitted was unfinished, poorly implemented, and frankly, a mistake?   Class balance and fixing Gates of Discord IS NOT compensation for your time and money.   These are issues that should have NEVER existed to begin with.   A person should be able to buy a product and be at least satisfied with the results upon purchase or be offered SOMETHING in compensation for being given a faulty product.<br />
<br />
So I'll ask again, EXACTLY WHAT HAS SOE GIVEN YOU BESIDES PROMISES AND A WHOLE LOT OF LIP SERVICE?<br />
<br />
It's been how long and have they fixed everything to your satisfaction?  <br />
<br />
Have they given ANYONE anything for their time and aggravation?<br />
<br />
And are you REALLY going to pay another $30 for another expansion to fix what should never have become broken to begin with?<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, as you can see, I'm more than a little annoyed with the way SOE has conducted themselves so far.  I've been waiting for them to make some visible overture to the EQ players for months of wasted time and money.  Maybe they get an attack of conscience and give Omens of War to everyone who paid for Gates for free.  <br />
<br />
Still, I'm waiting but not holding my breath any longer.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Conaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Why should the players have to wait for the release of OOW to see class balance issues addressed?  That view point is just flat out silly!  Let’s suppose you lease a new flat, to live in, and a year later the owner starts to cut off your hot water every evening at six and a few months after your parking space is reassigned to someone else and then you are told that you must now mow the lawn every third Tuesday of each month.  Don’t you think that you, as a customer, have the right to be made whole once again (to be given what you pay for)  without renting a second flat?  I have purchased every expansion and have been paying SoE, to play EQ, for four years on one account and two years on the second.  I think that makes me a pretty good customer and as such I expected to be treated with some measure of respect and that my concerns will be addressed in a timely manner, not ignored.<br />
<br />
As far as other classes being broken.  I invite them to take the same approach that I advocate here for us Shaman.  Point of fact, this is the only way that we, the paying customers, will have any chance to effect a change in SoE policy and attitude.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmm I think they have improved game but have lost the vision and plot with which the game was designed. I also think imagination wise, they have added little to the game or classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Warren Maguson Emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You have a valid point mcroc, they recently have made overall improvements to gameplay and class balance issues...  now the statements I wish you to reconsider is this....<br />
<br />
SoE knowingly released an incomplete and faulty expansion and had you pay for it and monthy for the right to use it.<br />
<br />
Fixing it is only right.  Compensation for a bad product that you paid for should not be part of that.  And certainly you should not have to pay again to fix everything else that is wrong. <br />
<br />
Now it can be argued that compensation doesn't need to be given, just fix what was broken free of charge.  But virtually every company with good customer service will attempt to generate good will by giving you something for your lost time and aggravation caused.<br />
<br />
But EVERYONE should be able to agree that you shouldn't have to pay to have something fixed that shouldn't have been broken to start with.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you feel that the game and your class if fixed now and are happy with the current state of affairs, fine, your opinion, I'm not about to harrass you for having one or expressing it.   All I ask is you be absolutely sure your issues are being handled NOW and that you do not continue to buy a product like Omens of War that will fix what's broken now.  <br />
<br />
What SoE did with GoD is a lot like this....<br />
<br />
<br />
SOE:  Hey guys, buy this new shiny &quot;Car in a Box&quot;!   It's fantastic. <br />
<br />
Customer:  Hey, we can't put this car together, it's broken.<br />
<br />
SOE:  ...<br />
<br />
Customer:  Hello?<br />
<br />
SOE:  ...<br />
<br />
Customer:  HELLO?<br />
<br />
SOE:  ...  Oh, you still here?  What's the problem?<br />
<br />
Customer:  This car is broken, we can't put it together.<br />
<br />
SOE:  Er... It's not broken, we assure you everything is working fine.<br />
<br />
Customer:  No, it's not.<br />
<br />
SOE:  Yes, it is.<br />
<br />
Customer:  No, it's NOT.<br />
<br />
SOE:  Ok, OK... you got us... you also need this expansion kit to put it together.   <br />
<br />
Customer:  ......<br />
<br />
<br />
For those who are new to this and/or you don't see the analogy.... GoD was content originally designed for 70th level characters, EQ's 5th anniversary was going to release 2 free levels of advancement while Omens of War was going to release the final 3 levels.... For whatever reason, they thought that was a bad idea and would be a better idea to have several hundred thousand subscribers bang their head against nigh impossible to beat encounters with horrifically lacking tools.  <br />
<br />

Truly boggles my mind,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Makelike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I relate this scenario to the automobile industry, if you buy a car and that model has design/manufacturing problems that are fundamental to that line of automobile you don't have to pay for it to be fixed, they recall it and fix it for free. <br />
<br />
$oE has admitted they produced and sold an incomplete product with known flaws to customers that had no prior knowledge of those problems. IMO they should simply put out a &quot;recall&quot; and fix those flaws for free. Whether that fix be through simple patching or a digital download of OoW to complete the expansion that was paid for by so many customers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">And are you REALLY going to pay another $30 for another expansion to fix what should never have become broken to begin with?<br />
In a word . . .<br />
<br />
Yes<br />
<br />
I agree some things should hav been fixed, but I tend to disagree that we have been broken for a LONG LONG time. PoP began to show a glimmer of our deficiencies, for sure, but honestly, we are still VERY effective there. The real trouble began with Gates, and I do not expect them to fully understand it at this stage of that expansion, with another expansion on the horizon that will increas levels to 70. If OoW didnt have a lvl increase tied to it, I would agree that the issues need to be solved NOW. But it does, and it makes little sense to fix things that are going to require re-fixing in 3 months. You have to have SOME appriciation for the fact that there are OTHER things going on, man. <br />
<br />
Shaman have been one of the most powerful classes for a LONG time. The day I dinged 51 (or 52 whatever Turgurs is) in Kunark is the day I became a GOD. Well, I will be the first to admit that SOE has solwly been draining my dietyness expansion after expansion, and that with Luclin, I think we were very well balanced with our abilities vs the content based on other classes. <br />
<br />
But I have to remember that class balance is a process, not an event. There is no magic wand. Like it or not, the Clerics have REAL issues with us becoming better healers, since it will further de-value them in everyday, mundane things like XP groups. Warriors have a valid point that making Knights more equal tank-wise will offer them less prospective oppertunities for XP and other common things EQ players do for hours and hours. Yes, Clerics and Warriors are REQUIRED classes. But honestly, try playing one. <br />
<br />
I am not trying to defend these people, I think they are over the top sometimes in their protests, just as I feel we exagerate a lot on things like our &quot;lack of value&quot;. But the task of balancing is not an easy one. SOE is taking solid steps, listening to its customer base, and adjusting things little by little. But even now, the new slow + the changes to our HoT and regen makes us VERY viable members of trial groups. 460 regen is nothing to sneeze at. Slowing without having to malos first is a very nice idea. Yeah, it could be adjusted. But its not WORTHLESS. <br />
<br />
Overall I am happy with the current status of our class, and optomistic that some further changes are in store down the road. But I really do not see any reason for any mass revolt, unless it not REALLY the class thing, but more of an overall &quot;I am sick of EQ&quot;. If thats the case, fine. Just dont come here spewing poison like we are being totally ignored, never to be adjusted again. They gave us a bigger heal. They improved our HoT and regen. They created better spell distribution in Gates overall. They tuned it down in many many ways. <br />
<br />
Some people will just never be satisfied. For myself, I am not completely estatic, but I am semi-content for the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Conaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Blazz,<br />
I really hate calling someone out specifically but if anyone here is spewing uninformed and unsubstantiated opinion, it is you.  By your own statement (the first line of your first post to this thread) you say that you have not have played in the Gates expansion yet you make claims about Shaman effectiveness there, spell drop rates and how great spells are that you can’t own, as you have not played in the expansion where they are obtained.  You are doing nothing but spewing the company line and have not experienced any of your claims, first hand.<br />
<br />
The guild that I belong to repeated the Ikki4 event last night.  We killed everything going to the Ikki zone then triggered and won the event.. hours invested by 53 people and we saw one spell.  If this is an increase in spell drops no wonder so many people have no Gates spells, geeeesh.  I certainly feel that anyone has a right to express their opinion on most any subject.  However, I would advise that one should hold their tongue when they are talking out of their a**.<br />
<br />
Finally, about the future.  Sure SoE started collecting redundant data, and reopened a one-way dialog via their game forums (we talk they ignore), made one useful adjustment and a couple of minor ones to a few of our spells, fixed some bugged content and did major work on graphics engine and world geometry problems that should NOT have ever been released to begin with.  As a result of the “new and improved” SoE we have seen to date, one patch completed and a second patch now scheduled for July 8th.  The OoW release is pushed back to August, if I remember right.  Do you think that SoE developers plan any additional patches between July 8th and August?  I don’t, and that is the primary reason that I joined this forum and typed out my post to begin with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">yeah Soe should give everyone a free ingame item to compensate for GoD,( not meant sarcastically just jesting at the nature of what SoE would do it)<br />
Also I agree with what you say Warren, however, the only thing you have to remember is Everquest have never been complete or fixed from the very start of Everquest. I'm not justifying them but its a habit SoE have developed. And to an extent is arguably the nature of an online game, however I do agree more objective testing should have been done. <br />
By the way, my only experience of GoD was in Beta when I played for an hour and found it too laggy to even move there so I am admittedly clueless to the extent of how bad GoD was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Blazz,<br />

Begging your pardon, but I am in a guild that is heading into Gates regularly. We are not to Ikky yet, but still, almost EVERYONE is saying there are more spells dropping in the Trials, in the loot-zones, and most stuff is WAY easier. The few times I have ventured into Gates I did not find it overly difficult. Granted, I am not at the &quot;cutting edge top 1.5%&quot; of the game yet, but regardless, I am not going to dismiss an entire expansion because that part is still a bit FUBARed. Sorry. You want spells, go back to the sewers, go back to KT, go back to Vxed. Oh wait, you GOT THOSE SPELLS ALREADY? What are you whining about again?<br />
<br />
Call me whatever you wish. I like EQ. I think they are fixing stuff. Maybe you should to to SOE HQ and wave your magic &quot;Code Writing&quot; wand and everything will be magically fixed instantly, but some people realize that game adjustments are a process, not an event. Wanna know the truth? I think SOE feels that if EVERY SINGLE PERSON in Uqua+ right now quit the game, 90% of their problems would be solved.<br />
<br />
They will get around to it. I am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt at this point. But you talk like the game is completely borked so baddly its unplayable and we should all abandon it now in some spiteful protest. Well go ahead man. I am doing just fine. I have game issues I would like resolved, EVERYBODY DOES. Why should YOU be first? You think SOE doesnt care about you or your issues, and you know what, if this is your attitude, your probably right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I know this may sound silly to some, but I really think SOE should look into creating a well thought out and well made adventerous movie (not like LoTR but the same quality) to help lift the game up.  Personally, it would need to be written by someone from the outside, but knows what EQ is about.  <br />
<br />
I know people will groan, because it means more $$$ for them, but it can truely create some refreshing ideas for developers and players alike for the game; maybe help reshape the game into something that once was (or tried to do).  I'm sure many players created a ranger because of the LoTR books (then even more when the movies came out).  It's these little things that can rebuild something large.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Conaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I reiterate please, just say no.  The below post was copied directly from SOE's message board in response to Shaman request for status report.  Notice that healing balance is considered a wish list item and that wish list items will not be addressed until after the release of OOW.  The only way things will change is for SOE to take a hit to their bottom line.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly, no I can not force anyone to give me specifics on your class lists.  Basically look at it this way, if it is in game and working as intended but you as a community have asked for it to be changed, it would be a wish.  If it is in game but not working as intended it is a fix.  If it is not currently in the game but it is something you would like added, this of course would be a wish.<br />
 <br />
Take for example, your healing.  Up until Gates healing works as intended, once you get to Gates your healing does not work effectively enough to be a main healer for your group.  So would this be a wish or a fix?  It is really considered working as intended, so it would be a wish to have your healing altered to be more effective in Gates.  But simply because it is working as intended does not mean that it is appropriate for Gates.  So effectively the request for better healing would be considered a request because shaman healing is working as intended, it is just not effective in Gates as it is in pre-Gates zones.<br />
 <br />
Now I am certainly not saying your concern regarding the need for better healing is not valid.  I think it is very valid, but this is not a post to discuss the validity of any of your class list items.  The alteration of healing is something that will take time to implement, all healing still needs to be balanced between the 3 &quot;healing classes&quot; as well as the encounters in the game. <br />
 <br />
I do feel shaman need more to be effective, my husband played a shaman for a long time but stopped at level 60 because he did not feel as effective as he saw other classes to be.  He loved his shaman to the point that he never played any other class to higher then level 16.  Since then he has been playing a monk who is now 54.  He would love to go back to his shaman and with the things you have asked to be fixed or added, I think he would bring his shaman out of retirement.<br />
 <br />
I know you all would like your list to be &quot;graded&quot; by a developer as to exactly what is considered a wish or a fix, but realistically it is no going to happen.  We keep saying that all wishes will be considered later, after issues from the summit are done and the launch of Omens, but honestly this is not 100% true.  Some of the wishes on some of the class lists are rather easy to implement and some are much more difficult, so some of the wishes have been implemented, epsecially those that will not potentially throw off balance of the game itself.<br />
 <br />
I ask for patience here, which I know is asking alot, because I know you have been very patient (for the most part ) already.  &quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I personally hate anonymous people coming to the crucible telling me to quit. Why? Because it's lame. You want to make a statement then make it, above board... say I (state your name and server) will not purchase OOW.<br />
<br />
Then, we can see if you are standing by your call to arms.<br />
<br />
Either way, I'll buy it because as much as I get annoyed with EQ I still find more enjoyment than irritation. It's a cheap hobby and I won't stop playing, or not purchase an expansion, because you tell me not to.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Karshak<br />
<br />
By the way, I didn't think that post from SoE was as bad as you made out. It's all about how you want to perceive things as much as how they are stated.<br />
<br />
Later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Conaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Karshak,<br />
You are free to do whatever you like, as am I.  However, you are not free to make untrue or misleading statements about my comments and/or view points.  I think, if you bothered to read my first post (that started this thread) I did state that I would not purchase OOW until I felt Shaman Class issues were addressed.  /boggle<br />
<br />
As far as anonymous people.  How am I any more anonymous than you?  I'm a registered user here under the exact name that I use for my in-game toon.  I only have one toon, a level 65 Shaman playing on the MT server.  Is that public enough or do you have some other criteria that you would like to hold me to?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Finally, about the future.  Sure SoE started collecting redundant data, and reopened a one-way dialog via their game forums (we talk they ignore), made one useful adjustment and a couple of minor ones to a few of our spells, fixed some bugged content and did major work on graphics engine and world geometry problems that should NOT have ever been released to begin with.  As a result of the “new and improved” SoE we have seen to date, one patch completed and a second patch now scheduled for July 8th.  The OoW release is pushed back to August, if I remember right.  Do you think that SoE developers plan any additional patches between July 8th and August?  I don’t, and that is the primary reason that I joined this forum and typed out my post to begin with.<br />
<br />
Conaan, no offense, but I haven't read anything in your thread that was new.  You have managed to start yet another thread about &quot;gathering the shaman together to:&quot;<br />
<br />
A. Quit<br />
B. Boycott<br />
C. Scream<br />
<br />
Pick one and I can find half a dozen threads that say the same thing.  I have no problem with people posting to an old thread and bumping it up.  Go ahead, I will read it.  Just a few days ago we had someone post an almost identical thread to this one, but wanted all shamans to quit.<br />
<br />
SOE screwed up on GoD, we know it and they know it- whatever their original plan for the expansion was it obviously didn't hit its mark.  To top that off it was virtually unplayable by the majority of classes in EQ.  Let's also not forget that the DX9 patch was released shortly after that which did major damage to the playability for many players- shamans or not.  While you may have the luxury to sit around lfg saying &quot;woe is me&quot; some players still not have been able to log on.  <br />
<br />
Players begin to scream if the servers are brought down more than 5 hours once a month, and the High-Enders are quitting in droves.  It sounds to me that SOE has a lot of issues that require their attention.  Now, like it or not you wrote almost a paragraph of fixes that SOE has made in the last few patches- so obviously someone is doing something to fix the game.  Its a long process, something that requires hours, if not days, of testing and customer feedback.  SOE still has to wade through the dribble [we need an MGBable HoT for 1000 hitpoints a tick for X ticks] to get to the meat-and-potatoes of the problems that we shamans, as well as other classes face.  <br />
<br />
Class balance is a slow process- its going to take time.  We, the shamans, are but one classes in the dozen or so that need attention.  SOE has made changes to our class over the last few months that are &quot;very&quot; beneficial.  While many may not be up to the level that we want- its a start.  <br />
<br />
Your &quot;anonymous&quot; background that was questioned before probably has something more to do that &quot;currently&quot; you have 7 posts on this board.  The majority of those posts are on this thread, as well as the thread listing next week's upcoming patch.  Why are you posting this thread now?  Where have you been when everyone else was posting the same exact threads?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well, slowly but surely changes are going in.  They aren't the ones at the top of &quot;our&quot; priority list, but most of the changes are for the better.  The only bone with SOE that I have right now is there isn't enough material in GoD/OoW for the non-ubahs.  I don't mean ubah loot for casual players, but somewhere to XP for casual 65s on a regular basis would be nice.  I hate BoT/PoV with a passion, and LDoNs aren't always available.  I don't mind soloing, but I don't want to do it all the time.<br />
<br />
SOE would do itself a favor if they did something with the empty zones in the game.  Maybe even come out with a bunch of new quests...God forbid being in the title and all.  Droga and Nurga are 2 really good examples of what can be done with the Old World zones to make them viable.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>FafnerMorell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Well, I know Conaan just by name alone  :cool:. Killed mammoths with him in Everfrost back in Aug 2000 or so, back when totemic armor was as uber as it got (not that level 20s like us would ever see it except auction in EC) and it wasn't uncommon to have groups with 3-4 shaman because it wasn't like you're ever going to see a cleric in Halas (maybe a really lost half-elf druid, but never a cleric). He's pretty well known on Morell Thulle (probably one of the top 5 or 10 shaman by EQRanking, not that gear means all that much, but he's certainly not a shammy newbie).<br />
<br />
We're both in the same guild - killed Quarm, Ikk#4, and working on Uqua now. We have about 4-5 shammies per raid - so we're pretty aware of the &quot;shamans not stacking well on raids&quot; issue (although no one has ever turned down a patch heaal from us when they're at 20% and falling &lt;grin&gt;), and we look for ways to keep useful.<br />
<br />
Personally, I like being a shaman, like EQ, don't consider SOE in league with Satan, etc. But it does seem like we're getting a raw deal. Blame it Rytan, Blame it on SOE not having anyone who plays a higher-level shaman, blame whatever. But there are obviously issues with shaman, and SOE doesn't seem to interested in addressing them, probably because they've got a lot of problems throughout GoD, and a new expansion to get out to keep the paychecks rolling in (as they blow their cash on SW:G and EQ2), and in the relative scheme of things, we aren't their biggest concern. Will a boycott work? Beats me - I've cancelled both of my accounts - I'll probably renew one (the one with my shaman) if they show the slightest effort in addressing the issues. I definitely won't be ordering Oow unless they do.<br />
<br />
If nothing else, it might help SOE realize that they need to fix some problems before worrying about raking us for more cash.   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Karshak,<br />
You are free to do whatever you like, as am I.  However, you are not free to make untrue or misleading statements about my comments and/or view points.  I think, if you bothered to read my first post (that started this thread) I did state that I would not purchase OOW until I felt Shaman Class issues were addressed.  /boggle<br />
<br />
As far as anonymous people.  How am I any more anonymous than you?  I'm a registered user here under the exact name that I use for my in-game toon.  I only have one toon, a level 65 Shaman playing on the MT server.  Is that public enough or do you have some other criteria that you would like to hold me to?<br />
<br />
Conaan<br />
<br />
/boggle all night long Conaan, but I am not sure why you are...<br />
<br />
You are asking us to NOT purchase the next expansion, ie. quit. I want to buy it, because I want to play it. <br />
<br />
As far as anonymity goes yes you have now addressed it and it is public enough. As for me, you would know if you posted here that I have made no secret of my server as I mention it fairly frequently, although the rn on the end of my name might also be a giveaway. Until you said you were a shaman named like your sig on MT you were nothing. Now at least you are a character in game. Not much difference as I will still buy oow but you have more credibility than other posters who swan in from nowhere shouting to quit.<br />
<br />
Thanks for answering, I hope your boggling soon dies down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Sitting here a tad bit amazed that the best some folks can counter with is: &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Question is pretty simple: is his point valid or not. Those who feel it is not don't need to justify their intentions to purchase OOW. Taking the extra step of assuming a poster is valid or invalid based on whether or not you know them or their reputation is damn silly. For the **search** and **check other posts on this topic** comments ... Chutoi has posted previously that OOW was not on his list. Of course back then it was popular to jump on the f*** SOE list. Now that SOE PR has played its game folks are swinging the other way.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I don't understand it. Bones. Shaman got tossed bones. They are still being tossed bones, just different ones. Class reps, pet zoning, mana numbers on casting ... bones.<br />
<br />
Conaan didn't identify who the SOE rep was who made the comment, nor link to the source of the quote ... in that he lacks as the comment lacks validity without it. This is different from his posting it - who the shaman is who posts is irrelavent. But, take a look at what was said and tell me (if true) SOE isn't doing the soft-shuffle-B***S*** routine again.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly, no I can not force anyone to give me specifics on your class lists.  Basically look at it this way, if it is in game and working as intended but you as a community have asked for it to be changed, it would be a wish.  If it is in game but not working as intended it is a fix.  If it is not currently in the game but it is something you would like added, this of course would be a wish.<br />
 <br />
Take for example, your healing.  Up until Gates healing works as intended, once you get to Gates your healing does not work effectively enough to be a main healer for your group.  So would this be a wish or a fix?  It is really considered working as intended, so it would be a wish to have your healing altered to be more effective in Gates.  But simply because it is working as intended does not mean that it is appropriate for Gates.  So effectively the request for better healing would be considered a request because shaman healing is working as intended, it is just not effective in Gates as it is in pre-Gates zones.&quot;<br />
<br />
What does this say that, as others mentioned, is so &quot;acceptable.&quot;<br />
<br />
SOE: &quot;Yes, shaman were intended to be healers pre-GoD but we changed our mind and significantly altered the content to ensure the class is be unable to heal in GoD ... as intended.&quot;<br />
<br />
SOE radically altered the class abilities, with the final stamp being the GoD expansion. Gear stats and mitigation of slow in PoP. Mitigation/unslowable common mobs that hit faster/harder but die faster in GoD. Each shaman skillset was eliminated/decimated in these 2 expansions in comparison to other class advances in the same 2 expansions. Not every class advanced - but there is not another class that has been hit as hard as shaman. Based on the statement above (again, if true) shaman nullification is the direct result of content design regardless of the design effects on the shaman class. It is .. as intended!!<br />
<br />
Yet, you folks are buying the hype and 'aura of comraderie' that SOE is throwing out. In the process accepting that you are no longer 'shaman' but something different. A hybrid of other hybrids whose significant impact in gameplay is marginal at best.<br />
<br />
The key to the quote Conaan furnished lies in the who thinks what. We believe we need healing upgrades to remain a viable priest class. Actually, being shaman, we believe that slow, manageable content is the answer ... SOE said F*** YOU to that, so we have adapted to this new concept of viable healer as a priority status. That however is not important.<br />
<br />
SOE has decided that those community concerns are just &quot;wishes&quot; because you see ... OUR HEALING WORKS AS INTENDED. Our nerfage is actually BALANCED AS INTENDED.<br />
<br />
Yes, this response is a tad melodramatic. Unless the quotes it is based on are in fact true; then, I would call the response subdued. But the real point is this - regardless of how well we have adapted to performing a function in game ... isn't the adaptation the result of limitations we should not have to deal with based on class nerfage for SOE perceptual balance to their game design? The design should adapt to us - as well as all other classes as much as possible. That is no longer the case. We have come full circle with the reintroduction of the pre-requisite 'holy trinity' to progress in content. This time it is not just other classes who feel the full impact. It is not other classes who are excluded from the circle for significant contributions they add. It is shaman who are not invited, not needed, not wanted and who do not bring any significant tools to the show. NONE. ZIP. NADA. With no other option because the things we bring DO NOT CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY.<br />
<br />
So keep hanging in there and smiling when another bone is tossed. Keep hoping when another 'class rep' plan is tossed out there. Keep hoping when SOE promises something ... everything ... and justs delays the reality of making it happen today ... tomorrow ... in the next expansion.<br />
<br />
No, I am not with Conaan. I will likely buy OOW. I still have fun in EQ. I still have fun with my shaman - mainly because I avoid the places that piss me off. Or I do them to the best of my limited abilities with friends, who like me, still enjoy getting our arses handed to us ... just as long as we had a shot at winning against challenging worthwhile content.<br />
<br />
I will not, however, praise SOE or condone their narrowminded obtuseness towards what a class was designed to do and their new-Vision of what they want the class to not be able to do to compensate for a clear lack of design/development and lack of proper planning or any f***ing progressive imagination. Nor can I sit by while others comment about their game experience on these boards to only see replies of &quot;who are you?&quot; As if that f***ing matters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">so we have boggled, and amazed. how quaint.<br />
<br />
Grafsha McDaughts /Zlow, clearly you missed my point, which is sad as I only wrote a small paragraph. I didn't say &quot;Who are you?&quot; as if it would add credibility. I said I was sick of anonymous players saying &quot;do this, or do that&quot;. Do you understand that? I'll re-state it. I am sick of anonymous people asking me to take action when there is no way of knowing if they are just being dramatic and have no intention of quitting/purchasing oow.<br />
<br />
There are countless leave the game because we suck threads and comments on the board. I don't care if chutoi plays or not, you brought his name up, not me (no offense intended chutoi).<br />
<br />
As far as me assuming if a poster is valid or not based on him supplying character name or having a reputation on these boards..... you assume too much... that would require that I would consider taking action if I &quot;knew&quot; the person.<br />
<br />
Let me assure you that I could care less if every shaman in the game quit out of anger at the moment. I don't pay for anyone elses account so why does it matter what they do? I will play my shaman until I see no reason to play any longer, or I am unable to for some reason. I agree with a lot of posters on the boards that the shaman class needs upgrades, but no one is going to make me do something.<br />
<br />
For the record, I want shaman to be back in their niche, but I am not going to **** my pants in anger because we got tossed bones. I mean, that patch wasn't addressed to shaman, it was addressed to all classes. Myopic insular viewing of each patch line to see if it checks off against our wish list is just going to make you more angry.<br />
<br />
I intend to watch how Sudedor gets on and won't be joining the lamers lambasting him, or telling him that he's not their choice.<br />
<br />
Probably not good enough for some as I don't have the requisite foam around my mouth. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">My point mostly was: &quot;Why did you wait until now to post on the Crucible?&quot;  We have seen this same type of thread popping up on the boards since the GoD release- so why now?<br />
<br />
I play on Brell and so far we have had one Elemental guild collapse since the release of GoD.  There have been a lot of players that have left recently, but it has been to a multitude of issues:<br />
<br />
- Bad Content<br />
- Bored<br />
- New Priorities in Life<br />
- Balance Issues<br />
- New Games<br />
- Summertime<br />
<br />
Out of all the players that have quit there have been only a select few that played shamans.  Mages, Beastlords, Paladins, and Rogues have vanished.  Practically every guild on the server is trying to track down reps- there just are not enough left to go around.  The shamans are still around, though- so obviously shamans are not quitting in droves.  The SOE devs are making fixes to the game- its a slow process.  For me, its a higher priority to fix server stability and zone bugs than shaman balancing.   Those problems effect all players and should be fixed first- so that all can benefit from them.<br />
<br />
As far as the issue with Conaan's anonymity, post counts give me an idea how long someone has taken an active interaction with the board.  Their posts give me a general background from where he/she is coming from, so I in turn, can come to my own conclusions.  His post count was at 7 and the majority of them came from this thread.  I don't know him, I have nothing to base his actions other than this &quot;fire and brimstone&quot; thread.  I don't know whether he is conservative in his views or a hot-head, all I know is that he decided to make himself known off a post that is re-posted at least twice a week by someone who didn't bother to check old threads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Yet, you folks are buying the hype and 'aura of comraderie' that SOE is throwing out.

First of all, SOE has not said with impunity that the matter of Shaman healing is closed forever. <br />
<br />
Second of all, there is a SIGNIFINCANT faction of Shaman, myself included, who DO NOT WISH to be Main Healers in cutting edge content. <br />
<br />
Thirdly, call it hype, call it &quot;bones&quot; call it whatever you wish. If you are an optimist, then the game is getting BETTER, gradually. If you are a pessimist, then these modifications to the game won't change your opinion, so just end billing.<br />
<br />
Basically, I am so sick of the constant &quot;Dont fall for it . .  its not enough. . . SOE doesnt care. . . the world will end in a ball of fire tomorrow&quot; comments that are OVERWHELMING this whole board recently. Be a pessimist somewhere else. If you have an objective opinion (I am not saying you have to be IN LOVE with the changes, just OBJECTIVE) then present it. But people need to stop being so COMPLETELY negative about every single thing SOE does. At what point will they actually be doing a &quot;good job&quot; to some of you people? When Shaman get Necro pets, Wizard Nukes, Cleric Heals, FD, Ports, Evac, Rez and a 95% slow that is irresistable? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">i love EQ. i find myself excited every day to log on and do different things, and i don't at all feel like it's an arcade game. i'm a 65 sham, and find that i have a LOT to do. some days, if there's a particular aa i'm chasing, i'll go grind out some aa and enjoy the company of an xp group. other times, i'll grab one of my friends (one of 59 sk, 65 enc, or 65 bst are my usual duo partners) and go after some minor named, clear out the TM castle a couple times to farm some little items and remind myself that despite the fact that i spend so much time fighting mobs that are a lot more powerful than me, i'm not at the bottom of the food chain anymore. some nights, i join open raids and help other people get flags (raiding is FUN. i still love taking down AD in PoV. that's just a fun fight to participate in, and occasionally while i'm doing cannis i'll look over and watch the big kite tornado off to the side of the dragon fight).<br />
<br />
other days, i just like to flat out go and make a mess. solo in the deep for kicks--the mobs aren't a threat at all individually, but that zone always has potential to get hairy for a soloing shammy. run out to natimbi and play the neck-slot lotto in the Souls camp.<br />
<br />
quests are even fun. i did the acrylia cavern shard quest (the turn in with Vah Shir in grim forest one--filling the staff with shards) for kicks, even.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
as in RL, some people allow themselves to enjoy EQ, and find fun all around them. others never stop looking for things to be unhappy about.<br />
<br />
if you don't like it, quit. i won't miss you. in fact, if enough people quit, and the devs went to merging servers to keep populations up, i think it would almost be a good thing, because we'd be left with the people who really loved the game and wanted to be here.<br />
<br />
<br />
the other thing is this--despite the fact that people keep saying eq is barely hanging on, there are tons of people on my server at all hours, and i can't imagine it's any different on the others...and there are a very healthy number of servers. it just happens that the whiners will go wherever they have to to whine, while most of the people who are enjoying the game are spending most of their time just PLAYING instead of going to forums and finding any and every opportunity to bash the game and rip SOE.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
you can throw any rationale at me you want, you can call me whatever you want, you can point out any perceived flaws in what i say, i honestly could care less. the bottom line for me is that i'm HAPPY with EQ. there are always little improvements that could be made, but when i look at the big picture, i'm happy. my 65 sham is my main, not an alt or bot, and i ENJOY playing the same character day in and day out. <br />
<br />
<br />
if you don't like the game, quit.<br />
<br />
if you don't WANT to quit, then there's apparently something keeping you here instead of some other game, and you should enjoy the high points instead of obsessing over the low points.<br />
<br />
if you've already left, then leave the forums, too. let it go. move on.<br />
<br />
want to comment on somebody leaving? ok, so some people leave. we have ALL left games before. it's the nature of the gaming business. people keep moving around until they find something that appeals to them, they play it for awhile, and they move on to the next game. people are FICKLE. it's not a sign that the game is tragically flawed so much as it is a sign that those raid leaders probably played for a few years and just stopped enjoying themselves due to so much time invested in one thing. so it goes.<br />
<br />
on the other hand, i've met over 50 people on my server who have gotten the game for the first time within the last 4-6 months.<br />
<br />
<br />
ok...time for me to submit. spending too much time shouting at a brick wall won't get me anywhere hehe</div></div><hr />

But you know what I would enjoy alot more. A meaningful contribution to groups in challenging content. I do not like having to log off Snoww and log on a Cleric because &quot;we need a real healer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Actions speak much louder than words do. And despite all the hot air flowing some days and silence the next there is little that has changed in what. a months time? Yes there have been some changes. Yes we got a upgrade to HoT's  And it helps. But we still need dot aggro fixed. And a slightly better direct heal. And an option to apply damage in the new paradigm of 45 second group fights.  (All while doing our job that takes up a good 10-20 seconds overall.)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Drop the drama blarg and conaan. <br />
<br />
Conaan, we don't have our own little club here, we just see a ton of the same posts day in day out, and that is just from the regular posters.<br />
<br />
When you posted I disagreed with your post, as is my right here. My reasons were twofold as I explained. Firstly, I disagree with what you think the right method is, and secondly I don't like anonymous posters.<br />
<br />
The whole game is anonymous if you choose it to be, but I personally (as I stated before) give little merit to any poster saying &quot;lets do something&quot; or &quot;I am going to do something and so should you&quot;. I prefer to see a server name as well as the character name so that if I wanted to see if they had followed through on their blurb I could. Not that I care enough to do so, but it's my opinion.<br />
<br />
I wasn't attacking, and I haven't really seen others attacking, well not at you conaan. If you want to make a big deal about it then go ahead.<br />
<br />
Just because people disagree with a post you make doesn't mean you aren't welcome. If you want to throw a tantrum and leave then bye. It's not petty to disregard a new poster who clearly hasn't read the last 100 posts or wouldn't be starting a new thread.<br />
<br />
Anyway, blarg, didn't you just do what you criticized people for doing? It's getting old.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I bought Gates but have yet to really play in it. I will buy OoW. I like EQ. Its the best game I can find for the type of things I want from a game. When I find another, I will play that instead.<br />
<br />
 Oh, and as for the original thread topic, the Devs arent blowing us off. They just gave us a bone, a fairly nice tasty one. They dont DARE do much more balancing until OoW, honestly, because then they may end up RE-BALANCING stuff they just balanced, and THATS a waste. Bug fixes are what I am hoping is the priority now, and when OoW ships, I am hopful the &quot;Balance Book&quot; will be re-opened. In case you didnt notice, Shamans arent the only ones with issues.<br />
<br />
Well said, well said!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Welcome to the combat of pots calling kettles black. I pick ... pots!! While I recognize my personal hyprocricy of arguing with you by openly stating you are posting to complain about complainers ... and I am posting to complain about you complaining about complainers. I find the redundancy ... ironically amusing. But enough ... on with the counter-post!<br />
<br />
When you posted I disagreed with your post, as is my right here. My reasons were twofold as I explained. Firstly, I disagree with what you think the right method is, and secondly I don't like anonymous posters. <br />
<br />
Disagreeing with his opinion is one thing. As you said, it is your right ... here. Then to say you, &quot;don't like anonymous posters&quot; as an additional defense is just poor, lacking, inconsequential, not to mention completely off topic. Yet, the same can be asked of you, Karshak ... who the f*** are you? Don't answer, rhetorical question.<br />
<br />
Instead of trying to justify your comments (as well as inflating your own sense of importance by assuming I was responding specifically to only your post with my last one) with this trite explanation of how you evaluate posted comments - get off your bandwagon of superiority and counter-argue with 'your facts' on how/why he is wrong. Why is comfortably waiting until the next expansion for shaman BASIC CLASS abilities to be addressed and adjusted a totally acceptable and reasonable expectation for each and every shaman playing EQ? Because it is acceptable to you? This could divert into a whole-nother topic. Like something too closely attached to the original thread post. We don't want to do that, however. A good hijacked thread should never, ever return to topic ... so, forget those questions.<br />
<br />
Back to hijack-topics: If you read my first post to this thread it made 2 points:<br />
<br />
(1) I am personally embarrassed/shamed to see these boards denegrate to the level of nitpicking bulls*** that has nothing to do with the thread topic. You didn't challenge what he said or what he offered as proof ... you just jumped on the &quot;who are you, Mr. Anonymous?&quot; Which leads to ...<br />
<br />
(2) Who the poster is has no importance if what the poster says is valid. Now, I don't know Conaan from Adam or Moses ... but if the quote he provided has a true/factual SOE released basis (which has not been proven yet - no link to source provided) then his comments about SOE playing the jack-the-players game is a reasonable response. That, IF TRUE, you are not stepping back and wondering if the snowball you are seeing in hell might not be made of frozen water is, in itself, rather amazing. Barnam and Bailey amazing. Regardless of this, Conaan has the right to come to these boards and raise his concerns in the same manner all the other &quot;F-SOE, BOYCOTT, QUIT, SIT-IN&quot; posters have. The same right as you to post your opposite end of the spectrum, ostarich viewpoint that &quot;SHAMAN ARE THE BEST THING SINCE SLICED BREAD!&quot;<br />
<br />
CLUE NUMBER 1: I have no argument with your right to post or what you post as your opinion. I may argue your opinion, and given what I have seen so far ... it wouldn't be hard to convincingly do so. That said, I would also stand up for your right to post. It is that silly old adage thing - &quot;I may not agree with what you say, but I will fight to the death your right to say it.&quot; Ok, you caught me ... most likely not to the death. But I would call 911 if you said something stupid and got smashed in the nose for it. I would even yell at your attacker ... if I was in a safe spot from which to do so. And I would, honestly, believe you had the right to say whatever it was that resulted in getting your face pushed in.<br />
<br />
Yet you feel the need to heap criticism towards Conaan with such strong well thought out points like (a) he is Mr. Anonymous because he only has 7 Crucible posts, as well as that he should ***USE SEARCH*** and add to an existing thread on this topic. Well, Sunshine, that he is a new poster he hasn't likely the experience to know about the commonality of post topics or the need to use **SEARCH**. Nor is he likely aware of the heated tempo these types of topics have generated of late. Nor is he required to add on to a thread because it makes you feel more warm and fuzzy. Catch that? That you have a problem with what he posted, how long he has posted on this forum and what he lacked doing beforehand to satisfy your expectations are not his problem. They are yours.<br />
<br />
Play Marine, Karshak. Adapt to reality. Overcome your limitations.<br />
<br />
On the 'anonymous' point - when someone else followed up with his resume stats, pointing out he is one of the Significant Shaman on his server ... that didn't stop you from still being a self-centered ***, jumping right back into the &quot;what are you doing on MY boards BS.&quot; I won't jump to the conclusion that you didn't quite grasp the concept of 'scan at a rate that ensures total comprehension of the topic points' at Evelyn Wood ... yet, I am concerned that you are zealously over-reacting to key words/sentences that personally jump out and attack you (oh! those meany words!) &quot;making you&quot; uncontrollably lash out in counterpost. In short, you are looking to rant at a poster who has a negative view of the SOE effort to balance shaman because ... somehow ... this issue has become very personal. The progression of this type of behavior, Karshak, is SAD&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;PATHETIC&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;SOMETHING REALLY BAD.<br />
<br />
Pathetic is looking like a comfort zone now, isn't it?<br />
<br />
Reading your comments followed by your rationale for those comments leaves me with one thought: get a clue, Karshak-whoever-the-hell-you-are. These are not your boards (nor mine.) Posting 1 or 600 or 1 million times does nothing to validate your shaman knowledge. It just means you post rarely, a lot or way too much. Ingame experience you have of the shaman class is about the only validator there is. This is MY OPINION and I have only verified it by checking the board tools and did not see the 'have Karshak validate me' button. If I am wrong about the above, please PM me with instructions on what to do so I can post in the future with your approval. <br />
<br />
Cliff Notes point for you, Karshak: There is no Kewpie Doll awarded for longevity to these boards. <br />
<br />
IMO ... yes ... IN MY OPINION ... that a key server shaman (who is not aware of the issues that have been beat to death on these boards) coming to these boards to post about his ingame experiences that reflect the same general consensus of a significant number of other senior shaman rings the bell loud: WOW, MAYBE THERE ARE REALLY PROBLEMS WITH SHAMAN!! WOW, HERE IS ANOTHER SENIOR SHAMAN COMING OUT OF THE WOODWORK TO VOICE HIS FRUSTRATION!!<br />
<br />
Perhaps I am jumping to conclusions after seeing this for the last 6 months + ... but, I see a trend here.<br />
<br />
It was good of you to respond to the topic and get past your own pettiness and offer discourse with a fellow shaman, Karshak. Oh, wait - you didn't do that. You basically ignored his issues and played the divert the argument and toss some crap in the way game. Good for you. Oh, wait - NOT! As such a senior, validated in your own mind, board shaman ... you set a piss-poor example of what the Shaman Crucible is. The majority of individuals that actually use these boards communicate thoughts, ideas and banter about potential solutions. Not agree. Banter, debate, offer evidence/proof, counter offer. So much for 'Karshak seniority' equating to 'maturity' and contributing the board quality in this post.<br />
<br />
 It's not petty to disregard a new poster who clearly hasn't read the last 100 posts or wouldn't be starting a new thread.<br />
<br />
That you think it is &quot;not petty to disregard a new poster&quot; justs neon-lights your pettiness and insular focus on &quot;what is important to me matters ... all else doesn't.&quot; Sad to be you, methinks. There is no memo new subscribers get detailing Karshak's Rules of Shaman Crucible Expectations.<br />
<br />
Follow this, it is simple: Conaan is a 'potential' server established leading shaman (based on what has been said in this post) who reaches a point of needing to vent about shaman issues he feels very passionate about. His chosen vent path is to subscribe to this forum and post. His concern is his frustration ... his absolution is posting that frustration on these boards. Now, somehow, since you have no concept of what he is personally reacting to, you still feel it the most important thing in your world to reply to his post and sing the song of Shaman Happy while pissing on his fire with grandoise retorts about his identity, number of posts as well as YOUR need to verify not only who he is but whether or not he follows up with his 'threats.' Not ... that you ... would ... of course ... but YOU ... want the option (actually you said opinion ... which made no sense whatsoever.)<br />
<br />
You are using the wrong format to solve your problem, Karshak. Being an obvious true-blue-'Merican, you can invoke the Patriot Act. Call the FBI, show them his post and as someone disgruntled against an established Japanese owned 'Merican enterprise they will ship Conaan The Agitator off to Cuba and solve your problem.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
To be sure, all I have responded with is pointless. As a matter of fact, you have no idea where I stand on the issue raised by Conaan. Now, if you had read my complete last post, thought about it and been half-honest with yourself it would of dawned on you that (intentionally left blank to test Karshak for reading comprehension - please refer to original response to this thread to find out what I was going to say here). Here, I am confident, is the ultimate irony of all the ironies of this debate between us, Kar ... I lost you paragraphs ago. You haven't gotten to this point in this post with more than 10% comprehension of what I have said. You are still fuming at the &quot;Get a clue ... &quot; paragraph and likely dishing out another fine, quality retort ... never to see this.<br />
<br />
I could be wrong ... but it isn't really very important, is it, Mr. Kettles!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">This thread has been sufficiently hi-jacked- it started out as a frustration thread, but got burned pretty fast.  The issues addressed in this thread have been commented on countless times which is probably why we are seeing the flame wars now.  We are not all going to agree on the same solution/level of the problem.  What frustrates me is that I come to the Crucible and see multiple NEW threads all talking about the same thing.  People are not bothering to read the posts that are up- they are just making a new one.  It takes 2 minutes to post &quot;Shamans suck&quot;, but it takes hours to back up the stance of &quot;we are not sucking as bad as you think.&quot;  Why did this thread collapse into a flame war?<br />
<br />
The facts that we do know:<br />
<br />
- Conaan had 7 posts last time I checked and the majority of them were<br />
  on this thread<br />
<br />
- Other posters recognize him as a respected shaman on his server- he<br />
  has been playing for many years.<br />
<br />
We all know and understand the issues facing shamans in today's content.  By now they should be pretty obvious.  This thread would have fizzled out fast had the poster been &quot;truly&quot; anonymous, but he's not.  Anyone with half a brain can scan through the recent topics posted on the general section- all it takes is scrolling downward with your mouse.  <br />
<br />
What I think infuriated a lot of posters was the FACT that he has been playing for years.  He either A. just stumbled across the shaman crucible or B. has been lurking around for quite some time.  The majority of the shamans I know and interact with have at least viewed the Crucible numerous times- if they are not already an active poster.  This leads me to believe that he was B. lurking.  Everyone is entitled to their opinion- I have no problem with that.  What I do have a problem with is someone who decides not to make their view known until 6 months down the line and bumps the posts with yet another &quot;Let's quit&quot; post.  Have an opinion, take a side, but pay attention to what other people are posting.  If someone else already has a thread open that comments on your topic- why not just post a reply?  People will read it, it won't be as offensive, and we would not have gone through with this thread high-jack.<br />
<br />
He didn't do that- he posted a new thread that was obviously an attempt to garner support from the vast majority of this board.  He bumped other threads written by other shamans that had a like-minded viewpoint- to make sure attention was brought to his thread.  Was it intentional? I don't know, but I have a feeling that had this been a post on some other topic it would have been met with harsher minds.  <br />
<br />
I have no argument with the message that he wanted to get across- my issue is with the method he used to get it across.  He didn't bother to read other threads- just showed up and posted what was on his mind, denounced others viewpoints, got frustrated and left for greener pastures.  If someone wants to get my support- they need to do the research first, and that includes researching the Crucible to see EVERYONE else's viewpoint.  He didn't do that- had he posted &quot;Shamans are working as intended&quot; I think the roles would have been changed.</div></div><hr />
