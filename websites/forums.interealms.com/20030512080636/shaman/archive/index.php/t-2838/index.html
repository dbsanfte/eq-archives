<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raghnar Spiritweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well i managed to get myself killed while doing the test of patience, i was waiting for Abe when i got attacked.<br />
<br />
It took some time to get back to my corpse and as i expected there where no NPCs around.<br />
<br />
My question is, do i have to do everything all over since i gave the jem to Ooglyn or can i get her to take me to the spot again?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your answers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe you need to give her the gem again, it's what actually kicks her into motion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, you have to go back and get the gem from Bondl which means you have to start over. Hopefully, you can get some ports. Good luck to you. If it's any consolation, I hit a snag during the test of patience also and had to start over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kholossus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I failed this test also a long time ago, gave her the gem but couldn't find her in the water since i had the wrong loc written down. So just go back to FP, Hail Bondl and say &quot; You can buy Booze&quot;. This causes the spirit to spawn in the room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Raghnar Spiritweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the responses, i went back to Bondl, got a new gem,  did the test again and managed to stay alive this time :)<br />
<br />
Thanks to a druid friend i now have my SoW boots, porting me around and waiting for me to do the quest must have been a test of patience for her hehe.</div></div><hr />
