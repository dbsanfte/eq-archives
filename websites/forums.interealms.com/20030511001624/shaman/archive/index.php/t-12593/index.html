<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Innatook</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am so tired of sitting in POJ LF trials group for hours every night, while getting /tells &quot;join us in POV/POS&quot; about every 20 mins. No one wants us in a trials group, but everyone wants us in the upper planes. Or they 'donate' 20pp to buff the hell out of their group, so they can pass while we sit there on our glowing spear.<br />
I say we all go on strike. Don't buff a group unless you are IN that group. That should increase the rate of Shaman getting POS/POV flagged. We are one of the most sought after members of a group, except for the trials group. Let's take a stand and change that.</div></div><hr />

Make a guild group and get you and them through.?<br />
<br />
I waited 4 months before I had finnaly gotten my guild people ready for trials. We failed alot. But we got through. I didnt want to pass in a pick up group.<br />
<br />
You only have to pass once. Don't sit there waiting for a group and not getting any xp. Get guild folks together and spend the time activily getting ready for the fights. Get xp. Get AA. Don't LFG<br />
<br />
And My guild is about as non Uber as they come. (Thank god)<br />

I can usually play about 2 hrs a night so I don't have many options.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">actualy i find if i sit around and be very nice and buff everyone with the simple request that if they pass and have time, could you please help me pass. That worked ok. But your best chance is getting a guild group , cause youknow each other and will tolerate each other more. Frankly, getting a few 65 friends to help you through ( 65 tank/cleric ) will make life alot easier.<br />

Its frustrating i know , ive definetly experienced what your going thrugh. Good luck bro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just gathered a lot of people and got my wife through, then got myself through.

<br />
From what I have seen, the odds of passing in a pickup group are slim.  Your far and away best shot is to talk to friends, and get high level help from them.</div></div><hr />

My advice is, instead of looking to join a group, try looking to start a group.<br />

Dude...if someone asks you to buff their trial group without inviting you in, tell him to let you in the group, or bite your @$$.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Then get a new guild sheesh.  Hanging on to the past is a sure way to become frustrated and bitter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">A lot of us have been in your situation. I, too, got tired of groups wanting my buffs, but not my person in their group. I stopped buffing them. If they were trading aego or kei, then I'd buff them, on the odd chance that I'd get into a group that had already been buffed, yet hadn't gone into the trial yet (i.e., someone got tired of waiting in their group and left). I agree with the others in that if your guild can't/won't get you through, you should look into another. I was unguilded at the time I passed, so finally had to have some high level friends give me a hand. I'm sorry to hear you're having a hard time in the trials. It sucks for shammies in the executioner's trial (which most people try). Good luck to you. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Innatook</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well look at Juujuu's guild, that why she says its so easy. I guess it would be with all lvl 65's with 100 AA's each. I doubt, she would say that if she would have tried at lvl 60. And by the way, thanks for all the positive feedback, since we are all shaman trying to help each other.:-/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kongming</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You best bet is to start the group, not join pickup groups,  u can form it of the LFG in the trail room.  Remember the trails is all about how the group is formed.  you NEED DPS.  And since shaman aren't great DPS unless you have your higher spells, then we decent DPS but still not great.  Normally a group can handle with a good tank(war/pally/sk) or monk tanking if UBER(not likely)  cleric healing, can be a druid if tank is really good, but i wouldn't trust it unless it was a cleric.  and rest high DPS, rogue, ranger, wizard,mage, or necro.  DO not try other semi decent or low dps classes.  The trail group will not be able to handle many low dps classes at once.  Of course it possible but not likely.<br />
<br />
As for your role assumine u have all your spells to your level,  I would start with AE slow(tigirs)  then bane other mobs that the MT is not on, and let your group know it so they can get on it next.  by the time they get to it the mob is at 50-70% with any luck and you done your share of dps.  Another option is just to chain nuke your Posion nuke.  I assume that should work fine, i dunno cause when i did the trail my evoc was like 170 and wasn't worth the effort to fizzle through nuking<br />
<br />
but the key is to be picky about who your group is, even if it take an hour to form and your waiting, u need the right group, and waiting for the right classes and not going oh he LFG and we need an exrta so take him.  no groups of like 2 warriors and a sk and chanter kinda of junk. take your time and wait it out till a decent dps class goes. <br />
<br />
also look at LFG screen often and try and see if classes u need are LFG in PoT, PoN, PoI, PoD.  they my want in trails group to get to storms and valor but to damn lazy or annoyed to look in Justice after hours of LFG there before.  <br />
<br />
One other things LEVEL is important for this,  getting a 55 rogue or something isn't gonna help much.  try to take people level 60 and above only, maybe chanter and cleric can do lower if they are truely needed.  like if you have 3 wizards but no chanter then a low level chanter if that all you can find will do.  and for cleric, well level == better buffs and mana pool, but if that all you can find they can sorta get by i think.<br />
<br />
Try to make sure everyone knows the trail and knows your strat.  Make sure everyone assists, and everyone is on the same page.  you must take charge, but since your a guild leader I assume you know how to do that.  While you don't have to be mean about it, you can't be overly nice.  you have to be picky about your group.  you have to run it tight and try to not alllow screwups</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Phinger Bang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Not trying to be too sarcastic but if a group wants you in Pov/PoS ask them to come run you through trails really quick.  Chances are they arlready have a decent group and at the same time, you can do some networking and move guilds.  I've said this on another post: the trials are a sprint but shaman are marathoners.  Make a deal with a group that you buff: If they pass the trials, request to replace their weakest player and have them do it again with you.<br />
<br />
And gandalfh, there is nothing particularly special about PoV/PoS other then exps.  Its not the best exp around, but it sure is better then PoD/PoN, especially pre-65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Juka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">As time goes by getting flagged for pretty much anything is going to become much harder for the average player, as people who have the exceptional loot move further and further past certain zones. I took a couple months off when PoP came out and when I returned I spent about 3-4 months and over 80 failed attempts before finally passing the trials in PoJ at level 63 - I passed with 2 lvl 65 wizzies, a 65 paladin, 65 cleric, 47 paladin and myself. They were all members of the local uberguild trying to get their 47 pally alt flagged, and they took pity on me (thank Cazic).<br />
<br />
The 80'ish failed attempts I endured were nearly all pickup groups, and equipment disparity was shocking. There is a reason most pickup groups fail (at trials, at least) - most pickup group members are casual players who simply don't have the equipment or skills necessary to pump out the required DPS or manapool needed to pass the trials. I was actually in one pickup group attempting to get flagged when our level 62 warrior was using a lamentation and bloodfire.<br />
<br />
This problem of the well-equipped players moving further and further on is only going to get worse as time goes by, and the problem is further compounded for shamans as we're not needed for trials groups. In fact, we hinder the average pickup trials group - our spot in a trials group is better off going to an extra DPS dealer most times, unless you're in a so-called &quot;uber group&quot;, where you can have 2 level 65 wizzies with 250+ AA's handle everything.<br />
<br />
Some of you will disagree with me and say that shaman's are amazing for trials groups, but I don't see how you can dispute these facts:<br />
<br />
1) Our DPS is limited to our DD's / AE's, DoT's are useless when mobs live for about 15 seconds.<br />
<br />
2) Slow mitigation makes us pretty much useless on anything except the Executioner himself. Also, once again, mobs live for 15 seconds or so.<br />
<br />
3) Our heals, while nice, are no match for a cleric or druid.<br />
<br />
4) Our exceptional mana regen abilities are pretty much negated by the short duration of the entire fight - I think it was around 11 minutes from spawn of first wave to death of the Executioner.<br />
<br />
When I passed trials with my above mentioned uber group that took pity on me, my only job was to Malo mobs so the wizzies resist rates would be decreased. Mobs died so fast to the wizzies that I didn't have time to nuke in between maloing the mobs. I mentioned that I felt sort of wierd just doing malo, and they laughed and said they were just going to go with the 5 of them and decided to pick me up just because they knew I'd been trying for months.<br />
<br />
I'm just glad I passed. I really feel for those of you out there who haven't yet, as it's only going to get harder, which is silly as slowers are needed more in Tier 2+ zones than in almost any other zones in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Xhosa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">DS potions do 30 damage on a level 60 tank. 1 potion will last the duration of the entire trial. a mob bashing on a tank for 1 minute with 30 damage DS will be half dead by the time you get to it. That's half the work done using a DS potion.<br />
<br />
Now a shaman a fantastic asset in a trial. There is more than one way to get through a trial as a shaman. You can slow. But in my opinion this is lost DPS as we use Mage/Druid DS as well as DS potion on the tank.<br />
<br />
The mobs hit very fast but not very hard, perfect for DS. It's 4 mobs beating on the MA which makes healing tough, but 3 mobs on the MA and the healing becomes much easier. <br />
<br />
My guild always takes a shaman into the trial as we look after 1 mob for each round. Then the others take care of the other 3. The shaman pulls 1 mob off the MA with slow and Bane/Epic and then let dog dog beat on the mob while the shaman tanks it. When the others are finished with the other 3 your mob is pretty much dead.  Bane + Epic + Pet kills a mob in under about minute. <br />
<br />
Our typical group is SK/Cleric/Mage/Rogue/Shaman/AN_other. Where AN_Other is the new trialist.<br />
<br />
Also note the rocks must go down first. They are enchanters and tash and slow. If your melee DPS gets slowed they game over. Druid or Magician banishment kills the rocks outright, so no xp or loot, but gets the mob out of the way fast. (Remember to re-imburse the druid/mage for the star ruby's)<br />
<br />
Hope this gives you an idea or different tactic to try.</div></div><hr />

I got flagged at level 60.  I experimented with different group types.  I have friends that are willing to come out and help me when I need.  I figured out what classes I wanted for the trial, got them, and rocked the trial ever since with that group.  Shut up about not being able to get flagged.  It's your own damn fault for not having friends to help you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gymkataman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I consider myself pretty luck, I am a weekend player for the most part and was able to get flagged in a pickup group (executioner trial).  The advice I got from the 65 BST that helped was for me to Cripple the MOBs and not worry about slow till the final MOB.  The DPS from a 65 BST and his pet was great and we had a 65 warrior with 200+ AA to help.  Other than those 2 the rest of the grp was pretty casual players with average gear.  We just sent tells to the LVL 65s and they were more than willing to help.  Also got 3 research components to drop during the trial.  A lot of it is just luck I guess - and the reward is not that great cause as soon as I got flagged all I got was tells to join BoT groups, so I guess I just can't win.</div></div><hr />

It's not because someone is in a big guild it was easy to go through PoJ trial when we did this. &quot;Big guild&quot; didn't wait for everyone to ding 65 to move in PoP (and if you think that.. you are stupid).<br />
I did 9 PoJ trial attempt before getting my flag myself at 61, I m now 65 with elemental flag and a few elemental toys and I worked my ass to get that freaking flag at 61 with guild group / pickup groups.<br />
Sure, if you sit and wait for someone to send you a tell asking you to join a trial group, you'll never get that flag.<br />

Make you own group, ask your friends, ask your guild.. Here how you can get a flag.. Whining on shaman board will not give ya that flag.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even for those with uber-friends and reasonably high-level guilds it can be difficult to do the trials &quot;80 or so times&quot; that it might take to do it with a pickup group.  Try explaining to my 6-year old why I have to be locked in my office for 8 hours on a saturday to get flagged.<br />
<br />
How many times have I assembled a group..only to have someone else complete the trial and delay us yet another 30 minutes? (Fuggin people don't want to try any other trials..)<br />

You got flagged? Good for you.  I'll be flagged and I'm sorry I asked for help on this board to get there.  People like you are an embarrassment to the good things this board stands for.

At any rate, Innatook you're probably going to <br />

Valor. You might want to shop for one now. <br />
<br />
I agree with your stance on not buffing groups if<br />

nuke. Don't bother slowing, the mobs don't last<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">There are other trials that don't rely on raw DPS ya know...  Fire is probably the hardest of all, but IMO Torture is just as easy/doable as execution and doesn't rely on high DPS.  Put together a balanced group and try some other trials instead of sitting on your butt waiting your turn at exe.  <br />
<br />
Execution is the simplest to figure out of course since the basic how-to has been posted on every message board known to EQ about 100 times or so, but there are other trials of very similar difficulty and possibly easier depending on your group makeup.<br />
<br />
I did execution at level 61/62 several times for myself and friends/guildies.  It's most certainly doable for a mediocre equipped group around level 62 IF they work together well.  If you have a group of mediocre or worse equipped people and on top of that they don't work together quickly, yer gonna fail and fail and that goes for pretty much any trial but especially for execution since it's so reliant on fast DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">What worked for me:<br />
Forget about a chanter - get c3 in the nexus beforehand.<br />
Do nothing but nuke your brains out and maybe a quick spot heal.<br />
Get mage dmg increasing nukey bracer and 2 fists of ixblat (lvl 62) or stunning swords (lvl 61) for dogdog ahead of time.<br />
<br />
The worst thing about trials for people with limited time is that the group seems to do a little better with each attempt (hopefully) as they get the hang of each other.  So if you don't have 4 or 5 hours to pound away at it, your chances are very bad.<br />
<br />
And hopefully ignore the losers who come here to feel superior instead of help people.  My guess is they wax nasty on people who don't have malo and torpor, either: &quot;just pick it up from the guild bank you worthless piece of crap excuse for a shaman - GOD how simple is that, moron?&quot;.<br />

Correction.  I was 61 with only the single target regen storebought spell at the time.  The difference between 60 and 61 without any level 61 spells is negligable.  I didn't do any hunting in the tier 1 zones because my computer died for 2 weeks while I was getting it fixed.  I got flagged the 2nd day I got back online.  My first day back online I was trying to get flagged with some random people in the poj trial, and got to the boss once.  I figured out what was the problem with my group I had, and got some friends to come out and help me get flagged.<br />
<br />
I'm also surprised you have any friends with that mouth.<br />
Messageboards just bring out the best in people I guess.<br />
<br />
Maybe I should ask some Watchers members to help....that is if they aren't busy killing Grum, waking the sleeper or whatever else they do when they get bored.<br />
Why don't you?  I'd come out to help you get flagged.  I could probably get a full group together if you try after we are done raiding for the day, or before the raiding for the day starts.  In a week I got my 55 monk, a 53 mage friend, 2 61 druid friends, and another random friend of a friend needing flagging.  We succeeded in the trial 5 times that week, with a grand total of 3 failures in there.  It's not hard.<br />
<br />
Why even bother posting if you're going to be a bitz, if you don't have some advice, shut the hell up.<br />
Oh yes.  Advice.  Hmm.  Maybe I should take your suggestion.  OH WAIT.<br />
