<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>umpaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I restarted my epic recently as I couldn't find the gem to start the test of patients. I did the test of patients fine and then iced the sk and pally in RM. I got their loots and went with my gem to WK to talk to a wandering spirit. I was waiting in the spot they talk about in the spoiler and it never came. I finnally saw a level 7 ranger in zone and offered some buffs if she could track it down for me. The ranger led me to the spirit and that's when things got wierd.<br />
<br />
I hailed the spirit repeatedly but it would not stop. I must have hailed it from right on top of it 30 times to no effect. Finally my ranger helper hailed it and it stopped immediately. She held it in place and I handed over the stuff. I found out that this must have been the alt for a fellow shaman player as she said &quot;what sheild of falsehood&quot; after i gave the stuff over and said i was finished. I don't really need that sheild at 62 lol.<br />
<br />
I've read some on this board about using this part as a faction exploit of the epic. Did they recently put something in here to try to defeat this? I'm thinking that due to restarting my faction may have been a little too high and that's why I couldn't stop it by hailing it?<br />
<br />
Anyone else heard about this or had this experience? I'm wondering if this is new or an old story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zugugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think it's anything new. When I did my epic (over a year ago, perhaps 2), I had trouble getting him to stop too. I think the best you can do is just keep mashing the hail button and running over the spirit until he stops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>umpaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hmmm zug i think i see your point. you generally have to be infront of a mob and standing in the right position to hail it, otherwise it ignores you. <br />
<br />
my problem was probably just hailing from behind instead of infront of the spirit (since i was chasing it. damn that little bugger is fast!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah be infront of it  that works</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I had the same problem, I just chased after it and eventually got its attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>foohealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Get in front, that stopped it for me about a month ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You have to pass the big fast wisp and get ahead of it when you Hail. You don't have to be facing it, just ahead of it. Being &quot;on top of it&quot; isn't good enough.<br />
<br />
As for using Woe/Envy/Marr repeatedly as a faction pumper, nothing has changed there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Siamese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I just grabbed my pet druid on the second account, parked the shaman at the zone, tracked the little bastage with the druid, snared him, ran to the shaman, rooted him in front of the shaman, and zoned the druid.  Worked quite well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I just ran behind it and turned the stuff in, yeah I remember being kinda irritated by that.</div></div><hr />
