How to Grief Another Guild's Instance in the Plane of Time<br />
<br />
Are you sick of only getting time every 5 days? Is there another guild on your server you'd like to &quot;get&quot;?<br />
Here is your chance! <br />
<br />
A few words, by way of explanation: the plane of time is controlled by instancing. That means in theory that <br />
each guild in time should be able to share equally. Each killing their own individually spawned mobs, without the<br />
blocking and griefing so common to other expansions.<br />
<br />
In practice, instances are attuned to the first person who zones into the tier one trials in Plane of Time B. So if you<br />
clear half of the plane of time one night, and come back a second night, as long as someone who was there on the<br />
first night zones in first, you get to restart time at roughly the same spot after defeating tier 1.<br />
<br />
&quot;But wait!&quot; you say. &quot;How do I grief if the zone is instanced?&quot;<br />
<br />
Here's how: camp a player in tier one, and log that player on while your rivals are doing that tier. You won't be<br />
in a raid, and will get booted, but you will get the toon you logged in attuned to your rival's instance. The next day,<br />
zone the toon you zoned in on your rivals in first with your own guild. Voila, you get their instance! Grats you on<br />
extra ph4t l00tz! <br />
<br />
I hope Sony fixs this too.  Very soon.</div></div><hr />

There is a little bit more to it then just the first person to zone in. If that was the case any one guild could farm time endlessly. Simply by remakeing the raid with a new leader.</div></div><hr />

This isn't news, it's the same on every server..  like some bizaare soap opera, the drama between the top few guilds is so thick you could cut it with a knife :rolleyes:  I wish they'd take EQ back to its roots, it never should have been the action game PoP turned it into, and hence never should have attracted this type of player in large enough numbers for them to become a problem.</div></div><hr />
