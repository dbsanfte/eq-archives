<br />
This is the third of three polls gathering feedback.<br />
<br />
This poll asks about the adjustment of the spell itself.</div></div><hr />

I think its a great idea Mac. I think we can put our heads together and come up with some reasonable alternatives to this mega-nerf they have lined up. Maybe what we need is a thread asking for ideas to modify the spell in a way we can accept, then one big poll offering a BUNCH of options for the spell. <br />
<br />
But heres whats NOT gonna work, people.<br />
<br />
&quot;Put it back the way it was&quot;<br />
&quot;Make it last 10 minutes&quot;<br />
&quot;Make it cost more mana, but everything else the same&quot;<br />
<br />
Stuff like that isnt gonna fly. We need to move on. Accept the fact the spell is GOING to be adjusted downward, and come up with some numbers we can live with, and that other classes can live with, and that seems relatively balnaced when you step back and look at the &quot;big picture&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I think he means add an aggro modifier to the target, so that you would have to be more careful of using it on everything in sight. Rogues already haev asked me NOT to use it on them in some situations, cause if they get even 1 round of aggro on some mobs, they are squishy. If pets with it cast on them start stealing aggro from the MA's, raids can wipe pretty easy. <br />
<br />
Personally I dont like the aggro modifier idea, but its certainly a reasonable suggestion, and worth further discussion.</div></div><hr />

Depends on the target. Increasing the aggro modifier on the proc would help tanks MA, but would be a detriment to pets and melee DPS classes like Rogues, Rangers, Monks and Zerkers. Currently, I dont think the proc has any &quot;defined&quot; aggro modifier, other than the normal aggro generated by a proc of any kind (like mage pet-weapons).<br />
<br />
As I said, I would rather not bring ANOTHER variable into the equation. We have enough now with cast time, recast time, mana cost, proc rate on pets, proc rate on PCs, and damaeg per proc. I would rather find some livable numbers in those variables, rather than add another.</div></div><hr />

How is this possible? You want the spell to be stronger than it is in its current form? More beneficial? <br />
<br />
Or are you saying we should be looking at more of a &quot;give and take&quot; idea. Lower proc rate and additional re-cast time in exchange for longer duration and reduced mana cost? <br />
<br />
I guess I am not following you Beth. I know you are of the &quot;Its fine the way it always has been&quot; mindset, and thats OK, your certainly entitled to your opinion, but I guess I dont understand your thoughts here. The spell is GOING to be nerfed. End of story. Period. Finito. Done deal. The sooner we accept that, and try to find a reasonable comprimise to this HUGE reamjob we are about to recieve, the more productive we can be in this discussion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They already downgraded the pets proccing to match the PC proccing.... why does the spell need an extra downgrade by adding a re-cast? That penalty is just an irritation. The thing that makes this so useful is that it's easy to add damage to a fight when you need to.... <br />
<br />
Grayed out spell gems are not something anyone should be advocating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">For me the goals for this spell should be:<br />
<br />
1) Be convenient to use<br />
2) Provide a reasonable damage per mana ratio<br />
3) Be balanced for solo, group and raid encounters<br />
4) Provide an appropriate amount of aggro for it's use<br />
5) Allow for skilled, attentive shaman to get more benefit from the spell<br />
<br />
The fact that pets proc'ed so much broke #2 for me.  That's why I could support changing the way pet's proc'ed.  The 30 second recast goes directly against #1 and #5, though, so it's not a good change.<br />
<br />
In order to meet all of these goals I'd recommend:<br />
<br />
a) Keep the cast and recast times the way they are now<br />
b) Keep the changes to change the pet proc rates<br />
c) Keep the aggro on the recepient and don't put on the caster<br />
d) Tweak the proc damage and mana cost to meet goals #2 and #3 if you feel they are out of line (which I don't)<br />
<br />
If SOE can't balance #2 and #3 with recommendation (D) above then consider making the spell a group only buff.<br />

<br />
I don't think it does need to be changed. As long as pet proc rate is tuned back to reasonable so we can't get 250+ dps from a single pet then the spell is fine as it is. If your really worried about spiritual channeling allowing us to keep it up on alot of people for the whole 2 minutes it runs then just make the panther always cast from mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Just a fix of the proc rate of the pets is all that should be done with this spell. <br />
<br />
Its mana usage is ok as it is, I can keep it up on like 3-4 pets/PCs in a group if all else I have to do is malos and slow. As soon as some patch healing or rebuffing comes into play, my mana goes down fast. Not to mention if I do not have some kind of crack on ...<br />
<br />
Recast times are pure evil, I have no idea how SOE can even think about adding more recast times. Greyed out spell icons are simply frustrating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">They already downgraded the pets proccing to match the PC proccing.... why does the spell need an extra downgrade by adding a re-cast?

<br />
Grayed out spell gems are not something anyone should be advocating.<br />
I am not advocating them, I dont like them any more than anyone else. But if the choice is 30 seconds or 10 seconds, I will take 10, eh? I honestly DO NOT see &quot;instant re-cast&quot; as an option on this spell. SOE will not do it. Time to admit that and try and cut our losses.<br />
<br />
As for the pet proc rate, I am not sure if this is still the case, but its not REALLY at the same rate as PC's. Here is Retrons analysis, and I assume this is still the condition of the proc rate on pets:<br />
So far (on Test), Leopard has kept its 400% proc rate modifier so there should be no changes on players. The beastlord proc buffs, magician epic clicky buffs etc have all gained a 150% modifier.<br />
<br />
BST buffed warders proc 6 or 7 times a minute and knowing that post nerf they'll still be doing the same, suggests the base for somewhat buffed pets is being changed to 100*(6.5/150) = 4.3 procs a minute.<br />
<br />
Therefore if things stay as they currently are on Test, leopard/panther will go off 4.3*4 times a minute, or 17 times a minute. That's still an order of magnitude above player procs but a good chunk below the 30 or so you'll currently get from a fully buffed pet.<br />
<br />
For Leopard, 10 procs a minute is ~67 DPS, currently at 30 procs a minute it's ~200 DPS. If my calculations are right, post nerf it'll be ~114 DPS, probably a little higher as we have better DEX buffs.<br />
<br />
114 DPS for 540 mana every 90 seconds is still pretty good going.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But yeah, bitter is a good word to describe how I feel. Bitter and betrayed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I honestly DO NOT see &quot;instant re-cast&quot; as an option on this spell. SOE will not do it. I am guessing that you are supposing that having &quot;instant recast&quot; makes us too powerful, in SOE's eyes.<br />
<br />
What are the circumstances in which we might be too powerful?<br />
<br />
Group.  The MaxShamanPowerGroup would be what?  Druid healer with BooBoo, Beastlord slower with warder, plus 3 Shadowknights with pets, plus DogDog.  That's ten targets for Panther.  All I have to do is maintain the buff on those 10 targets; in every 90 second cycle I must devote 50 seconds to casting Panther, and I have 40 seconds for cannibalizing and medding.  I have enchanter and beast and druid mana buffs, and we're outdoors and I'm on my horse.  The pulls and positioning are flawless.  Everyone makes sure that Panther is always the top buff.  <br />
<br />
550/proc x 10 procs/ min x 10 proccers = 55,000 dpm = 916 dps.<br />
<br />
At some point I'll run out of mana, and that will slow things down.  Plus nothing in life runs at 100% efficiency, and for sure this project won't.  Can we maintain 70% efficiency?  50% efficiency?  Who knows.<br />
<br />
Let's say I can genuinely maintain 70% efficiency.  That would put me at 641 dps for a theoretical sustainable maximum dps in a group.  Is that too much?  Maybe it is.<br />
<br />
So here's my group question:  What is the theoretical maximum sustainable dps, that we don't think a shaman in a group should ever be able to surpass?<br />
<br />
Raid. The group scenario above is carefully crafted to have max Panther targets and no need for the shaman to do anything but cast Panther on those targets.  That's a pretty unusual group.  But it's pretty easy on a raid to have a shaman who has nothing to do but maintain Panther on as many characters as possible during the Burn call on a boss mob.<br />
<br />
550/proc x 10procs/min x 18 proccers = 99,000 dpm = 1650 dps<br />
<br />
Note that the buff only lands on character number 18 at the point that we are 90 seconds into the fight, and is just fading out on the first one in the same moment.  The shaman has been building toward 1650 dps for a minute and a half, and now must maintain it.  Let's say that the total fight lasts three minutes.  That gives us 90 seconds that builds toward 1650 dps (averaging 825 dps over those 90 seconds) and 90 seconds at 1650 dps (must keep casting Panther on people even when the mob is down to 4% health).  That gives a shaman a theoretical burst dps of 1237 over those three minutes, assuming 100% efficiency.<br />
<br />
But again, you can't achieve 100% efficiency:  people will wander out of range, you will mistarget, and so on.  But let's assume 90% efficiency for this brief time period.  That would yield an attainable burst dps of 1113 dps over those three minutes.  Is that too much burst dps?  Maybe it is.<br />
<br />
Here, then, is my raid question:  What is the theoretical maximum burst dps, that we don't think a shaman in a raid should ever be able to surpass?<br />
<br />
Once we have answered these two questions, then we can ask the third question:  what is the best way to adjust these spells so that they cannot surpass these levels of damage?<br />
<br />
Anything we say before answering these three questions is just shooting in the dark.  Is a 30 second refresh timer going to do it?  Is a 10 second refresh timer going to do it?  Is increased mana cost or aggro modifiers going to do it?  If we haven't decided what the cap on shaman sustained damage / burst damage ought to be, then we are just doing blind guesswork and seeing what happens.<br />
<br />
Bah, this post is too long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>kayen85</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Why is compromise needed? It's like a teacher awarding you an A+ on a paper then the following month when looking back on his grades saying hmm I'll just give him B with no justifcation. <br />

So here we are fighting tooth and nail to get a B+? Cause you don't have the confidents to stand up and say NO change was needed and deserve the A+.  <br />

Just leave the spell as is and fix what you set out to fix. If we want to settled for some half assed version thats fine, but there is no reason too and make it known.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Lorianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">No Macnair it wasn't too long.  I actually understood that.  And I read every word.<br />
<br />
My queries ...<br />
<br />
What is normal dps for other classes?  Wizards, mage pets, rangers, rogues?  How much of an increase does panther do over the normal?<br />
Take a Qvic group or even a Riftseekers Queens group. Use a War, rogue, ranger, wizard, cleric, shaman.  Use Time+, Qvic geared average.<br />
<br />
What is the percentage of dps that we are adding on these mobs (not named) casting Panther?  Assume fights last at max 2 minutes, and assume just single pulls.  Panth is cast on war, rogue, dogdog and occasionally cleric pet (or leave out the cleric pet and just cast it on the battle clerics).  Ranger is autofiring not meleeing.  Assume the shaman is nahil on inc, malos/or sinia next, then goes into dps mode.<br />
<br />
Can this even be formulated?  And if so, using a 5 mob pull as the average (so maybe 13 - 15 minutes), what is the difference in dps with Panth the first 15 minutes and then no panther the next 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
Used this make-up because this is the group I regularly hunt with.  And to tell you the truth I don't see too many groups with a war, bst, bst mage, mage, shaman out there.  Could be possible, I just haven't encountered them.<br />
<br />
Query number 2 - sorry Macnair<br />
<br />
Raiding Anguish.  As a shaman you step into Anguish without RGC loaded, get used to seeing &quot;loading please wait&quot;.<br />
<br />
3 shaman in the raid.  Each one assigned to 2 rebuffs for rezzed, one assigned to Malos on all inc, 2 assigned to ffa nahil for clears to minis and nameds.  ALL assigned to RGC for minis and nameds.<br />
<br />
One assigned to panth pets, one assigned to MT/OT/RT's, one assigned to rogues, etc.<br />
<br />
I do not think there is any way to show dps on an average with this scenario.  But I do know that if I end up with the /tar pet cast panth chore, I am hating life. <br />
<br />
So this is probably extreme ... and I am really waiting for Macnair to tell me to learn how to parse and formulate cause he won't do the work for me.  <br />
<br />
I wish I could.  Because I just don't see how the spell as it stands with instant cast, large mana, is over-powering us. In either scenario.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Your rss group is already pretty high damage, Lor.  Your warrior is around 250 since he's tanking, ranger 300ish, rogue anywhere from 350 (Jagged Timeforged Blade) up to 500 (Crystal Dagger / Soulskive / DDoN) depending on how current his dagger is.  Anguish rogues are 600ish.  Discs boost all three a pretty significant amount if they're not being lazy.  Wizards I don't have such a lock on, but probably 4-500?  Dunno how their DoN spell affected the overtime output.<br />
<br />
ANYHOW, in a group with dps that high to begin (that's about as high a base as you can get), 100dps on each melee from Panther is just &quot;good.&quot;  The concern, I believe, is how 100dps on each melee affects groups with much lower base damage.  Lade a group with unguilded &amp; lfg rogues, paladins, etc, and run the numbers again.  The difference, percentage-wise, is somewhat more extreme.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">That's the grouping scenario, though, and that doesn't seem to be the target of the current nerf ... &quot;bat&quot; seems too small.. nerf... steamroller?  The nerf still allows casting on three group members.  It's a terrible awful way of implementation, but that's the numbers.  Three people is how many they want us keeping the spell on.  In groups, that's a reasonable number.  No abuse with dru &amp; sk pets, they're dropping the hammer on that.  But Maw-ing your group's worth of melee is fine, according to this nerf.<br />
<br />
The extreme limitation comes into play on raids or named encounters, where we'd be burning mana to deal as much damage as possible with our spell, even running Spiritual Channelling to burn hp as well as mana, to deal the max damage.  The current nerf says No to that.  Group or raid, three is the maximum Maws you can do.  Not even allowed to load both to run 3 good &amp; 3 bad.  Three shall be the number of thy counting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Anything we say before answering these three questions is just shooting in the dark.

I think the &quot;broken&quot; factor comes into play on raids. My guild hs 6+ active raiding shaman. We can afford to have a couple dedicated to Panther. When you have no other mana-duties, you can keep Panther running on 5+ pets fairly easily. <br />
<br />
On one big boss mob, a Shaman can channel and Panther 15-20 targets with relative ease. THATS a lot of DPS. I think THAT is the aspect of the spell they are trying to fix. <br />
<br />
30 second recast means 3 targets per shaman, period. No possibility for more. A 15 second recast would still allow the &quot;1 Shaman, 6 Pets&quot; situation on raids, but wouldnt allow the &quot;Panther the Raid&quot; thing. A 10 second recast would be virtually the same, except easier to manage for us. With the reduced proc rate, I dont see a need to nerf the cast time more than 10 seconds. At 10 seconds, it gives us a pretty solid &quot;Channel-Burst&quot; DPS potential without being TOTALLY overpowering (Channeling still has its own prohibitive recast timer to prevent that). <br />
<br />
Anyway, I am about done with the whole thing I think. Its really bothering me. I have been playing this game since the day it went live, and getting daily reports from friends in Beta a month before that. I have tried, in that time, to play the game as its designed. I did Naggy and Vox pre-Kunark. I killed Kunark dragons pre-Velious. I didnt get into VT until PoP came out, but I did the full Luclin Bosses-Ssra-VT thing. I was there for the 1st of 2nd PoP God kill for every step of my guilds progression. I was there for that first TRC win, when we broke into Time. I was there for that first Ikky 4 win. I missed the first Uqua win, but I was there for the one before that, when we had Braxt to 1% and wiped. <br />
<br />
I say all this because in all that time, I have never felt as betrayed and angry as I am right now. Never. I have been a staunch defender of SOE through the years. I have argued on their side on many topics. I have tried to see the &quot;big picture&quot; and not just the &quot;Shaman perspective&quot;. <br />
<br />
But this . . . this is just . . . I dunno. I am totally flabergasted, confused, hurt, bitter, angry, all rolled into one. I honestly felt SOE would to the right thing here. I felt they would keep it a nice DPS contribution while limiting the ability to use it in &quot;broken&quot; situations (think of 2 Mage Pet Armys, and 2 Shaman standing there panthering them all, bing, bang, bong).<br />
<br />

Please take your energy (or whatever is left after this SoE screwing that came out of the blue) and work the problem.  We are not divided in this.<br />

Besides the (wise) forbearance on pushing this travesty to Live, we've recieved no communication on the intent of such a massive change.  Is there a target number for shaman dps that's being exceded in some particular situation?  A specific limitation they're trying to achieve on how much one spell contributes?  Is there a balance they're trying to strike with another class?  Right now intent is more than somewhat overshadowed by results; more like occluded.  In game we have titles referring to clairvoyance, but it's pretty poor to expect us to go without any communication irl.</div></div><hr />

Appearantly not.  A downgrade in a spell is generally called a nerf in eq.  Your world might vary.<br />
DID YOU THINK SOE WAS EVER GONNA LET THE SPELL FLY AS IT WAS!<br />
Nope, but prett much every single person on this board knew they'd over nerf it.  Some didnt I guess.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am so tired of you rocket-scientists thinking that ANYONE asked for a &quot;NERF&quot;. You dont even know the definition of the word. And its obvious most of you havent got the slightest clue about class balance. <br />
<br />
Who's Idea of class balance?   And what the hell is class balance anyway?  For every single person its different. Personally, I play eq to have fun, not be a slave to yet another crappy spell.<br />
<br />
<br />

Nope, haven't forgot.  No such thing as wizard level dps in a caster group, sol/sop isnt optimal for all groups.<br />
<br />

And everyone who doesn't agree with you is stupid.  Nice.<br />
<br />
As an addendum:  Blazz, I dont blame you for the nerf.  In the grand scheme of nerfing, you simply dont matter.  Youre just one of the few shamans asking for a self-nerfing.  We KNEW the pet change would happen.  Dont think many were happy, given how nice it was.  I think everyone had accepted it, wanted to gripe, and go on.  I STILL cant see how you or anyone else is surprised though.  Sony ALWAYS messes these things up.</div></div><hr />

Blazz, I can safely say that your grasp on logic is tenious in your argument style.  Your final paragraph is why people think you are a fool.  You a slowly slipping into Millman status.  Just because people don't agree with you does not make the idiots, but does reflect (poorly)  on the author.<br />
<br />
We don't want to be gods, but I think most people think it is kindakooky to want to nerf your own class.  A change in the proc rate on pets is a nerf. period end of stoy.  if it makes it better for you to delude yourself  into calling it an adjustment, fine.  The rest of the people will see it as a nerf.<br />
<br />
Has the spell radically changed the game?  No.  Has it allowed groups/raids to radically change what they could before? No Has it made them able to do it a little faster?  Sure.  Is it that big of a chane?  No.<br />
<br />
I cannot fathom why you would want to change something that has revitalized a class that had faded with every expansion since our glory days?  <br />
<br />
Do I think you caused the nerf? of course not.  I do not think they cared what we (or you)think one way or the other.  Sadly, the only way that has any demonsterable showing of sucess with the developers is to gripe, complain and act like fools.  <br />
<br />
I did not make those rules, but since that is the only thing they will listen to at SOE that is how we must operate.  This boards willingness to embrace the nerf (of any type) only guarantees its coming.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>hasek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">option not listed. NO recast time, reduce pet procs to those of PC's. While 30 seconds is insulting, 10 seconds is annoying and tedious. I don't want to see another freakin grayed gem slot and have to pound on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Assume fights last at max 2 minutes, and assume just single pulls.  Panth is cast on war, rogue, dogdog and occasionally cleric pet (or leave out the cleric pet and just cast it on the battle clerics).  Ranger is autofiring not meleeing.  Assume the shaman is nahil on inc, malos/or sinia next, then goes into dps mode.Three basic targets for panther:  warrior, rogue, dogdog; plus occasionally battle cleric:  call this 3.2 targets.  Assuming 100% efficiency:<br />
<br />
550/proc x 10procs/min x 3.2 proccers = 17,600 dpm = 293 dps <br />
<br />
Efficiency will indeed be high, because there are only 3.2 targets to keep track of, and 90 seconds per cycle to do it in.  Still, the shaman does have other things to do, and not every pull will be instantaneous.  Assuming 80% efficiency (seems reasonable, with an attentive shaman and fast pulls):  that gives us 234 dps as a realistic attainable goal.<br />
<br />
That's hardly a game breaking amount of dps.  It's only about 37% of the theoretical maximum sustainable dps (641) I suggested above:  but that scenario was stacked to allow the shaman to contribute the absolute maximum dps.  <br />
<br />
Well geared wizards and rogues are in the 400-600 dps range.  I would need someone to come up with a theoretical maximum sustainable dps figure for each of them, to compare to the theoretical max that I calculated.  <br />
<br />
In a typical group, though, it looks like the direct dps provided by wizards and rogues will outdamage the cooperative dps provided by a shaman, by a factor of about 2 to 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Raiding Anguish.  3 shaman in the raid.  ... ALL assigned to RGC for minis and nameds.  One assigned to panth pets, one assigned to MT/OT/RT's, one assigned to rogues, etc. This sounds like a typical raid setup:  planned to achieve a goal and win an encounter, not planned for the sake of maximizing shaman dps.  <br />
<br />
So even though I can calculate out a theoretical msximum burst dps of 1113 over 3 minutes of a raid, that's not what people actually do.<br />
<br />
If you have the assignment you hate of panthering 6 pets:<br />
<br />
550/proc x 10procs/min x 6 proccers = 33,000 dpm = 550 dps<br />
<br />
During the first 30 seconds you are just working up to this amount:  so for those 30 seconds your average is 275 dps.<br />
<br />
Over the whole 3 minutes, then, you have 30 seconds at 275 dps followed by 150 seconds at 550 dps (you must continue to maintain panther on these pets until the very end of the fight):  90,750 total damage, 504 dps.<br />
<br />
You won't manage to do this with 100% efficiency:  but let's assume you achieve 90% efficiency over this brief period:  454 dps for a real figure for burst dps in a raid setting.<br />
<br />
That's a real contribution; but it is still probably less than your wizards and rogues are contributing at that level.<br />
<br />
Here's the problem, as I see it, though.<br />
<br />
People may or may not think that having a shaman provide cooperative burst damage of 454 dps for three minutes is too much.  But many people will think that having a shaman theoretically able to provide 1113 dps for three minutes is too much.  That is:  it is not the amount that a shaman typically does provide that they fear; it is the maximum aount that a shaman might possibly provide that they fear.<br />
<br />
My questions remain.  What is the amount of burst dps on a raid, and what is the amount of sustained dps in a group, that should be the amount no shaman can surpass?  And, with those answers in hand, what is the best mechanism to make it so that no shaman can surpass those numbers?<br />
<br />
Just to keep the ball rolling, I might propose two numbers:  <br />
<br />
If a highly-skilled and highly-efficient shaman with excellent gear and aa can in the proper circumstances generate 600 dps over 3 minutes in a raid setting, we should not prevent this.  <br />
<br />
If a highly-skilled and highly-efficient shaman with excellent gear and aa can in the proper circumstances generate 1000 dps over 3 minutes in a raid setting, we should indeed prevent this.<br />
<br />
Now.  We may spend soe time arguing about those numbers, but after we have agreed on some such numbers as these, we can proceed to argue about whether this will be best achieved by adjusting the proc rate, or the amount of the DD, or the mana cost of the spell, or the refresh rate, or some other factor, or some combination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Personally, I think SoE overreacted (as usual) and nerfed a spell that didn't need to be nerfed.  The problem wasn't the spell itself, the problem was that pets were coded with an innate enhanced proc rate, and this spell fell into that category.<br />
<br />
Their reaction?  Fix pet proc rates AND nerf the spell.  Typical SoE reaction, using a backhoe to dig a hole for a fencepost.<br />
<br />
Adjusting pet proc rates was all they had to do to bring the spell back into balance, but this nerfing of the spell by turning it into the hellspawned bastard stepchild of FA is going beyond the beam.<br />
<br />
My vote on the list above was to extend duration and increase mana cost, because I'd like to spend less time refreshing a 90 second buff.  I'll gladly spend the extra mana for it to last for 3 minutes instead of 90 seconds.<br />
<br />
After they fix pet proc rates, they don't have to DO anything else to balance the spell.</div></div><hr />

Still, nobody was 'screaming' for a nerf.  <br />
<br />
If you can't imagine that a person would feel betrayed when they agreed to compromise and instead got mugged, then you need more imagination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Come on, we've been discussing this for a while now.  Post after post after post of folks who just knew in their hearts an over nerf would happen.  Anger, yes.  Surprise?  no.<br />
Okay, 'screaming for a nerf' is overstating it.  Still, asking for an 'adjustment' and getting it is hardly a betrayal.  Besides, theres nothing to really 'betray'.  No promises were made about this spell.  Agreeing to compromise is meaningless since it's not an interactive process.  <br />
The spell will probably be un-nerfed some before it goes live, but its solely due to people screaming bloody murder, not because of reasoned arguments.<br />
<br />
--edit--<br />
To answer the original question.  From what we know, they have two issues with the spell.  Too much power on pets, and buffing entire raids.  Part one was solved by nerfing(sorry,'adjusting') pet proc rate.  Other can be solved by simply making it a group castable spell only.  30 second timer will basically kill this spells usefulness in anything but a chain pulling group.<br />
<br />
I'm still shocked that some are surprised they(Sony) screwed it up.  They've not had much luck at making changes to powerful abilities without going overboard.</div></div><hr />
