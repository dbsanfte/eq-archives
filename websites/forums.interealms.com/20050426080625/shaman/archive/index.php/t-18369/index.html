<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm currently 59, but I noticed that in the next few levels I'll be relying more on root rotting for exp and was hoping to find help from the experts.  When you rootrot do you slow the mob?  I just picked up malo so I figure my spell line up will go like malo, root, slow, dot, dot, dot.  Do you guys tend to slow?  I figure it's worth the mana for the damage I take when root breaks.  I currently have epic, bane and pox.  Oh and another thing, should I hold back on my poison dots since they are less mana efficient?  Any advice is appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I slow when I root rot mobs. Your likely to get hit as your re-rooting and unslowed mobs are not only bad for your health, they tend to interrupt your casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">SLOW!!!! Always Slow!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>veggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't see why not to slow... could save your ass when root brakes (and it will break with nife/pox)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Always slow.  <br />
<br />
A couple times when I've had 2 mobs at once it has gone like this:<br />
<br />
1)  I'll root park one and dot it, then get busy with the first one.  Sometimes get so busy I forget to slow 2nd one.<br />
<br />
2) Finish first one, 2nd mob might be at 50%.<br />
<br />
3) me: &quot;Man, I hate wasting a slow on a mob at 50% - I could just DoT it again with that mana and it would probably be dead.  Save that 300 mp&quot;<br />
<br />
4) When root invariably breaks I lose more HPs than if I had slowed and canni'd back the mana. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I didn't see anything about doggy in your method. Your not using him? Otherwise you should be slowing the mob just to not have to heal him.<br />
<br />
As everyone else said you should slow always.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Is using doggie (and then having to heal doggie) more or less efficient than just root-rotting? (nowhere near this point yet, please no flames! im not fireproof!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Is using doggie (and then having to heal doggie) more or less efficient than just root-rotting? (nowhere near this point yet, please no flames! im not fireproof!)<br />
<br />
If the mob is slowed there usually is never a reason to have to heal doggy. After the fight just sit them down and they regen fast. When you get a method down of the right dot's and DD's to let the dog get and keep aggro there is no need to root. Just back off and let dog tank. When a mob is down to around 40 percent I cast Bane and it will come after me but it won't be alive for long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Is using doggie (and then having to heal doggie) more or less efficient than just root-rotting? (nowhere near this point yet, please no flames! im not fireproof!)<br />
<br />
As a general rule, dog-dog is super efficient.  I always use him if possible.  Root-rotting, self-tanking, pet-tanking, etc.  Normally only spells I use on pet are Haste and Regen.  IF I use summoned wpns then I'll give him a full suite of dex buffs.<br />
<br />
Pets have same regen as mobs do (i.e. not fighting = super regen) and I'm under the impression that casting a regen spell on a pet causes his 'super-regen' to be activated even when fighting.  I don't have any proof other than my own observations, but pretty sure I read about it here on the Crucible.  <br />
<br />
Only time I don't bother with pet is if I'm soloing mobs that hit for 300+ (currently Crystalline Golems in PoV).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I didn't see anything about doggy in your method.<br />
<br />
<br />
I was just thinking about times when it isn't feasible to use him ie: the mobs hits too hard for me or him to tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hail,<br />
<br />
I virtually always slow for the above reasons mentioned.  You can get away with not doing it on occasion, but it is more than likely going to bite you in the bearbutt for NOT slowing more than the slight mana cost slowing causes.<br />
<br />
I pretty much always have dogdog up even if I'm root/rotting.  Great to have an expendable no cast time method to temporarily CC when that add comes by.  /pet hold really makes this more viable.  I don't let him attack when I'm soloing in Tactics unless the mob is running at like 5% health.  I root runners at 15% and dot them down w/o dogdog's help because the adds from a runner are more dangerous.  Unless dogdog gets a Virtue or Pot9 plus a mage belt, I don't use him to tank in Tier3.<br />
<br />
Dogdog does just fine tanking in Tier1 zones like Plane of Innovation though, even if only shaman-buffed w/ Velium weapons. <br />
<br />
YMMV. :cool: <br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you're rotting it's because they hit too hard for you or pet to tank which means you don't want that hard hitting bastard smacking you around unslowed when it breaks root. (or you're just messing around a bit)<br />
<br />
Always slow. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vanuiil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i don't slow, because i got a ranger for snare while i &quot;solo&quot;..<br />
but i think i would slow without snare..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">ALWAYS SLOW<br />
not mater who is in group, what your doing...it is your job and i assure you it will save lives...<br />
<br />
when i solo and slow runs on the mob with it at 2% hp, the times i don't promply reslow i 99% of the time die from some freak root break...<br />
<br />
when i charm kill or kite with a 65 druid the mob i don't slow on always kills him and or me from a snare resist or a charm break...<br />
<br />
mobs that only slow slightly i always slow anyway...gives me that half second longer to get away from an otherwise leathal quad...when i forget to slow 90% of the time i die...<br />
<br />
you may not listen but you will end up learning the hard way =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ever since I got VP3, I never slow when root-rotting. Its USUALLY that reliable. Button refreshes, 3-5 seconds later the mob comes, re-VP, bounce him away, he never touches you. <br />
<br />
Duo-reverse kiting with a Necro, Druid or Wiz I always slow though. Just for those times when you get a bit too close, dont want him getting off 2 rounds on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">With VP3 I never slow either. Rather save the mana.<br />
Plus with mitigation in the upper levels of PoP it's not worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I always slow even when root-rotting. I usually do both malos and malosinia (bane bouncing is annoying), so why not? It doesn't cost THAT much mana and can save you in case root breaks or VP wears off when you're not ready. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">viscerator you don't think it is worth it?  even with the heavy midigation i think it is.<br />
in fire if i dont' slow and have a mob bash me, i get 3 rounded, sometimes to my death, before i can get out of range.  if i slow i they can only get 2 rounds off on a bash.<br />
2 rounds can be death self buffed, 3 rounds 99% of the time is a sure self buffed death.<br />
just makes sence to slow to me /shrug.  (even with full debuffs i see VP resist often enough to use slow...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Torlaan02</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I always slow when Soloing. Not that uber with the HPs so its nice when Root breaks, and it always does right in the middle of casting Curse. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I always slow as well.<br />
<br />
However, I rarely use dogdog if I am soloing with root/rot.  I figure if the mob hits so hard that I  resort to root/rot, then I don't want it hitting my dog either.  I generally solo in Tier 3 or EP if that makes any difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Slow! The mana used can be regained relativly fast, and if mob gets ahold of you hp's drop fast very well worth it. Unless of course you got a pocket snare guy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Nope, I don't even slow the reds in Fire. I just never get hit. If you give yourself enough room, you can handle root breaks, and re-root. VP is great and pretty reliable as well. Of course I always use malosina and ID, to lower resists.<br />
<br />
The only time it's bad is if you HAPPEN to be in close enough to Epic dot, because the cast range on that is the suck, otherwise you backup and re-root. Between VP and clicky pants, it's pretty easy to keep something perma-rooted.</div></div><hr />
