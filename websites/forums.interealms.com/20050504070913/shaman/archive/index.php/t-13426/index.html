<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Warning:  both must have the faction for it.  Tried this with a bot cleric that I had looting the medals and because that char didn't have the proper faction, the quest dude ate the medals.  Just have both hail him and if he speaks to you, you should be fine.<br />
<br />
I believe the faction needed is acquired thru killing giants, which my bot had not done.<br />
<br />
And be sure you have the 4 different ones.  Identify them and check to make sure their lore corresponds to the 4 different corner sections.</div></div><hr />
