<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night, while I am at my sweet little grind spot in HHK, I had a run in with a most unsavory individual.  We shall call him Ulster for this story. <br />
<br />
Ulster tells you &quot;Group me plz.&quot;<br />
<br />
You tell Ulster, Thank you, but no thank you. I'd rather solo.  I am getting about 1/2 light blue mobs, so grouping would really mess up xp.  But I'll share, which ones do you want (there is a total of 6 spawns, Isabella, 2 bards and 3 nobles).<br />
<br />
Ulster tells you &quot; I can't solo them&quot;<br />
<br />
You tell Ulster &quot;sorry bro&quot;<br />
<br />
Ulster tells you &quot;Noob @sshole (hmm why does not grouping make me a noob?)<br />
<br />
Then our little rogue friend starts to pickpocket every mob I fight.<br />
That is VERY annoying.  I mean, yes, this is an xp grind, but the nobles and Isabella do drop occasional gems and up to 6 plat and change.  That adds up and I am poor.  I asked him nicely to stop (really), and the only answer I get is, well you won't group (in his case really PL as he was MUCH lower level) me, I'll make sure you don't get any cash.<br />
<br />
At this point I just got fed up and gated.  Sorry for venting, but it REALLY PISSED me off.<br />

<br />
You did the right thing.  No sense in fighting with a moron such as you described.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, it's always nice to be able to deal out justice when some stupid arse tries something like this.<br />
<br />
Reminds me of when I was playing my necro.<br />
<br />
From lvl 49 to 53 I hunted seafuries/gornit in OOT.<br />
<br />
Had a wizard one day(believe he was lvl 40) send me a tell asking if I would camp the AC for him.  When I politely tell him no, he starts nuking my seafuries(was root dotting them) and breaking my roots.  Figured if he wanted them so bad, I'd let him have one.  Waited until my snare wore off on one and then FD'ed.<br />
<br />
Root broke and the clops made a bee line to the wizard.  Think he dropped him in a few hits.<br />
<br />
Can't imagine how much I laughed.  Felt good to be able to deal out some justice for once.<br />
<br />
Never heard from the wizard again. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I had a similar experience in HHK, I was killing the nobels and isabella, when this guy comes upto me and starts saying &quot;invite pls&quot; So I told him no thanks I'm doing fine the bards are free if you want them.<br />
<br />
So then he says &quot;no invite pls&quot; and then proceeds to spam me with group invites so many that my chat window was full and when I scrolled back all I could see was some jerk invites you to join a group. over and over again.<br />
<br />
So I ignored him and carried on pulling.  He just kept on spamming me till I started laughing at him. Then he got fed up and left me. I was going to petition him but I was more interested in hunting than explaining to a guide why the guy was suck a jerk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Again, the crystal clear reason pvp servers exist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I was levelling an alt at the giant fort in Frontier Mountains a while back.  We had been pulling to a camp that was a sharp right from the fort entrance.  After a couple hours, some other group sets up near us and their mage parks his pet too close to our pull path.  This was long before the changes in pet aggro, so our giants keep jumping this mage's pet.  They are yelling at us to quit training, my group is yelling at them to stop KS'ing, and I'm yelling, &quot;just move the damn pet back, Idiots.&quot;<br />
<br />
I watch their mage run into the fort, grab a giant, run to us and gate.  Mr. Brainiac somehow missed that we've been killing two and three of these every pull.  Wack, wack, wack - dead giant and we send him a tell thanking him for the pull.<br />
<br />
Brainiac comes back and has learned from his mistake.  He gets a sow and runs DEEP into the fort and grabs a pack of the highest level giants.  Just as he's coming out a giant spawns at the doorway.  New giant baps him on the head -- he's stunned.  The craigs make a tent stake out of him and go home.  I'm falling out of my chair laughing.</div></div><hr />

Twoflower, na Ulster was his name.  I did talk to a very nice guide about this though, so I am pretty sure his name won't be Ulster very much longer... ; )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">There was a story here a while back, about some shaman soloing in KC... he'd slow stuff, pull to the zone &amp; kiil it.  To make a long story short, he had a group of 3 move in and 'assist' him, KS'ing him.  After he tried getting them to back off, he petitioned...  then decided he'd pull a toughie (that he could kill), and when they jumped in to KS, he dispelled his debuffs (Turgurs) and watched it rip them up.  The guide, who was invis &amp; watching,  gave the KS'ers warnings, laughed with the shaman about it, and went on his way.<br />
<br />
Now, dispelling a rude kiter's Snare is something that'll get you a warning... but if you're clearing your own debuffs... ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">ahem.<br />
Been a long time since I've gotten to mete out some Tribunal-style justice.  But in this case I'd definitely make an example of him.  Luclin's idea was a good one.  Hard to petition that sort of thing.  Root and dispell slow works too.  Just wait till u see the NPC say &quot;Stop thief!&quot; or something like that.  That means the rogue has aggro now.  Then you put your diabolical plan into action.  <br />
<br />
Oh and I dunno if canceling snares gets you a warning or whatever.  I've never even had to talk to a GM about it haha!  Rude quadders don't get any breaks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I have done that Cush.  I was powerleveling my cousin's ranger at the zone in KC when some rogue decided to start backstabbing and ks'ing my mobs.   I got the usual &quot;only helping&quot; or &quot;just practising skill&quot; bs from him.  Well I got totally fed up.  I rooted a skelly and backed off ranger.  He tanked it just fine slowed.  I proceded to dispell my own slow. At that point the skelly ownzed him.  He zoned with just a sliver of red left (damnit to close to zone!).   Too bad he didn't die.</div></div><hr />
