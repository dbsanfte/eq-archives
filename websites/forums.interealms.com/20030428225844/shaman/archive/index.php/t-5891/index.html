<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off, let me explain the situation. I play on two different servers. My main is a level 48 shaman on Tholuxe. I have a shadowknight on luclin but I recently decided I'll start another shaman, but on that server. So I decided to be an ogre. If I manage to sell some stuff in bazaar I'd have maybe 11k ish.<br />
<br />
I already have the following items.<br />
<br />
55 hp 55 mana necklace. <br />
6 ac 65 hp rings.<br />
2 ac 35 hp 25 mana earrings.<br />
Spider Fur Belt.<br />
Goranga Idol.<br />
Silver Chitin Hand Wraps.<br />
<br />
And that's about it, I think.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm not sure if I could afford a REIF and Ikky BP. I've seen most ikky bp's go for like 8k. Same for REIF. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
So I can either get one or the other plus some other stuff. I plan to mostly solo, and would rather melee than root rot. So what should I get to help my ogre along?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">REIF doesn't proc until much higher, so i would suggest, if you could find it for a good rpice the Ikky bp. at low levels it amkes a large difference. i lend my ikky to my fiance's SK when i PL her and it makes life alot easier. you can get good damage/delay weapons that are cheap enough. i had a smoldering brand when i was a noob and i crushed the crap out of stuff well into my 30s. granted its not a spear but, atleast on Bristlebane, they go for like 200p. for a spear i had a slime coated harpoon, and those are also cheap cheap in bristlebane. i just got rid of it at level 49-ish and it served me well. a spine chill spear wouldn't be bad either. again, going off bb prices, you should see if you can pick up a clay guardian shield (250p), a sarnak battle shield (1k), or even a crusty shield (300p). anyways this is just my opinion, i don't always go the standard route for things =)</div></div><hr />
