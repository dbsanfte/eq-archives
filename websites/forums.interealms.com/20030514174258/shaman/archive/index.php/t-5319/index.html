<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I heard that now you can only raise melee skill from darkblues and up. It sounds a bit wrong but, i am unsure whether to try raising skill on some FV drovlargs, I dont know whether to kill light blues or go search for DB cons. Any help will be helpful</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tienen Crazywolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I always thought it was possible to skill up on any mob that gave xp. Back in the day, I remember getting skill increases off exp giving green mobs, long before the days of light blue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eepjr24</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am not sure how recent a change you are talking, but I got a skill up in piercing off a light blue mob in TM on... Thursday, September 5, 2002? May have been Friday, not totally sure, was in caves both nights.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">even before the sept.  5 or recent patches i went to DL and tried to work 2hb up on a light blue dog.  i had about 244 dex and 220 wisdom.  i beat the same dog for a good half hour...no skill raises.  i uses a granite face grinder, and i had enchanter speed on.  this was maybe 2 months ago.  i have never gotten a skill increase off a light blue, or at least not any time recent.  i remember when you could at one point, but i think they changed it and didn't tell us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There is no reason to even try, since skill increases from light blue (formerly high green) mobs have always been uncommon. Skill up on normal blues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>shatterstarix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hey i have a quick question, i duo with a monk and were getting into the low 50's now, unfortunately i neglected to work on much defense with the shaman since the monk is usually taking the damage. i am now finding that when the shaman gets aggro she takes ALOT of damage. <br />
i want to raise her defensive skill, is there anyway besides using trainingpoints or getting hammered on by dark blue mobs for 20 seconds then having to heal and med to do it all over again? any high lvl mobs out there that hit for stoopid low damage? <br />
ive also heard that if you stand in the path of some in game traps like in TOFS and SolA you get checks from them?? i tried this in Sol A breifly but i didnt get any raises out if it. anyways thanks for the help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually, you can't train defense/offense. To raise defense, you're just gonna have to take a beating. Try to find mobs that are blue/light blue and at the same time, don't hit too hard. If you were still in the 40s I'd suggest you head to Echo Caverns and solo on the side that leads to the deep. The underbulks hit fast, but not that hard (up to 70ish? -- lighter than IGs and HGs). I finished raising defense there. I just slowed the mob, cast the current cripple-like debuff (forget the name) and meleed them (hasted of course) with my trusty dog, occasionally nuking if I was taking much more damage than the mob or just healing myself -- whichever seemed more appropriate at the time. It was kinda slow, but I'm glad I got my defense up cuz as you noticed, mobs don't like to be slowed. Since you're in the 50s though, not sure what a good type of mob would be for skill-ups. :( If you're gonna continue duoing with the monk, slow early so you are guaranteed some aggro so you'll take a few hits. Eventually your defense will raise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lyanaeran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hello,<br />
I had the same problem, duo with monk and 40 defense level 34. So last night a cleric friend (51) help me, i pulled two dark blue mobs and he was healing me for a few hours. Little boring but I am 124 defense now.<br />
<br />
So just find a cleric friend to help you, get him a KEI and in a few hours it's done.</div></div><hr />
