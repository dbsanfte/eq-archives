<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I noticed in Dulak recently that I needed more regen for the MOBs I was fighting, so I changed to bear form for the heck of it.<br />
<br />
In bear form, by weapon seemed to proc a LOT less, maybe once or twice per fight if I was lucky.<br />
<br />
As an unscientific test, I dropped bear form and watched the battle spam: five or six procs per fight. After an hour or so, I tried bear form again: one or two procs per fight. Dropped bear form - the procs rolled in again.<br />
<br />
Is this a known issue or did I just have a bad run of luck in bear form? The mobs I was fighting were exactly the same, my fighting method exactly the same, all my buffs were up in both forms.<br />
<br />
My weapon is this: Club of the Ice Ocean (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4003)<br />
<br />
I would parse the output but I'm not sure of the methods to do it or a good program to use. If someone could point me in the right direction to get this information down, I'll post the results here (unless of course this is old news to everyone else).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">While, in theory, bear form shouldn't affect your proc rate, as there is no change in your dex by using bear form, I wouldn't be surprised at there being a bug that resulted in that. ;) Most likely though, everything is normal in that proc rates are fairly random. When I bothered to use an item that procced (blight hammer/barbarian spiritist's hammer) it always seemed like I procced more on green mobs than blues, but I doubt there was any correlation. To really test it though, you'd have to do lots of trials in and out of bear form. The random number generator is just so streaky. I'm not as expert at the game mechanics as many posters though, so can't really say anything for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well something to note is if your a Iksar or Troll Bear form attually robs you of your natural regen.  I was so annoyed when I discovered that at 29...  :mad: Have since not bothered to buy our other bear form... though I suppose it would make an alright alchemy Wis buff.  Which is truly sad when that is the only real use I can think up for it.</div></div><hr />
