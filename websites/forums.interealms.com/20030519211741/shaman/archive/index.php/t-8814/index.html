<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TixaUoff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i just hit 54 two nites ago in seb, since then i have grouped 2 in Velks both for about 5hrs or so in UD now that wasnt the sick xp but it was pretty good cause we had a nice group but any after that i had about 1 yellow of xp, now today, just today i went to PoN with my 59 bard friend and we hunted Trees, Bats, Spider, and those dog things  for about 2 hrs and i got 2 yellows, got about 1/4 a blue per kill  was very sweet xp, and no down time, just Malo/Dot Dot and sick pet(w/ pet taunt off) on mob while bard ran aound in cirlce and dot/snared the mob. mobs went down rather cast. made me laugh when shaman/bards were in the zone OOCn for group while we were just dual soloin everything for aewsome xp..anyway just thought id share seems like a great tactic if you happen to have a bard friend, im a barb shaman btw if that makes a diff im not sure if other races get a penalty for xp...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">How where you malo'n, and double dotting without taking aggro from the bard?<br />
<br />
Otherwise, thats pretty nice exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pretty nifty how a level 54 can cast a level 60 spell, 'eh? (Malo)<br />
<br />
/grins</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>TixaUoff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">lol you know what i mean, malosi w/e =P<br />
id wait till my friend got him down 1 bub of life before i cast dots, but as long as i stood i could cast maloSI  w/ no agro prob, he seemed to keep agro very well...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That's great, but it's not something everyone can easily reproduce (a 59 bard handy, ya know?).  I could get close to that exp in 54 in HHK, when 54 was a hell level.  Now I'm sure I can match it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My wife's 53 bard can solo the trees and spiders in PoN (at least in this one area along the zone wall) so you don't have to have a 59 bard to do the duo! :-)  At 53 solo it takes her about 10 minutes to kill one.  Not impressive but then she was just seeing what could be done pulling singly.  I think she got 3-6% aa for the kill.</div></div><hr />
