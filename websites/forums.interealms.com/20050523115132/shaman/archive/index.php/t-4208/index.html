<br />
Came so close to buying Everfrost port and noticed BAR / SHM.<br />
<br />
Would love to be able to use one and I know not one of the stones says VAH but am hoping it's similar to Ogre / Troll setup where their ports are the same.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

2 reasons: Vah Shir are agnostic. And if a Spiritstone for Vah Shir existed it would take you to Shar Vahl, but you know there is no porting available in Luclin beyond Nexus.</div></div><hr />

Think those are just like the wizard nexus port.  Meaning you have to be in luclin to cast them.  Which really isn't all that useful since you can get just about anywhere in luclin in 10 minutes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Catlovers, skip this 'guide how to wash a cat'... and don't try this at home ;-) <br />
<br />
1. Thoroughly clean the toilet. <br />
2. Add the required amount of shampoo to the toilet water and have both lids up. <br />
3. Find the cat and soothe him while you carry him towards the bathroom. <br />
4. In one smooth movement, put the cat in the toilet and close both lids. (You may need to stand on the lid so that he cannot escape.) The cat will self - agitate and make ample suds. Never mind the noises that come from your toilet, the cat is actually enjoying this. <br />
CAUTION: Do not get any part of your body too close to the edge, as his paws will be reaching out for anything they can find. <br />
5. Flush the toilet three or four times. This provides a &quot;Power Wash&quot; and &quot;Rinse&quot;, which I have found to be quite effective. <br />
6. Have someone open the door to the outside and ensure that there are no people between the toilet and the outside door. <br />
7. Stand behind the toilet as far as you can, and quickly lift both lids. <br />
8. The now clan cat will rocket out of the toilet, and run outside where he will dry himself. <br />
Sincerely, <br />
<br />

At least the people that did have a choice can bitch now, since it didn't matter when they picked a god and now they have problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't see why they couldn't put in a &quot;Spiritstone of the Ancestors&quot; or the like.  If it really bothers VI that people would be able to port to the moon, they could make it a moon-only gate. /shrug</div></div><hr />

And none of this says that we Vah Shir are faithless.  I would choose to believe that we revere the spirits of our ancestors, and draw power through those spirits and the spirits of the Wild that surround us.  It would seem like adherence to a religious dogma *smiles*, would be the realm of clerics and not spirit worshipping shamen.  :D<br />
