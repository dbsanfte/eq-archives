<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shakasa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With PoP I have been grouping quite a bit, but now want to start soloing again.<br />
<br />
I went to where I last soloed quite a bit in TD but found all was green or lblue at best.<br />
<br />
Where could a lvl 58 almost 59 shaman solo for two levels (61).  I have my JBB, Epic, Horse and most all of my spells up to 58.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No non pop places will give very good exp.  That said you can solo in me and up not sure if you need to be 60 to single pull the shrooms in fg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">not sure if you need to be 60 to single pull the shrooms in fg.Well I know you can't single 'em at 59, 'cause I tried 'em last night and aggroed two right in the front.  Ok, figured I'd slow 'em and root 'em and go to town.  Wonderful plan, 'cept these seemed to be immune to root.  Ok, I'll just have to nuke the $#!+ out of 'em.  Well, near constant stuns make that impossible.  I ended up having to zone 'em, running like a schoolgirl.  :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd imagine at that level you could solo PoJ and maybe even some other tier 1 planes easily. why not do that?</div></div><hr />
