<p><b> Eagle Eye: 17% increase to Archery Accuracy</b></p>

<p>Results of some archery tests I did.  Thanks to Harlan of Zebuxoruk for some help on the statistics.<br />
<br />
<U>Test: How much does Eagle Eye increase Archery Accuracy?</U><br />
<br />
The short and quick answer: <B>About 17%</B><br />
<br />
The long, detailed, too-much-time-and-effort answer:<br />
<br />
Okay, I'm a tad rusty in statistics, but I wanted to figure out what percent my accuracy was in archery with and without Eagle Eye.<br />
<br />
Accuracy is amount of arrows which made contact with the target divide by total amount fired.  I said 'made contact' as opposed to simply 'hit' because I include Dodges as hits: as some define a Dodge as a hit attempt with succeeds the Skill check, possibly the AC check, then fails on the Dodge check.<br />
<br />
I intended to fire 5 to 10 thousand arrows per test, at a thousand per session.  I just started collecting data for I figured out my sample size.  I did that after 4000, having a rough average which I used to find the standard deviation, and with a decided input of confidence (90%) and error (1%), I found my sample size needed to be 6142 arrows.<br />
<br />
I fired enough arrows to collect 6142 hits / misses / dodges with and without Eagle Eye.  I had to fire more than just that because sometimes arrows are lost, they simply disappear with no message--this is thought to be causes due to lag in the singals between your machine, and server; you fire and shot, then fire again before the server thinks you're ready.  You can see that with spells sometime, if you've ever gotten the 'Spell Recovery Time not yet met' message.<br />
<br />
My stats during the tests were:<br />
<br />
<B>Level 60<br />
ATK 1365<br />
Archery Skill 240<br />
Offense 252<br />
STR 192<br />
DEX 200</B> (Sometimes between 195 to 200, when I missed catching Stamina bottom out)<br />
<br />
I shot Ssolet Dnaas in Warslik's Woods, a blue con mob.<br />
<br />
Here are my results, and the formulas used:<br />
<br />
<PRE><TT>Session	Hits	Misses	Dodge	Lost	<br />
					Hit+D	%Hit<br />
No Eye<br />
1	616	342	42	20<br />
2	626	329	45	17<br />
3	591	361	48	22<br />
4	594	360	46	30<br />
5	599	339	62	42<br />
6	598	358	44	54<br />
7	75	54	13	1<br />
TOTAL	3699	2143	300	186	3999	65.11%<br />
<br />
Eagle Eye<br />
8	708	251	41	66<br />
9	701	250	49	52<br />
10	720	231	49	35<br />
11	708	232	60	80<br />
12	701	251	48	38<br />
13	726	223	51	96<br />
14	97	37	8	0<br />
TOTAL	4361	1475	306	367	4667	75.99%<br />
<br />
			NoEye	EglEye<br />
s = standard deviation	.4767	.4272<br />
x = value (0 or 1)<br />
i = which value<br />
x~ = mean		.6511	.7599<br />
n = sample size		6142	6142<br />
<br />
s^2 = Sum( ( x(i) - x~ )^2 ) / ( n - 1 )<br />
<br />
				NoEye	EglEye<br />
z = Normal Curve thingy		2.575	2.575<br />
100 * (1 - a ) % = confidence	.99	.99<br />
B = bound, or error		.0157	.0140<br />
<br />
z(a/2) * ( s / n^(1/2) ) = B<br />
<br />
<br />
No Eye  Accuracy is  65.11% +/- 1.57%<br />
		     63.54% to 66.68%<br />
Eagle Eye  Accuracy is  75.99% +/- 1.40%<br />
		        74.58% to 77.39%<br />
<br />
( 74.58% - 66.68% ) / 66.68% = 11.86% increase<br />
( 77.39% - 63.54% ) / 63.54% = 21.79% increase<br />
			       16.82% increase +/- 4.97%</TT></PRE>So the result is, <B>Eagle Eye increases Archery Accuracy by 16.82%, with a margin of error being 4.97% with 99% confidence</B><br />
<br />
<br />
Interesting observation: 240 skill + 40 is a 16.67% increase.  Perhaps 6E is Archery Skill, and all Archery Skill is is Accuracy?<br />

<p>Thank you.   I've been curious about the accuracy increases myself, but haven't had the time to hit Ssolet myself.  Keep getting distracted:P    Nice job.<br />

<p>Awesome post.  I've decided to use these regardless, long as I have a slot free and am using Archery, but having data that supports the use of this line is even better <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p><b><img src="images/icons/icon8.gif" alt="Angry" width="15" height="15" border="0"> Eagle Eye</b></p>

<p>Very nice statistical analysis there <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="">.<br />
<br />
The only thing that gets me (and its a general gripe i have with Archery in EQ), is that as a ranger, our entire class is centered around the bow. Yet, as your data clearly shows, a level 60 ranger can only hit his target 65% of the time without the spell.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, the target is a stationary one, and i doubt that anyone was in your way while you were firing them.<br />
<br />
I just dont see the logic that VI has to give the ranger, who is the epitomie of archery, a skill that only allows them to hit their mark 65 % of the time.<br />
<br />
Personally, as a 60 Ranger, i would think that even in the thick of battle, with dozens of people fighting the same moving target, I would be able to hit my mark at least 90% of the time, because "I" am a ranger. The MASTER OF THE BOW. Not only am I a ranger, but im a damn good one, because Im level 60. <br />
<br />
But alas, this is not the case. If only I had known. Now we know that the best archer in the game, can only hit his target (a stationary target no less..OMG ROFL), 65% of the time without aid of a spell.<br />
<br />
To me, VI gave us this spell because THEY KNOW archery is broken (where do all those missing arrows go to, that dont hit their target and we dont get a miss message).<br />
<br />
I hope one day they fix archery, and I will be a RANGER. Not a melted down wanna-be warrior who cant hit the broad side of a barn.<br />

<p>As a 60 Ranger, you're only going to hit mobs 65% of the time with your swords also.<br />
<br />
I don't buy an argument that we should hit more often with our bow.  It seems fine to me.<br />
<br />
The problem I have is with the bugs in archery, not the hit rate for normal shots.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>Nice work indeed.<br />
<br />
Comment 1:  It really isn't accurate to evaluate the min and max magnitude of the effect by using largest possible increase for one calculation and the smallest possible increase for another.  It is more correct to use the nominal values to calculate the size of the effect, and then evaluate the statistical combination of errors to assign an error value to the final calculated result.<br />
<br />
Comment 2: I don't believe you should determine the final effect as a percentage increase, but rather as an absolute increase.  I'm predicating that on the assumption that the bonus is coded as something like<br />
<br />
if (eagle eye active)<br />
    chance_to_hit = chance_to_hit + N<br />
<br />
rather than<br />
<br />
if (eagle eye active)<br />
    chance_to_hit = chance_to_hit * (1 + N), where 0 < N < 1.0<br />
<br />
If my assumption is correct, then it would be more correct to evaluate it as an absolute difference, rather than a percentage difference.  If you do it that way, then Eagle Eye = roughly a 10% increase in archery accuracy (75.99 - 65.11 = 10.88).<br />
<br />
Still, both my comments aside, you've done good work, much more reliable than "All I know is I had eagle eye up last night and WOW I WAS SHMAKKIN DEM MOBS!!  One arrow even did over OVER 200 DAMAGE!!!  THIS SPELL ROXORZ!!" or the converese "I had eagle eye up and I missed SIX TIMES IN A ROW one time!!  Verant suxorz!!  This spell us USELESS."<br />

<p>After the discussion at the Dallas Fan Faire where they admitted that the +% items do nothing (or less than intended) if you are already at (or approaching) the hard cap of the skill concerned I wonder if this is also affected.... if the mysterious 6E is archery accuracy and is capped at 252 like every other skill, then the +40 it is supposed to grant will in fact be capped at +12 (assuming 240 archery skill)... I guess the only way to test this would be to use 2 rangers, 1 with lower archery skill, both using eagle eye and assuming all other things being equal, and see if their actual hit rate was the same... tricky...<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>I wondered that too, but considering Myrrh was able to record these numbers with maxed archery skill (240) I think that's not the case.  And this isn't, strictly speaking, a +% item; it's a spell that increases skill, so we can hope it doesn't have that cap limit.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

Less that 100 STA at 60 though? <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="">  I'm guessing you had DEX gear on for the test?<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>
