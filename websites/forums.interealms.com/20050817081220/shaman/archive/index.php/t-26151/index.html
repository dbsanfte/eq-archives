<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>fisher2930</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a 65 shammy. due to navy obligations i have not been around for a little while and don't know all the good spots anymore. my wife started playing a ranger on another acount so we can play together when i am at home. i was wondering where a good spot for us to go to would be.<br />
<br />
I was told that Bloodfields and Nobels causeway would do good for us. was wondering if i could get any other ideas on getting good AA's for both of us or just ok AA's for me and great AA's for her. I can get a 61 ranger sometimes but not too much so just us too mainly.<br />
<br />
thank you for your help<br />
happy hunting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">With your wife at 53, you're mostly PLing her, not partnering so much.  Depending on gear, Farrel's Companion may very well outdamage her.  doggie doesn't cast Ensnare, of course, but that could be a plus since he doesn't draw agro so much :p<br />
<br />
Concentrate on levels for both of you, pushing for a 70/70 duo.  Levels much&gt; aa.  Anywhere you can kite will be great, or some older dungeons.  Shaman are often limited in dungeons by how devastating unsnared runners can be.  Your other half dovetails nicely there :)<br />
<br />
Bloodfields, PoV, Harbinger, Sebilis, Velks, Howling Stones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>notch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have a freind that is a 56 ranger. Not to much a difference between that and 53. here is where we go. I make sure ranger gets a virt.<br />
<br />
PoJ jail.  Great loot. Ranger should be able to tank fine once slowed. <br />
<br />
greigs end arround the gate area.(midle of zone) dark blue mobs to you.  Red to ranger. ranger can tank with one Q per  slowed mob. Occasoinal gems. 6-12 pp per kill in cash. I usually tank here because mobs can dispell or cast 4 types of dots (resist over 200ish and nothing seems to land) PLus with regen I dont even need to cast a heal and can use that for dots.<br />
<br />
Natimbi lost soul camp. they hit kinda hard for there lvl no real loot but the occasoinal BD and chance for named that drop a 20hp aug.<br />
<br />
Other then that.. I guess you could hit dulak but the aa is pretty weak even on stormwave.. great xp for the ranger though. and chance for gems.</div></div><hr />
