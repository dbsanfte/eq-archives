I play EQ for 1,5 month. My char is 31 Troll SK at Karana server. I`d like to start Troll Shaman and here is my problem. I`ll not play my SK anymore so i want to /auction my stuff. What should i sell and buy for my new char coz i`m totally Shm noob.<br />
<br />
This is what i have at 31.<br />
<br />
-2x Orc Earing<br />
-2x 6/65 ring<br />
- Skull-Sharped Barbatue( this AC 10 35hp  :)  )<br />
- Orc neckle<br />
- Crusty: bp, 2x bracer, boots, legs, vambracers, arms<br />
- Spider Fur Belt<br />
- MoSS + Clay Guardian Shield or Blade of Xagloz<br />
<br />
Rest of my eq sux:(  Thx in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My suggestion would be to go to an equipment site, pull up what you have and see if it can be used bya  shaman.<br />
<br />
Normally I won't answer equipment posts b/c I think they are ghey. Little bit of homework and you would not need to ask this.<br />
<br />
However... /sigh<br />
<br />
Keep 6/65hp rings<br />
Spider fur belt<br />
Clay guardian shield<br />
Blade of X for HS key quest unless you need it for cash now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Keep the 2 6ac 65hps rings, clay shield and spider fur belt.<br />
<br />
The rest of it, sell and see if you can get yourself a full set of rygorr or totemic.  You'll especially want the totemic helm if nothing else.<br />
<br />
Pick up a slime coated harpoon or a spine chill spear and possibly a 2hb weapon if you wanna keep those maxed.  Or you could go with 1hb.  It's really up to you.<br />
<br />
Don't worry about your wis being low right now.  You'll want to get as many ac/hps items you can in the early levels.  Later on, you can begin to raise your wis a bit.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hey  Targar, you're thinking of the Xalgoz Fang.  That is for the HS key, not the Blade of Xalgoz.  The Blade is just a fairly nice 2hs at a decent price.  :)  Otherwise, I agree with the assesment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Carnal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thx for help. Sorry, maybe this q is gay but i spend max 3h/day in EQ - dont like waisting time on searching www.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Spelling gay as ghey is more gay than being gay itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Using gay in this context is just queer.</div></div><hr />
