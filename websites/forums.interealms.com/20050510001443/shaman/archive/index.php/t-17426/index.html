<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Keldrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all...<br />
<br />
I'm an EQ returnee after a bit over a year's absence.  I played a ranger up to 54 on TM (named Shaedoe) up till SoL came out.  Which is kinda how I found this place.  I have very fond memories of the Ranger's Glade community and I'm hoping to find something similar here.<br />
<br />
While gone, I maxed a ranger on DAOC, piddle a bit on AO, and then spent a couple months trying to give SWG a fair chance.  &lt;sigh&gt;  Guess I don't need to say much more about that piece of... <br />
<br />
Anywhoo... a bunch of my SWG guild got totally fed up with it... so we've started up on the newbie server Stromm.  Interesting place so far.  And boy... a lot has changed.<br />
<br />
Really nice to be somewhere where there is actually content again. ;)<br />
<br />
I've gotten some great tips from you guys on getting started with my Barb shammie (Keldrak) and I'm really loving it.  Thanks and I'll be seeing you around the forums here. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vesik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd love to see the SWG site boast their numbers now - 2nd largest MMORPG ever in its 2nd month.  Wow, I thought, this game is rockin - can't wait for my TKA to be fixed and some new music for my musician tree.  2 months later I've quit, my friends have quit, my in game friends I made quit - just about everyone I knew period quit, and a lot of people I didn't ;).  &quot;2nd to last MMORPG ever right ahead of AC2&quot; is probably what they could say now eh? :(<br />
<br />
Some went back to EQ, some back to DAoC, some back to AO, some waiting for FFXI.  Anyway, welcome to the boards - I'm a semi-noob here myself, 'lil over a months time now I believe.<br />
<br />
It's a shame about SWG - I'll try it again in a year, and if its still ass then I'll look at my pretty collectors edition art book and burn the rest :p.</div></div><hr />
