<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Drops in Grieg's End.  Off Alchemist Valrona.  So far I have had NO luck in finding where she spawns at and pulling her to zone for easy slaughter.   You will need a group to take her out, but all named in Grieg stay where you leave them (either by death, zoning or gating)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">read a Harry Potte book (british version) :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">She spawns rather deep in, if I remember right it was just about exactly halfway through the zone.<br />
<br />
Was pretty damn funny, a group of us went there, fought our asses off.  Killed her, got the shaman &quot;phat lewt&quot;<br />
<br />
We never went back, that zone is a waste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've seen her very near the zone in also. Didnt drop the stone :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There are many threads on this topic.  :)<br />
<br />
Alchemist Varona doesn't drop it every time.  She spawns somewhat randomly, and I have found her very close to the zone line (DSP).  Bring a group, bring a tracker, and wander around.  Spawn time seemed like ~26 minutes, so plan a couple hours to get a few shots at her.  If she's not up, track to things that have names, whack em, and wander some more.  Watch out for Praetorian Myral, he's mean, but most of the other nameds are pretty wimpy if you are mid-50+.<br />
<br />
I've killed that beotch 5 times now, still no friggin stone.  If I thought about it more, I'd probably be bitter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">this zone is NOT a waste, its just a pain in the tail ;)<br />
<br />
some smith named dropped 2 ytrium ore, something else dropped a 15% instill doubt mask, and I got my philosopher stone on my only sighting of the alchemist..   and that praetorian is rough if you cant figure out how to work him over, especially when he has the hammer that procs DA(if he procs on you, he will be perma DA since NPC can still melee while invuln heh)   but he drops some phat lewt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually a quite interesting zone. Me (60 shaman) and a level 60 bard actually managed to run around in there for a quite a bit picking off some of the named mobs. Kept the aggro on myself and kept torpor up during the fight and the bard didn't have to worry with torpor slow effects. Slow is a requirement.  All was pretty cool until my inviso wore off at a most inopportune moment. :) <br />
<br />
Somewhat a high risk endeavor and odds are you will take some deaths, but there is always next time. ;) nice change of pace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">*** do you do about that dude with the DA hammer? Ran into him not too long ago, he's a mean bastid with that thing. I guess you cant let him swing the hammer so he wont proc eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">yeah, basically... if he gets a chance to swing at you, you have to zone out and reset agro and try again<br />
<br />
<br />
edit:  he is the guy that drops the Wand of Casual Blessings also, the right click RGC 1hb with better stats than cleric epic..   my guild has been working to get all our clerics this item since we havent found out which mobs drop RGC now..   lol<br />
<br />
anyone have a confirmed drop of RGC recently?  dont think Rhag1 drops it anymore</div></div><hr />
