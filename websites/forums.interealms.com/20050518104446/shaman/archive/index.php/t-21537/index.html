They're just mainly cut-and-pasted from the PoP spells, but at least you can get an idea of what's new. Of note is that the Canni spell is based from the Ancient GoD one, and the slow seems to be a disease slow - unlike the beastlord's new slow.<br />

Those spells are most likely placeholders for new spells to come.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not to mention there are no 66 - 70 spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">they are place holders.<br />
<br />
<br />
basicly we are getting a new puppy, new stat spells, upgraded nukes and canni and looks like a avatar and Heal over time. Also a regen direct heal, root , slow and AC. So basicly a standard progression of spells, but again, these are fromt he place holders up there. Usualy they copy and paste older spells as place holders and upgrade the info. So you can tell what kind of spell we will probably get, but wont know till release exact numbers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Step 1: Create spells for shaman. Done.<br />
SQL@SoE Development&gt; <br />
insert into spells<br />
select * from spells where class &amp; SHM and level &gt;60 and level &lt; 65;<br />
<br />
update spells set spellname='Shm-'||type||'-'target where class &amp; SHM and spellid &gt; 5000;<br />
<br />
update spells set level = null where class &amp; SHM and spellid &gt; 5000;<br />
<br />
Step 2: Tune spells. Not done for shaman (is done for other classes folks).<br />
Foreach effect except slow multiply the effect by 10%.<br />
Foreach effect with a level restriction.  Adjust the level restriction + 5, except charm which is +3.<br />
<br />
Step 3: Add spells to NPCs to hard to get to. Not done.<br />
Step 4: Make spells more common. Not done.<br />
Step 5: Change certain spells because they are useless. Not done.<br />
NOTE: this roadmap was used for Kunark, PoP, and Gates.<br />
<br />
I guarentee that ANY game which has such a transparent forumla for advancement will FAIL.<br />
<br />
Will be quiet now and wait for develope reply of: &quot;This is on test folks, give me a break.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I dont have any psychic powers, but my guess is they are going to give 10-20% upgrades to every spell shaman have now, and beastlords will edge even closer to shaman for slowing (and probably will get some sort of resist debuff).  <br />
<br />
I think it's hilarious they seem to be planning on giving more useless stat buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'll be able to add 500+ to strength now!  <br />
<br />
To be honest, unless they plan on giving us something like an 80-85% slow, increasing the slowing powers of the other slowers makes us even more useless....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">haha, shamans are getting more stat buffs.<br />
<br />
be prepared for another line of completely worthless spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Eh, at this point who knows what they'll do.  We may have to mass petition to get a dex and Str buff replaced just like we did in PoP, or we might see them change spells around completely like with Daluda.   Who konws, maybe the entry for Slow will mitigate mitigation, the AGI will include a dodge skill modifier.  Or maybe the AGI will do a while 4 more than the prior one and cost 12 times the mana.<br />
<br />
  More will come eventually, for now we know where to look.  Just be amazed that they are allowing us to find them so easily for once.<br />
<br />
  There used to be a time when the Devs had enough time on their hands to make false spell entries, and they would cover up portions of the true ones so we didn't know what was actually happening from Lucy (like moving the class using entry down a couple lines so it would be missed in a normally numeric field.<br />
<br />
  Some relics of those times are:  UltraDeathSpell (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1102&amp;source=Test), UltraDeathSpell2 (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1103&amp;source=Test), UltraDeathSpell3 (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1104&amp;source=Test)<br />
<br />
  Sorta wish they still did things like this on a regular basis, but if they did then PoM1.0 would not only still exist, but would have been patched more often when it used to exist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Unless our new stat buffs last for 3-4 hrs, I dont want any more and wont waste a page in my book for them. Crap, crap and more crap.<br />
EDIT: Also, I am tired of jumping through hoops, kissing ass and ramming my nose to the grindstone to get all my spells...how about some way to grant the spells to everyone and not let them be rare as heck? 15k for a spell is just wrong, NO ONE should have to spend that much plat, time or whatever to get something that in essence makes their class what it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i dont agree with the last part of the post helfdane.<br />
<br />
Rarity of items/spells is a double edged swrd.<br />
<br />
Yes its annoying to not be able to afford stuffs, but secondly rarity creats a market, and thus an ecconomy.......which soe can exploit *cough<br />
<br />
EQ having a virtual econmy was always one of the aims of the developers.<br />
<br />
its no drop spells in expansion that really annoy me; typical exploit trick to try and get folk to buy an expansion.<br />
<br />
Most of the time, high spels prices is down to trader greed......so realy ur annoyed by capitalism and human exploitation, and i agree that suks; but then i am a communist so its esy for me to say that!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Heh, and if they just upgrade all of the above, add some new names, and dump out another expansion I really won't need to play anymore. :p<br />
<br />
Just plain out not interested in new stat buffs, FocusX, AvatarX, RootX, DoTX, DDX, etc, etc, etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just plain out not interested in new stat buffs, FocusX, AvatarX, RootX, DoTX, DDX, etc, etc, etc...<br />
<br />
<br />
No offense, but you may need to quit your shaman and move to a new toon. Thats not meant in a bad way, just in a logical way.  Upgrade to Focus and Avatar and Root and DoT's and DD's is our natural spell progression line, thats like saying your sick of your mage cause your getting a new pet at the next level. <br />
<br />
<br />
I know you want new things, but without blurring the class lines you cant really go too crazy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Someone wanna tell me WHY they're giving us an AC buff? For those times when there's no Cleric / Paladin in PoK, anywhere?<br />
<br />
And not one, but two Agility buffs? Please tell me where I sign for all this leetness.<br />
<br />
And oh look... A disease debuff.<br />
<br />
Maaan, these things better be vendor bought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Nah, it isn't time to move to a new toon, it is time for SOE to think a bit and actually CREATE some spells.  <br />
<br />
Stat buffs are dead so why not move some characteristics into shaman spells that enhance strikethrough, combat effects, and maybe even bestow things like flurry or enrage?  Giving us a DoT shielding buff or a longer lasting +attk buff would be interesting as well.  Of course we will get some kind of +hp and DoT spells, but SOE does NOT have to just crap out a new list of cookie-cutter spells like they are prone to do because it is EASY.<br />
<br />
It might be time for the devs to actually develop something! :p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">i wish they would correct our pets level 34,39,44,49, then should be 54 59 64, and next 69 we are 1 pet lower than we should be which is why it sucks so much compare to when we had it at 49.<br />
<br />
just one of my many complaints and annoyances on how shaman been treated.</div></div><hr />
