I bit the bullet and called VI tech... and they actually Fixed something!<br />
<br />
I guess an install messed with DX 8 but not all the changes took place until i crashed cause i never restarted.... so VI's standard answer (Reinstall drivers) actually worked!  Dont ask me i just work here...<br />

FYI, thanks to whomever looted me up and gated me out, im assuming it was you Rizz or Zelf, but if it wasnt... thanks A_Namless_Keeper_01<br />
