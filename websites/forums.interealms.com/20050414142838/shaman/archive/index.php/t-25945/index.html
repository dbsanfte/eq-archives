Looks like it's coded to proc every 6 seconds or once/tick. This results in a potential DPS of 91.6 + whatever the player's crit modifier through AAs is.<br />
<br />
I'd love to see Retron parse the puppy for 5 minutes just to have a straight comparison.</div></div><hr />

well say a 5 minute fight so 300 seconds <br />

not 405 DD, but a 550 DD that is near unresistable....if the proc rate is the same (which logically it'd have to be, to be an upgrade but lets not get started on SOE logic.) I could really put out some DPS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you do the math, you are looking at 91.6 DPS(10 procs/minutes being the assumption based on this parse). The crit rate on this parse is certainly above average and should be closer to 20%. <br />
<br />
So 91.6*1.2 = 110 DPS.</div></div><hr />

How would 5 mins with a higher mana cost make the damage go up at all.  You can still keep it on the same number of people, just takes some of the PITA out of having to cast every 1 minute.<br />

Without paying an extreme amount of attention to it, I watched him proc once four times in about 2 seconds.  <br />
<br />
I think that I might actually parse it out when I get a chance sometime and place it on most pets.  I know that it won't stack with the bst snare proc, but not sure what else it won't stack with offhand (i know how to look it up yes).</div></div><hr />

Do casual players have an 11k mana pool?<br />
I myself wander between casual play and semi raiding, and only just recently broke 7k mana pool. <br />

Again, wide seperation between the average folks and the top end people.  Mana IS an issue for the vast majority of players, even shamans.  Somewhat less useful at level 61 (leopard) or even 69 (panther) than for a top geared, high aa'd level 70.  Of course, the high end players dont have quite the dps issue non-ubers do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">And most importantly, simply multiplying both mana cost and duration by the same factor means that you can keep the spell up on precisely the same number of people, so nothing changes as far as overall DPS is concerned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you pass some of that crazy **** you are smoking around?<br />
<br />
What does base mana have to do with anything when you are dealing with a buff that needs to be renewed every 5 minutes. Mana pool is irrelevant.<br />
I had typed out all the little &quot;errors&quot; you had in there regarding mana pres and stuff, but everything, that needs to be said, has been said by m(Ineedanewboardname).<br />
<br />
Your DPS doesn't increase if the mana cost is upped proportionally. All a longer duration would do, if we falsely assumed mana was a non issue *at all*, is to make it possible for less Shamans to contribute the DPS this buff can add to a raid(and this is only valid for raids). <br />
So while a longer duration and infinite mana would hypothetically allow 1 Shaman to buff 30 &quot;proc'ers&quot;, you probably needed 3 for it currently, but it's not like the other 2 could buff 60 more people and raise the DPS even more, 'cause the raid is all buffed *gasp*.<br />
<br />
Edit: Sometimes I feel the need to be overly precise so that everyone gets a point, but VM and mblahblah have been saying the same thing in case you wondered!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Duration of the spell has nothing directly to do with the dps it will do. The dps is dependant on how much damage the proc does and how frequently it procs. Nothing else.<br />
<br />
Now duration might indirectly effect things if the spell lasted longer and didn't cost more it would be much easier to keep it up on more people. You'd also be less likely to have holes where it wore off and hadn't been refreshed yet. If they up the duration and mana cost by equal amounts it would make the spell less of a hastle to use but wouldn't really change the dps at all.<br />
<br />
I don't have the spell yet but I think people are really looking at it the wrong way. This isn't a buff your going to keep up on the entire group or raid all the time. This is more like a disc or aa that you use on someone else for a dps boost or an indirect dot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Yes, that's what I'll be telling the melee, it's just like a disc or AA for a dps boost, you don't get it ALL THE TIME. I'm sure that will go over GREAT!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">So far I personaly am likeing this buff . It really seems to be better DPS than say nuking when im in a melee heavy group .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Mana pool is an issue when you want to do a lot of damage in one encounter.  When the goal is to have as many people as possible buffed for one 5min period, then mana pool most certainly matters.<br />
<br />
btw, I'd say that high end shaman have a much bigger dps problem than non-raiders, since there's a far bigger discrepancy between Trident of the Pyrilen and Nightshade, Blade of Entropy than there is between Muram's Anger and Discordant Energy.  No matter what the gear, all shaman use the same spells to deal damage.</div></div><hr />

[Sun Feb 27 16:54:59 2005] Your pet's Spirit of the Leopard spell has worn off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">It's a great spell, and imo fixes the inability for us to do any reasonable melee damage ourselves or our pet.  But honestly... I don't see any need for changes that some think will happen, because I've had this spell 3 days and I'm already sick of casting it.  Even with max duration focus I have to recast it every 1 min 42 seconds.  I'm so sick of trying to keep it going on more than one person that I stopped bothering.  Unless I'm soloing I have only used it for big fights lately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Krakpaw Grunchybear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Guys...STOP IT!!!~ Havent you learnt anything from past expansions when things seem too good to be true? (someone delete this thread and make a post saying this spell sucks pls.)<br />
<br />
repeat after me: This spell sucks.<br />
<br />
Oh, and increase the duration of the spell plz  ;)</div></div><hr />

Using this during trash plows is just too much of a hassle. I used it on Royals in RS tonight, hit all the pets, the MT, and a couple melee, and the boss dropped like a rock. only started casting it when king/queen became targetable though. too busy the rest of the script.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">yeah, I really only suggest using it during real named fights, or on some random pets.  I just like to see pets proc it a ****load so I give it to them sometimes while trash clearing.  It's too much of a hassle to do it while trash clearing though.  However, use it on pets/melee dps during a named fight and see how much fun you have :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Did a parse on a fully buffed Child of Water (mage rogue pet).  Recorded 118 procs in 5:25.  Thats about ~150ish DPS.<br />
<br />
Last night, we raided King and Queen in RS.  King fight normally runs about 7 minutes w/ 50ish person raid.  With 4 shaman casting Leopard on 15ish melee (no SKs), 4 mage pets, a few necro pets, a few shaman dogs, and pet swarms, King died in about 4:30.<br />
<br />
Shaman.  The new king of raid burst DPS???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Supergreat rogues top out around 1200 dps, burst, and don't need 15 other melee to back them up to do it :)<br />
<br />
We're &quot;just&quot; 5x better than we were :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Just out of curiosity, whats your opinion on pets -vs- melee as top priority?  Pets seems to proc a lot more, but of course a pc gives you a change to crit depending on aa's.  Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Pets never fall off of mobs that are being pushed around.  They never have &quot;You cannot see your target&quot; or &quot;get closer, moron&quot; issues.  I far prefer buffing pets with this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Definitely pref pets unless there's an ae they are unlikely to survive. They proc rate seems to more than make up lack of crits they have. Additionally if the mob isn't pinned someplace  they typically do a much better job of following the mob around.</div></div><hr />
