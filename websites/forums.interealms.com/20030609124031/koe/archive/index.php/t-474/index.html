<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Spinetapper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wanting to know if anyone could spare a little time sometime for some assistance with my epic mob in Steamfont... shes a lvl 50 mob and quads for 200's so I would only need 2-3 groups depending on what classes/lvls will be willing to help. Best way I've heard to kill her is have many pet classes and a few melee and fear kite her kill dead, she doesnt summon and wont attack pets. I'm sure KoE has done this mob before and may have a better stratagy on killing Renux. I truely hope you can find time for this, and as always, feel free to ask me for ANY help what-so-ever, epic, cr, etc..... Be safe all!<br />
<br />
PS Thanks for the killer Weapon tonight Rizz :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cshae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'll help, Spinetapper, let's see who else will volunteer and we can organise a day and time for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its all a matter of timing :)  I'd like to help (I think I've been on a couple of these now) but when did you want to do this? Really this is a short duration deal and would fit nice with our &quot;roving epic nights&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spinetapper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Anytime would be good for me...last night is prolly best, anytime we can get enough people to do it would be fine...it would only take about 10-15 min to complete after everyone has arrived (including buff time). Thanks again</div></div><hr />
