<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fastosus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, i know that this item drops in the caves in dulak, but is there a certain mob or lacation in these caves that drops it. If anyone knows where to find this please put the location, mob name and any other information that you know of. I have a group of people whilling to help me out and go there go &quot;mini raid&quot; for it. Any help is greatly appreciated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fenora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Drops off An Enraged Soulstealer, his PH is usually a servant of hate. He popped for me in the 2nd dead-end cave (past the bridge). Took about 5 hours to get him to show up. I've also heard that he will pop inbetween the stairs and the bridge also, haven't verified this myself tho. <br />
<br />
He's a rare spawn so take some munchies and a good book with ya, hehe.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fastosus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">TY very much for the info. I have spring break coming up next week and i think that will be the first order of business for me. <br />
<br />
Thank you again for you help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>agrad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have nailed this guy 3 times so far, all in the same place, between the bridge and the stairs down that dead end room.  I generally invis up to the turn in the bridge, root/dot the mob there, then buff up quick and get a pet rdy.  Using  ER3 bracer I can always pull him single between the 2 mobs at the end of that fork on the bridge.  Be careful fighting him to close to those 2 also, because if one of them is an archon, they will heal him if they are close enough.<br />
<br />
The Enraged is a necro mob and likes to cast a lot, and depending on how lucky you are with resists, it can be a very easy fight at 58+ or annoyingly difficult.<br />
<br />
I've parked a ranger in dulak specifically to track this guy, as he is typically one of the highest cons in the zone, so tracksort-consider generally shows him at the top of the list when he is up.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you get him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">what are his rare/common drops plz?<br />
<br />
ie will he pop with the mace or ......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>agrad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">He has always been wielding it when I have dropped him. Other loot has always been the normal stuff that drops of these guys, luggald flesh/luggald daggers/sharpened claws (stackable), etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Mace is his common, a decent wiz/mage cloak is his rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Can a 55 shammy solo this guy? I have pretty decent gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">how bout a 51 shaman?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think 55 would really be pushing it to be honest unless you got lucky and got turgur to land first cast and you have to have nice resists and either epic or jbb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>huth2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have killed this guy 3 times now @ 52, i have died 3 times but only due to sloppiness and impatients on my part getting adds.<br />
<br />
Just make sure you have killed the wanderer and he will be a while coming back (20min spawn time) buff up resists as he likes to cast.<br />
<br />
Give dogdog 2 weps so he dual wields or it's gonna be a longer fight. Pull with maloisi, send in dogdog, slow, ebolt and heal as required. If you have enuff mana then nuke..i tend to finish this fight with around 15% mana and 70-80% HP....<br />
<br />
I always have c3 up and try and get aego or po9 but the last 2 times i have only had c3 and hos/sta so 2k HP<br />
<br />
Go to it guys, it can be done...55! pah you doubt our class :D<br />
<br />
*edit* i dont have my epic or a JBB either just some nice gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I was level 57 the first time I fought him and my pet died within 30 seconds 'cause he resisted 3 or 4 malosi/turgurs.  Had a druid friend with me so we still killed him easily, but if I was solo I think it may have been quite tough to finish him.</div></div><hr />
