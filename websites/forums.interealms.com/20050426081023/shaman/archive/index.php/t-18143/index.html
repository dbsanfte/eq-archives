<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Selea RangersTwink</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm looking for a good place to duo with my shaman. She just got into 51, and the mobs are starting to eat my ranger up a bit. <br />
<br />
Where would y'all recommend?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SylentsofXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did this with my 65 rogue. so i may be of some help to ya<br />
<br />
<br />
from 47-53 i did the hole. first the zone in, then working my way to the pit.  Mobs dont hit hard and they die fast. Once you get to the pit dont bother slowing the massive thingies, cause they mitigate. i just debuffed and dot'd them.<br />
<br />
once i got to 53 i hit PoJ ZO's.  these guys dont hit hard either, so it was easy on my sham to tank them while i melee'd the crap outta them.<br />
<br />
its boring exp mind you. but its still better then lfg. around 55 it gets painfully slow, taking me 5 hours to do 2 yellow.<br />
<br />
hope this helps ya a bit.</div></div><hr />
