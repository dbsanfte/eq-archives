<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Possem of Innoruuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all I have been helping a friend with his epic and the last page we need is the student log.  I have seen/heard the spectrial Curier drops this log and we have camped him and killed him a number of times.  Each time we kill him he drops &quot;an illegible scroll&quot; and no log.  Is the log rare?  Has this been changed?  Or am i just misinformed?  <br />
<br />
Thanks for the Help<br />

<br />
Alas, you are 60 so you're in for a very boring camp.....<br />
BUT,<br />
This is what I tell young shammies .... Get over to CoM and solo between 49-55 .... Work your way to the Stable camp and live there ... You'll get all of your pages over time... great XP.... and maybe a few RARE weaps.... Sometimes you'll even get a chance to loot Ghiosk books...  Partnering with another shammy or melee is also great .. helps the time fly by... Only thing that sucks is the nearest bank :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Possem of Innoruuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So I take it they do not drop everytime and its a random drop thing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yep .. random drop for sure</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lumppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Took me about 6 couriers to finally get the students log. Did this about 10 days ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>fudorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Random isn't an appropriate term for the drop rate.  I spent literally 3 days RT in CoM, both with guildies and solo, killing the courier, only to get the Iksar SK scroll.  I would say on total, took out a total of 50-60 couriers to get it to drop.<br />
<br />
By the same token, have seen it drop 3-4 times in a row since.  When the need is there, the item doesn't seem to be... when you no longer need it, it shows up constantly.</div></div><hr />

5 encounters over 3 days and nothing but ilegible scroll drops. :(<br />
Many many hours in the stables.<br />
<br />
Tonight, with another shaman friend, my RL spouse (enchanter) and a rogue, we camped the stables for several hours back-back.<br />
<br />
First courier popped within 5 minutes and dropped the log.<br />
I was amazed but happy.  An hour or so later another popped and also dropped the log.  Shaman friend (in 40's) looted this one.<br />
<br />
They stay for exp while I do the turn-ins.  Pages combine and turn in fine, but pond sentinel eats the Ghiosk books. :(  DOH!<br />
<br />
While waiting for petition to come through, I head back.  Thinking it possibly to be a faction issue, we remain at the camp for about another SIX hours killing everything in the stables and nearby as fast as they spawned practically.  No other couriers in that entire time, or he popped at the entrance and we didn't catch it before someone nailed it while we were fighting other stable spawns.  <br />
<br />
So yes, the courier is random, and yes, and the student log drop is also random.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

PS: Petition verified my faction was found wanting. :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>dfarls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Guess I was Lucky, camped at the stables for an hour before he popped and he dropped it the first time. I'm off to the hole as soon as I organize the group!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">aye, i got stables the other day and through clearing them on my first spawn i got the courier twice...dropped the log both times, so me and one other lucky shm in the zone got this out of the way</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>guice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">the illegial scrolls are for the monk Whistling Fists quest.<br />
<br />
When I ran the WF quest, I believe I saw the log once out of about 7-8 curiours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Farbzilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Stables are the place to be.  I camped it for 2 days before i got mine (great xp in the process).  And as fate would have it the courier continued to spawn and drop book after book for the next few hours :)<br />
<br />
Keep that area clear and you'll get it before TOO long</div></div><hr />
