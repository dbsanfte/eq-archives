<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DankShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi guys, its time i got started on my new computer, i want to build something about as nice as i can get it on a $1000 max budget, But since my only option out here where i live is 56k, is there a maximum that my computer will be able to process everquest and other online games due to the slow connection?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shambler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are 2 things refered to as &quot;lag&quot; in eq, although only one is technicaly correct. What most people experience is &quot;graphics lag&quot;. This is caused by your computer not being powerfull enough to render all the information. Real lag is caused by the time it takes to get all the packets.<br />
<br />
The processing power of your computer is mostly needed to do all the client side work like rendering 100 ogers in the Bazaar scratching there asses or 150 Kunark trees swishing in the wind.<br />
<br />
So no, the 56k connection shouldn't hinder the processing power of your computer.<br />
<br />
Are there parts you wont need to buy, such as monitor, mouse keyboard etc? You can build a very nice machine on that budget if you don't need a new monitor :)</div></div><hr />
