<br />
Rumors from the Safehouse message boards are that as part of next weeks changes, all hell levels (with the exception of 54 and 59) will be removed from the game.<br />
Since this is just rumor at the moment we can't provide any further details on how Sony may address their previous reasons for not being able to fix hell levels (i.e. it would cause all players who had finished those levels already to gain massive experience).<br />
<br />
Wonderful news if this goes through for new players and old players wishing to make alts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There's more.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is more stuff which is supposed to be amongst the possible changes (spell changes were already mentioned such as more early percent resses) Some are now live or going live on test. <br />
As always the stuff on test might not make it to live but WOW. <br />
<br />
&quot;BUFF HEAVEN <br />
<br />
A boon for buffers on the Test Server! <br />
A new command has been added called /rtarget. This command automatically targets the last person who sent you a tell. This makes it much easier to buff during raids. It also has good value for people needing support heals during fights. <br />
<br />
Of other note: a new chat filter has been added for critical hits. <br />
<br />
These changes should hopefully go live next week. <br />

WHAT CORPSE? <br />
<br />
More from the Test Server! <br />
Perhaps one of the more exciting changes made to the game in the last 48 hours on Test is for players Level 10 or below. <br />
<br />
According to players who have been enjoying life as a Gnome Paladin or Halfling Ranger, if you die while level 10 or below you now respawn at your bind point with all your gear. <br />
<br />
That's right, no more corpses for players under Level 10! This should significantly help in reducing downtime or lost items due to corpse decay. Note: This is only on the Test Server currently. <br />

THE SHORTIES GO HYBRID <br />
<br />
More news from the Test Server. <br />
It appears that Gnomes will soon have the ability to play both Shadow Knight and Paladin classes. <br />
<br />
Halflings also have the ability to now be Rangers and Paladins. <br />
<br />
This change may not go live to the servers, but if it does will add more variety to the hybrid race choices. <br />

CHAT CHANNELS HERE <br />
<br />
Chat channels have now been added to the test server. This long awaited ability is excellent for improving group communication on raids without spamming zones or guild chat. <br />
<br />
These channels can be password protected when creating the channel. They are used with the following commands (test only currently): <br />
<br />
/join : (e.g: /join casters:seekrit) <br />
/chat (text) <br />
/leave <br />
This is most likely part of the new updates being released to EverQuest over the next week. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Copied from The Concert Hall, this is a compilation of known and rumored changes that could go live NEXT WEEK!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jlove Fizzboom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Joo bastiches bedda not turn of Criticals so soon after I got Fury 3!!<br />
<br />
I can imagine the spam on large encounters with 20 melee all going offensive tho, especially with more and more getting their Fury.<br />
<br />
No if only we could turn off those &quot;Ah, I feel much better now.&quot; spams:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nadonius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Agree with Q, I worked my butt off to get where I am now, and its gonna mean nothing if they take hell out.  Now, if they remove hell and keep the total exp requirement from 1-60 the same, that may not be so bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Barain ni Melangell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well...the Hell level thing has always been a problem...one because they have said that removeing them would mean that everyone currently above lvl 50 would gain 1 1/2 to 2 levels depending on the class and exp modifiers.<br />
<br />
This is a big thing when you talk about Veeshan and all the other old servers where 95% of the primary population is post lvl 50.  I will just wait and see what they do on this.<br />
<br />
Now if only they would give Druids and Shaman HalfHeals(2500 point heal)ROFLMAO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Quinnell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Somehow I'm sure they won't be suddenly granting levels to people.<br />
<br />
I'd be surprised by that - not opposed; but, very, very surprised.<br />
<br />
I'd be glad to suddenly be pushing 58 though.  :)<br />
<br />

barely 56 wizard</div></div><hr />
