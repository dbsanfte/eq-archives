<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slisth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, after 2 years of playing EQ much of my gear still sucks. I was wondering if anyone can provide a list of good, fairly easy to quest gear that shammies can use? The problem is Allakhazam's has a million quests, and who the heck has time to search through all the crap looking for the few gem quests?<br />
<br />
For example, I know that the Testament of Vanear is good for lower level shammies. I know that the twilight sea quests seem to uniformly suck (the armor is not that great), and are long and extremely boring to camp. Obviously the 8th cudgel is uber (I have number 6 so far). I would like to start a thread where people post their suggestions for good shammy quests. <br />
<br />
So, here are the ones I know of. If everyone contributes, we may actually get a useful list of these quests for shammies of all levels.<br />
<br />
Testament of Vaneer -(http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=144)<br />
Fine Antique Veil - (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2191)<br />
8th Cudgel - (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1900)<br />
Scaled Mystic Armor (for iksar up to about level 30 - 40)<br />
Beginner Magic Manual (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2218)<br />
<br />
<br />
Slisth <br />
Shaman of the 54th circle, Xev</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well if you are looking for body armor then here's a rough progression of lowest to highest in terms of AC:<br />
<br />
Totemic -- &gt; quested all over the world<br />
Spirit Weaver's --&gt;  drops in PoG<br />
Rune Etched --&gt; drops in PoH<br />
Rune Crafter's --&gt; Kael drop Thurg quest<br />
Wolf Caller's --&gt; ToV drop Skyshrine quest<br />
Spirit Caller's --&gt; ToV drop Kael quest<br />
<br />
Rune Crafters, Wolf Callers and Spirit Callers all require 3 gems and enough faction(kindly+ for thurg and ally for Skyshrine). Just hand in the armor and gems to the appropiate NPC. All these quests are listed on allakhazam.<br />
<br />
Best bet is to start getting in on some Kael arena raids for the Rune Crafters armor. Chain drops aren't common though so be prepared to go on several raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I wouldn't really say velious armors are &quot;quested&quot;.  Sure you have to do a &quot;quest&quot;, which involves looting the armor, buying 3 gems in the bazaar, and handing them to an NPC, but it's pretty much just loot with a side step (and required faction).<br />
<br />
There really isn't a ton of straight quest stuff out there, the mid-range armors (scaled mystic, totemic) are the only ones I can think of atm.<br />
<br />
I suppose you can add our epic in there, you get boots, a shield, and a spear out of that one.<br />
Earring of solstice is another one, though all it requires is buying 9 items (also in the bazaar).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Andal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The Shield of Bane Warding is a very nice quest item for a Shammy, and has an excellent graphic as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Coldain Military Wristguard and Kromrif Military leggings are both very nice quested items for shaman.</div></div><hr />

Does anyone know if Aura of Health stacks, like Aura of Battle or Flowing Thought?  I would think that with illusion potions it would be pretty easy to do both of these quests.  I'm just not sure if you would get the benefit from both Auras of Health.<br />
<br />
I have also heard that the luggald flesh camps are a pain.  Any experiences in this regard?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>skwayb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Jaradis suggested these 2 Quests on another Topic.  They are some very nice pieces.<br />
<br />
If you are looking for some nice sleeves and shoulders you should look into these quests.<br />
<br />
Quest Info - Fusibility Research (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1292)<br />
<br />
Item Info - Strength of Elements (+100 HP Shoulders) (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6989) -- Requires getting these 4 elements:<br />
<br />
-- Fusible Coral Ore - Off Phinigel Autropos in Kedge Keep <br />
-- Fusible Earthen Ore - From Master Yael in the Hole <br />
-- Fusible Igneous Ore - Ground spawn by the large volcano in Sky Fire mountains around 900, -1500 <br />
-- Fusible Velium Ore - Off a large air elemental named Guardian Kozzalym in Western Wastes.<br />
<br />
Now if you are Ally with Chardock you can do this one.  This is a very nice piece.  It will fit in the Arms, Shoulders or Wrist.  This would be an item you probably wouldn't replace for awhile.<br />
<br />
Quest Info - Spirit Wracked Cord (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1889)<br />
<br />
This requires you do the Regal Band of Bathezid (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1888) quest.<br />
<br />
Yah I know trying to be ally with Chardock is the suck.  If you are KOS it requires going to Droga or Nurga and killing close to 3000 GREEN mobs.  Well less than that if you do the turn ins to Harold from the items they drop to get additional faction hits but you need a faction adjustment of about 3000.  Info for how to change your faction comes from the Chardock Quests EZ Board (http://pub64.ezboard.com/bchardokquests).  My faction is toast from all the Sarnak killing I did when I was a little cub in Lake ill Omen and the King/Queen Kills I have been on.  But this is something you might want to look into.<br />
<br />
Like Jaradis said these will probably be some items you have for a long time until you get in some higher end zones.<br />
<br />
Zyrro Qool<br />
Prophet<br />
Mythic Voyagers (http://pub147.ezboard.com/bmythicvoyagers56372) <br />
My Gear (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3191)</div></div><hr />

I have also heard that the luggald flesh camps are a pain.  Any experiences in this regard?<br />
<br />
According to my Magelo profile, they do:<br />
<br />
              Base   Item   Total<br />
HP Regen 17/23    2      19/25 <br />
<br />
Regarding the flesh, the Dulak part was much, much easier than the Nadox part. In Dulak there was a group of mid levels camping the secret Luggald tunnel for Necro quest drops, I kept them buffed and hasted in exchange for the flesh drops. This took about 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
I originally tried to solo the Luggald shrine in Nadox but it didn't work out so well. Not only do these mobs have an insane amount of HP, but if your pet pushes the mob too close to the wall get read for adds. After getting a rez I decided a full group approach was the way to go. It took about, I would say, four to five hours of constant Luggald slaying to yield three fecund flesh.<br />
<br />
The Skelly in Tox was pretty easy as well, everyone getting lost trying to find the island took way longer than the fight once we got there. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>sorsisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Is the mark quest reward random, or is it based on your class? I saw another reward for that quest was a dagger that shaman cant use, id hate to put 5-10 hours into a quest to yield a no drop dagger i cant even use  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Reward is based on your class.</div></div><hr />
