<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just completed that last night, wanted to give peeps a little feedback. Went to the southwing, ranger,monk,me, cleric, druid, crazy train pulling enchanter. (bot to open the door also)<br />
<br />
First skull that dropped was the lore, got 4 more within 1 1/2 hours. Straight cake. Hauled butt over to the Oracle on the beach, did the turn ins. <br />
<br />
First of all, Pendel the uber woodelf dork was hanging out in the water for some reason, and I saw some conehead ghost I had never seen before wandering the beach. Neither assisted. <br />
<br />
Anyway, giving the dusty skull to the oracle, (just a 60 monk and myself for this fight) it takes about 3-5 mins for the iksar to pop. He's a SK, hit the monk with a 700+ point HT. Feared us both for a few seconds also. Malo'd, slow bounced, but stuck the second time, resisted bane, didnt get to try pox. Epic stuck, ice nuke worked. Decent amount of HP, hits for around 200. <br />
<br />
All thats left now is blackened iksar bones, a few turn ins and a trip with some friends to HS for a VS beatdown!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i'm right there with ya krak...got all i need for the final turn in, just gotta round up a few peeps =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sebanis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hrm, I don't have Malo yet, so the fact slow bounced first try scares me a bit :( Think I will need more than my ranger friend for this one, thanks for the feedback Krak :) <br />
<br />
Can you tell me was it just a regular yard trash mob that dropped the dusty skull? I heard the smaller named ones drop it, though am still not sure</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The skulls mostly dropped from yard trash, and ONLY off of skeleton mobs. I think one of the named dropped a glowing skull, but the dusty came offa regular mob, * I think *</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did that fight in FoB with just my 60 shaman and 60 warrior. I didn't know what spells would stick and I lack malo. Had my pet up. After he spawned and spells started to bounce I decided to go all heals to be safe. Warrior was getting beat pretty quick so I went defensive and just wore the thing down. Was a little iffy for  awhile. Having some extra help is a plus but watch out for those that are KoS will have to fight the Oracle too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Do you need a key for the southwing?  If so where does it drop and what is its name?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sebanis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok, just got my cudgel tonight. I slowed the Arisen first try at level 60, no debuffs. I might have been lucky though. Epic dot stuck as well. The thing has quite some hitpoints but is a pansy once slowed and the inital HT goes off. Had a paladin friend tanking along with pet, he took very little damage and was able to heal him easily with just chloroblast.<br />
<br />
The script to spawn the Arisen takes a few minutes, just be patient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You need a key to get into HS and you need keys for each wing. The keys for each wing drop throughout the zone. The key to NW drops at zone in. Then  you get the next key in NW to move to another wing (can't remember which). I don't think anyone does it that way tho. You need to do SW for this quest and the teh next so just bring a rogue with a LP of 201+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Purtyoogly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">soloed the skelly in FoB wasnt too much of an issue.<br />
slowed on first try...might have just gotten lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The arisen iksar in FoB is immune to poison and disease. Cold nukes work though.<br />
<br />
The ghost on the beach in FoB sometimes goes invisible, so you don't always see her without spirit sight.</div></div><hr />
