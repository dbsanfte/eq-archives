&quot;How exactly are the experience penalties applied? I know they don't apply to AA, but they do apply to regular exp. However, I don't know WHEN the penalties are applied. It's easy to understand if the player goes 100% regular exp or 100% AA, but it's when the exp is split I have a question. Let me use an example: a hypothetical troll bard.<br />
<br />
Assumptions: 20% penalty, 10,000 exp for a mob kill, 90% AA experience, 10% regular experience<br />
<br />
1) If penalty is applied first<br />
2000 penalty<br />
800 reg exp<br />
7200 AA exp<br />
<br />
2) if the penalty is applied last<br />
9000 reg exp<br />
200 penalty<br />
800 reg exp<br />
<br />
There is an potential experience 'bleed' of 18%. Similarly, how does it work with leadership exp on? Will a racial exp penalty ever hit the leadership experience pool?<br />
<br />
This has been bugging me for a while! Thanks very much if you can help!&quot;<br />

Penalties are not applied to XP gained; they are applied to XP required.  A troll warrior gets exactly the same XP that a human warrior gets for a kill.  They simply require more XP to level up.  The example would look like this:<br />
 <br />
10,000 XP for the NPC, 90% to AAs, 10% to normal.<br />
 <br />
Both warriors get 8,000 towards AA and 2,000 toward normal bar.<br />
 <br />
Human warrior needs 500,000 to level up.  Troll warrior needs 600,000 to level up.  So human sees a 2% increase in his normal level bar, but the troll only sees a 1.67% increase because he needs more XP to fill it.  The AA bar grows the same for each.<br />
 <br />
These numbers are just to show how the system works; they are not the exact numbers from the game.<br />

I hope this answers your question properly . Sorry it took so long for me to respond . Im posting this on the boards rather than PMing becase there were several outhers interested in knowing about this .</div></div><hr />

I know someone has to point it out.... might as well be me.<br />
<br />
10,000x .9= 9,000<br />
10,000x .1= 1,000<br />
<br />
Where do the 8k and 2k come from?  I know they were just trying to use small numbers for us stupid people and making it round.... but come on there was a reason to use small numbers for idiots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Obviously the 8k/2k was a simple mistake, he had calculated that based on 80/20 instead of 90/10.<br />
<br />
I don't understand how this can cause an xp loss, Shumm.  According to this, a troll warrior and a human warrior should gain AA's at exactly the same rate when split at the same level, but the troll will gain levelling XP slower.</div></div><hr />

he most likely means a rounding mistake for odd experiencenumbers, so if you split 2001 exp to 50% normal/50% aa exp, the splits purely mathematically would be 1000,5 each, but as it is quite possible that experience just works with full, non-rational numbers (and you certainly will get more exp than the mob can give out if it), it will be rounded down and 1000 exp will be given each. So you would loose 1 point worth of experience max per mob. This is kinda .. .moot.<br />
<br />
especially its not really granted, that the mobs dont just give even numbers of exp :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yup exactly - thus very minor xp losses.<br />
Mob xp used to be lvl*lvl*ZEM if I recall correctly, and the loss may be as much as 2 xp if leadership is taken into account ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Clarifying, the above formula is the mobs level, so a level 50 mob would give:<br />
50*50*75=187500xp<br />
The 75 is from standard outdoor zone - haven't checked, since this is just an example.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, it answers that.  If you have 2 level 65 players, one of them suffering a penalty, and the other not suffering a penalty.  The player with the penalty will require more exp to fill his regular exp bar, but the same amount of exp to fill his AA bar.  So if both players are on full AA they will both gain the same percentage of AA exp per kill, and if they are both splitting their AA/regular exp by the same amount (90/10 like in example), then they will both gain the same percentage of AA exp per kill, but the person without the penalty will gain a higher percentage of regular exp than the person with the penalty, because it takes more exp for the person with the penalty to fill his bar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Correct me if I'm wrong here, but isn't one point of AA based on the required experience to go from level 51 to level 52? If so than the penalty based characters had a higher amount of xp required to go from level 51 to level 52. This raw elevated experience requirement would continue through, translating in a larger amount of experience than &quot;normal&quot; for each point of AA they acomplish. Using an example of 10,000 exp required for normal characters to level from 51 to 52, a 20% penalty character will require 12,000 points to make the level, thus it will cost them 12,000 points per aa from then on, versus 10,000 points for a normal character to make an aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It's probably approximately the un-penalized, non-bonused value. I think that was a ballpark figure, not an exact number.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, that's just an approximation of the amount of xp it takes, it's not a rule.</div></div><hr />

Where have you seen this confirmed?  I believe this NOT to be the case, based on my experience with friends AAXP'ing, but I haven't seen definitive results either way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Rofl.  I was checking some of my settings, and someone gave me a negative rep bump for asking the question.  <br />
<br />
They said, &quot;this is a no brainer you answered your own question. As for Leadership points they do cost exp but the percent of how much exp would be good to know&quot;<br />
<br />
I found that somewhat amusing.  Is anyone else unable to see that the two scenarios I posited are actually a difference of 18% lost experience?  :p<br />
<br />
Fortunately, it's a non-issue.  It just took them 2 months to answer the question!<br />
