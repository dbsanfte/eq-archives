<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The first DoN AA provides +10 to stats.  The second one provides a boost to HP/mana/end.  I'm trying to figure out what the second one actually does but need some info from you.  I want to do it for just shaman for now so I don't have to worry about class differences.<br />
<br />
So far it looks like shaman get +200 mana applied to their base mana.  The HP boost is related to gear though.  Naked you get no increase.  As you add gear there is a factor that boosts your HPs.  I get around 160 hps with my current gear.  As gear improves the amount of added HPs increases.  You can see my first attempts at Magelo Forums&gt;Main Forum&gt;DoN Progression.<br />
<br />
If I could get some of you with the 2nd DoN AA to get naked and ... er .... ummm post your:<br />
<br />
Level, class, in game naked HP, total in game HP, Magelo Base Direct Indirect and Total HPs. <br />
<br />
Make sure your Magelo matches your actual equip/AAs/skills/charm stats, etc. and make sure you have no tribute, stat food, buffs, leader AAs, etc. going at the time. <br />
<br />
Thanks for any help you can provide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Scowls1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">sure my unbuffed &quot;neked at teh soulbinder&quot; hps is 1850.<br />
my ingame unbuffed geared hps, is 7250(ish)<br />
magelo shows me a  little behind, by about 150 or so.<br />
<br />
i have the 2nd aa (and 3rd, but it shouldnt make a diff acourding to the description)<br />
<br />
mana...im not sure naked mana, or real ingame, somewhere aroundd 8700...its also about 150 ahead of magelo<br />
<br />
one of the problems is that magelo hasnt figured out the formula yet either exactly.  but i know its 150 off on mana and hps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks Scowls.  I really need exact numbers though.  Also you have stat food on your Magelo that changes the numbers some and if you are at the soulbinder it makes me wonder if you were in group/raid waiting for a rez and had any LAA stats included.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scowls1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">sometimes, i die soloing. i posted my lowest hps i remember having.  i usually look at it to see if i accidentally cannied...would i kill myself.<br />
<br />
next time i log on ill write stuff down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Lvl 70, I get 206 hp and 204 mana above that shown in my magelo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I didn't look at any of your magelo's, but it is likely that ND will affect the amount of hp you get from this AA, as it effects everything else, including gear hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dirkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The Second DoN AA works exactly as ND does. I think over on the Magelo boards they have roughly pegged it as a further 3% increase.</div></div><hr />
