helloooos....me got da primal cudgel da other day in AC.<br />
<br />
it is a nice hammer and has group primal essence as a spell which does.:<br />
<br />
1: Increase Agility by 20 (L1)<br />
2: Increase Dexterity by 20 (L1)<br />
3: Increase Strength by 20 (L1)<br />
4: Increase Stamina by 20 (L1)<br />
<br />
<br />
now it doesn't stack with our agility spell...and also some SK spell(me forget which one)<br />
<br />
is this worth casting?  cuz its agi is only 20 yet our agi buff is 52.<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
guess i lack knowledge of this spells uses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blearg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its useful for most melee, as most don't particularly care about AGI. The 20sta/dex is very nice for those without Primal, or casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">its 20 sta and stacks with our sta buff, so its more hp for those not already maxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">20 sta is 60 hp for us, 80 hp for um monks I know...not sure if any more for any other classes.  60 hp is minimum I think, so even if nobody wants it in particular, it's good even for pure casters cuz it's got some HP in it.  And casters actually often need STR for the crap they carry, so the str component comes in handy pretty often even for them.<br />
<br />
Guys with primal don't need it, but everyone else isn't hurt by it a bit.  Great junk buff too!  Cast it before you do focus or any other buffs, and when you're facing a debuffing mob, do group PE every once in a while to boost the good buffs further down in the line.  (all mobs don't debuff one after another in a line, but some definitely do)</div></div><hr />
