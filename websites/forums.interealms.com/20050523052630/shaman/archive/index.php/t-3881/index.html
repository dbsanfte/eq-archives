<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Balduvius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone have a good link to a list of items with these focus effects or some sort of database listing of items?  I am looking to get a mana preservation item besides obulus death shroud and rather unsure of what items have affliction efficency.  Currently I have bracelet of the sky for affliction haste 3 and I am hooked on the focus effects :).<br />
Thanks,<br />

I love the Search feature, it makes me so happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Phat link, Glory. I've been looking for something like this for a while. (Er, yes, I'm coming back.. /sheepish)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">http://everquest.allakhazam.com is great too, but I think you might need to be a premium member to search for focus items (premium is so cheap though, its worth it).</div></div><hr />

I had another shaman comment about how he doens't think the ODS is worth it.   Personally, I've rather liked it.  Plus the other high end Raiding Shaman on my server who are trying to buy one reinforces that I made the right choice.<br />
<br />
Plus, it means I can stop collecting stupid crystalline silk threads and crystalline silk to get my tailoring up. ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">He didn't think ODS was worth it?  then what the hell does he have in its place, Coldain Shawl level 264?  that extra 15% means that I'm almost always ahead of the rest of the raid when it comes for mana, NOTHING is gonna make me give up this item.<br />
<br />
I have JBB, which I switch out for a resist item, once in a great while, FT which I switch out for high AC/resist BP once in a great while, and ODS which I switch out for Pauldrons, VERY rarely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naghite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If affliction efficiency continues to do slows - an ODS would never go off for me except for torpor, which is dirt cheap anyway.  With no AE3 - ODS good, with AE3 - ODS = unused redundancy....we'll have to see if they do go back</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks I was looking for this list myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I said that the ODS wasn't worth it on this board before.<br />
<br />
That's because I use a Crystalline Torque instead, which seem to be a lot cheaper.  There's better shoulder stuff than there is neck stuff typically.  Obviously depends on what you have or get.</div></div><hr />
