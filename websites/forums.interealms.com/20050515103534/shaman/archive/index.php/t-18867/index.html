<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yedak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am curious, and its probably impossible to know, at a given time in EQ what the ratio of botted to &quot;real&quot; main character Shaman is.<br />
<br />
I am sure that some people consider their 2 two-boxed chacters to be both &quot;real&quot;, but I think that depends on the context.<br />
<br />
Is it a signifigant percentage or just a minor thing? Shaman seem to be a very popular &quot;buffbot&quot; class, so I am sure its more than just a trivial amount.<br />
<br />
So, what is it? 1%, 5%, more?<br />
<br />
BTW, I am a Shaman re-roll as main. This Shaman is not my highest character, but he is not a bot, and is my current and forseeable main.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Typical Raid group I go with...<br />
Me= Rogue/Shaman Botted<br />
Mage/Shaman Botted<br />
Rogue/Shaman Botted<br />
1 Shaman solo<br />
<br />
So from my calculations: 75% of all shaman are bots :)<br />
<br />
Pretty sure from my statistics class, 4 cases can sum up the entire population of EQ players :)<br />
<br />
Top of my head honestly I'd say 10% are full time Bots.  Right on par with Clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would say 30%.  That might be high, but that seems to be what I see on my server.  Everyone and their brother has a shaman, and for every 10 that I see, about 3 or 4 of them are following another character around with /autofollow and never saying a word.  Most of those shaman are Druman, with Gebs and leather at 60+.<br />
<br />
Its annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well I&quot;m in a light raiding guild of about 45-60 people, average 20-25 on a night unless a big raid. We have 4 active shaman and 3 are always 2-boxed wheter it be raids, xp grinds or LDoN. The other shaman is 2-boxed about 75percent of the time when his wife doesn't want to or cannot play her wizard.<br />
 <br />
I don't know if we are typical but most of my guilds shaman except the latter one are all what I consider bots. By that I mean, if they are asked to fill one spot in a group, or for some reason can only bring one character, they prefer that character not be their shaman and also consider their shaman bot last and usually only will take rot loots for their shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Cleric bots way way out number shaman bots I'd say, but there are quite a few shaman bots too.<br />
<br />
I know about 10 people with a cleric bot for every one that has a shaman bot though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Speaking for my guild, we have 8 shamans;<br />
<br />
65 - main (me)<br />
64 - main<br />
63 - bot (original player quit in the 40's - guildmate leveled up)<br />
63 - alt (used to be a main - player switched to necro)<br />
53 - alt (used to be a main - player switched to beastlord)<br />
44 - alt<br />
39 - alt<br />
21 - alt<br />
<br />
Looking around my server, I mostly see shamans that were created since PoP came out because people needed them or wanted to get groups easier - which of course led to a overabundance of shamans, and now they are a dime a dozen. That's about how much most of them are worth too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd say there are 3x as many cleric bots as there are shaman bots.  Most high end guilds would crash and burn if it wasn't for their boxed clerics.<br />
<br />
I'd estimate 10-15% of all shamans are bots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yedak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Would it be safe to say that the way PoP mobs were implemented with hitting so much harder than before overemphasized the necessity of Slow, causing a huge influx of Slow Dispensers?<br />
<br />
This has reminded me of when my first &quot;real&quot; char was level 16 and hunting in Oasis, and there was this strange Dorf just sitting there and would jerkily stand up and heal.<br />
<br />
Now this was the olden days, and when he said he was controlling both characters, it was like OMG, you are the all time super twink ever.<br />
<br />
Now its normal to have a botted char in a group, even a LDON group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmmm, none of the shaman in my guild are bots.<br />
<br />
It isn't unsual for 5+ shaman to be on a raid.  And we are down 2 or 3 shaman from people quiting the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Bots?  I'd say it's not incredibly high.  Most the shamans I know are mains.  I know of 1 botted shaman, and that's about it.<br />
<br />
I'd say &quot;boting&quot; is more prevalent in the high-end uber guilds, which are still a small percentage of the total population.  In that case I could imagine shamans being a popular choice, but in most practical senses the shaman I meet and get to know are main chars.  I myself included.  He's not my first main char, but he's my current and highest level/most AA toon.  I play him prob 90% of the time.  I &quot;bot&quot; a 57 monk sometimes when I'm feeling saucy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My guild has 8 primary shaman, 2 Primary recruit shaman, a few alt shaman that aren't bots, and 1 bot alt shaman.<br />
<br />
Better question is how many bot clerics are out there?<br />
Looking at my guild, about 1/3 of all clerics we have are bots.<br />
We started doing Fennin script last week with about 50 people, of which only 8 where real healers (cleric/druid).<br />
We had the fairly useless classes for the Fennin fight itself (like monks) etc pull out the duel comp clerics to play as primary characters.<br />
Our healing population grew by easily 50% more people.<br />
I'm almost beginning to think that every new recruit needs to have access to a bot cleric with a res stick unless the recruit is a cleric himself.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Why must *high end guilds* have a higher population of bot shaman? Right now our guild has 7 or 8 shaman, NONE are bots.  The only bots in our whole guild is one cleric bot, and one bard bot.   Just kind of annoyed me to see such a sweeping generalization as that.  And fyi, our guild is *number 1* (killed quarm first, only guild on server able to clear time in one day in under 6 hours).  So, no, our guild doesnt employ botted shaman.  Seen more in the mid tier guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Honestly i dont think alot of shaman are botted.  The reason is you do not need alot fo them.  It does not take alot of shaman to buff a large number of players.  My guild has about 25-30 raiders at an event and we usually have 2 shaman there.  My shaman is a bot for my mage but i really enjoy playing him in groups.  I just wish we had more DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Our Guild:<br />
7 Raiding &quot;Main&quot; Shamans (all medium to high shamans)<br />
1 Non-Raiding &quot;Main&quot; Shaman<br />
1 Raid &quot;Bot&quot; Shaman<br />
<br />
And probably <br />
5 other twink/alt shamans that can be botted.  Usually dragged out only for LDON runs when there are no slowers present.<br />
<br />
all priest classes make popular non-raid bots for a variety of reasons.  <br />
Druids become port/forage/pl bots<br />
Shaman become slowers when one not around<br />
Clerics become rezzers<br />
I'd say of &quot;non-raiding&quot; bots, all are proably very very close in numbers.<br />
<br />
But when it comes to raiding bots.  Id say cleric bots way way out number any other bots.  It simply goes back to how disproportionately you need clerics at raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>lanolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">PoT guild, we ONLY bot clerics and only when we have to. &quot;real&quot; players on raids are simply too important to have people running around 2 boxing on raids.<br />
<br />
XP groups its another story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I am in an elemental guild.  On average there are 3 main shaman on a raid and 2 botted shaman.  So 40% are botted.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">look for more bot'ed shaman if we are the only person that can buff endurance and cast the stationary warder thingy</div></div><hr />

Islowem chill... So your in the *NUMBER 1!!!* guild on your server and you dont have any bots, great.  Look around at all the other folks saying they do.  Look at people saying 30% of the sham they know are bots.  Something tells me there are TONS of Shaman bots around.<br />
<br />
Wow... I've seen tons of blow ups lately on this board and this one takes the cake for the silliest reason to get upset at someone.  &quot;NEVER tell me that there are lots of bots in high end guilds!!! I'm in a high end guild and we dont have any!!!!!&quot;  <br />
<br />
Heh I'm still giggling at this :) Please read my post above... I wa kidding though that since in &quot;My world&quot; 75% of the shaman are bots, so 75% of all shaman must be bots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">We very rarely need to bot shm, clerics on the other hand ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">That was in no way a blow up or a brag.   Was a simple defense to the *high end guild equates to more shaman bots*.  I dont disagree nor argue the point that our class would probably be the most likely to be botted in raiding guilds (minus the fact you need huge comp heal cycles at times, hence the cleric bots), cause after one or two mgbs (FoS and ToT), and a debuff / slow, you can do better to have ANY other class.  <br />
<br />
My point, and not a rip roaring shout, was that it was a fallacy to say high end = bot shaman.   Try re reading what i posted, without thinking Im yelling or screaming and you will see.  My current guild status was only put in, to validate my point, not brag.  Notice some of the other time/ elemental shaman agree'ing with me?<br />
<br />
Anyways, have a cup of joe, and realize it wasnt worded how you thought it was.  :D</div></div><hr />

I dont hate bots becase a Bot cant do what a &quot;real&quot; person can . Becase a really good 2 boxer can pretty much play too toons pretty damn good .<br />
I hate bots becase I think .. If you need anouther cleric or shaman .. recruite one .. this is a multi player game . Dont cheat yourself or outhers .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I would say about 20-25% nowadays.<br />
<br />
And it makes me sad... and it does nothing but reinforce the BoT-shaman reputation.  Sorry - but a bot-shaman isn't going to be played as well as I play my character.  A shaman requires too much activity and attention...  MAYBE if you were to play a druid as the other box... no one expects a druid to do anything anyway so you could play the shaman 90% and the druid 10% and everyone would be seeing what is expected.  *snicker*</div></div><hr />
