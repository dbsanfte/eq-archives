<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, <br />
<br />
Looking for upgrades.<br />
<br />
have about 7k - plus i make about 1k per night or so.<br />
<br />
Wondering if i should just plough through the 50's and save all cash for Malo/Torpor, and equip as it drops, or individually upgrade?<br />
<br />
If i were to upgrade, could you let me know your advice on which slots to upgrade?<br />
<br />
P.S - i know im wearing yellow booties, dont laugh!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Firstly, go hang your head in shame for wearing those boots.<br />
<br />
Now that you've done that, get rid of them.  Tribal war boots are nice, and you should make money on that deal. Do the Coldain military bracer quest to replace the RMB.  Get a new cloack.  Ancient Seahorse cloaks arent bad.  Hiero is optimal.  <br />
<br />
Get a solstice earring, or atleast the pieces as you go.  Buying the pieces individually is deffinately the way to go.  I got mine for 5k all told, instead of 8 or 9 for the total package.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know about your boots. I found an interesting droppable set from mines of ssra. Dusty Soriz boots. 40 hps nothing special but better than Gebs. Would be very cheap.  <br />
<br />
The Turtlebone ring? Keep it, but put ac6/65 ring it its place and use it only for EB gear.<br />
<br />
Ranged slot. Your sta is pretty low. Go with a Idol of the Thorned or Goranga.  That charm isn't doing much for ya imo<br />
<br />
Helm. Been an incredibly long time. There has to be something out there better than that. Anything with hitpoints on it.  Jaundiced Bone as a worst case scenario.<br />
<br />
RMB. Try a sentry Bracer/ +15 sta bracer. See if you can find a deal. If you've got 7k, this is a place to look to upgrade.<br />
<br />
I always like the Earring of Solstice.  I'd start picking up this items (or just do it all now).  Great earring. Hard to get 2 earrings better than it to replace it.<br />
<br />
HP -&gt; Sta -&gt; AC at your level. As you approach 60 you'll want to make resists on the items you upgrade with a little more important.<br />
<br />
Your question about saving for Malo/Torpor.  Unless you're being pl'd you're a long way from 60.   If you're a powergamer type then you're likely to join a guild once you approach 60 (lots of guilds have these spells in the guild vault)  If you're not the powergamer type, you're a good bit from 60.  Get some upgrades. (Since you're buying mostly tradable ones, you'll make at least some of your money back in resale)  You have a fungi tunic. With the steady value of Fungi and the lowering price of torpor/malo, you'll have a nice bartering item for torpor once you hit 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Upgraded to the following.<br />
