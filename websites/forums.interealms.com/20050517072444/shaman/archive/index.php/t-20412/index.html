<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dakirra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I dualed a druid friend and he owned me. We are both 65. he has better resists gear, but he told me there a way a shaman could easily beat him. Anyone know what i should do next time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bearhugz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well that would be hard wouldnt it without knowing what u did or he did. the duel round by round so to speak. what spells did he cast , u cast , pet or no pet, spell lineup resists etcetc<br />
<br />
the bear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">pell his dots off, if hes casting 2 then wait til second one lands. play defensive, just out heal him, then when hes oom gank him (or more likely win when he concedes)<br />
<br />
other than that forget it, druids are a far superior pvp class than shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>dakirra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can't dot in a dual, you lose xp. We both nuked.. I used pet, which he quickly killed. both used root, he used blind a lot ( i didn't have cure blindness at the time). I had level 63 debuff ( I now have malos) got resisted. I quickly went oom, he didn't even come close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I disagree, I usually smoke druids in PvP.  They simply cannot outlast shaman healing, and they have just as much trouble landing spells on us as we do them.  Advantage shaman with Malos.<br />
<br />
This is an easy fight.  Make sure you stay on yer horse.  Sic dogdog on him, and then dispell the sh*t out of the druid.  Once dispelled, Malos him.<br />
<br />
At this point, he's lost all his buffs, including any mana-regen buffs.  Even if he dispells you, there's no way a buffless druid keeps up with a buffless shaman in mana-regen.<br />
<br />
Spirit Call 3 on him and let the dogs pound on him.  This'll get him worried.<br />
<br />
All you gotta do is keep yer health healed, which is no prob.  Q + Tnarg's and canni 5 and you'll have mana all day long.<br />
<br />
Play defense until he runs out of mana... at which point he is worthless.<br />
<br />
At this point do what you want.  If you can land spells, then nuke/DoT him until dead.  If you can't land spells, then use dogdog/SC3 and melee to take him down.<br />
<br />
Other tools you can use are:<br />
<br />
- Malicious Decay/Virulent Paralysis combination... that should be able to root him.  Also good for interrupts.<br />
- Nothing is more annoying than being blinded.  See if you can land it on him.  Also have cure blind memmed ( I think druids can blind)<br />
- Make sure you have some sort of cure up.  Whether it be Radiant Cure, or  Disinfecting Aura... you wanna be able to cure any of his DoTs/snares/roots on you or dogdog if he lands one.<br />
- Dispell Dispell Dispell....   buffs are a huge advantage and dispell is the one spell that he can't resist.  Nothing is more frustrating than losing mana-regen, and 1000 hps worth of buffs.<br />
- Put yer important buffs last...   junk buffs first.  Focus and Resist buffs should be yer final 5 buffs.  Throw agility, charisma, acumen, whatever first so that he dispells those.<br />
<br />
The only trouble I'd have with a druid is if he had a DC pet, but I'd prob find a way to deal with it.  (again.... dispell..)<br />
<br />
I'm assuming you are dueling in an arena so prob no DC pets available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>dakirra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Which despell would you recomend? Some work better than others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Definitely Annul Magic, our highest level Dispell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thread hijack.<br />
<br />
OK, got a buddy, 65 Wiz with 80 aa's, currently does not play much.  I'm trying to get to his level since we have a long standing invite to PvP each other.<br />
<br />
So, you PvP experts, who would win this fight, assuming all things such as gear being equal?  Are Wizards good at PvP or wusses?  I plan to prepare properly, even if I have to get higher resist gear just for the duel.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Dispell only works if he is a crappy PVPer. Most good pvpers keep atleast 4 instaclick buffs in their top spell slots to aviod being dispelled. Coldain ring, gobby earring etc.<br />
<br />
For the record - i myself is a crappy pvper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As a shaman, ALWAYS play defensive in pvp. Keep yourself FM and with decent health. Use your efficient heals, and melee him down. Using Mal Decay + VP is great for pvp, it roots em so they can't get away from dogdog, and interrupts casting.<br />
<br />
Malos is your friend in pvp, without it you can't get spells to land.<br />
<br />
Dispells in pvp. Try to keep 2 dispels up - annul magic and nullify magic*(see below).<br />
<br />
Dots, at least on RZ, do not cause exp deaths. I don't play blue server so I don't have experience with it.<br />
<br />
*dispells*<br />
Use nullify magic on your opponent. Nullify magic sometimes skips buffs, so junk buffs don't always work. Most of the time, nullify takes off the top buff + 1 random buff.<br />
<br />
Annul magic, use this on yourself for when you get dotted/debuffed. This dispell always takes the top 2 buffs/debuffs off.<br />
<br />
A druid who is only nuking will most likely use Summer's Flame for pvp. This means he's going to first Hand of Ro you, which is a low-resist FR debuffer, takes off like 90. Make sure you have a &quot;dot slot&quot; open. A &quot;dot slot&quot; is the place where the first debuff/dot lands when it's cast on you. That way, when it lands, you can easily dispell it(see above, annul magic). then he will summer's flame you now that your FR is low. When he lands the debuff on you, you have about 6 seconds or so before the nuke lands. time it right and you can dispell the debuff before his nuke lands, and likely resist it.<br />
<br />
To the other poster, about PvPing a wizard: Be extremely careful. If he gets you below 75%, he WILL manaburn you. So you need to keep your HPs up, and always be ready to heal. a smart wizard will lure you to about 80%, then cast the low-resist DD/stun he has to get you lower, which gives him extra time to get MB off before you heal. Interrupts here are your friend, get Spirit call and Virulent paralysis on him. Also, dispells are your friend, a wizard is very tender, so getting runes off really will help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">hand of ro is -72FR and it's -200 resist adjust. It's hard to get fire resist to a decent level as a shaman (at least it is for me) and they have an awesome debuff for it.<br />
<br />
With hand of ro and summer's flame they can bring you down quick. Thankfully, you can keep yourself alive with quies and tnargs easier than they can nuke you. Just outlast them.<br />
<br />
If he has crappy resists, try and keep him blinded :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Dueling priest vs priest is quite boring if both people know how to play.  <br />
Shaman pet and meleeing is meaningless due to flameshield, which cannot be dispelled if the other person has 2 instant clicks.   Our dots can easilly be cured (not to mention they have a 99% resist rate on pvp), and our nukes are nothing to depend on.  But same thing goes with druids.<br />
<br />
The only way a shaman can win, is to bring down the druid to about 60% hp.  They generally dont heal themselves if dueling against a shaman until about 60% down, to get the most efficient heal.  Then sink your 5 pets on him right away (hopefully you didnt waist those AAs on the new GoD pets)  And then spam nukes.  Hopefully the 5 pets will keep the druid from casting heal.  You have time for about 6-7 nukes, all depending on your focus items.  And if you didnt kill him by the time the pets poof, you lost your shot.  <br />
<br />
{Blind is most likely what he was talking about when he said he can be killed by us easilly, but good gear prevents this spell from haveing any kind of effectiveness}</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Actually, isn't it more like 5 times? ;)<br />
<br />
Pally heals are so efficient that I think they can CH themselves 3x before they run oom + LoH + the actual kill</div></div><hr />
