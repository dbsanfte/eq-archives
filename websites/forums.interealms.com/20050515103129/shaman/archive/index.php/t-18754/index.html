<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">he procs a blind, which makes holding agro a real pain in the ass. Even with 500MR your tank will only resist it about 1/2 the time. Best bet is to either CoH debuff then pull so your debuff squad doesn't get mulched, or simply debuff slower if your tank can stay alive.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, if you have any rogues with MM daggers, have them bag them cause the proc overwrites incite  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Spread out the debuffs among the shaman you got, don't have just one do all the debuffs.  Usually you should not get agro just from a single debuff or slow.  Being at max range seems to help a lot too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">MT's in water generally get knocked back crazy style.  If it is early in the fight or tank has weak aggro built up, it is very easy for the npc to transfer hate to someone else (e.g.: debuffer).  That may be the case as well as what was mentioned in the previous replies.<br />

Good Luck with Bard Masks :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Let the main tank get aggro. Water is very bitchy for melees and the MT has a hard time already getting agro with the blind.  It's better to wait 10 seconds for the slow than have almost no shaman to cure blind and patch heal when defensive falls.<br />
<br />
PS: Cure blind isn't broken, just takes several casts of it to work in this case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you have ever overaggroed in water or hunted in kedge/SG at all, then you know what happens when you get hit in the water and aren't wedged in to a corner.  Well, there are no corners to wedge in to in PoWater.  This means that when your MT is getting smacked by coirnav, he's getting knocked all over the place and is missing a lot of rounds of melee.  On top of that, he is probably getting blinded, thus making him miss ever more.  For any PoWater fight, especially hydrotha, you just have to wait a little bit longer than normal to start debuffing.</div></div><hr />

If you look at the spells on Lucy it appears as though Cure Blind would work, but I am guessing this one is bugged or never was intended to work as a cure for this encounter.  With 2 or 3 shamans casting cure Blind as fast as it refreshes you still get no result and no &quot;cure&quot; message.</div></div><hr />

I've noticed the exact same thing.  I will be spamming cure blind, along with the rest of the shamans, and no one is getting a cure message.  The MT, though, is screaming in guildchat for a blind cure and accuses you of not doing your job :-\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Stepping</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just wondering can you set up an ogre wall in the water?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just wondering can you set up an ogre wall in the water?<br />
<br />
Not really.  Hydrotha tends to stay at the top of the cavern, so to form a wall you would have to keep still in the water, which is damn tough as you are constantly swimming.  Also a problem with Hydrotha and other mobs in PoWater is that the walls are curved at the bottom, so if you are up against the wall and get summoned, you'll actually end up below the curvature of the wall and get ported to zone in because the game thought you were under the world.</div></div><hr />

Just part of the package, it used to be the Chanters who took the early deaths with Tash, now it seems to be the Shaman.</div></div><hr />

I'd have to guess rampage too. Malos aggro still seems to be really low. Heck I almost never get aggro from turgurs anymore since by the time i've cast malos and turgurs the mt has established more aggro. Our regular mt's right now both run with stone etched war swords, one is yak augmented the other has anger 3 and I really don't have any aggro troubles with turgurs unless I'm doing something really silly like just casting slow as soon as they are in range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Here is my secret to living through all these encounters.<br />
<br />
I require the APP shaman to debuff first. I praise their technique and it makes them feel all warm inside even when they die. By the time they have died trying to debuff, the MT should have sufficient agro by now. I then slow and cripple and don't get agro. <br />
<br />
Life is good with apps around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Koridar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Bwahahahahahaha!!  sounds like a plan Shinerbear.</div></div><hr />

Looks like someone needs to go back to Ssra/Velious and learn how rampage works again...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Bloxr Fatso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">With the shaman in my guild I tend to just have each try slow on a mob once, and call their resists in shaman channel.  If all resisted we wait a second and all try again...  Normally at least one shaman will land slow on the first attempt and pulling aggro doesn't become an issue (we have one shaman malos prior to anyone slowing of course).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Xysander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I knew there was a reason Shiner always let me slow when I was an app.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Hmm, maybe I'm not clear on something here. Cure Blindness is one of those spells that's been sitting in my spellbook for literally years without having been cast at all. I broke it out for the first time to fight Hydrotha. Most of the time I cast it, I get a message that says &quot;MA-XX's eye's sparkle!&quot; and I've been assuming this means its working as it is supposed to. The MA seems to think it is, cause they quit yelling about being blind.<br />
<br />
Is it NOT removing the blind? We have 3 or 4 of us chain casting it during the event, because it doesn't always remove on a single casting, but I think we also have somebody casting RGC at the same time.<br />
<br />
If &quot;XX's eye's sparkle&quot; isn't meaning anything, I'm going to quit casting the spell over and over!<br />

/shrug - no fancy shmancy strats for Hydro..<br />

Get better tanks... with arrows. (or better healers to keep em alive if they are doing their job)</div></div><hr />

Nothing like training Hydro onto your raid because the game thinks your Slow hit after the CotH by the way(even though that would be impossible from your current location). Those bugs are priceless.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I like the &quot;strenght in numbers&quot; approach best.  Kinda like a school of herings.  5 shaman debuffing on incoming, mob pongs a bit, shaman take a round here and there, but mob is slowed, and someone will get aggro before the mob concentrates too much on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Stor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Yeah, except with Hydrotha, it's like a bunch of naked children smeared in chicken's blood tossing a rabid, starving, angry wolverine around.<br />

<br />
They make their shaman pull.  The shaman times Slow to land before CoH does.  If done properly, the mob is pre-slowed before entering camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Stor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Hydrotha is no joke.  He'd be simple were it a fight on dry land, but the knockback of water makes it an absolute bitch.<br />
<br />
We killed him for the first time after about 3 days of playing with him, with about 45 people and 8 clerics.  Our main tank is about 9.5k.  <br />
<br />
As far as I can tell, curing the blind is impossible.  It's much better to have your tanks 2 box so they can see if they get blinded.  <br />
<br />
Just outside Hydrotha's room, there is a T intersection and a large rock.  We set up just outside this room and pull him to here.  The tank should try to position him with his own back to the rock.  This should help a little with knockback, but a he will inevitably be pushed around, up, and over the rock, especially once your retarded melee start pushing Hydrotha all over the place.  <br />
<br />
Knockback makes proximity agro touchy, so tell your melee to SURROUND Hydrotha and keep it him roughly centered in the middle of the room.  Don't push him into the wall or ceiling, because he can and will warp.  Have your melee go easy on the procs and agro-inducing attacks.  Turn off attack occasionally, or back up.  Most of your damage should come from nukes.  Pets are also a bad idea as their push is constant, unless the master is not a complete tard.  This is a feel-it-out kind of fight, and I don't think it's really possible to break it down to a science.<br />
<br />
Also, we set up the pulls and initial heals in an unorthodox way.  To keep clerics from being eaten, we had our 3 paladins use LoH for the first 3 heals, giving the tank time to build agro so the clerics don't get eaten.  Surprisingly, the paladins didn't die.  I suppose you could also pull with a weaponshield ranger, but that didn't work as well for us.<br />
<br />
Make no mistake, Hydrotha is a bitch.</div></div><hr />
