<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is starting to get rediculous. It's almost been a year since I got 60 , and STILL no freaking torpor. I even have the money to buy it now. I am getting to the point that I even am considering quiting EQ. Just wondering whateveryone else thinks.<br />
<br />
<br />
I liked what Grizlor had to say so am quoting it:<br />
Okay now, as of the last patch, Sha's Advantage and Savagery (two beastlord spells which almost didn't exist) were moved to a vendor in PoK. While I'm all for that, since maybe three BL's on this server had thier 50% slow... what about other obscenely rare spells from previous expansions? I'm still waiting for the day when there are vendor purchaseable copies of Sunstrike, Lure of Ice, Emmissary of Thule, Demi Lich, Malo, Torpor, Pox, Voice of the Berserker, and Flaming Sword of Xuzl are available... These are KUNARK spells from almost three years ago... For ****'s sake, you go into the bazaar and type in Mala and you'll see 15 copies for sale for like three hundred plat...<br />
<br />
So far, spells like Warder's Protection, Brell's Mountainous Barrier, Cloak of the Akheva, and now these two beastlord spells are available... hybrid spells only from the last expansion, which is still getting quite an ammount of use. Why then, is no love extended to the traditional book and robe (or armor and mace, or, uh, kilt and spear) casters?<br />
<br />
With the advent of PoP the 60-65 spells, upgrades to most of these are available via parchments. A shaman receiving Malos and Quiesence at 65 because two three year old spells aren't available is simply ridiculous, and likewise for a necro who never is able to get his 59 pet and eventually gets his 61 one. What's the damage of making these spells available to people? I don't care if they cost 5k each for chrissakes, but at least they will be entering the game at a rate at which people need them.<br />
<br />
Kunark content is simply not being completed anymore. Sure, smaller guilds sometimes take out talendor, or Trak, but Veeshan's peak isn't even getting cleared regularly which, as pain in the ass as it may be, was a major source of the level 59-60 kunark era spells which the general populous needs.<br />
<br />
The current solution to obtaining spells - having mobs drop a genaric quest item which, when turned into the appropriate npc produces a spell for the apropriate class is a better idea than previous ways of doling out spells, but some of the reasoning is just ludicrous. Petrifying earth for instance is a level 62 necromancer spell, obtainable via ethereal parchments. Yet for Shamans and Clerics, the spell is level 64 and the result of a Spectral turnin. Do I even have to explain why this is messed up? Another example would be Pacification, a RUNE WORD spell for clericss, yet an Enchanter Ethereal Parchment spell.<br />
<br />
As a final example about how messed up the parchment rewards are messed up, observe THIS SPELL Which is the result of an Ethereal Parchment turnin for shamans.<br />
<br />
Now look at these FOUR SPECTRAL PARCHMENT SPELLS and you tell me that's not ridiculous. For the first two weeks of POP, shamans could even get Swift like the wind (49 chanter vendor spell) from spectrals.<br />
<br />
But no, they think the game is broken because Oozing Fleshes drop sabretooth hides. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It is out there and will drop if you kill the mobs that drop it. Some of them take a guild, some less. I've seen it drop or had friends get it off of guardian wurms, emperor in sebilis, Veeshan's peak, harla dar, sontalak, any kunark dragon, chardok king. That is quite a few sources, some of them repop very quickly. Good Hunting and I hope it drops for you the next time you take one of them down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Who voted fair?  What the hell is fair about paying money to play a game and being denied a fair shot at our most powerful spells?<br />
<br />
The only shaman that ever get these come in three classes:<br />
1. Extremely lucky.  In the right time at the right place.<br />
2. In an uber gulid &gt;  maybe 5% of all shaman fall into this category, if that.<br />
3. Willing to play for hours and hours and hours to either make plat for the spells or get super lucky on a drop.  See point #1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i voted fair <br />
<br />
im guildless and gotten two 65 spells already</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Gore:  3 times<br />
Trak:  2 times<br />
Chardok Royals:  8 times<br />
Prot / Jumpy:  2 times<br />
<br />
No Pox, Malo or Topor.   Those are from guild events that I can document.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I voted unfair, but dont really care.  Really my feelings are somewhere between the first two options: but I can't say I'm extremely pissed.<br />
<br />
Some classes can go to the bazaar and buy all their 60 spells and have change out of 500pp, shamans have to work extremely hard to get theirs. So no, it isn't fair.  Spell drops for torpor/malo ought to be increased.<br />
<br />
Having said that it is doable.  I'm unguilded but I now have both Malo and Torpor.  The 2nd shaman in my group is still 59, but we have already gotten her Malo and I'm confident that we will get her Torpor too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I voted that it's unfair. From all the classes out there, we're being shafted mostly for our spells. I.e. Mala - this damn thing drops everywhere, all the time, and I have YET to see Malo drop. And when someone gets it, it's on sale on Bazaar for 100k (or more). Wee, frikkin' fun. Mala is on sale for 25-50pp. I've had days when Gore was laid down, Trak, Jumpy and Prot - 0 Torpor, 0 Malo, 0 other shaman spells. From lvl 59 spells I have group CHA buff, which was on sale on vendors. Yeah, right, I really need THAT spell...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Seems that there's some druids on this board...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">voted fair<br />
<br />
folks it not an abnormal thing for spells to be hard to get ahold of. There are ways of obtaining them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've seen malo, topor and pox all drop from one sev kill .. so i can't really say i haven't seen them drop</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SimcimaTZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just bought torpor for 40k this morning.  Same guy who sold it to me had Malo for sale yesterday morning.  I was gonna buy Malo but decided to hold off and get Torpor first.   I asked him if he still had Malo and he said that he sold it.  But said don't worry, I'll have another one real soon.  hmmm, makes me wonder where the hell he's getting these spells to drop off of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Umm to those that voted fair. This post is about a game called Everquest. And since It's seems like you might have an intrest in it you can buy it at your local game shop. Back to the issue example: /bazaar search Mala and voala 10 for sell 50pp each search for malo(this is the shaman spell) big fat ZERO. Hmm sounds fair?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>glydor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Maybe someone will notice this crap and fix it. Lets face it, either you ARE extremely extremely lucky, have a ton of time to farm plat. Then again there are guild raids, and boy oh boy does my guild LOVE to drop out of bastion of thunder and take down trak or go to VP or form a grind in seb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wontonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I attended the previous fan fair in San Francisco, I went to the Dev discussion panel and trying to ask them about do they had any plan to increase the drop rate of shaman spells.  Well I never got picked in the race of raising hands.  But at the end, I walked up to the speakers and asked them the question.  Their answer was:  All the spells' drop rate had been increased, you'll see them droping more often.<br />
<br />
So I was pleased and walk away with hope in my heart.  <br />
<br />
Now, months after the fan fair, No sight of those post 58 shaman spells.  <br />
<br />
And as I said in my post, you can still live as a successful shaman even without torpor.  I for one refuse to pay the 70k pp for that one spell.  I have the money, but I rather spend them on a pair of Bracelet of Sense, or a lodiazl shield, or a pair of Glittering Ring of Judgement, or some other nice gears. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">atm 72 % are not pist but EXTREEMLY PIST. Get the freaking hint VI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jamorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I voted fair.  I'm about as un-uber as you get and I have Malo and Torpor.  I didn't pay a lot for the one I bought too (6k for Torpor).  I've seen them drop all drop.  Raid the things that drop our spells 60 spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Smokejaguar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have been playing EQ as a Shaman for almost 4 years now in what would be considered a &quot;uber&quot; guild.  I still dont have PoX.  Guess I will just wait till I get Rosrak's Greaves.  I voted fair however, because I have never wanted for spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">SoE, take a look at the above two posts please.   Notice two things, poster just above this post is in UBER guild.  Then look two posts up and notice (super) lucky shaman bought it for 6k.<br />
<br />
Mala is for sale all the time at ~50pp.  Now we both know that Malo and Torpor are about as rare as they get.  Hmm 6k is a LUCKY price ...<br />
<br />
(still) extremely pissed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jamorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">6k was the going rate back then.  It wasn't lucky.  This was just when Luclin came out.  Since then Torpor has shot up in price on my server.  It's hard to find a 60 shaman without Torpor/Malo on my server however.  Now I guess to be on a good server is 'lucky'.<br />
<br />
If you're looking for spells, raid a lot.  If some guild wants you to buff for Sev, do it.  If someone is doing the Chardok royals, go along.  Kill Gwurms, do the mobs in Seb that drop 60 shaman spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I voted that I was extremely angry about our drop rates and anyone out there who thinks this is fair obviously either isn't a shaman or is in an Uber guild that could care less what other people have to go through to get what they have.  Malo and Torpor are considered class defining spells by a large part of the shaman community, yet they are extremely difficult to get.<br />
<br />
Yes I realize it's possible to get them, and that if you have 40 hours a week to play the game and camp mobs and raid you won't have too much difficulty getting the spells.  But what about the rest of us?  I have a real life and obligations outside of this game and because of that I probly will never get Torpor or Malo.  I pay the same amount as all the other players to play this game, so how is that fair??  Even KEI drops so often that every 60 chanter can easily get it from the bazaar.  Yet out of all the shamans in my guild and our allies guilds..only 1 has Torpor and none have Malo.   So exactly how is that FAIR?  <br />
<br />
In order for it to be FAIR all the level 60 NPC drop spells from an expansion should have an equal chance of dropping.  You don't see anybody else having to shell out more than 10-15k for their rarest level 60 Kunark spells..yet the average shaman pays 50k or more each for Malo and Torpor, when they can even find them for sale.<br />
<br />
Maybe some of you need to think about your definitions of Fair if you seriously think this is fair to the bulk of the shaman community.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I am 58 with 8 AA and holding...I have completely stopped farming exp, working on exp period or even bothering to work on AA. I am working on tradeskills, faction work for Chardok (oh why oh why did I hunt at the sarnak fort in my younger days), and generally goof off while I try to figure out where in the world I am going to get the cash to plop down on Torpor (65k in Bazaar on Karana now) and Malo (100k on Karana now) &gt;OR&lt; where I am going to find the time to first level to 60, then find a guild (again) that I can live with, work with, and enjoy hunting with enough that I can eventually get the drops on a random raid or when I can drag a tank or 2 out of PoP kicking and screaming and head to Seb for a Emp camp....<br />
I dont know about you all out there in shammie land, but I find it very difficult to get anyone to leave PoP_Zone_001 cause the exp is so nice and the potential at high end loot(in some zones) is simply much better than yard trash duty in Seb or chardok.<br />
I might be the only one, but I think that PoP has done more harm than good.....they toss bones to those of us that are unguilded by making new heals and a new pet at 61, but generally leave the rest of us behind by forcing us to come up with insane amounts of time for plat farming or spell farming, then turn around and give the hybrids free access to copies of their class defning level 60 spells but /rude to Clerics, Shaman, druids, and the finger wigglers out there.<br />
Just confuses the daylights out of me.<br />
I am mad as hell and I am not going to take it anymore!</div></div><hr />
