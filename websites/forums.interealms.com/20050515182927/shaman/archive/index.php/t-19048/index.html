<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I used to post here as Osoe 2 years ago. I left to daoc I came back recently with my old acct posted on one post and my acct got bugged with Dreadstone tried to send me a pm. I tried to email Sunmoon but he probably hasnt gotten to it yet. I made this acct with my new toons name anyway so its all good.<br />
<br />
Just saying hi if anyone here remembers me all new faces though except for a couple. Anyone remember the name of the guy who played on test who was the first to document a shaman killing Yeldema with screen shots? He was like a god here back then hehe. <br />
<br />
So much has changed...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wow you lasted 2 years in Daoc</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep, great game. I like both games. Friends and family who wouldnt give up eq brought me back though. :) That and eq sent me a free acct a while back. When I made my new shaman my cousin dropped 100k on me. Which on my servers bad economy was enough for a fungi and some trinkets :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, that was Nixx Darkpaw, later Nixx the Oracle.<br />
<br />
I remember a thread where he zoned into Siren's Grotto (when hardly anyone knew how to find it) and let his pet tank a entralled ulthork or something.  I was floored at the time reading how much damage he channelled through that dog.<br />
<br />
Of course, the Yeldema solo was the sensation of the year.  Funny the people who came here and called him a liar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Welcome back to the crucible~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah I remember the SG thread he made.<br />
<br />
<br />
I remember once when I made a comment about shamans not stacking well on raids. He replied to me that If I felt useless at a raid then I probably am useless as a player or something like that and all the other shamans agreed. Now its a common rant here hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't remember anyone calling him a liar. It wasn't the first Yeldema solo and he provided screenshots in the thread he started.</div></div><hr />
