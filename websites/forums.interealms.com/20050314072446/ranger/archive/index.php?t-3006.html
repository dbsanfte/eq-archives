Thanks much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sean SpiritArrow</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 08:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its like, 75% up to 50ish, then raise a little bit till you hit 55, then it raises again till 59, then it finally is 100% at 60.<br />
<br />
Not sure on the numbers inbetween.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That came about from some SK I think parsing his new twink with an M2H convinced it gets better haste as you lvl, I think he later found low lvl haste cap = crap.<br />

I added absolutely no hard data to this thread.. just rumors and from this dog I was talking to, said his best friends, uncles, owners, kids, grandpa's, lovers, monkeys, importer's nephews, housewife, said that...  type of business... aww well. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sean SpiritArrow</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 12:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I think you're right that item haste goes up as you level, then caps at its set max for that item. Items can go up to 50% with the &quot;haste&quot; effect, but the highest one so far is 41% - which I think you need level 40 to have that much, pretty sure it works off how the spell is read in the spdat (1% + your level up and caps at 50%, which would be level 49... though no items are set that high).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seregel</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 01:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason I ask, is that if an enchanter casts Celerity on me (50% haste) and I have an FBSS on, can I exceed the 50% haste from Celerity at my current level (45)? If not, I'll swap the FBSS out for some ac.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hebuorn</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yea 75 % is the cap ...</div></div><hr />
