<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aragroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When I solo, i cast my dots then med while they are eating away at the mob.  When my dots have eaten away enough and run out, i stand up and blast the Jbb about 3-5 times.  Is my way good, or would it be better to keep applying dots and med, or root and blast with jbb the entire time?<br />
<br />
Any help would be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I pull with slow, then apply poison and start blasting.  I just stand and tank the mob.  Rooting and blasting is probably more efficient but it's too much of a pain in the ass to have to keep reapplying root and backing up every time.  Plus, I have more fun pretending to be a tank :)  Oh, I also add in my puppy sometimes.<br />
<br />
What level are you and what are you fighting?  When I first hit 45 I just rooted and blasted without bothering with slow or dots because it only took like 6-7 blasts to kill it.  At my level though, it would just take too long to root and blast them down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The only thing I do when I solo is pull with Slow and chain cast JBB while my pet chews on the mobsi back side, by doing this I am able to chain pull with no or little downtime.<br />
<br />
If I accidently pull 2 or 3 mobs I will Root and maybe throw in a Dot while I work on the other.<br />
<br />
Another thing I did with JBB at level 47-51 was just cast root and JBB in TD doing Spirocs.  Now mobs have alot more HP and I find it more effecient to just do what I stated above.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
P.S. Just got my Epic last night so things will go that much better and no need to use DoT's again unless of course I solo an uber mob. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It really depends, in my experience. I just got a JBB not too long ago myself, so I may not be the best person to answer you, but I'll try and maybe someone will come along and correct me and we'll both learn something. :) I am currently in RM fighting HGs to get enough plat to pay back a loan from a friend to get my JBB, so I'll use the HGs as an example. If I am fighting one HG, I usually pull with slow, then when I get close to where I want to fight, I root the mob, blast it with the JBB a few times until the root breaks. Then I send in the pet (if he hasn't joined in already), continuing to blast away at the mob. [Note: Tank for the doggie as much as possible. He doesn't like to get pounded on and if he gets beat on too much, he goes back to the land of puppy spirits.] If I am taking too much damage, I root the mob again and let the doggie take some hits while I get a few cheap shots in. Once root breaks, the mob is back on me, so the pet doesn't take too much damage. I still dot when I want a fight to end quickly, but it's not always necessary. Dotting is especially useful for adds, but if given the choice between slowing an add and dotting (depending on how much mana you have), slow the mob as it makes it easier to get the JBB blasts off and you or your pet don't take as much damage if still in melee range. The JBB is great for handling adds (at least so far). At 44, if I'd gotten an add in RM, I'd have had to run or ask for help if I'd been fighting a while already. At 45, with a JBB, I have been able to take two adds and still end the fight at roughly 60% health, 60% mana (admittedly, I was near full mana when the adds showed up). I do practice root/dotting sometimes, to work on the technique and to add some variety to my hunting strategy. You don't necessarily have to concentrate so much on that though, if your AC is high enough. Get down and dirty with the mob. I usually slow the mob, then tank/jbb/dot if needed and have my pet nip away at the mobs hindparts, using root to control adds or keep the mob from wandering off and bringing back friends. You'll find that at times, just blasting away with the JBB while tanking for the pet is enough. It's not uncommon for me to end a fight having only used the mana for slow and maybe one dot or a few roots. Percentage-wise, that takes about 10% of my mana. Still, if you're getting exp pretty quickly using your method, stick with it. This is what works for me, but there are lots of variables that will determine your &quot;fighting style&quot;. Experiment. See how much damage you can do while taking the least amount of damage and expending the least amount of mana. There may be more efficient methods. I would really like to hear how others incorporated the JBB into their styles also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aragroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sorry for not stating in my original post, but i am 51 and fighting seafuries in OOT.  Thanks for all the input, i think seafuries have around 5000hp, so it might take awhile to blast them down all the way.   Ill try one dot and nuking and see how that works unless you guys got some more suggestions.<br />
Thanks again for the help.</div></div><hr />

I'm hoping that the increased power of Ebolt over VoS will soften the blow of having to move to a higher level hunting spot.</div></div><hr />

LOL, I love Krakster's little JBB comments. Have you added impotence to the list of side effects?    :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Just as a side note ... one extra step to Durnitol post.<br />
<br />
1) Get some AC. 900 to start. <br />
2) Get a fungus covered scale tunic <br />
3) Get Epic <br />
4) Summon Dogdog <br />
5) Pull with slow. <br />
6) Press attack. <br />
<br />
Allow Pet Taunt to hit once ... then Pull back a step before casting Epic.   The Mob normally will focus attention on the Pet allowing a smooth cast of Epic without interuption.   The Silly cast times on Epic are so long that a single extra recast many times make it not worth the effort.<br />
<br />
7) Click epic. <br />
8) Click JBB.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If you want to know which is better, dotting + bracer or only bracer, there's an easy way to check.<br />
<br />
1.  Get a stopwatch.<br />
2.  Get to full mana and fully buffed<br />
3.  Pull a mob and kill it, timing how long it takes for you to kill it AND get back to full mana.<br />
4.  Average your times over a few kills to get a good average.<br />
5.  Pull a mob and kill it in a different method, timing how long it takes for you to kill it AND get back to full mana.<br />
6.  Average your times over a few kills to get a good average.<br />
7.  Compare average kill/med times.  Use the faster method.<br />
8.  Go to step 5 if you feel you might have a better method.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Lagger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Dont bother dotting em (unless u got free epic dot)<br />
<br />
Just pull with slow, dog and jbb till dead<br />
<br />
Dotting is just a waste of mana if u can kill the mob just using jbb, means faster pulling and quicker lvling.<br />
<br />
killing rathe giants for cash is too easy, pull with slow, run to pet, let pet tank the giant whilst u run off to pull more :) or even pull as many as u can with slow and kill em all at once, apart from the mana to cast the slows you will lose no mana and practically no health (if any) if you have regrow on.</div></div><hr />

/mourn the poor lab rats<br />
<br />
I do the same as Scurg and Lagger, pulll with slow and tank for the dog whilst chain casting JBB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">This may sound obvious, but thank the Tribunal people mention Jobarer.  I swear there was a &quot; don't bother summoning Pet&quot; just root, nuke, DOT sentiment for awhile.<br />
<br />
Jobarer soloing is awesome. If VI would ever fix pathing (LAUGH) he'd be great in an exp group too.<br />
<br />
Dog + JBB + Epic + Fungal = fun times.<br />
<br />
Does beg the question - at what level(If ever) is Jobarer useless in soloing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">At 51 I was in OOT doing seafurbies solo with out stopping between pulls and getting valuable skill increases.<br />
<br />
Pull with slow+melee 15 seconds or so (aggros Cujo on the seafurbie)+back off and JBB with autoattack turned on<br />
<br />
You will get the SF's attention sooner rather than later, but your dog should take 20% of damage (it'll be fully healed by your next pull due to NPC regen) and the auto attack might give you a skill increase once the mob is in melee or just do a few extra damage.  Cann 3-4 times during the fight and you've regained the mana you spent on slow, keep pulling till you need to rebuff yourself and/or cujo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I view our pet as a dot that does full damage while kiting the mob in a circle. Before I pull the mob, I buff the pet with SoW and Quickness. Pull the mob with Scourge and then order the pet to attack. I then start runing in a circle as the mob is chasing me and getting damaged by my pet. If I hear my pet yelp, it means the mob stopped and is attacking my pet. I then nail it with a 220+ DD to get it to chase me again. The mob usually goes down quickly and I'm at full health so I can canni mana back quickly. I did this to 20 mobs last night. Works very well.</div></div><hr />
