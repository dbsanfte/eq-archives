<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have to vent because canni3 has pissed me off since the day I got it. The fizzle rate was just way too much with alteration maxxed. I thought it would get better as I leveled but it never improved. Canni2 was never anywhere near as bad as canni3.<br />
<br />
Today I ding 58 and whooooooa babby canni4!!!! OMG, this is just simply amazing. A little slower cast time but it doesn't matter when you gain 2x the amount of mana per cast. And thankfully it's not the fizzle monster that canni3 was. It's like canni2, barely a fizzle to be seen.<br />
<br />
KEI? I don't need no stinking KEI :) I can buff the hell out of my group and canni4 down to a sliver of hp very quickly and then KM and and canni4 a bit more and then I'm ready to go.<br />
<br />
Canni4 is simply amazing. I'm really glad I held off AAing till 58. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">WOOT!! Grats on getting 58! and yeah, it's a great level. Canni4 and KM are an awesome combo. They really revitalized my game and it sounds like, yours. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Buffa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Grats Solariis. I can't wait to get Canni IV too. I hate the fizzle rate on Canni III.</div></div><hr />
