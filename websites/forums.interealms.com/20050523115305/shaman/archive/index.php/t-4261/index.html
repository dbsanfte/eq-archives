<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">well not quite 51 , but as im a few bubs away and sitting ehre meding up . i notice everything is gettign light blue and the thigns that are dark blue are just too much of a fight to be worth it. <br />
<br />
so where to go at 51 is my question . burnign woods was awesome . lots of pulls but far enough to avoid adds you you know how to back off your pet . i cant believe i have done 48-51 in 4 days when i hear others say 3 months . <br />
<br />
but anyway . where to go now is my question</div></div><hr />

Start (or finish) your epic. <br />
<br />
good idea</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">well that was simple :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Solo/duo in CoM is good xp, mobs just a few levels higher than in BW and good xp modifier on zone.<br />
<br />
Fight at the temple (turn right through main gate), the gazebo's just in front of the castle or the east side of stables. Most mobs are blue to 54/55 in these locations, and can be singled with a bit of experience once you learn pathing routes.<br />
<br />
Search for City of mist for more info ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">actualy beyond doing my epic . is there someplace i can solo like i was in BW ? that was so sweet being able to pull so fast and level so well . i realize the whole rest of the game cant be like that . but maybe there is someplace i can hit for 1 maybe 2 more levels like that ?  ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
*ps . im at CoM right now . alot of things are light blue . but your right , over by the waterfall inside they arent also the goos and the things closer to the castle . im going to be there for a while cause i need 2 more notes ( mechant , personal diary) .<br />
<br />
options are nice though :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vallya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">O'i hunted alone in the Scarlet Desert fer 51 an 52.  The fightin was good, if ye can stand the thrice cursed heat. Stay on the edge a the sand. Them reavers an revnants er more fight then they're worth if ye ask ol Vallya. Stay on speakin terms with the ugly red men, an ye can rest in their caves. Hunt fer cats, bugs, an plants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">wow , great idea . i luv luclin and i heard thats a GREAT place to hunt . well actualy i hunted there in a group at 47ish<br />
<br />
there is enough room to move around and plenty to pull and not train adds . good call mate. i just hope they are still blue ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bloodgills were still pretty good experience at 51.  There is a limit to how long I could force myself to do them, but I still popped in for some quick, safe XP grinding until 53 or so.  Helps to regain the lost XP when you eat an unres'd death in a dungeon someplace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">any more ?   i jut wa talking to my guild and they want everyone to be 55+ to hit the upcoming plane raids.<br />
<br />
well if i can do 51-54 anywhere close to as fast as i did 48-51 . i would be as gleeful as a lil schoolbear ;)</div></div><hr />

Solo/duo in CoM is good xp, mobs just a few levels higher than in BW and good xp modifier on zone.<br />
<br />
Burning Woods has an xp modifier??  Cool..didnt know that :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ginslunger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I second the City of Mist idea.  I love that place.<br />
<br />
Cobalt Scar is a place you might want to check out.  I did a lot of soloing there from 49 to 53 right when Velious came out.  I've heard that it's over run by quad kiters now though.<br />
<br />
I'm soloing my 54 cleric right now in The Grey root/dotting undead.  All are dark blue cons to 54.  Not so sure about at 51.  <br />
<br />
Maiden's Eye might also be worth a look although I have better luck in groups there than I do soloing.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">awesome suggestion , im bookmarking this thread . anymore ? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Try Hole entrance. Not too shabby, and you might pick up some Iron Oxides and Mercuries. FE02's sell for 400 pp on Xev, maybe a little less now since the hub bub over the PoTC earring seems to have died down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">isnt the hole a lil rough ? i mean the entrance is like what  .. 8 elementals that are fairly high MR ?<br />
<br />
i havent been there in a while , i might be wrong</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hole entrance is doable, but a single bad pull can make things ugly real fast.  The trick (in my experience) is to learn the pathing, and run at the first sign of trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>extra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Neriak 3rd gate :)  Two necromancers, a wizard, and a guard.  Great experience at 51, my mage did 51-54 there.  (at 55 they turn light blue)...<br />
<br />
If you dont care about faction, that is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The Hole entrance isn't bad, in my experience. I solod there on and off from level 50 ish, if I remember right. There are 6 elementals near the entrance, and usually I could single pull them with malosi (or whatever), then slow, send in the pet, and start poking. I didn't have my epic or JBB at the time either. If you get a double pull and you can't handle it, just swim to the zone.<br />
<br />
I'd rather do the Hole than Maiden's Eye at level 51 - ME is dangerous and people are always training bad mobs onto you if you're anywhere near a zone line. However if you can find a safe spot, it's not too bad.<br />
<br />
Mind you if you are just grinding to 55 because your guild told you to, maybe bloodgils are the best ...</div></div><hr />
