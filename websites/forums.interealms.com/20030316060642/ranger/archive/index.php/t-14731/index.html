<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Duddlee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I got there just today and I hear it is good xp.  ANd from what I could tell it is.  Just a bit laggy.  Well anyways I now believe this zone is just one giant bug!  I check track and a heretic invader shows up.  I got plenty of hp's and enough mana to snare and get the job done.  So I snare and I pull to my pull spot.  Well for some reason he is still beating me from behind.  I check using F9 and he isn't even around!!!<br />

*** is up with this zone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brannuer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've had that happen in other zones too. Most typically, there is a big lag spike as you're moving. Your screen shows you moving away and gaining distance, but the server doesn't get that info, so to it, you're stil standing there. Kinda like *almost* going LD.  Once I watched 2 mobs beat on me from 100's of yards away and kill me. As I died I noticed my lag bar was very yellow/red.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Benemyjosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Try logging out and logging back in.  That helps me sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>nekoken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Stonebrunt is buggy as heck.  Mobs are always disappearing when you are pulling or teleporting around due to weird geometry issues.  The pathing is just odd here.  You'd think it was a dungeon it is so poor.  In spite of that though it is still a fun zone to hunt in as long as you have SoW, snare, and root to control the adds you are sure to get.</div></div><hr />
