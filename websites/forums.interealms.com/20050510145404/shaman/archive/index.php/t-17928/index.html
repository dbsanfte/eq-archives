<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caelum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've gotten the two big goals for AA out of the way, and now am wondering what to go with next.  Anyways, here is what I have so far:<br />
<br />
Run 3<br />
Metab 3<br />
MC 3<br />
Canni 5<br />
MGB<br />
<br />
Now I figured it would be a good idea to get RC 1 at least, and liked it so much I am currently in the midst of getting to RC 3, real useful AA there.<br />
<br />
So I guess after RC, I am thinking along the lines of:<br />
<br />
<br />
SCR 3<br />
SCRM (Really hate the short duration times on shaman buffs, especially since FA is so damn popular)<br />
ND 3<br />
QB 3(3 second Qui)<br />
CA 3<br />
LR 5<br />
SCM 3<br />
VP 3<br />
SC 1<br />
<br />
Does this look good?  Any suggestions I missed?  Would a different order be better?  Still kind of new to the AA game so any advice would be appreciated.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>JuyshinRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">SCR3<br />
SCRM<br />
ND3<br />
SCM3<br />
<br />
would be the next skills i would go for .. the order you want to do them in is personal preferance really, i did ND3 first after cannibilize and then SCR3, SCM3, SCRM... first levels of VP and Spirit Call are also useful and entertaining, but i haven't gone further with them .. manafree root and pets in an emergency are always nice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gobblok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Whow metab3 ?<br />
<br />
Your the first ever i see not taking IR3 and RS3 as first AAs.<br />
<br />
Personally i wouldnt do RC3 untill you can reach at least ep. I stopped with RC2, wich takes off all effects i know so far. <br />
If you are a soloing shm throw in supsend minion 2. Its definatly worth the 6 points.<br />
And for the fun i did scf1 and HA1, just to count my crits on raids and being not that bored ;=)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">LR5 is huge. I got that even before ND3 since being missed more is even better than having more HP.<br />
<br />
SCM3 will save you mana. And its clearly noticable.<br />
<br />
And get VP1 ASAP. It lets you toss mobs out of your face that are beating on you. Then gives you time to slow them. VP3 is nice, but for the money, VP1 cant be beat.<br />
<br />
I think you've got a pretty good list there, but do things as you want to. There is no real wrong way to get your AA's.<br />
<br />
I also like Spirit Call lots. I took it to SC3 just for the fun factor, which is mainly what it is. The pets dont do lots of dmg, but they do interrupt casters alot and allow you to push a mob if you stack them all up in one place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">SCM3 <br />
VP3<br />
LR5<br />
<br />
in that order would be my route</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Scm3<br />
Nd3<br />
Vp3<br />
Lr5<br />
Qb3<br />
Scr2<br />
Lr5<br />
Scrm<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was thinking about getting SCR/M after i got Can5/MGB, but now im tempted to go take CA3 and LR 5...<br />
<br />
Some like to take Spirit Call and VP first also....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you are doing lots of LDoN get RC3 asap. I pretty much use that skill at least 5 times per adventure. Tanks getting slowed, traps on chests going off, tashses to be cleared. Sure you could argue 'use pureblood', but really, I have better things to do and spells to have memmed than pureblood. One quick cast of RC and all the bad is gone. <br />
<br />
Plus RC can get rid of any curse ****ers which PB can't do.<br />
<br />
I love VP in LDoN to help with CC and since I pull most of the time it is really handy in spacing out mobs or pulling mobs off walls. Can't tell you how many times pet poofs attacking a mob that has gotten pushed into a wall. VP puts it back in the center ready for me to loot it.<br />
<br />
Spirit Call to me is a godsend when I play in my 4 man group (Druid, Shaman, Warrior, and Beastlord). We can waste up to 3 min with cleric mobs because they keep CHing themselves, but if SC is up there is hardly a chance that he will be able to channel through 5 mutts + dogdog.<br />
<br />
I am one of those oddball shamans that haven't even worked on archetype beyond MC3. I will get to it someday, but I am having way too much fun with PoP AAs. I guess ND will be my first AA when i get around to archetype.<br />
<br />
No wait, get Quick Buff 3 before RC. 3 sec torpor/quiesence makes you a healing god in LDoN and other places. Then RC. Yeah, I like how that looks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What's your unbuffed hps?  If you're not around 2200 - 2500 hps unbuffed at least I'd go with nd3 next to give you a bit of extra padding on canni 5.  It's very nice to not have to worry about low hps aggro when canning.<br />
<br />
I'd probably recomend vp1 next.  It took me forever to break down and get it but if you're a shammy who root parks for CC it's a definate must have.<br />
<br />
Definately scr/m after this.  Not only does it help with FA but less buffing all around, and it makes Q do a ton more healing.  For Q alone it's well worth it and very underestimated in some circles imo.<br />
<br />
If you have or have acess to a haste of mithanial or some other spell haste I'd go with QB2 next, otherwise QB3.  But for 9 AA's it's probably better to get that range slot haste of mithanial item than to get QB3.  Personally I'm edging up on 200 AA's and still don't have QB3 and probably won't get it till around 300 or more.<br />
<br />
At this point, I'd take a look around and see what you need most.  Do you seem to have mana trouble at all/a lot or do you end up dying with fm or close to it a lot?  If you're having any sort of mana problems get scm3 it's definately a help, though not hugely noticable.  Otherwise, get CA 3 first, then think about the question again before you decide between LR5 and scm3.<br />
<br />
I'd get vp 3 at this point.  I don't have it yet but it's next on my list to get because aparently the knockback is a lot better and being able to keep a mob perma rooted while soloing is gonna be really nice too.  (If you do a ton of soloing I'd recomend you getting vp up to level 3 a lot earlier).<br />
<br />
I don't have sc yet so can't say a ton about it, but it seems to be situational at best, and more of a fun toy than anything really useful.  I'd personally recomend hg3, ha3, ahg3, aha3 at this point first, especially if you raid being able to toss out some real heals is pretty nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I agree with alot of what tudani said.<br />
<br />
As far as RC goes I'd stop at 2 if that where your currently at. RC 3 doesn't really add much in the way of poison disease or curse counters cured. Most useful thing it does add is more chances to cure detrimental items.<br />
<br />
I'd also say stop at qb2. Odds are if you don't have a haste item now you will likely get one in the future. Since a benificial haste item or a regular haste item also effects other spells too so it's not like having the aa's negates the need for either.<br />
<br />
VP3 is nice but just getting the first level is handy for having the knock back and the always memed aa root. I'd definitely put the first level of the aa up higher altho waiting off before you get all three isn't bad if you aren't a big soloer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">same position you are in, I did (and wouldnt change):<br />
scr3/scrm<br />
rc1<br />
quickbuff1 (to finish elder title)<br />
scm3<br />
nd3<br />
vp1<br />
spirit call1<br />
ca3<br />
currently at lr3, working to finish lr5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">To me AA path depends alot on what kind of shaman you are. Mainly raiding/groupin  vs soloing alters the path in my opinion.<br />
If you raid the healing AAs and SCRM line are more important<br />
If you solo the defensive AAs and VP line take more meaning<br />
ND is always great to have. Spirit Call is ok but I really wish I had those 4 points back now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Swiftfisted</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I did:<br />
<br />
RC1<br />
SCR3/SCRM<br />
Quick Buff (elder title)<br />
VP1<br />
<br />
The extended buffs are godly, don't underestimate it.  Also, VP1 has been a life saver in many situations, I would get that ASAP as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I would go<br />
RC1<br />
LR5<br />
SCM<br />
ND3<br />
SCR/m<br />
<br />
What you need to consider is if you get hit often.. if you are just grinding then you can set aside lr5 and get scm and scr/m instead because SCM is just HUGE mana save wise.. Also if your hps is not comfortably high for you to use canni v then nd3 is priority..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">After Cann5, I'll vote for getting level one in SC, VP and RC before going for any of the archetype AAs. Getting all 3 is cheaper than the 12AAs you need just to max out one of your Arch skills and a helluva lot more useful. <br />
<br />
After that; SCM3, SCRM, QB2, ND3, LR5, MGB in no particular order. Which to take first is gonna depend on your play style more than anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Glaknuka Darkrage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Dunno about blue servers but on PvP servers QB3 is very useful as it reduces the time it takes to cast Quiescence and also SCRM lengthens the duration of Quiescence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If I had to do them over again, I'd first spend points on skills that add new functionality - VP1, RC1, SC1.  Each is useful, cheap, and hell it's funner to summon multiple dogs at once or send a mob or gnome flying than gaining 10 percent duration to your buffs would be.<br />
<br />
Yes funner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Get one level each of <br />
Virulent Paralysis<br />
Spirit Call<br />
Radient Cure<br />
each of these AA's adds to the things you can do at a moments notice and each one is an instant 'new' thing that increases your power significantly.  SC and VP are fun effects to see happen :)<br />
<br />
If I was doing it all again, I think I would go for Combat Agility/Lightning Reflexes before others.  A single miss per fight from a mob hitting for 500+ is more HP that any ammount of A will get you, and with CA/LR you get a lot of misses.  Live Shaman  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dead Shaman in all circumstances.<br />
<br />
With CanniV, you've done some mana production AA's, so I'd wait on getting SCM for a while and get something different.  <br />
<br />
Focus on our core competency spell that can be affected by AA; torpor/quiesence.  Up it's duration and reduce it's casting time (SCRM and QB).  <br />
The upped duration of buffs = reduced mana expenditure over time, especially as you will be casting Quiesence a lot - I know I do.  9AA's getting +25% extension on Quiesence = a spell that is 25% more mana effective - the increased mana effectiveness from the same AA's SCM is about 10%-12%.  The extended duration of buffs that are annoying to cast is a massive boost to our power and a great reducer of tedious buffing (Haste, FA, Quiesence, Replenishment)<br />
I know SCM affects all spells you cast, but it felt to me that getting SCR gave me the same boost in mana capabilities as SCM gave.  Going to SCRM from SCR was equally totally worthwhile.  <br />
<br />
<br />
RC1<br />
SC1<br />
VP1<br />
CA3<br />
LR5<br />
SCR<br />
SCRM</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I agree with the others on getting first level of RC, VP and SC.  I have them and their utility is great for the AA expense.<br />
<br />
Next I've decided to do QB1 and 2.  Having Q cut in half for cast time allows you to do a lot of other things, including Cann so that you're essentially regaining mana similar to that saved from SCM with extra benefits.<br />
<br />
Not sure where to go from there.  So many great avenues to choose from.  Either SCM, LR, SCRM, or ND, I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">run3<br />
regen3<br />
mc3<br />
canni5<br />
sm2<br />
<br />
i'm almost exited about sm2 as i am canni5, well not quite, but yea.<br />
<br />
everything else past sm2 is just a blur to me at the moment :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">after run3, regen3, mc3, canni 5... I got:<br />
<br />
- MGB (for raids and for buffing folks in PoK, etc... love it.... plus it feels good to &quot;have it out of the way&quot;)<br />
- I currently have SCR2, working on 3, and then I'll get SCRM.<br />
<br />
After that I'll go for:<br />
- Quick Buff 1 (for Elder title)<br />
- SCM3 (I love mana preservation)<br />
- SC1<br />
- VP1<br />
- (maybe RC1)<br />
<br />
Then I'm going defensive/evasive AAs:<br />
- ND3<br />
- LR5<br />
- CA3<br />
- CS3<br />
- Innate Defense3<br />
<br />
Then crits:<br />
- SCF3<br />
- FoM<br />
<br />
Then I'm going for healing enhancements:<br />
- Healing Adept<br />
- Healing Gift<br />
- Channeling Focus<br />
- Advanced Healing Adept<br />
- Advanced Healing Gift<br />
<br />
Then I'll go back and finish up the PoP Abilities that are started but unfinished:<br />
- SC3<br />
- VP3<br />
- RC3<br />
- QB3<br />
<br />
At that point, I'd be fairly happy, and anything else is just icing.  I'll prob work on resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I notice that most of you take CA3/LR5 but not CS3/ID5, or at very least CS3. As someone who plays both a warrior and a shaman I think you are nuts. You get a much bigger bang for the buck from CS3 than you do for LR5, yet it takes 3aaxp less. Now, I know that you are thinking it is better to be missed than hit for less, and that might well be true for things that hit for 1000 or more, but I expect that the vast majority of shaman usually fight things that hit for much less. In LDoN for example most people are fighting stuff that hits for 100-300 in general, and with ~5khp buffed (which most self respecting shaman should be able to achieve) and for hits like that CS3 is much more usefull than ID5.<br />
<br />
If you are getting hit a lot (which shaman are), survivability &gt;&gt;&gt; everything else. Other than certain basic essentials such as canni5, mgb and rc, screw everything else and do your defensive skills first. I would suggest CA3/CS3/ND3, followed by ID5/LR5. After that you can work on the fluffy stuff.</div></div><hr />
