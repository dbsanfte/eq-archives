<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Best Buy, Media Play, and Walmart in Cincinnati area don't have them yet.  Each of those stores are at most 5 mins from me so I just drove over to check, but EB is about a 35 min drive from me so I just said screw it and downloaded one copy for my main account.  Might buy the boxed for my alt account when the other stores get them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I let my fingers do the walking, and I'm glad I did.<br />
EB was sold out 'in 30 seconds'.<br />
EBx had none, and no clue about the game.<br />
Gamestop had 2 copies on 'reserve', which they wouldn't release for sale.<br />
Gamestop x2 had none, and were also clueless.<br />
Best Buy had none in stock.<br />
Neither did BJ's.<br />
/cry<br />
<br />
Not paying 10 bucks extra for 24hr shipping, so I'll reserve a copy tomorrow I guess.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rekcim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Why not just buy it online??</div></div><hr />

I want the in game reward.  I also like to have the CD's.  Easier in case I need to reinstall, and I just like having something tangible for my dollar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I paid the 10 bucks extra for 24 hour shipping.  I will be in school/at work tomorrow from 9 am til 10 pm so I won't even get to LOOK for one.<br />
I must remember EBGames for the next expansion, I guess.  I hear WalMart sometimes has them when no one else does but I just don't have time to go all over town looking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Got mine at Babbages of Cross Creek Mall in Fayetteville, NC. Home of the 82 Airborne.</div></div><hr />

Went to the new zone Natimbi and the &quot;new race&quot; NPCs (Taelosian I guess) in the wayfarers camp are affected by the staff faction modifier. With the staff in my range slot I went from apprehensive to kindly. Still not sure what the actual faction name is though as the zone was wicked crowded and I was lagging pretty bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It modifies slave faction in Riwwi, for one.  Dubious w/out staff to amiable with staff.  Still couldn't talk to them.   :p   Haven't been to the other zones yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">hehe the CD is only 212megs, light load</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Gamestop was where I bought mine, btw. First copy out of the box, and I think it was the only one that wasn't reserved.<br />
<br />
Lucky me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Gamestop had mine.  (Colerain Ave in Cincinnati, across from Northgate Mall).  There were at least a few others on the shelf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Media Play in Charlotte, NC had them on 2/10.  Didn't have them till around 11am though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The big advantage to buying at a store is that when someone has it on sale (and someone always will) you can go back and get your $10 or whatever back if you bought it at EBgames or Fry's or someplace with a price garuntee. Ended up getting like $40 back on the 3 copies of PoP I bought when someone was selling it for $12.99 two weeks after launch.</div></div><hr />
