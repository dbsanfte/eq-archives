<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Pets no longer poof when zoning? WOW! Looking forward to discovering new stuff since I quit back in March.<br />
<br />
Speaking of that...I deleted all of my toons back in March, then mid May I sent email via the &quot;email server GM&quot; page on SOE's site asking for a restore (before we decided to give CoH a try). I resub'd one account to see if they ever did it, but I never recevied any email or any other type of acknowledgement through mid June, and no character ever showed back up on the account, so I thought it was over and done with. <br />
<br />
Then...<br />
<br />
Last week the wife and I became bored with the lack of depth in CoH and decided to give EQ a try again, only THIS time we were going to start over on a new server and play &quot;from scratch&quot;. Well, for shiznits-N-griznits I decided to log into Veeshan to see if any old friends were on so I could let them know we were playing again. Low and behold, Valgoth had been restored. My wife logged into Veeshan and found her old Rogue restored. Then, just to check, she re-sub'd the account with her 55 Druid and found SHE had been restored. Well...looks like all of the toons I requested a restore for were, in fact, restored. Re-sub'd the account with my Warrior &amp; Monk. Yup, both there. Will resub the account with my Cleric sometime tonight or tomorrow (once I get the vidcard back in my other machine).<br />
<br />
On a side note, we're still playing lowbies. I started a human Wizard (found I really liked playing a blaster type in CoH) and the wife started a High Elf Enchanter (she played a controller in CoH). Even the low level game is a blast again.<br />
<br />
So, I'm back, yet again. Though I wish WoW would hurry up and come out and save me from this seeming endless cycle. :)</div></div><hr />

Grats on finding the fun again. I've been dinking around on Rallos, myself, spooking in the old zones (A level 26 necro can pwn Warslik's woods, even IF his dress has been stolen from him!). Mostly it's been reminding me how much I like Blue servers. By the time i'm done getting that goober killed, I'll be ready to grind Gandwer to 65 and my Beastlord to 60!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You lasted about 6 months; well done :)  Thats about the usual time frame before people decide to &quot;give it one more chance&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Glad to see you back.</div></div><hr />
