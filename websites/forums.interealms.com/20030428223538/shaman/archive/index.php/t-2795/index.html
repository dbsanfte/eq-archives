<br />
<br />
Black Lace Boned Armor ? Beastlord Barbarians.  Tribunal ONLY<br />
<br />
Wristguard ? AC 9, Wis 5, HP 30, mana 30, 5 to all saves		Price 10,000 plat<br />
<br />
Other items can be made, but stats for them have not yet been reported.  If you are a beastlord Barbarian, consider the supply quest below.  <br />
<br />
All items above are made after you order them, unless you get lucky and I have got one lying around.  <br />
<br />
I offer a discount from the above prices for each blue diamond you bring me.  <br />
<br />
Trade Supply Quest<br />
<br />
In lieu of the cash amounts outlined above, I will accept trade skill supplies in the quantities outlined below. <br />
<br />
<br />
For all pieces except Leggings, Tunics, and Cloaks, the deal is this.  You bring me 4 times the trade skill supplies I need to make the item.  We group.  You get 3 attempts at your armour piece.  Regardless of success or failure, I keep the supplies for the fourth attempt as my fee.  If  I succeed on the first combine, I retain all of the remaining supplies as my fee.  If I succeed on the second combine, I retain all of the remaining supplies as my fee.  If I succeed on the third combine, I retain the supplies for the fourth attempt as my fee.  If I fail on the first 3 combines, I still retain the supplies for the fourth attempt as my fee.  <br />
<br />
Chances are I will succeed within your three attempts.  When I smith my wisdom is over 255 and my strength is also over 255.  My current skill is 242, but is raised to 254 with the Geerlock smithing hammer.  255 is the highest smithing skill you can reach with the geerlock hammer.  250 is the highest skill you can reach without the hammer.  According to EQ Traders, folks are succeeding 33% to 50% on these combines.  <br />
<br />
Trade Supplies:<br />
<br />
Helanic Tundra Armour:<br />
<br />
Veil, collar, bracers, and boots:  (Total needed for 4)<br />
<br />
4 blue diamonds, 4 leather paddings, 4 frost tempers, 4 Celestial Essences, 2 Large Bricks of Velium, 4 Coldain Velium Tempers, 6 Large Bricks Medium Quality Ore, 4 Imbued Ivories, 4 molds (sold in Halas).<br />
<br />
Helm, Pauldron, Girdle, Sleeves, Gloves:  (Total needed for 4 attempts)<br />
<br />
8 blue diamonds, 4 leather paddings, 4 frost tempers, 8 Celestial Essences, 4 Large Bricks of Velium, 8 Coldain Velium Tempers, 8 Large Bricks MQ Ore, 4 Imbued Ivories (4 molds).<br />
<br />
Large Bricks of Medium Quality Ore are sold by venders, but not in all cities.  Closest city to Halas selling MQ ore is Qeynos.<br />
<br />
Large Bricks of Velium drop off of various mobs in Velious.  3 small bricks can be combined to produce one large brick.  For every 3 small bricks you bring in lieu of a large brick, add one Coldain Velium Temper.  <br />
<br />
Coldain Velium Tempers are sold by dwarfs in Thurgadin.  My price (max ally with 126 Charisma) is just under 27 plat per temper.  <br />
<br />
Frost tempers and celestial essences are player created items.  Each frost temper requires brewing 2 essence of winter, one ice goblin blood, and one brandy (triv 135).  Each celestial essence requires combining celestial solvent (sold in SH) and a spell research component in a mortar and pestle (no fail combine).  Ivory is a drop only gem that must be imbued by a tribunal-worshipping shaman.  I will provide all of the frost tempers, celestial essence, and imbued ivory needed for your 4 supply sets (3 for your attempts, 1 for my fee) for an additional fee of one blue diamond.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Helanic Tundra Breast Plate, Cloak, and Leggings:<br />
<br />
For Leggings, Tunics/Breastplates, and Cloaks the deal is this.  You bring me 6 times the trade skill supplies I need to make the item.  We group.  You get 4 attempts at your armour piece.  Regardless of success or failure, I keep the supplies for the fifth and sixth attempts as my fee.  If  I succeed on the first combine, I retain all of the remaining supplies as my fee.  If I succeed on the second combine, I retain all of the remaining supplies as my fee.  If I succeed on the third combine, I retain all of the remaining supplies as my fee.  If I succeed on the fourth combine, I retain the supplies for the 5th and 6th combine as my fee.   If I fail on the first 4 combines, I still retain the supplies for the fifth and sixth attempts as my fee.    <br />
<br />
I am asking for 6 sets of supplies to maximize your chances of getting your breastplate, leggings, or cloak.  These items have a higher triv, so failures are more likely.  The success rate is still reported at around 33%, so chances are reasonable that I will succeed within your four attempts.  When I smith my wisdom is over 255 and my strength is also over 255.  My current skill is 242, but is raised to 254 with the Geerlock smithing hammer.  255 is the highest smithing skill you can reach with the geerlock hammer.  250 is the highest skill you can reach without the hammer.  <br />
<br />
<br />
For Helanic Tundra Breast Plates, Cloaks, and Leggings, you will need to provide me with the following for 6 possible attempts (4 yours, 2 mine):<br />
<br />
18 Blue Diamonds, 6 Leather Padding, 6 Frost Tempers, 18 Celestial Essences, 9 Large Bricks Velium, 18 Coldain Velium Tempers, 15 Large Bricks Medium Quality Ore, 6 Imbued Ivories, 6 molds.<br />
<br />
Frost tempers and celestial essences are player created items.  Each frost temper requires brewing 2 essence of winter, one ice goblin blood, and one brandy (triv 135).  Each celestial essence requires combining celestial solvent (sold in SH) and a spell research component in a mortar and pestle (no fail combine).  Ivory is a drop only gem that must be imbued by a tribunal-worshipping shaman.  I will provide all of the frost tempers, celestial essence, and imbued ivory needed for your 6 supply sets (4 for your attempts, 2 for my fee) for an additional fee of one blue diamond. <br />
<br />
For the Artificer's Ringmail, the deal is the same as for the Helanic Tundra armour.  Substitute an appropriate piece of large patchwork/tattered armour for each leather padding.  (Patchwork/tattered has to match the piece being made ? bracer for bracer, veil for veil, etc.)  Substitute the appropriate large chainmail pattern for the mold.  <br />
For Black Lace-boned armour (stats not known for most pieces) the deal is the same for all pieces, except that boots are treated the same as tunics, leggings, and cloaks.  Boots require 3 infused bonings.    <br />
<br />
Substitute an appropriate piece of large patchwork/tattered armour for each leather padding.  (Patchwork/tattered has to match the piece being made ? bracer for bracer, veil for veil, etc.)  Substitute the appropriate large chainmail pattern for the mold.  The good news is that you substitute small bricks of velium for the large bricks.  The bad news is that you must double the number of bricks, as each only yields one boning.  Substitute small bricks of medium quality ore for the large bricks used in the Helanic Tundra recipes.<br />
<br />
All final combines must be done at the Northman forge in Halas.<br />
