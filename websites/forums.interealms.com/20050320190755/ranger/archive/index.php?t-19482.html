<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elladan</div><div class="date">02-28-2003, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought I would write up a small guide on how to use the new cartography system based off of what I've found using it over the past couple of days to map some of the new LoY zones (I currently have Gunthak and Dulak's finished).  At first, I was using my Ranger (57) to do the mapping using Camo.  This worked out fairly well, except for a few times when it dropped in some rather congested areas.  And if you've been in LoY, you know what this can mean I'm sure.  It then dawned on me that maybe my 25 Rogue would be better suited for this task.  Stripped him bare (in case I died during my expeditions), and used Hide/Sneak to do my mapping.<br />
<br />
Let me first explain how the maps are stored, since knowing this will make things a little clearer I think.  The maps are stored as text files (under the maps directory where you installed EQ, and named zone_1, zone_2, and zone_3.  The 1, 2, and 3 refer to the layer of the map) using /loc's and a few other fields to describe the various attributes assigned to the object.  Lines (designated by an L in the first column) are stored as a start point and an end point followed by a color.  Labels are stored as points (designated by a P in the first column), and include the text, color, and size of the Label.  Because of the use of /loc, you actually end up with a 3D map of sorts of what you draw since it stores the Z as well as X and Y axis. Hence, how the Height Filter works; based off of the Z axis.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------<br />
Basics of the Cartography window<br />
<br />
The left side of this window is obviously the map.  For those of you that have a wheel on your mouse, the wheel can be used to zoom in/out on the map.  It will zoom in to what the center of the map currently is, and can at times be kind of hard to use. When zooming out, however, I am not sure where it zooms to, though I often have to use the centering button to be able to see any part of the map.  You can also click and drag on the map to move the map around.  To the right is a toolbar. <br />
<br />
At the top of the toolbar is a small arrow pad.  Clicking on any of these arrows will scroll the map in the indicated direction. However, this has to be clicked each time you want to scroll, and can be very annoying, and it is easier to drag your map to where you want to see.  If you click in the middle of the buttons, the map centers on you.  Below this are two buttons to allow you to zoom in/out on your map.  <br />
<br />
Next are your visible layers.  Each map has four visible layers. Base, 1, 2, and 3.  Base is provided by SoE.  Layers 1, 2, and 3 are player created layers. Each layer can be turned on/off as needed.  <br />
<br />
After this is that Active layer buttons.  These are labeled 1, 2, 3, and indicates which layer is currently active in regards to what editing functions are used.  You may only have one active layer at a time.  <br />
<br />
Next is the Labels button.  This allows you to toggle the visibility of the labels on the map.<br />
<br />
Below this is a button for your Height Filter.  Having this turned on, you only see those portions of the Visible layers that are within a given height as your current /loc.  This filter can be defined by the user using the two text boxes below the button itself (both default to 10).  Turning this filter off allows you to see the entire zone regardless of height.  Normally this is what you would use for travel, the exception being zones where  you have multiple layers over the same X, Y axis (like you would see in Crystal Caverns main shaft).  At the very bottom on the right hand side you will see a small compass icon.  Clicking here will bring up the Map Toolbox.<br />
<br />
The Map Toolbox is what enables you to create your own maps, lay out routes to your favorite watering hole or camp, or to add special points of interest (quest NPCs, spawn point of the Orc Shovel, ...)<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
Getting to Know the Map Toolbox<br />
<br />
First, we will cover the first three buttons.  These buttons will allow you to draw straight lines on your map.  The first button, Start Line, sets the beginning point of your line.  Once you click this, you will not see anything happen to your map until you click one of the next two buttons.  The next button sets the end point of your line.  Once you click this, you will have to click Start Line again to begin drawing a new line.  If, however, you only wish to draw a line to your current position without ending the function, you use the next button, Add Point.  This sets the end point of your current line, and the start point of your next line.  By using this, you can easily draw a route on your map ... say you want to map the route taken by the dwarf for the second ring.  You just press start after turning in the axe, then whenever he stops (at the bottom of the hill, various points between spots), or changes direction (giant fort, jail, orc fort), you simply press the Add Point, and the progress is marked up to that point.  Once he goes full circle, and comes back to where he started, simply press End Line.  This would have a distinct advantage over Auto Map since you may get way-laid or side tracked hunting down some fierce creature that would otherwise eat the dwarf, you won't have errant lines all over your map.<br />
<br />
Next is the Remove Line button.  This is used to remove a line from your map.  Please note two things.  Once a line is removed, it must be re-drawn in order to put it back on the map.  Second, you can not select a small section of the line, it is all or nothing. To do this, simply place your cursor over the line and click on it (sometimes, it takes a number of clicks, and even then you might not get it.  Sometimes you have to just delete portions around that line before being able to get all of it.  You will normally see this when selecting lines created by the Auto Map feature) and it will be highlighted in yellow.  Multiple lines can be selected for any function pertaining to lines.  After you have the section(s) selected, press the button and it will disappear.<br />
<br />
Set Line Color allows you to do just that, set the color of the currently selected section(s) of a line.<br />
<br />
Join at Intersect can be a useful tool, more so if you are doing Auto Mapping.  Lets say I am following a zone line, and I bump into some big ugly troll and I can't squeeze between him and the wall, and have to go around him.  I can either a) map a bump into the wall where the troll is, or I can stop Auto Mapping, move to the other side of the troll, and then begin mapping again for a short distance.  After this, you select two segments (the ones before and after the troll), then select Join at Intersect, and it will complete the line for you.  Be warned, however, that I have seen this do some odd things at time.  I've seen it draw past one the end of one line to another, and I've seen it do the intersect at an odd point as well.  I have also received a message stating that the points were too far apart to be intersected.  But, for short distances as this (and this is the only use I've see for it), it should work fine.<br />
<br />
Auto Map.  Auto Map is what I've been using heavily to map.  What it does is creates a line behind you, writing to the map file every time you change directions.  Looking back, I could have done my mapping with Start Line and End Line, but it is easier to just hit Auto Map and just follow the walls without having to hit Set Point at every nook and cranny.  You can also use it to trace a route that you are taking if you want, or to simply make stick maps as I was doing at one point.  (Take the mines for example.  At first, I wasn't mapping the walls, I just turned on Auto Map and ran down the center of each tunnel.  Crude, but effective.)  It also has a (very) limited function as an eraser.  If you walk backwards over the line (precisely) that you just drew, it will erase the line.  Normally, however, unless this is a straight line as you run across one of the Karanas or some such, this can not be done.<br />
<br />
Add Label allows you to add a point of interest to your map.  Clicking on this button brings up a separate window with a variety of options that can be set.  Text, color, and size actually.  Text is what you want the label to read.  Color allows you to choose<br />
the color of the label (say you want to make the banker stand out from the merchants, you can make a label for him and color it red).  The default color is black for all labels.<br />
<br />
Edit Label allows you to edit your currently selected label, and brings up the same box as does Add Label.<br />
<br />
Move Label to Me allows you to move the currently selected label to your current location.  Useful if you've mis-labeled a location.  <br />
<br />
Remove Label allows you to get rid of the currently selected label.  Useful if you've mis labeled something (example, I thought that Hate's Fury was behind this big door at the bottom of Daluk's Harbor, and labeled it as such before using the door (so that I didn't have to go back and re-map it).  But, since we know now that the zones aren't connected ... you can see where I would have a use for this button.<br />
<br />
Set Current Line Color.  This refers to the color of the line that is created using the Start/End Line or Auto Map function, and simply allows you to change the color of the line.  Please note that if you are running in a straight line and then decide to change the color of the line, you will either need to do a small dodge to the side, or turn off Auto Map.  Otherwise, it thinks you are still drawing that line, and will color the entire line since you turned on Auto Map, or the last time you turned.  The default color for Auto Map is black.<br />
<br />
Clear Current Map blanks out ALL of your layers (though I'm currently unsure of the Base map.  I don't think that it does, but don't really want to test that theory.  I'll probably try it sometime in Felwithe South since it is a small zone and easily re-mapped if need be). Again, there is a pop up confirmation box here.<br />
<br />
Clear Current Layer allows you to blank your currently active layer, erasing everything that is stored in the map file.  So, before doing this, you should ensure that you have the correct active layer.  There is a conformation box that pops up, which has saved me from a few mis-clicks (why did they put it so close to my Set Current Line Color Button?)<br />
<br />
Save Current Map ... 'Nuff said.<br />
<br />
------------------------<br />
Tips and pointers<br />
<br />
As I said, I started out with Elladan, but decided to stop doing that after Camo dropped in a few, less than desirable places, so I had to either train, Root/Camo/Camp, or die (that one hurt).  So, I got my Rogue to do the job.  A little slower since he doesn't have SoW, and has to Sneak everywhere, but it is by far safer to have a Rogue do it than any other class.  So far at 25, I have been able to map Gulf of Gunthak, Dulak's Harbor, and part of Torgian Mines.  So, ifyou plan on doing any extensive mapping, I'd suggest a Rogue since their Hide/Sneak works very well (just move off to a blank Hotbox so you don't accidentally reveal yourself at a bad moment), and works against both the living and undead.<br />
<br />
Don't play hero.  If your invis begins to drop, don't try to map out the rest of the building (one of the small shacks in the caves in Gunthak in my case), don't worry about drawing a line to a safe spot to re-inivs (it can be removed after all), just get to a safe spot.  I tried to play the hero and ended up with 4-5 greens (and in Gunthak, they aren't green by much), and it was just too many to Root/Camp out, and I don't train anybody unless I know I'm really close to the zone.  In the end, I got a free trip to PoK out of it ...  Just remember, don't play the hero.  (Of course, if you take a Rogue, this will be less of an issue.)<br />
<br />
Beware of questionable scenery.  Twice with my Rogue, I've become stuck some place that I didn't want to be, and couldn't get out.  Ended up dropping Hide/Sneak and getting killed.  If it looks like you may get stuck, map around it.  (Boy, I sure do miss the /stuck command from DAoC ...)<br />
<br />
Be ready to make the commitment.  Unless you are making basic stick maps of the zone, this is going to take you quite a while to do.  I spent roughly 8 hours mapping Dulak's Harbor.  Far more time doing Gunthak (though I probably didn't have to do each and every last shack).  It takes time to make a good map.<br />
<br />
Use different colors.  They can help show a change in terrain, different buildings, ... Though I'm sure you have all seen some of the maps that SoE released, so you know what I mean here.<br />
<br />
Share them with friends.   I'm in a VERY small guild.  Five people.  When I make a map, I can easily mail it to them, and they can put it in their maps directory.  If you are going to do this as a guild thing, then it might be wise to discuss what layer it is you are going to have maps made by your guild on so that people don't use that layer.  And since they are simple text files, they are easy to move to your friends.  <br />
<br />
Used a custom color before, but don't remember what the numbers were?  Simply select a line segment  of the color that you want, then click on Set Line Color.  The color settings for that color will pop up (just wish they had used a white background for the red, green and blue colors.  Red and Green you can see well enough, but blue doesn't show up well on the black).<br />
<br />
-----------------------<br />
Word of warning<br />
<br />
I have run across a bug while using the map system.  And it all started after I had removed a layer from one of my maps (I was getting rid of my earlier stick map of the zone).  Sometimes while you have your map up, your cursor will become<br />
invisible (though it is still functional and your computer tracks it properly, you just can't see it), and/or your other windows will have their faded transparency set to 0.  The second I've seen more often when I zoom way out on a map.  Zooming back in will actually set the value back to what you have it at.  I've also seen both of these problems clear themselves up for some unknown reason, while I was still logged in.  Camping out does not seem to help with the invisible cursor problem either.  If you do need to see your cursor for whatever reason, just turn off your map, and you will be able to see it again.<br />
<br />
Any questions or comments, just let me know.  I'll see if I can answer them for you.<br />

<br />
Long?  Really depends on the zone.  The Gulf of Gunthak probably took me 8 hours (as I think I mentioned), but the Warrens took me maybe an hour to do.  I started on one of Butcherblock and am afraid that I'll be an old, gray man before finishing that one ...  I now know why Sony didn't provide a map of it.  It is fairly large with a lot of terrain.  It took me nearly an hour to map about one quarter of the zone wall (from the northern sea border to down near the bandit camp west of the chessboard).  I'm using Elladan to do this since SoW makes it go so much faster, and I don't have to worry about being killed by greens as I did in Gunthak.<br />
<br />
Boring?   It has its moments.  But then sneaking about in Nadox conning critters every so often does give you a small thrill though not a big one.<br />
<br />
Difficult?  Not really.  Deleting errant lines can be a test in patience, but other than that, it is fairly easy.  Set your color, Auto Map, follow the wall.<br />
<br />
Frustrating?  Again, only if you have to deal with those errant lines.  Bah, that can be annoying.<br />
<br />
I'll see about attaching one or two of my maps here later (at work now) and see if you all like them.  If so, I can attach other ones I've done.  So far, I have Gunthak, Dulak, and the Warrens completed.  Torgiran is nearly complete except for the underwater portion of it (my Rogue doesn't have gills ...)  My map of Nadox is also incomplete, and will probably stay that way since there are reports of see invis critters further down.  But, I'll map as much of it as I can.<br />
<br />
But all in all, you are right.  You'll either have the heart for it or not; and this can definately be a bit tedious at times.  Me, I've always been something of an explorer though (don't ask how I got a Cleric to 52 over 3 years ... boggles my mind too), so I think it is pretty neat to be able to draw up my own maps.  Gives me a better excuse for not leveling than just piddling around doing some odd quest for something that I'll have no use for.<br />
