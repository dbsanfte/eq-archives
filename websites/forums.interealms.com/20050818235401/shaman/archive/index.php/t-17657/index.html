When the euro guild on Saryrn has gotten 8 or 9 of the past 10 VT repops?<br />
<br />
NO.<br />
<br />
The only way we (with pacific raiding times) have gotten a VT spawn is for Saryrn to crash at about 7pm PST on Sunday.</div></div><hr />

Can we whine about this a little more please? You don't see us come complaining on message boards when the Japanese clear everything do you?  It's part of the game, learn to live with it or go play FFXI.</div></div><hr />

Out of the mouth of a euro guild member.  <br />
<br />
Oh, and when was the last time TJ cleared everything before you guys did?</div></div><hr />

Out of the mouth of a euro guild member.<br />
<br />
Better than out of the ass of an american guild member.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Serb, what the **** is your problem?  Do you have a problem with me personally or do you have a problem with me having a grip about spawn times.<br />
<br />
As to TJ killing every thing, there is a big difference between them killing some (not all) elemental mobs and you guys hitting VT every week.  Try playing in a PST time zone and having a REAL LIFE.  Then you will understand that my grip is legitimate</div></div><hr />

I live in Japan, and just so you know my life is just as &quot;real&quot; as yours.  What annoys me the most about this topic is that it has gone on ad infinitum many times already, most recently in the later parts of this thread:<br />
<br />
http://pub40.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessageRange?topicID=3411.topic&amp;start=1&amp;stop=20<br />
<br />
...and it gets old after going through it over and over again.<br />
<br />
Although you still have a legitimate gripe, it's getting pretty tired.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Umm...I suggest you reread the thread you linked.  It deals with the whole situation of killing named before the warder have popped.  Its not about a VT's spawn time be better for one time zone then another.  The problems brought up in the thread are no longer an issue after last months patch.<br />
<br />
So what if this topic has gone on ad infinitum.  Its still a problem that should be addressed by the develpers.  NTOV, ST, Elementals, you name it.  They all have random spawns on server reset.  VT does not, hence benefits guilds that are in prime time when the servers come up (in this case, Europeans).<br />
<br />
Finally, this gripe may be getting tired to you, but remember your on the side that gets to take advantage of the situation here.  It doesnt get tired to those of us who recieve short end of things here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, I need to take a day off work in order to get VT?</div></div><hr />

Don't have a real life I think that's what he means<br />

Make EQ your entire existance, that's what I think he means<br />

Spend all your time and money on/in Eq, you will be much happier!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The problem is that this real life stuff is ADDICTIVE.  At the point that your RL is affecting your EQ play time, you have to step in and make a decision.  Are you going to continue wasting your time working a day job, hanging out with friends, going to movies, etc?  Or are you going to give your guildmates the attention they deserve and get a part-time third-shift job so that you can clear Vex Thal after the patch?<br />
<br />
It's all about priorities.</div></div><hr />
