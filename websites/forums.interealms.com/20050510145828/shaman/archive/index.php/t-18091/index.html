<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A lot of threads discuss the &quot;starting&quot; AAs.  I've 160ish AA now, basically all the essentials, and I'm looking for suggestion what to add next.<br />
Options include:<br />
Healing Gift+advanced<br />
Spell casting fury+advanced<br />
combat stability+advanced<br />
innate enlightenment<br />
VP2+3<br />
SC2+3<br />
suspend minion<br />
Rabid Bear+advanced (j/k)<br />
<br />
Mainly a raiding shaman, so that list should keep me busy for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Serbitar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd max healing gift then id5, then vp3, then innate enlightenment, then FoM3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">VP 2&amp;3 (boing, uber soloing potential)<br />
Suspended minion (nice for ldon or when you have to invis up)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">go for VP 2+3, then CA/ID, then HG/advanced, imo. After that, it's all eye candy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">lots will disagree with me on this one too I guess...<br />
<br />
Spell Casting Mastery - Probably 3rd best AA we get<br />
<br />
Innate Enlightenment - Bigger mana pool is good<br />
<br />
Healing Gift/Spell Casting Fury my personal favorites.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">330AA here, I have everything except alchemy mastery, resists, and innate stat increasers.  Out of the list of AA's you gave, I would pick healing gift (and adept if you don't have it) to do first if you are a raiding shaman.  I say this because I feel that our role in high-end raiding (from your magelo it looks like you're doing lots of PoTime) is to debuff first, then heal.  Lots of people disagree with me on this and think our time is better spent dotting and nuking, but my choice is to heal.  If you are the type that likes to nuke more than heal, then get SCF first and save healing AA for near the end.<br />
<br />
Once you have gotten healing AA out of the way, get VP3.  It is really an amazing AA.  I waiting until around 280ish to get it and I really regret it.  It is great for soloing, but it really shines in LDoN  (you have some nice augs so I am guessing you do a lot of LDoN in your offtime).  If you have VP1 already, then VP3 is only 6 short AA away.  That is just too cheap to wait.<br />
<br />
After that, get ID5.  It isn't as great as LR5, but it is a significant bonus, especially in LDoN.  It isn't that useful on a time raid because if you get aggro on the boss you're most likely going to die no matter what AA you have, so I didn't place it higher.<br />
<br />
Following that, get innate enlightenment.  You need the extra 200 mana.<br />
<br />
Everything else is really a toss-up.  None of the remaining AA on your list have really impressed me that much.<br />
<br />
FOM3 increased our nuke damage by a fairly significant percent (around 17% I think?), but our nuke DPS is so low to begin with that it just doesn't matter.  It is fun to see yourself crit, especially when you get a bunch in a row, but there are often long long gaps in between crits, even with FOM3.  And honestly the actual improvement in our DPS doesn't justify the 30AA you have to spend to max crit AA's.<br />
<br />
Spirit Call is useful in LDoN and in dueling.  You can VP an add away from the group, and then send in the wolf pack.  Throw on a Bane and you'll do a lot of damage to this mob by the time your group finally gets to it.  SC is limited in usefulness because it will not last the full duration on an LDoN mob unless the mob is an add or your group's DPS is just abominable.  SC is mostly useless in PoP.  It does insignificant damage to high-level mobs, and unless the mob is being tanked, your pets are going to die (I assume you aren't still exping in valor).  For dueling, though, it shines.  I duel a lot so I like it.  It doesn't do much to melee classes, but it is very effective against priests and completely tears up casters.  It is cheap enough to be worth getting, but I wouldn't put it high on my list.<br />
<br />
Suspended Minion is neither bad nor good.  I keep a pet in my pocket on raids, and pull it out for the boss fight or wherever it is appropriate.  For the most part our pets aren't effective enough to be worth the hassle of managing them, but if you can just suspend it and bring it out when the extra smidge of DPS is needed, it is worthwhile.  It is also good for LDoN, since I have the tendency to let my pets attack in to enrage.  When one goes splat, I pull out the second one.  If that one goes splat, I just go without a pet for the rest of the mission (I'm really really lazy about pets).  SM also allows you to keep your pet when you invis, but I have very rarely used it for this.  I rarely come across a situation where I already have a pet out and then need to invis to go somewhere that doesn't involve crossing a zoneline.<br />

I have rabid bear and hastened rabidity 3.  Rabid Bear has given me enough laughs to be worthwhile, but the hours I spent getting the AA to train hastened rabidity would have been better spent masturbating with a cheese grater.</div></div><hr />

ROFLMAO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My last 6 AA went to hastened rabid.  I love it personally.  Yes, I wasted 11 AAs between RB and hastened, but I don't really care (just broke 200 recently, at 208.  It's fun, and that's what matters.  I'm currently working for +COV so I can go solo stronghorn... http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=27200 with rabid should be good times.</div></div><hr />

Oh man, and I thought knocking mobs all over the place with VP was fun.  I have to get me one of those.</div></div><hr />
