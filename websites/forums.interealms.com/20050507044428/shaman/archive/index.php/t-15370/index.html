THANKfully its 10 sec casting... /pats SoW boots</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Actually Seru drops SOW boots as well. Casting time is at least 10 seconds though, maybe 20.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pimping out SoW on items is lame.  But hey, as long as every expansion comes with an all/all item with the top end cleric hp buff its all good.<br />
<br />
Stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ssiky the Ikky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Why is pimping out SoW lame?  Big deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oh this is funny... They put the books in places most people never go. Nothing like trying to entice people to go places they hate.<br />
<br />
I've looted (and destroyed) both books from Ssra. Doubt I will ever go back to Acrylia though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Screw the effect! I'd like to have it just for it's stats!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">bah, give them SoW, its a 10 second cast time and ours is right click instant. ours is WAY better because of that.<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
<br />
holy crap, i just saw the stats  :eek:  these are pretty damn uber i must say, i think i might be questnig them, i mean **** they ot mana pres 4 on them and 100 hp and 12 stam</div></div><hr />

Another reason ours is better is because you can cast  while running at full speed and it doesn't get interrupted.  I LOVE THAT!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Umm... have you ever fought Khati Sha?  This requires a raid, and a damn good one.  The other three books arent unreasonable to obtain, but there certainly wont be mass farming of the last one.</div></div><hr />

I seen him on Allakhazam.com  He's lvl 68 and looks meaner then anything I've ever seen in the eq world...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">if there was one &quot;nifty&quot; I could lose, it would be SoW. Assuming I can keep my little black fur booties.<br />
<br />
&quot;sowplz&quot; gets old, I would give everyone on norrath a free sow clicky item if I could just so they would shut up.</div></div><hr />

A couple of warriors in my guild have had this ever since VP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">With run 3 who cares about sow items anymore?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Halycona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Is SOW a spell that ONLY shamans get? Nope<br />
Is it something we can sell in PoK/bazaar for 50plat a throw? Nope<br />
<br />
Thus it's no big deal, it's not class defining in any way. Just helps out a few people who want to put in the time to get this item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I love when people bitch about this subject, it makes me feel all warm and tingly inside.<br />
<br />
oh.. and when did people start doing Khati Sha? i remember when no one would attempt him... atleast i think i remember that :&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">??  So you guys would rather have people ask you for sow?  That means scribing it to your spells, waiting on refresh, getting them BACK IN RANGE, and casting it...<br />
<br />
  Get one of these in your guild and next time a slacker without run3 asks for sow you can say &quot;ask the warrior for that buff&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">People in my group get Billy if outdoors, people not in my group can do whatever the hell they want, I'm not buffing them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tat2demon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I wish there were more SoW items out there. Like a little no stat trinket that drops in Befallen or something with a 15 second cast time on it. That way I dont get bugged all the time. Now if they just had something with free noob PLing and right click HoS Id be happier than hell.<br />
<br />
On another note, people that can take down Khati Sha are probably not the least bit interested in a SoW item. Theyre waaaay beyond that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Korginard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well as others have said, who CARES about SoW? That thing has Mana Preservation 4 on it as well as some very nice stats! Sow is an afterthought on that ring.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Khati Sha SUPPOSEDLY has been killed by only one guild server wide.<br />
<br />
The ring reportedly has waves of DT MOBs... AND the boss is lvl 68.<br />
<br />
No one is going to be &quot;farming&quot; SOW boots.  Frankly, if they can complete the cycle, they deserve instant-click SOW plus a lot more, IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">&quot;sowplz&quot; gets old, I would give everyone on norrath a free sow clicky item if I could just so they would shut up.<br />
<br />
Agreed!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Actually, this item is pretty nice since it's got Mana Preservation IV.  It also has killer stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Umm... have you ever fought Khati Sha?  This requires a raid, and a damn good one.  The other three books arent unreasonable to obtain, but there certainly wont be mass farming of the last one.<br />
<br />
What kind of raid force would you say is needed? If the raiders are pretty nicely equipped level 65s in an elemental guild?</div></div><hr />

<br />
HAS to be a lie right? waves of DT mobs? like they just come out and take 5 peeps out a random and you got 30s to kill em and they take out another 5?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I wouldn't doubt there are waves of DT :P thats acrylia caverns for ya.. annoying, and sure as hell not worth the effort.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you all seriously still in ToV or something?  Almost every PoP boss encounter (not mini's in BoT , balblalablabl)  talking sayrn, bertox, mith marr, etc...   all that **** is like lvl 70 I thought.   I don't see the problem here.   So you have a few mobs that DT...   Bring a raid of 72 and it's over.</div></div><hr />
