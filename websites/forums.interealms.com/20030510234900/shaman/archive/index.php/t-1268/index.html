<br />
<br />
Besides Giant Helms/Toe turn ins for faction.<br />
<br />
What other quests exist to raise CoV faction so I can get to ally?<br />
<br />

Thank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">An easy one is the mercenary assignements. Get a ranger with you and track down the mercenaries in Wakening Land. Loot their assignement and turn them in to Kcor for faction and coins. Plus you get faction just from killing them too. <br />
<br />
It's mostly good for barbarian and probably Vah shir shammies though... the rest of the shamans race are KOS to the sifaye, unicorns and other Tunare NPCs, which makes adds a pain.<br />
<br />
There is also a fed-ex quest from one off from one of the versions of Sentry Emil that will send you to give a report to Eysa Florawhisper in WL (for Tunarean Faction) and bring a message back to him (for coins and CoV/Yelinak faction). It's kinda slow and annoying, with the MOBs a few minutes and a zone from each other.<br />
<br />
Best way for faction is still killing high level Kromzek in the Arena. You get the best faction hits there and toes/helms drop as a bonus.</div></div><hr />
