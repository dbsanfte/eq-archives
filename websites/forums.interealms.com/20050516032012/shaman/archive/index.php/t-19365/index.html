<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Adinaya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When PoP was about to be released, we as a shaman class sent a petition type message to Sony about the spells that they were about to give us such as single target strength, dex, etc. At first, we got no response and many were feeling frustrated and unheard. Do you remember what we did? We pre-ordered PoP and then we cancelled the pre-order. When there are hundreds, possibly thousands of cancellations, all within the same 24 hour period, it really gets their attention. What I would suggest, is that we all pre-order GoD and then, if they have not given us any indication that our class issues are being addressed, then say on February 3rd, one week from release date, we all cancel the pre-order. It sends a strong, unified message that they are unlikely to ignore. <br />
If GoD ends up looking worthwhile, we would still have a week to pre-order again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Errrr PoP was out for several months before they changed those spells.  I also don't remember hundreds or even thousands of people doing a coordinated cancellation of their pre-orders.  I don't even think you could pre-order PoP?  I just went to wal-mart and bought mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Galdir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Cancel God will make no difrens and i dont realy care so much for what new spells and so we get.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I not ordering it anyway,  its way too laggy on my computer. So going to work out how to upgrade my computer over the next few months then may consider buying it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">at the moment, i am going to canx my pre order, though i giving them  alittle while longer till i do, but 3rd feb seems good enough time to do it anyway.. then i just wait and see if it is worth it or not.</div></div><hr />
