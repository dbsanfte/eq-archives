<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>pugger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been carrying this silly druid on my back for far to long :) and looking for a new campground.<br />
<br />
We did raptors till about 55 then started on Pon (love da birdies) and now we both at 59 and Ive been camping stalkers for decent drops and decent exp.  Get about one yellow of real exp or 1aa for each of us in like 4 to 5 hours depending on how much the pet breaks and a billion roots break. This isnt bad when the stalkers are open but that is starting to get a little rare.<br />
<br />
Ive read posts about PoD but really didnt like it there...maybe im missing something but mobs seem to have lots of hps and take longer for bout the same exp and not lots of room to run the druid all over the place there.<br />
<br />
So wanted to know if anyone had any suggestions on where to either quad kite with shaman backup or charm or even just root rot if its good exp cause birds seem to have been faster exp then stalkers and it just seem like shamans ought to be able to do better then 1aa every 5 hours..specially with a 59 druid there for snares and hella more dots.<br />
<br />
The druid is about one yellow from 60 and the shaman is one yellow into 59 but workin on aa's tryin to get to mgb..is this even a good time to go for it or lvl to 62 then do BoT?  I dont know just kinda bored and lookin for new spots...read through all the posts and none of there really stuck with what I do...either 2 high lvl for me yet or talkin bout lower lvl or duo with another class.<br />
