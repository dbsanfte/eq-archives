<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Joromitar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello. I was thinking of making a Barbarian... but the woads they have are too slim. In some peoples sigs here, I see their char with woads that look really cool, yet I have never seen them before during char creation. How do you get those woads??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, sadly, it's one of those graphics cards things. On my &quot;good&quot; computer, I can see the full range, though they're pretty dim. On THIS machine, however, all I can see is the two lines over the left eye for the male face.<br />
<br />
Good machine has a GeForce FX 5200, this clunker has a Voodoo 3, you do the math</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Joromitar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pity... I have the Intel... =( *cough* Boy, I wish someone hear wouldn't mind taking pics of all the woads and posting them... *cough* *cough*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">*hands Joromitar a cough drop and whacks him on the back a few times.<br />
<br />
You gonna be okay, there??  :p<br />

I just took screenshots, and it seems I can't attach files at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Joromitar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That sucks =(</div></div><hr />

It has a light source built in &amp; is fairly cheap 2k on MM</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Joromitar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">er... what r u talking about? lol... that has nothing to do with the topic =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dirkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">lol, I always laugh when on guild pages and stuff they post screenshots with all the old models. I understand that some have to do this, I'm just not used to it. I have a Geforce FX 5600, and I run with EVERYTHING. All models on, light sources, animations, full clip plane, etc. I love it :)<br />
<br />
However, I hadn't noticed differences in woads. I can try to take some screens and post them if you all would like, though I'm not sure what the differences are...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Nice work. But I think I'll remain Woadless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Joromitar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Nice... thanks a lot!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Man, it's time for me to get a new video card.  How much are the GeForce 5600 256 running?  Not looking to spend a fortune, but i'd love to be able to turn on the new models, lights, clip plane, etc. etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Joromitar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">ditto</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have a GeForce 5600, I don't play with everything on though.  My computer sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Joromitar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">about how much was it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">2.6ghz PIV ATI 9600.  No lag except in the baz.  My hdd struggles a bit sometimes but a SATA drive is next on the upgrade list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Some people think older model graphics for certain races are still better.  My machine can handle all new graphics very easy but the Iksar look stupid with the new graphics.  The Wood Elves look like they are standing sideways up a hill even on level ground which gives them a look of having a stick up their buttox.  Unfortunately turning off wood elf graphics turns off 3 other race graphics.  A small price to pay for me but I guess others like having a stick shoved up their buttox look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">LOL &quot;the iksar look stupid with the new graphics&quot;.....are you kidding me?  The old graphics make them look retarded compared to today.  But thats not the topic of the thread....i think i need a few upgrades too, my warrior looks a little weak, and has the same problem with his woad.  Think ill go with the streak down the left eye,  kinda like that one hehe :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I use the lower right hand wode myself, and also the face with one eye white w/ scar across it :)   Best thing is that the look carries over when I do illusions giving me one hellofa nice WE appearance :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">My 5600 was around $100.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Sounds about right. Newegg has them at $90.<br />
