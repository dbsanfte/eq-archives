<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>pacman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering if it is possible to camp him with just a 60 Shaman ( no torpor ) and a 51 Rogue.  ??<br />
<br />
And if so, what is the best way to kill him ?<br />
<br />
Thanks alot .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">without torpor it would be incredibly hard i would imagine, but no experience here, just my opinion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if ya get torpor you could camp him w/ just a shammy, but i doubt you could w/ only you and the rogue...<br />
<br />
Its probably possible, but would be immensly hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">correct answer:<br />
<br />
Not Bloody Likely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Maboun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well in blood room you have one spawn whos very easy I guess you could clear him and then pull emperor/ph to you. Here is the hard part. The emperor gates , a lot. His spawn point is close but he can bring the other 4 or 6 skels from that room with him. <br />
<br />
The trick is if you let him summon a pet first then pull him he seems to never gate. Not sure why but always worked for us we kept pet mezzed till he died and he never gated and I think you can then atone the pet or something to make him poof.<br />
<br />
He is definitely single pullable at 60 but he hits fairly hard and can be fairly MR sometimes a few resisted slows and he would probably gib you. If he has pet with him (he summons the spectre pet) I would say no way in hell.<br />
<br />
But what the hey prove us wrong!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you fight him in the doorway between the Blood and Emperor rooms he won't gate.  If any shaman can solo him, self-buffed and without Torpor, I'd be amazed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've solo'd him two times now, with torpor. Both fights were very close. I agree, it would be extremely impressive for a shaman to solo him with out torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Would a 59 paladin and 59 shaman be able to take this guy? <br />
<br />
We were killing guardian wurms in SF last night with a very well equipped bard and were able to handle that (barely). Maybe that will give something to compare against.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you two can take guadian wurms, I think you would have no problem at all with the Emp, especially since the paly can prevent him from gating. Don't forget, though, that you'll still need a rogue to get you down there.</div></div><hr />
