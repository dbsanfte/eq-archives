<br />
Green dots can be an indicator of the quality of posts the person makes...but most people still have only 1 dot, even if they're a contributing member of the community, due to people not using the reputation system that much.  If people used it more, it'd be more useful.   :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Grey dots are not necessarily negative. Grey dots are from individuals who don't have enough reputation to either positively or negatively affect your reputation.</div></div><hr />

The regular posters or lurkers should know the more famous/infamous people and just skip or ignore the worst of the worse  ;) . The helpful or mostly rational posters get a good 'reputation' without tools necessary.<br />
<br />
The sporadic visitors should read the posts and judge the content, not the posters.<br />

I don't like the reputation thing because people only give you rep points if you piss them off.  They completely forget about how much good Fing information you are giving out if you aren't nice and cuddly about how you say it.</div></div><hr />

I'm just ticked off that I can't seem to give any additional negative hits to Fargonstuff's reputation until I spread some rep love to others.  Quick, someone post something sensible so I can spread the rep love.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Personally I like the system. Just would like it more visable and up front. It gives people a chance to know how to take a strangers point of view. If they are sarcastic humor, or honestly being a flamer over something.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Something else I think you should change is make it so that people with a grey dot HAVE to include a comment, or make a new field that says &quot;this person approved of your post&quot; or &quot;this person disapproved of your post&quot;.  Yesterday, on the ldon gear thread, I got a grey dot calling me a jerk, a green dot with no comment, and then a grey dot with no comment.  I am really curious if the grey dot with no comment guy hates me or loves me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tragik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Regardless of it's intended effect, in practice it isn't working accurately enough to be reliable or reasonably fair.  If you get to throw stones at another human being, at least that person should be able to see who cast it.  Sorry, but the idea is ludicrous and should never have been implemented.<br />
<br />
It would be best to remove this 'feature' and let people build and destroy their reputations the old fashioned way.<br />

LOL Jin :D<br />
<br />
I think it's pretty much held on it's own merits. The people above who hate it probably won't pay any attention to it. The people who do may or may not get a slightly skewed view of someone's rep by the dots. It is handy to give a rough idea on someone's previous contributions (or lack thereof) though. The biggest improvement I could suggest is to echo the removal of anonimity. At least if someone was being an ass you'd know a) who it was, and b) could ask an admin to intervene if it mattered to you, but in reality it would probably just make people think twice about doing so.<br />
<br />
For the newcomer, it's handy to see who's thrown out good stuff in the past and who hasn't, it kinda gives more value to what they're saying. That's the only downside with the 'traditional' way of building your rep - you don't get that instant value appraisal. That said, it doesn't take too long to see who's who and which end they're speaking out of, so maybe we wouldn't miss it greatly. I just think as it's in and functional it would be more productive to try and improve it rather than just bin it. *shrugs*</div></div><hr />
