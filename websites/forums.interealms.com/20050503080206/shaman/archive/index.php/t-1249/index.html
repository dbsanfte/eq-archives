<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bloogbloog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just recently took a visit to the moon...what can I do so I can train in Shadowhaven? Im an orge by the way..I would love to make this spot the place I hunt and bank since I dont have to worry about faction issues...<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Do the Amulet of the Haven quest. It's pretty simple and quick and will get you the faction to use the shaman trainer. Quest starts with some city official...grr...I cant remember his name. Somebody here probably remembers his name or at least his title.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Trade Commisioner Henry is the guy you want to talk to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>argoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Orges can't do the appropriate quest. Ogres can though. ;)<br />
<br />
Go to Allakhazam and look up the Traders of the Haven Quest (list quests by zone and pick Shadow Haven).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">there are TONS of faction quests in Shadow haven.<br />
<br />
The best ones I have found (I'm also an ogre):<br />
<br />
Deliver a note to Lt. Bronas in Dawnshroud Peaks.  Take the note and the resulting report back and forth everytime you go hunt...easy and good faction hits.<br />
<br />
There is a multipart that involves delivering a shipment to dwarves in Paludal caves, then back to Shaven, then back to PC, then back again...I do this one when I am hunting in TM or Hollowshade.<br />
<br />
After a couple months on the moon I am 'warmly' with the merchants in the shaman guild, I get prices on herbs for alchemy that are equal to what I could get in Oggok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Iscadia Starhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually, the best way to do it is to do the main quest from Trade Commissioner Henry to Fungus Grove a few times, then do the 3 lesser quests (Coglixar Xorlopodil for House Stout, Daloran Glimmerblade for House Fordel, and Beriol Talkorakoir for House Midst) at the same time.  ALL  of them take you up to Katta Castellum eventually (though the House Stout one involves a few detours), so why not combine the 3 trips up there into one?<br />
<br />
Right now I'm allied with pretty much any Shadowhaven merchant I care to trade with...I think I'm at worst indifferent to any NPC that I run across.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BryeLLe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">there's also a pretty easy one that starts with stearno somethingoranother, barb vendor near the shadowhaven soulbinder. hail him and he gives you something that you take to gearo in the bazaar. he's near the stalls behind the bank right outside the shadowhaven zone. then hail gearo and he gives you something to give back to stearno. rinse and repeat. raises 4-5 factions but doesn't seem to give a very big hit. i've done it (and the henry quest) about 4-5 times already, warmly to some but still can't buy from all the vendors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Steano/Gearo gives a big hit to Merchants of Shadowhaven and smaller hits to the houses to Stout, Fordel and Midst)  - it got me very quickly to amiable with the vendors at the end of town near the portal to Nexus and thezones to Echo.<br />
<br />
I am now ally with with those merchants, which really helps.  But no, I cannot buy/sell in the other end of town, towards Paludal.<br />
<br />
Since I ( a troll) and the Ogres and Iksar are KOS in Katta, I have to wonder how we could complete the quests Iscadia mentioned.  Anyone know if they can be done BEFORE the mind-numbing effort to get Katta faction?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ogres are not KOS in Katta.  I am dubious to all.  I can bank, and wander about freely but thats about it.  Can't turn do the Rallic Pack quest, etc.<br />
<br />
I have been able to do the grimling pick quest, and I'm pretty sure I can do the phosphate and the pyrrotte sample quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Pyrrohitite is the one you can do with the lowest faction, I think.  My ogre could do it before he could do any of the others, except for mining pick, which I didn't know about before doing all the others.<br />
<br />
Enough pyrrohitite and you can start handing in vampyre ashes and blood, and enough of that, and you can start handing in shrieking stones.<br />
<br />
After handing in literally hundreds of quest items, though(you wouldn't believe how many), and killing in Seru and killing many vampyres, I still can't buy or sell.</div></div><hr />
