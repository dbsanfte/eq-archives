<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is a little slower then the last two drives thus far, but not too bad. To date (1/21) we've raised $1560.88 towards the total of $1950 needed. A LOT more donations this time, but most of them 1 to 10 dollars.. hehe, this time I even had over 30 people donate a dollar, and one person donated 57 cents! *grins*<br />
<br />
It may sound small, but every bit helps... the payment is due at the beginning of February, so we have about 10 days left to come up with the 400 more dollars.<br />
<br />
I am surprised about one thing this time... over 30 people have asked me for an address to mail a check, yet I've only received 5 checks so far. I'm pretty sure I gave out the right address, so I'm not sure why that is.<br />
<br />
Regardless, we are getting there and I can't thank you all enough for the help.. again! :) I'll let everyone know when we reach the mark (hopefully soon) and close another drive in our history.<br />
<br />
Thank you, thank you, thank you!<br />

Also, please be sure to try and include your board name when you donate, it makes it A LOT easier to find you when I am going through my list. :)</div></div><hr />

Without enough donations, this place you love to go to for shaman info would not exist  :(</div></div><hr />
