<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone care to refresh my mind about the mage spell Aegis of Ro - something about SoE forgetting to make it drop at all or something?<br />
<br />
Reason I am wondering is because I picked it up yesterday and wondered if it's worth some of the coffins I had to use yesterday(no I am not telling why ;) )</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">my guild has 9 or 10 copies of that ...seems to drop pretty common at least for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Worgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmmm,  for a good long time back in the kunark days most people thought it didn't drop at all.  <br />
<br />
It did though,  but I think the only mob that dropped it (outside of VP at least) was Talendor!  So not exactly common,  hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>wsbsteven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Got a few copies off of Guardian Wurms in vp and off of Tola in Seb.  If you were on the Tribunal I'd give you a few.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the replies, seems I got my hopes a little too high, several copies for sale in bazaar, one of them for 5pp :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Originally, it didn't drop at all. Not even from one single mob. There wasn't a single mage on any server who had ever possessed a scroll of that spell.<br />
<br />
Then one day they put out a patch saying &quot;we have added a new magician spell&quot;. That patch was some time during the Velious era.<br />
<br />
The spell they 'added'? Aegis of Ro, which had been in the spell data files since Kunark (and if I remember correctly was mentioned in the generally useless Prima strategy guide).<br />
<br />
Since that patch, it has dropped like candy - just like all other Magician Kunark spells. It was vaulable for about 2 weeks.</div></div><hr />
