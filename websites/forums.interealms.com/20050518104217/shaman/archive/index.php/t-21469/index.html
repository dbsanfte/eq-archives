<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, so I'm playing a defender now in City of Heroes.  I chose my combination of powers because they had good debuffs and what I thought were solid, but not overwhelming, offensive powers.  These abilities I thought were as close as a superhero could get to a shaman.  Little did I know that taking on the defensive, debuffing role in a different game would lead me to inherit the same problems I have been frustrated with in EQ.<br />
<br />
The bottom line appears to be that at the higher levels, defenders are underpowered, their buffs and debuffs not effective.  Why?  Well the damage dealing classes apparently are so powerful that mobs don't live long enough or do enough damage to give defenders much to do.  Sound familiar?  If you want to read more, see this thread  (http://boards.cityofheroes.com/showflat.php?Cat=&amp;Number=437284&amp;page=0&amp;view=collapsed&amp;sb=5&amp;o=&amp;fpart=1) in the CoH forums.  I personally haven't hit the wall yet, supposedly it happens by level 20 and I'm only 13.  There's 50 levels.<br />
<br />
So I just got to wondering if this is a problem common to all games.  Basically, when the fights get more intense and the mobs do more damage, the only viable defense is a potent offense.<br />
<br />
Defenses don't win games, they just keep you from losing.<br />
<br />
What does this have to do with shamans?  It implies that the only what to fix them is to make them more potent offensively.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As one who has played and watched sports his entire life, I can say that defense does win championships. A most recent example is the LA Lakers win over the Spurs. <br />
<br />
Until the Lakers put the clamps on Tony Parker - they were down 2-0 and looking to get beat.  Four games later, some horrid shooting by Parker; And Shaq, Kobe and the gang are looking forward to a couple of days off.<br />
<br />
Pro Football - the current paradigm is a spectacular defense, solid to above average special teams and a QB and offense that limits mistakes.  Example? New England Patriots. <br />
<br />
Hockey? Three words: Clutch n Grab. Granted, (and I'm no purist) that's not &quot;defensive&quot; it's probably LACK of defensive ability, but the days of the Edmonton Oilers with Gretzy, Messier, Tikkanen, Kurri, Coffey and company are long gone.<br />
<br />
Baseball? bud selig is the anti-christ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The best defense is a good offense :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, the problem isn't that defense/debuff isn't a viable part of battle, its that while mob and player attack strength continually goes up (gear, expansions, etc..), debuffs remain static.<br />
<br />
Every expansion where they released mobs that hit harder, they should have released debuffs designed to mitigate those mobs.  But they didn't.   <br />
<br />
One new slow doesn't counter GoD.  <br />
<br />
If they had released a fast cast neg resist check slow (which they did), plus a new cripple that reduces attack and more of everything else, plus a bigger hp fo7 with AC, strikethrough, and dodge type components, we'd still be sought after for debuff/buff.  <br />
<br />
but, they didn't.  Mobs got tougher, gear got better, our buffs/debuffs didn't keep pace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Every expansion where they released mobs that hit harder, they should have released debuffs designed to mitigate those mobs. But they didn't.(Bill Lundberg Voice) Yeah, I'm gonna have to sort of... Disagree with you there.<br />
<br />
While perhaps cripple falls under this description, Slow only gets more powerful the more DPS mobs deal, because you're preventing more damage for the same 250 mana spell the more DPS something cranks out unslowed. That's why we have all this Slow Mitigation bull**** that exists today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I read the thread, and I'm surprised people are complaining about balance and grinding out numbers and percentages this early on... maybe they got used to it in late EQ before they left for CoH... kinda nostalgic though hearing &quot;20&quot; being referred to as &quot;high end&quot; lol... I personally haven't played CoH though, so my opinions are totally unbased.<br />
<br />
I don't see why everyone reportedly dislikes the long fights.  The only long fights I hated were ones that went over an hour.  What's wrong with a 1 minute fight?<br />
<br />
What's the group member max in CoH?  Is it like 10?<br />
<br />
And Grizlor is correct.  Turgur's was just godly in Kunark.  I did like the way they handled making different mobs less slowable though, using the disease line.  That added a bit of use for that type of spell, and I must say I much prefer it over mitigation, which seems like a sony brand quick-fix that solves the immediate problem but creates others.<br />
<br />
I do think that an omens of war Shaman Class AA that mitigates mitigation, at least slightly (say, taking 25 percent off of the percent that mobs mitigate, at the MAX) would help us remain on top in that area.<br />
<br />
When people say &quot;Debuff&quot;, the only things that seriously come to mind are Cripple and Slow.  Cripple has no upgrade, and affects a base number of each particular stat, rather than a percentage, like Turgur's.   The fact that Turgur's reduces mobs' hit rate by a % makes it a spell that is useful down the levels... excluding mitigation, that is.<br />
<br />
Seeing as how they put in upgrades to our &quot;Frenzy&quot; and stat buff lines, I'm blown away that no cripple upgrade was put in.  Whether or not people believe it is useless, it is a line that's been with us since the earliest levels.  Strange... /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As one who has played and watched sports his entire life, I can say that defense does win championships.<br />
<br />
No defense, no matter how spectacular, is going to win a game if you can't score points. I'm not saying defense is unimportant, but in the high intensity fights we've seen at the high levels in EQ, defense counts for very little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well if DPS wins all fights. Then there is a problem with the game.<br />
<br />
And to be honest. Considering the powers that are able to be given to the NPC's There are lots of things that can shut down the sprint fights.<br />
<br />
If a Monster pops off an invulnerable ability and everyone continues with the Burn em till dead. guess what. A whole ton of End is gone. Or End drains from a monster to slow down the sprinters. <br />
<br />
Or lots and lots fo hit points. <br />
<br />
The problem comes in single pull. Mega High DPS mobs that it is more efficent to kill before being killed yourself. One fight like that is fun. 30 in a row is a snoozefest. <br />
<br />
Moderation in all things is key. Some High DPS. Soem special attacks. Some Movement heavy Chase em down and just kill the bastard fights. and some swarm fights Some Blow em up and let the Defenders sort em out fights. <br />
<br />
So far I am having a Blast in CoH because as long as you do not mindlessly go after one type of efficent to kill monster you get very good variation in combats. <br />
<br />
Last night we zoned out from a knockdown drag out kick out tail fight in a mission zone. to an outside area and someone had trained a level 18 boss on the doorway. We couldnt go back in. that was certain death. But to my level 10 Tanker the level 18 Boss was certain death too. But what the hell if I am to die. Make it a blazing death. So I jumped him hard. We had 3 people dead. But they Went to the Hospital and quickly zoned into our area. and I ported one in between swings. (Got a very lucky miss fromt he boss) And two other teamates got the other two in and quick ports as well. <br />
<br />
I was taking 135 a hit with my puny little tanking abilites. (310 total Hitpoints) But with layered Heals. And a insane scrapper who just kept <br />
taking aggro at the right time to let me get healed we killed the beasty. <br />
<br />
I have not had that much fun since the last time I said Ahh F it. and pulled 6 monsters in Tactics pit just to see if it would kill us. It was chaotic nail biting fun. But when trying the same tactic Vrs a lost boss I would be stunned and whalloped in a matter of seconds. The tactics are different. Or powersets needed are different. Or both. <br />
<br />
High DPS will win many fights. Because damage that is never dealt is certainly the most easily healed. But the developers need to set it up so while a one dimensonal group will succeed in some things other fights will teach them that tactics. and quick thinking can net a greater reward. Fun and Challange. <br />
<br />
That is the challange for The Game makers out there. Make a good solid playable game. that is deep and rewarding at the same time. while feeling fresh for the 10 hour a day crews. <br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
<br />
You all need it. But CoH for me has the magic that EQ hjas lost. It is fun to see what is around that corner again. Even if the Corner is a City block that looks the same to some jaded eyes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">think they dont like cripple line as its one of the best power lvling tools in the locker.<br />
<br />
probably they didnt upgrade it, cos some enc was heard saying he never used it........<br />
<br />
Whoever  developed the shaman spell lines past luclin was a major blonde.  Ofcourse at this point we were stil seen as overpowered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Defense doesn't win anything, it just keeps one from loosing. In sports, you do not win if you have only defense, you need some offense to actually get something, which wins the game for you. You may put out a short time offense, get a point(s)/goal/whatever, and then focus only on defense and win. Sure, thanks to the defense there was no loss, but without the offense, there wouldn't have been the victory either.<br />
<br />
So, yeah, seems to be the same situation. Offense is too strong (question of balance), fights are short and during that time, there's nothing to offer from the defensive char in that battle, as all the effects work over long time (well, long as 1 minute or so :) ). Doesn't exactly make things such fun. At least in CoH there's only one class who has such abilities (I may be wrong, never tried CoH), so the char of yours will never really be obsolete or good only for some certain situations, unlike in EQ, where few classes have similar or close abilities of other classes, and on top of it also have the utility, which is much more useful then some other class, thus making them, in the end, more desirable and almost obsoleting some other class.</div></div><hr />
