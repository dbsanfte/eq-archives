<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not sure how detailed you're looking for, but just the basic layout can be found at http://maps.eq-toolbox.com - click on the little thumbnail to see an image of the map.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thats perfect thanks Kamidari. Went here once before never seemed to get back here til 2 days ago. I couldnt seem to explore the whole zone without a flyer getting me. Why i was curious what i hadnt seen yet. Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The damn ghosts are annoying as hell. i usually find it best to kill them all at the T before you hit the domesticated pens. Usually if you kill them there you should make it through the castle to the other zout before the ghosts respawn.Otherwise you end up getting chain adds from these guys. I reccomend you do the ring and range quests both. The turn in guy for the range is not far into the castle (straight to the T then left). the staffs usually drop between zin and castle. the gems mainly drop in the castle and the area just past the castle if you dont enter. The pages all seem to drop off Chokidai. I found the domesticated were the best for drops. The turn in guy is in the room to the right after you exit the back of the castle. BTW the Rabid Chokidai can drop torpor and can spawn anywhere but inside the castle. I got my copy when it spawned as the first mob from zin lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nice on getting the torp there saraniax. The flyers have been wat got me a couple of times moving in.</div></div><hr />
