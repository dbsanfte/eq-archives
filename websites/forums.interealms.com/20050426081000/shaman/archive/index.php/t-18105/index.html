<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi<br />
<br />
I am rapidly approaching 60+. I have Malo and Torpor and all my 61 spells. When i hit 60/61 i want to solo some named or challenging mobs.<br />
<br />
Can anyone suggest a few that i could try (sensible ones :D ).<br />
<br />
My equipment isn't to bad and should be a little better by then..maybe a couple more ornate pieces.<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">sorry was really tired when i posted...from your magelo looks like WW dragons would be a challange for you, and at least you know the area judging by your ntov loot.<br />
einnod hit on some goodies too.  maybe try solo tanking some xp mobs in pop..that could prove fun.</div></div><hr />

ok you've got me stumped. I know you didn't solo bzzibuzzana, nevederia, Protos, Jorlleag or Torden. From your gear the best I can make out is that you mean soloing in OS for the Heiro cloak, the hole for the brell's girdle, or Cazic thule for the blood. Or am I totally missing what you meant in the first place?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tat2demon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hes not looking to solo for loot. Just looking for some ideas on some of the 60+ &quot;solo trophies&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Meddow Spiritwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hes not looking to solo for loot. Just looking for some ideas on some of the 60+ &quot;solo trophies&quot;.<br />
<br />
Umm the first Solo Trophy for most 60/61 shamans seems to be Cliff Golems. Long fight without epic. but they are fun =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">At lvl60 (before pop) I soloed dragons in WW, no other mob that I soloed came close to that would give me the satisfaction (braging rights) and challange that soloing a dragon does... The challange at your level and equipment would be very valid. When you slay a dragon no other named that you want to solo will ever look as &quot;tough&quot; hehe.<br />
<br />
I would also suggest doing it now (with your current level/equipment) since at 65 with more powerful dots, heals, hps ect... those dragons are no challange at all and it brings little satysfaction in killing them (I go back sometimes when Im bored, but the only challange is to navigate around WW being KoS)<br />
<br />
Another place you could get your skills polished on are the Vampires in TM (the castle) there are 5 named in the castle you can take out solo. All of them are practically immune to poison/disease, this is where you will shine on your &quot;long term survival&quot; and mana recycling abilities (excellent place to practice) ... loot isnt bad either, but since the mobs arent rootable and summon (I think) this is one place you can say you solo that a druid/wizards rarely does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Try them now you say...at 58. I think i will ...you reckon it's doable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Oh, I thought you were 61 hehe... but I actualy think it is doable at 58; I did it at 60 with roughly same equipment as you over a year ago (C3 and Aego as additional buffs back than) and I had NO Malo/Torpor. I used my resisteable Malosinia and lvl58 2k heal...<br />
<br />
Since there are better buffs avaible to you today (Virtue or Kazz+pot9 and C3-5) I think you could do it. It would be extra challange and something to brag about. Try fighting Yeldema 1st, this dragon doesnt AE dispell.<br />
<br />
The way I did it at 60 without Torpor/Malo or even a horse; I pulled with Malosini (I dont remamber the name of 58 Malosini line) I had it stick on the 1st cast (lucky) and slowed right after that; after that I had disease dots (Poxx/Plague) and Epic on him since poison dots were very mana draining, a pet and I cept on healing myself with my 2k heal. I think my logs showed roughly 9 minute long fight.<br />
<br />
Good luck  :D</div></div><hr />
