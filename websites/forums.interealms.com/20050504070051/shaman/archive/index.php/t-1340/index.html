I swear I was taking more damage than the warriors there.  I was lucky in that we were only there for about an hour and a half and I never did get killed, but it was NOT pleasant.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">why are you getting agro?  successful slow or resisted slow?<br />
<br />
make sure mobs are properly debuffed before slowing.  Then you avoid resists, then you avoid (hopefully) getting agro.<br />
<br />
debuffing is:<br />
Malo/Mala<br />
Tash<br />
Occlusion of Sound<br />
Malosini</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What's your level?  Easier to avoid aggro at 60th vs 59th or lower.  Also, give your main tank time to build aggro.  Most TOV fights are MT fights anyway, so there's a CH cycle going already - it's not vital that you slow immediately.  Wait for the mob to get to about 80% health before slowing, or judge it based on how good your MT is about getting aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Gonna have to agree with Blacklace here.<br />
This is an unfortunate part of the shaman job description.  You WILL be summoned, you WILL be killed.  If you are not, then you probably are not playing your shaman to his full potential (NOT telling you how to play your class, just suggesting that you may be missing out on a lot of what makes a shaman such a great class).<br />
Personally, I think the problem lies more with the clerics (if they are getting pissed at you for having to heal you) than with you.  I mean, what?  Were they hoping to just sit and nuke, throwing a heal to the MA every now and then?<br />
<br />
But anyway, yes, Henora's debuff suggestions will probably help you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Level and Debuffs make a big difference.  Resisted Slows are mega taunt and make for dead shaman in a hurry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>oOga[FoH]</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Raid shamans have to play agressive.. Unless you are the only one there, waiting for mobs to be glued to a tank, etc is just silly.. Soon as the mob is in range I am casting malo and following with a slow cast always.. I get the **** kicked out of me on a daily basis and in time, you will come to love it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Most shamans won't have your gear ooga.  <br />
It's a lot safer and a lot more effective to stick a sini first. <br />
<br />
thx</div></div><hr />

<br />
It may help to give MT a bit more time with mob after malo hits but before you slow. Seems that I always get attention when I am resisted, but half the fun is to see if you can stay at the mob's feet while tank is getting back agro, and live. Be sure that you are not running around after slow hits or is resisted, pulling mob away from tank. best idea, hang out right behind MT till he gets agro back.<br />
<br />
Consider hits a red badge of courage.<br />
<br />
Tell clerics that healing shami is main job after healing MA. Not sure how chanter will feel about that. Shami alive+Mob slowed=More raid mana left after kill and shorter down time.<br />
<br />
Besides, you gotta die from something.</div></div><hr />

Learn your class and agro management. It don't take skill to click an icon, it takes skill to be around to click it after N:th resist to get the job done.<br />
<br />
If you can be skilled, then duoble box for the lack of it like someone suggested.<br />
