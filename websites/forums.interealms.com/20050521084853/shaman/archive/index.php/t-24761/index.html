<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So...how do you learn dark elf AND tier dal? If you are learning from another player who is a dark elf, do they teach you two langages at the same time? Do dark elves start out knowing both languages and can teach either?<br />
<br />
Since the Vah Shir were created years after the original game, why is dark elf 26 after them at 25?<br />

 i dont think the numbers / the way they are listed here is significant in any way.....<br />
<br />
and good question, i was playing with 2 DE chars last night, and tho both knew elder tier'dal and dark elvish and elder dark elvish, neither had tier'dal...yet it is listed as a language.<br />
<br />
*seperate from either of the above*<br />
<br />
i was wondering where the skill came form also, and was hoping for someone *in the know* to come and enlighten us all=)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This is old news.  As far back as I can remember (I started right when Velious came out, and a friend of mine went on a language learning crusade not too long after) people have been wondering if there was a secret language they didn't know about.  But then it turned out that (surprise surprise) SOE screwed up.  In some documents they claim that there is both Dark Evlish and Tier'Dal.  But that would be silly, since the two are the same thing, so they only implemented Tier'dal.  End result: the game only has 25 languages, and if anyone tells you otherwise ask them to talk to you in Dark Evlish.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that is what i am saying...i took home the above list...<br />
<br />
opened my skills<br />
<br />
looked at my languages...<br />
<br />
dark elvish is there<br />
<br />
tier'dal ISNT<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
so...not a rumor.<br />
<br />
do YOU have teir'dal?<br />
<br />
i would like to learn that. as its all i am apparently missing.<br />
<br />
could it be that different servers have it listed differently?(i have serious doubts on that...but hey)<br />
<br />
i checked the listed languages against MINE....<br />
<br />
then posted.<br />
<br />
plain and simple.<br />

<br />
Dark Elvish and Teir'Dal are the same language, number 5. Both terms were used in the original interface -- called Teir'Dal in the UI but Dark Elvish in the chat window. Now it's just called Dark Elvish.<br />
<br />
Elder Teir'Dal is language number 18.<br />
<br />
There are 25 languages.</div></div><hr />
