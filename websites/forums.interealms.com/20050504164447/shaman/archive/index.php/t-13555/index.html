<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It all started when I logged on to get the last bit of xp needed for 60.  As I was headed to PoT i get a tell from a guildmate to meet him at the bank.  Once there he opens up the trade window and i see a spell scroll being placed there.  I moved my cursor to see what spell it was and when i did i nearly fell over in my chair.  It was topor! :) :)  <br />
<br />
Even with that alone that wouldve made my day, but luck wouldnt leave it at that.  By the time i logged i had gotten 60, finished my epic, received an awesome shaman range slot item from CoD, and got 61.  Like  I said a very good day<br />
<br />
Been playing around with malo/topor and they are amazing.  When i looked at the shaman posts singing the praises of these two spells i was a bit skeptical thinking that there is no way two rare spells like that could have so much an impact.  Now i see new possibilites, things i never dreamed I could do.  This is brand new territory for me so it will be a while before i start soloing any dragons, but im learning fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wait til you get 65 and Q.  That is pretty cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Congrats. I've had Torpor since I made 60, but I still dont have Malo yet. I have all but the words of retention to research it, though. Gonna suck if that combine fails.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Grats! It is funny how many are skeptical of certain things like how great Torpor is or how great canni 5 is until they get them. Then they believe. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its not just cool, I couldnt believe the diffrence in Q and Torpor, I thought it was just going to be a minor upgrade, boy was I wrong, its almost like casting torpor for the first time.  Work on SCR and it heals back as much damage as you do to yourself with CannV.</div></div><hr />
