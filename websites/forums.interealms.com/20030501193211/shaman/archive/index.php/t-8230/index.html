<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone use it ? I know the DS we have doesnt stack with other DS. <br />
Does the CR and DR and other resists stack with all forms of resists ? ( circle of seasons) <br />
do potions like  Elixir of Divine Endurance and Potion of Greater Aura of Cold stack with each other ?<br />
<br />
would be nice if we this could all be useful , i know we cant make cash of it, but if it can help us on raids...<br />
<br />
I mean stacking mage summoned items along with some of these potions , i see some potential for greatly helping a raid or if nothing else the MA and main clerics</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>UbercyrusForbeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From what I;ve seen, resists are not stackable. =/<br />
<br />
Which means, those potions are no good on any raids (where they'd actually be used) because there's always a druid around to CoS.<br />
<br />
/shrug oh well!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grobgitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Greater Elixir of Concentration and Stinging Wort are very useful for Raids :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye i make stinging wort potions for myself, i may even give one to a important raid person, like one of the clerics just so they wont die and can /q out for the rezzes later. But for selling potions, screw that would be the same as emptying my Bank account and handing out plat to everyone that walks by.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Most potions stack with other effects.  I've stacked potions with all of the resistance spells, the clarity potion with spell clarity.  Potion effects also stack with bard songs.  My personal best was when I stacked MR potion with Endurance potion and bard song and got my MR to over 300.<br />
<br />
There are a few odd effects that don't stack, but for the most part potion effects stack with almost everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Our Resist potions + The SoL resist potion do stack</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">so can anyone confirm that the cold and fire resists do NOT stack with CoS ?<br />
<br />
if they dont then its pointless to make them , if they do though ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Resist potions do NOT stack with with resist spells.  I believe they do stack with CoS/CoW, but most people cast other spells that DO stack with CoW/CoS and overwrite.<br />
<br />
I used Greater Potions of Cold to help out with a monky lavastorm epic fight once, since we were short a few key classes they helped out.<br />
<br />
DS potions DO stack with mage DS's..and a few others.  While it's not mega-uber, it can make a difference and the tanks like being able to DS themselves.<br />
<br />
Of course calimony is very useful for keeping my favorite people (me) alive.<br />
<br />
If you are going to make/bring potions to a raid, make sure that you clear it with the RL before you do.  Get your reimbursement paid up from the guildbank/raid-dues or don't bring em. Clerics get paid for 'dots..so should you.  If your RL doesn't seem responsive, ask the MT.  One tank I knew had cash coming out the wazoo from good drops.  He would buy DS potions and calimony's before the raid..use only a few of em, and use the rest for soloing..god I miss him.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">welll this has nothing to do with alchemy but i see folks looking for stackable resists <br />
<br />
head to POM .. thats right pom .. there are a few card quest for resist flowers .. 5 flowers all together yet only 3 will stack <br />
they are very time consuming to obtain, but will stack and give you 50+ the resist<br />
<br />
the 3 that stack are the cold resist flower, posion resist flower, and the hardest one to obtain, the magic resist flower<br />
<br />
stacks with druid seasons .. chanters GRM .. and shammies tali of tribunal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jeradin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">DS is pretty damn sweet potion for raiding.<br />
<br />
It stacks with Mage DS, and will stack with Druids DS, also stacks with Chardok ring effect, Bramblecoat and Bard DS.<br />
<br />
It does not stack with rangers Call of rathe/earth line, Coldain ring and Fiery might.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mages 61 DS = 45 points.<br />
Druids 63 DS = 40 points.<br />
Shaman potion = 33points on a level 65 toon. <br />
<br />
Solo I can get 61 DS going on myself, Potion + chardok ring + Bramblecoat.<br />
<br />
Also, our posion risist potion stacks with group PR and DMF, great for trak raids, and we used FR resists potions back in the day for Taledor raids.</div></div><hr />
