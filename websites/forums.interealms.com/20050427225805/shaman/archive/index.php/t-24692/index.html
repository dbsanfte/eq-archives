<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">...atleast for closed beta testers :)<br />
<br />
Im not quite sure its accessible for the rest of you too just yet but head on over to website and see what you can find.<br />
<br />
Its a +2.5 GB download for me so its certainly gonna take its time to finish with that Torrent download system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>aphex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i'm 580 megs into it and have been downloading for 11 hours now... looks like it's going to be a few more days =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At least you all are making progress into it. :)  On a cable modem, i'm getting a smoooooooth 2-4KB/s and i'm looking forward to playing the World of Warcraft open beta....about a week after release. :D<br />
<br />
I wanna get back to my characters already *whine* heh. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My download rate is hovering around 20 kb/s so it will take many many hours to complete for me too.<br />
<br />
Whats odd is that I read somewhere that this is basically the same client-software as we were playing on when they pulled down the servers. The new features like paladin and hunter talents will come in a later patch. Very strange that it is neccessary to download all this again if this is true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">FP download at 82% completed. 1.5 to 2 more hours to go.<br />
<br />
Both account keys received and our accounts are now set up.<br />
<br />
We're down to a countdown of only MINUTES before we get to play again! :) Ok, well...maybe HOURS since we still have to work today. LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Installing WoW Client, waiting for my key from FP to come.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Did you download the file using the BitTorrent downloader Divinator? Or were you able to get into Fileplanet's download servers?<br />
<br />
I'm having a problem, myself.  I cannot use BitTorrent.  Well, technically I can, I guess, but it'll take me until a week after release to finish pulling the file.<br />
<br />
So, I signed up for a FilePlanet access (Also aiming to get into The Matrix Online beta, so i figured 8 bucks was a good price to pay).  I have a closed beta account, I just need the new client.<br />
<br />
So my question is, for anyone who knows, can you - and if so, how - get to download the WoW open beta client from FilePlanet before they send you your key?<br />
<br />
Every time I go to fileplanet to the download site, i click the &quot;download&quot; button and it directs me to the crappy signup page :( Which i've already done.  I just want the dang client :(  Hehe.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Detton, no, you have to wait until they send the key. Also confirmed by several posters on the WoW Community Forums.<br />
<br />
They've got some funky cacheing problems with their login process, so best way to make sure is to go back to the main fileplanet landing page and click on &quot;Logout&quot; under the Members section header (top left). Close your browser, start a new session, go back to fileplanet, log in, THEN try to access the subsequent pages.<br />
<br />
I had the exact same problem you're describing, and a friend confirmed for me. Once you're truly logged in (no cacheing problems) you can fill out the stress test application form. Once that form is filled out it's just a waiting game for the email with the key.<br />
<br />
G'luck with it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bleh.  Alright, thanks for the help.  Dont suppose anyone has it already and wants to send it to me through a messanger? :P  I'm on a cable connection...  I'm kidding.  Well, unless someone wants to do that - i am desperate :D - , but mostly kidding. :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Meglo Maeneac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Download finished in 4 hours 32 minutes.<br />
<br />
I knew I paid $40/month for 1.5 up/down for a reason!  <br />
<br />
Detton, if you want to send me a blank DVD disc I can mail you a copy of the zip file.. same goes for anyone else...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks for the offer, but it probably wouldn't be worth it, with the time it'd take to ship both ways.  I can't really afford to pay for next-day delivery, and i'm not downloading *quite* as badly as I implied (Close, very close, but not quite)<br />
<br />
Thanks anyway, though.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes Detton, I downloaded it from Blizzard's BitTorrent system. To tell you the truth is sucks ass but whatever. For the most of the session I was at work/sleeping. Took about 20h. <br />
<br />
At the end it gave me an error that it might be corrupt cause it couldn't verify all the data multiple times. I installed it anyways and had no problems.<br />
<br />
<br />
Still no key from FP tho. ****ers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The Blizzard downloader absolutely sucks. It's been bad for most of the beta, but the current implementation is truly awful. Most people are uploading more than they are downloading - and with no way to cap the upload speed, it pretty much cripples any web browsing or any other network based activity. I am not a fan of this distribution method at all.<br />
<br />
If you don't mind paying Fileplanet $8 for a 1 month membership, I highly recommend this route. Not only do you get into the final stress test earlier, you also get to use a normal download from the Fileplanet servers. Let me put it this way: I have a 1.5 mbit downstream DSL line at home. Using the Blizzard downloader, my download speeds ranged from 0-30/KB sec, and the estimated time to get all 2.5 GB was about 2.5 days (during which time my home network would be unusable). I got tired of this and signed up with Fileplanet, got my key about 12 hours later, and downloaded the entire client at 140 KB/sec, which took about 4-5 hours.<br />
<br />
DSL line: $40 a month. Fileplanet 1 month membership: $8. Not having to deal with Blizzard's horrible downloader: priceless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yes the Blizzard downloader has sucked, but guess what?  It's *beta* and they are saving money with that method.  It will not be the same issue in retail.<br />
<br />
Also as a side note they have announced that this latest client download is the SAME client as the retail disk will have so once installed you are good to go for retail and will only need your CD key and account created.  (and maybe 1 or 2 patches).</div></div><hr />
