<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Woland</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The 7 may test server patch removed the -200 hate on slow spells.<br />
<br />
Anyone on test know the reason for this?<br />
<br />
Maybe Verant decided to decrease the agro from disease counters instead. If so that would be a nice improvement for shaman and necro disease DoTs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">isn't a neg200 hate by verant's coding adding 200 hate in reality?<br />
<br />
I seem to recall having read something along these lines somewhere, a really long time ago...<br />
<br />
Oh Edit.<br />
That would explain why they take it out... it would reduce aggro on slow spells in fact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Woland</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lowering hate in the SPDAT means decreasing the agro, and in this case this part was removed.<br />
<br />
So the result will be that slows generate more agro, unless Verant decreased agro from disease counters instead.<br />

<br />
If slow landes, hate reduction component works fine.<br />
If slow gets resisted, hate reduction component doesn't kick in.<br />
<br />
Thus a resisted slow currently generates more aggro then before the half assed monkey coder VI type fix.<br />
<br />
If the global aggro for slow is reduced, than that's the real fix. Of course it won't work on first patch so you have to wait a few more patches.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heh this change will put us right back to when the disease counters were introduced.  Of course perhaps VI has a new fix in place for the slow spells to take in consideration of resists.  Time will tell as well as the mounting death toll....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you saying that the disease counters of a resisted slow generate additional aggro, even if they aren't applied to the mob (since the spell was resisted)?<br />
<br />
Thats the only way that a resisted spell could generate MORE aggro than before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>thorvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">So, basically does this mean I'm back to getting beat up for my lunch money again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It appeared to me that on resisted slows the disease counters did add more agro. Just like when a Shadowknight casts Disease Cloud, resisted or not they're going to pissing off some mob. <br />
<br />
Which is what worries me about them messing around with disease counters and such. If they &quot;fix&quot; how those counters affect the hate list what does that do to Shadowknights? Is there really a way for them to keep the disease counters on slows while keeping it from being insta-Shaman death and, at the same time, allow Shadowknights to use those disease counters the way they do best? Taking past history into consideration...why do I have the feeling there will be some pretty pissed off SK's soon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Maybe the disease thing does add a lot of aggro, but it sure is nice curing slow on the main tank on Nevederia.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Given that they didn't change Tigir's, looks to me like this is someone's balls up, rather than an intentional change.<br />
<br />
Always ready to be proved wrong though, I guess we'll have to see what VI say about it (if anything).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Perhaps they just lowered the amount of hate generated by the slow portion to offset the hate added by the counters....  Nah, that'd make too much sense. :p  <br />
<br />
Removing the hate associated with disease counters would really change quite a bit and throw things off for many classes, so I'm guessing that's what they did.  VI has a penchant for picking the poorest solution to a problem.<br />
<br />
Or... They just hosed it up and 'accidentally' rolled our slow back to the mega aggro versions they were just a lil bit ago. :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Since it wasn't just our slows that were effected, I think its safe to assume that Tigirs is just a mistake.</div></div><hr />

Not to sure about this. Whenever I fail to land a Slow on a mob which resists it, it goes berserk and wants to kill me. It pushes aside two taunting warriors, a backstabbing thief, runs past the Wizard that is nuking it and says hello to me while cracking it's knuckles.</div></div><hr />

I only have one word to say.....oppps! I misread the post. But I wish they fix it already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>howjan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The amount of aggro generated by slow on test has been fixed since they inplimented the disease counters.  Regular xp mobs are turned by snare 95% of the time, unless you get a resist or 2 on slow of course.  I do alot of grinding in chardok (yeah yeah, I didn't know about the damn quests before I hosed my faction) and it's not uncommon for a dog to smack a sub 60 robe that's sitting after I have landed slow on it.  So it would appear that sitting plus lvl is a greater taunt than slow in some cases.  But something that was quiet interesting to me was that slow was pulling aggro off the enchanter on mez'd mobs.  Don't ask me how that works, it's just the way it's happening currently.  In tov the flurries don't get too upset until you get a couple resists.  Imo the resists still seem a little higher than they should be or were, but of course most of us would agree, it should land on the first cast with zero aggro.  <br />
<br />
That's the way stuff was working as of 5hrs ago on test.<br />

And why would you need a hate reduction component for disease counters that aren't 'kicking in' either? Don't say you were farming HoT and mobs felt like they were attacking you more on resists.</div></div><hr />

I believe any spell that has disease counters is a big taunt regardless if it lands or not.

The real crime is that I have this spell, and its basically useless to me on RZ. Sometime my wicked half will get the better of me and Ill cast it on a group of tanks in the middle of a big fight on a raid though hehe.(ok ok I wouldnt.. but guh). I wish one of the 5% on a server that can use it got the spell instead of me lol.</div></div><hr />

Mobs HATE counters. Turgur's is changed to add SIXTEEN disease counters, and shamans all over Norrath become stains on the grass. 'Nuff said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Eoin:  When was the last time you were turned into a stain because you landed Plauge (9 counters)?  Or maybe Insidious Decay (9 counters) or Envenomed Bolt (10 poison counters)?  None of these spells are famous for generating huge amounts of aggro.  I doubt the mob summons you when you land an EBolt.<br />
<br />
I am fully aware of how many counters were added to each of the Slow spells.  That isn't my question at all...and simply pointing out that Shamans have been getting more than their fair share of the mob's luvin isn't breaking news :)<br />
<br />
<br />
This is what I was talking about:<br />
<br />
1) people believe that even when resisted, our slows generate HUGE aggro because of the disease counters.<br />
<br />
2) As evidence of a spell that generates huge aggro even if resisted, people mention Disease Cloud.  ShadowKnights use it to generate massive amounts of aggro to pull the mob off of casters, etc.<br />
<br />
3) Looking at the actual spell (Disease Cloud) - It's a pathetic spell, that shouldn't do jack squat to a mob.  It has ONE counter, and does about 50 pts of damage.  whoop-de-doo. <br />
<br />
I'm not going to believe a bunch of shamans about what a ShadowKnight spell does.  If you play an SK, I want to know if Disease Cloud as an uber-taunt is an urban myth or are there some hard facts that I can see.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you cast any of those spells at the wrong time, you will get aggro. I have been summoned and beat on for casting ID and EBolt (but only when it's not dangerous). The difference seems to lie in the number of counters. Turgur's has nearly twice the counters of Plague. That's a lot more aggro all by itself.<br />
<br />
SKs don't just cast DC once. They chain it how ever many times it takes to gain aggro. But it usually doesn't take many, which would seem to indicate that counter aggro is not linear. I don't think the odds are very good for an actual SK to comment on this here, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Chkorsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">being a lvl 55 sk.<br />
<br />
disease cloud is THE taunt spell shadow knights have. it  might be just a lvl 9 spell for us but there is no shadow knight that doesn't have it perma memmed.<br />
<br />
it is THE spell to grab quick agro (unless of course you're working with an enchanter who wants to mez the mob afterwards) off of anyone.<br />
<br />
it's a DD spell, a DOT (long one) and adds a disease counter. combination of those three is why it's such a big taunt.<br />
<br />
if they screwed up the taunt value of disease cloud they'll have every shadow knight on frothing at their mouth.<br />
<br />
and about hard facts. ask Azzikai what it does to her when I don't cast DC on a mob before she slows. If I don't cast DC on a mob before she slows she will get attention, if I do cast DC on a mob before she slows the mob doesn't even bother with her (even if slow gets resisted twice).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Snap, I use Insidious Decay as an agro spell when I need to get agro off a cleric or caster.  It's 100 mana, and it's a HUGE taunt.  It won't keep you on top of the hate list without damage, but it's very effective as a taunt if you have it up.  I've seen maybe twice where the spell won't taunt a mob on to me when cast twice<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Icklymuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I'll take a stab at this one.<br />
Raising my monk in OT the ONLY class that could out taunt me and keep aggro off me was an SK that continually used DC. <br />
Later on playing my Gnomie SK into his 30's I found that DC was my best friend for keeping or getting aggro away from someone else. Hell I could walk up to a group and DC a mob half dead and get aggro... <br />
<br />
Can I explain it. Nope I can only report what I have seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Shaman low level spells definitely causes agro. Take sicken for example, its a level 5 shaman spell that costs 30 mana to cast, 1.75 sec cast time.<br />
<br />
When I duo with a rogue, 3 casts on the mob keeps it on me the entire fight. With no casts, only slow, the mob pretty fast turns to the rogue. <br />
<br />
Now this spell does 42 damage, 3 casts equals 126 damage, you telling me 126 damage causes almost no agro snapdragn? =P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Glad to hear all the responses regarding aggro from non-Slow spells (esp Disease Cloud)...thats the type of info that I was looking for.<br />
<br />
One final question - Does anything change if DC is resisted?  It's such a quick casting spell that I assume SKs will cast is again and again until it sticks...but does anyone have any ideas if a *resisted* disease cloud has any aggro?  (Same goes for Insid Decay).<br />
<br />
I think we all agree that *any* amount of counters generates a large amount of hate...and apparently it makes a difference if 3 counters are landed 1 at a time via DC or all 3 at once via Drowsy (for example).<br />
<br />
Thanks for the replies.  Now if only we can determine if resisted spells (with a counter effect) have a large taunt/hate/aggro effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Insidious decay is unresistable. This is part of the taunt factor. Ask any enchanter about how much they enjoy tashing stuff :)</div></div><hr />

Insidious decay is unresistable. This is part of the taunt factor. Ask any enchanter about how much they enjoy tashing stuff :) <br />
<br />
I don't buy something being unresistable being the key for aggro. Malo is unresistable and it has basically no aggro to it.<br />
<br />
And as some who has also played an enchanter I have pleanty of exp with tashing mobs. Tash isn't the aggro magnet that people make it out to be really. It was bad when slows where bad when SoV first came out but after a tank has been on the mob for 30sec or so i can chain cast tash and not draw aggro. Tashes biggest problem is it's so fast casting it's really easy to land early before the tank has really established aggro. Cripple is alot worse aggro than tash is. That is likely to get you killed even cast a good time after the tank has engaged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Tash's aggro comes from Poison counters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Ok, slow agro should now be fixed on live server. This is why:<br />
<br />
Before, when I was in fungus grove duoing with an primal wielding Rogue(60), I casted sicken 3 times, shroom never went of me after that.<br />
<br />
Now, after patch, if I cast sicken, even 5 times, that damn shroom dont even look at me, and this is a lvl 59 rogue with non uber gear. So disease dots dont seem to cause alot of agro anymore, any sks check this out?<br />
<br />
Verant seem to have removed most , if not all of the agro caused by the disease counters.<br />
<br />
Tested a low lvl poison dot instead, that still worked like a charm though :)<br />
