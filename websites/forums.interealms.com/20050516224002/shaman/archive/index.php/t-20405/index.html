<br />
I was in Katta Castellum for the first time ever today.  I pulled one of the guards near the bank.  First one died fine.  Second one despawned with 25% health and was instantly placed by a new, different guard at his spawn point.<br />
<br />
I thought that was odd, so took a break.  Came back a couple of hours later.  Pulled the two guards by Twilight Sea zoneline.  Got both of them down under 20% health and both of them despawned at the exact same time, replaced by two fresh mobs again.  I /ooc'ed if anybody else was having this problem and got a bunch of nope's.  I then killed for a good hour without having the problem recur.  My final pull the mob despawned at 3% health.  It pissed me off enough for me to say forget it.<br />
<br />
I /petitioned this as I'm sure it's some kind of bug, but was wondering if this has happened to anybody else.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It has happened to me recently, I have been PLeveling my cleric there. I am pretty sure this is a result of the anti-bard kite code they put in. I have also had this problem in various other zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">this is a common ocurance in katta, somewhere in the 5% range will just poof on ya, could be more, could be less but thats close enough. still great exp and if you grind out enough lvls in there you will be nonkos in the arex :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In katta and a couple of other Luclin zones there is a &quot;changing of the guard&quot; it occurs once per day and all the guards in the city will despawn and respawn.  If you just HAPPENED to be fighting one at that time... tough luck, you just wasted all that time and EQ is working as intended.<br />
<br />
  Since in Luclin you cannot tell the EQ time with /time, you have to pretty much guess at when it'll happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kamm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That bug has been around for along time. Its not predictable, The guards can poof, for seemingly no reason at all, at any time. I could have 5-10 percent of guards poof, or go days without having it happen. They always respawn right away, at their spawn point at full health. Seemed to happen alot near the TS zone.<br />
<br />
Very annoying.</div></div><hr />
