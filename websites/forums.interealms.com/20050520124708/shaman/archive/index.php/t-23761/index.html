Thank you!<br />

Well, I noticed that on one kill in Dranik's Scar I got a message saying that my faction standing with the Children of _______(not sure who's kids they were) got worse, then on the next kill of a different type of mob, I got a faction hit saying that my faction standing with the same Children could not possibly get any better.  I found that hard to believe since I had just hurt that faction, but then I thought...what if our faction is max Scowling, and that is as good as it can possibly get?<br />
<br />
Who knows, but it seems we start out not being able to improve 2 factions because they cannot get any better.  I can't remember what their specific names were though.  <br />
<br />
I think the mob that I killed that gave me the negative faction hit with the Children was a Dragorn, and the one that I killed next was a Noc Havocblade.<br />
<br />
Good luck on trying to figure out these factions :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That does seem very wierd. Why bother have that faction then, if it can't get better then scowling. I guess that goes with alot of faction that never made any sense such as Deathfist Orcs why even bother having that faction if it is of no use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Percent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What if the faction is &quot;tiered&quot; where as you progress through the content of OoW you &quot;unlock&quot; the ability to improve your level of faction(s)?  Such as you complete a quest or kill a named npc in WoS that allows you to raise your faction from scowling the threateningly.  To keep it from simply farming green mobs for hours (or days) to get faction raised.<br />
<br />
Just a thought...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well, not totally sure on what all the faction is for.  What's interesting is that in MPG the faction gives you hits pos hits to Overlord Mata Muram.  The same is true about Riftseekers Sanctum.  Wonder if I&quot;ll still be kos when we get that far hehe.</div></div><hr />

This is where it was very confusing to us last night.  We were in the instance zones gotten from Grand Historian ? in Dranik's Scar.<br />
<br />
Inside dungeon we where killing and depending on Mob type, we where either raising Mata or lowering Mata.<br />
<br />
I also had seen on Alla's website someone saying to watch faction with children?<br />
<br />
Most zones I have visited, this is the case.  Entrance mobs to Bloodfields gives negative hits to the children, and same mob types in Causeway zone gives positive faction hits.<br />
