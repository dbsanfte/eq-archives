For the most part its going to be safe to assume that many of the skills similar to existing skills (Healing AA's, Defensive AA's) are going to be on the 3/6/9 cost system, and the ones like increased Stats/FT/Regen are on the 5/5/5/5/5 system.</div></div><hr />

Then crit hot's<br />
<br />
From there it is incrimental increases till Level 70 depending on what I decide will help me the most at the time. <br />
<br />
New level Or new aa. All depends on what will give me the best flow of fun and power comparable to my guilds advancement. Hitting level 70 with no spells And no chances to get spells for months wont really hlep me a whole lot. but you never know.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hail,<br />
<br />
If I buy OoW (still a pretty big 'if' for me), I'll go for the extra spell gem, call of the wild, and then probably either the follow-on to LR or SCS.<br />
<br />
Now that my stamina has finally gotten to the point where I can click it off whenever, buff slots haven't been as big a deal as they were before.  BUT, if the new spell buffs seem worthwhile, I might dump points into there instead.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Nice list of AA's (and everyone knows I am hard to please).  Not easy to decide what to do first although the spell gem and the FT levels are no brainers first (since I have 5 over FT cap already).  Then I have to grind grind grind again, hopefully all in Omens with spells actually dropping!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
But really, good stuff<br />

PS: Heck next I might get the pet suspend one that allows you to camp.  The Mages are going to be selling a lot of pet toys.  I absolutely love pet affinity - it solves quite a few of our wimpy pet issues.  I mean think about it, 2.5k extra hps (with all the buffs and pet junk), attack buffs, haste, item haste, and duel wield with mage hth weapons with proc.  I always cry when I log with &quot;super puppy&quot; still alive. I'm hoping that Omens pet upgrade is good also - more reason to invest in fluffy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmmmm, Purdy, you point raised a question. Mage toys are set to poof when you log (after XX minutes.) So if you equip your pet, suspend it and log for the day will the weaps still be there when you log on? If that is the case, mages will be crying about their summoned weapons market being nerfed by SOE since you only need their services when, and if, the pet dies.</div></div><hr />

I'll tell you a secret about mages:  They hate summoning crap for people.  And there's not really a big market for summoned items.</div></div><hr />

Yes.</div></div><hr />

Description: This ability grants heal-over-time spells the chance to have a critical effect each tick they are active. An exceptional heal doubles the healing value of the spell for that tick.<br />
<br />
this would be verry nice if it worked on you regan spell, since the new one heals 60 hp's a tick you could get 120 hp heals out of the crits would be nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">FYI.. Sleight of hand is no longer an AA that anyone has.  Well, at least shaman do not get it and neither does magician/wizard so I'm assuming that it was removed for everyone as of 9/10<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm going with getting the extra spell gem off the bat and saving 9 when I hit 70 for Call of the Wild.  After that, i'm not totally sure, but at the very least, I'll prob split it up between getting the healing AAs (advanced healing adept and advanced healing gift) and then the defensive ones first.  I'm sure it's been tweaked a bit, but when I was messing aroundin beta, I could have swore that I was a criting madman on heals.. seemed to crit every other cast.  That will prob be the factor on getting Gift before Adept.</div></div><hr />

----------<br />
<br />
It's not too much of a market currently although you can usually find a bazaar mage bot selling them.  But, as peeps get all the pet aa's, and if the mage pet toys survive the suspended logging I have a hard time believing that peeps won't buy them.<br />

You don't raid, do you? Which is fine :) But if you raid, Heals that can be MGB'd are more than tricks.<br />

Unless the Devs finally reached the terminal phase of brain rot and made that heal not MGB'able?</div></div><hr />

*nod*  I hear that it is, but it doesn't stack with Wood, which is fine we just would be appended to any &quot;wood chains&quot; or whatever.  Unless that stacking was changed from what I've heard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Yep, Ancestral Aid and SotW don't stack and Ancestral Aid was &quot;nerfed&quot; to heal 325/tick(was 400) a week or so ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Oh, didn't realize it was MGBable.  That does make it useful.  Party on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Correct me if I'm wrong, but SotW only heals for 250/tick vs. 325 for Anc Aid.  SotW has AC and DS buff, while Anc Aid has endurance regen, so both will be valuable in different situations.  Since I'm not a raider and don't have to worry about the non-stacking issue, I can see Anc Aid being a very nice addition to most exp groups.  Same refresh as paragon, so the timer seems about right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Yes, the timer is in line with the Cleric HoT as well. The amount healed is a little low imo, but for an AA, good enough.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I'm probably one of the few hoping Ancenstral Aid wasn't MGB'ble.  I can be strained now as is with buffs, and probably will be more so with the new buffs, and I'm going to need to save MGB for them, not for a short lived AA.  Beasts can get by it, because their group buffs don't cost enormous mana like Focus, and well, my guild can have 10 druids on a raid (my guild's shaman crew has been dwindling to near nothing).  But it doesn't mean Ancenstral Aid would be worthless to me.  I'm definately getting it when I can.  And it would make us important when we do have it, where it would make guilds having to place shamans in more strategical groups with tanks, during raids.<br />
<br />
I was really hoping for an AA to reduce MGB resuse time by half (over a  3 tier purchase), but I guess that would be too powerful in conjunction with Ancenstral Aid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
how do we know that these AA will stay that cost though between going live and beta?  Eitherway, they don't look too bad. Can't wait for Call of the Wild and that extra spell gem :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Huh. I wonder if our new Can AA will be especially useful during buff time? So, your raid has gathered, everyone is doing MGBs. Three clerics do three MGBs HOV/Symbol/Reverence. There are still 6 clerics standing around.<br />
<br />
I need to do group buffs on 12 groups because I'm holding MGB for Ancestral Aid. I ask a cleric with mana who's not busy to help me out. I pop my new cann AA and for 4 minutes I have unlimited mana as long as I have health. I bet I would be able to focus/sta/agi every group while the cleric keeps me healed.<br />
<br />
Interesting!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Wazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">It looks like the new costs are alot more reasonable than the GoD ones.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Huh. I wonder if our new Can AA will be especially useful during buff time? So, your raid has gathered, everyone is doing MGBs. Three clerics do three MGBs HOV/Symbol/Reverence. There are still 6 clerics standing around.<br />
<br />
I need to do group buffs on 12 groups because I'm holding MGB for Ancestral Aid. I ask a cleric with mana who's not busy to help me out. I pop my new cann AA and for 4 minutes I have unlimited mana as long as I have health. I bet I would be able to focus/sta/agi every group while the cleric keeps me healed.<br />
<br />
Interesting!<br />
<br />
Yes, that should be useful for buffing, once you get the level and AA's needed for it.  What is the reuse timer on Spiritual Channeling?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Samanna, you have FoMM under GoD AA's listed as 3cost and 3/3/3 advancement.  The cost is actually 4 and the advancement is 4/8/12.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I gotta say, the AA's  to me seem very reasonable in AA cost. GoD was just plain silly in the costs of some things, but oh well, it kept people busy right ?<br />

Seriously, this looks like a worth while expansion to get, more so then GoD atleast, i almost wish i wasnt quiting, im curious about the content and that rez and the other nice AA's.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Oh, btw Sam--you've got a couple of errors/unfinished areas in your chart of AAs (for GoD).<br />
<br />
GoD stuff I remember off the top of my head:<br />
Call of the Ancients: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15<br />
Quickened Curing: 5, 10, 15<br />
Persistent Casting: 3, 6, 9<br />
Critical Affliction was 5, 10, 15<br />
<br />
Ones I'm not sure about (been a while):<br />
I think Convalence was 3, 5.<br />
I think Advanced Spirit call was 5, 10<br />
I think Fury of Magic Mastery went up as you bought it--something like 4, 8, 12.<br />

Ability: Expansive Mind <br />
Description: This ability raises the maximum that your mana regeneration can be increased with items by 1 point per rank. <br />
Cost per Level: 5 <br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think they ever intended it to be FT 40, thats way too big of a jump.  I think 5 is too small, but 25 is way too much.   Personally I was hoping for 2 per rank, thus capping at FT 25.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some of the PoP AA costs on that chart are incorrect.<br />
<br />
New Tanaan Crafting Mastery is 6 levels at 3 AA each.<br />
<br />
Planar Power is 5 levels at 2 AA each.<br />
<br />
Suspended minion level 1 is 5 AA.<br />
<br />
It looks like you have the levels and cost for LR and ID flipped - each has 5 levels, 3 AA per level.<br />
<br />
AHA and AHG don't have the same cost. One is 2/4/6 and the other is 2/3/4. I am pretty sure AHG is the 2/3/4 one, but it's been a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I couldn't find it with a quicklazy search, but I'm sure it was said somewhere on a Sony site that the wording on Expansive Mind was wrong.  Pretty sure they mean it to be 1 FT per level.  5 levels = 5 extra FT is a total of 20FT available.<br />
<br />
I think I read it at the Safehouse... /yawn too tired to check!</div></div><hr />

Start at Boon of the Pious (halfway down page) and continue on to next page down to Plague of Anguish.   Those are some of the new level 70 OoW focus effects.  They aren't finished though.  Lots of the nuke focus don't have any resist attached to them yet.<br />
