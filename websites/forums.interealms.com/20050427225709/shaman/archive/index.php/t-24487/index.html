<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kazracr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I tired search but wasn't working that great but any way heres my question.<br />
  Can anyone list the level and difficulity of the boats in dulak and what level to start and leave each boat and what rare is on each boat?<br />
 Im a decently equiped shaman i have fungi, Jbb and a horse and a 3k mana pool with a kei.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At 52, I can clear the storm wave boat (first one on the right as you zone in) using Virtue, horse, jbb, , slow, dot, kei, and dog dog.   With the fungi and your own regen spell, you probably won't need to heal yourself much at all if you have an ok ac.  Just tank for dogdog.<br />
<br />
I've only tried harder boats solo once and was doing pretty good but ended up having to camp before I cleared the boat so I don't know if I could have cleared the boat before repop.<br />
<br />
ON the stormwave, the rare you are probably looking for is the charm that drops off of the captain.</div></div><hr />

Stormwave should be fairly easy at 52. Lady Dirulia is next and you could likely do that boat solo at 52 as well. I have hunted the Dandolak off and on since 54 and am 58 now. When in Dulak don't forget about the buildings......they are fun to break and camp in for a change of pace....The windscorn shipyard with all the architects and ship builders would be pretty good at 52 to 55 as well.......Good Luck.<br />

&quot;Madness takes its toll.......Please have exact change ready&quot;<br />
