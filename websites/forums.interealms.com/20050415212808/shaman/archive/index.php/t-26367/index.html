<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was browsing Lucy today and noticed some changes on Test to pre-50 nukes for shaman.<br />
<br />
There were some exceptions but in general it looks like cast times, mana costs and damage are all going to be lowered.<br />
<br />
Link (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/newspells.html?source=Test&amp;date=2005-03-30%2023:03:47) <br />
<br />
The one that I noticed most is Winter's Roar will be reduced from 263 DD to 190 DD.  Will this also affect the JBB?  I don't use mine any more but it was a staple of my middle years.  <br />
<br />
I'd hate to see new shaman not get the feeling of power it brought to the rest of us.<br />
<br />
Just noticed another interesting one that might affect an item.  Conflagration is being raised to 900 DD.  There are a couple of weapons that have this for a proc.  If they are changed that will make them very desireable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ice nukes being made same as poison nukes, looks like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Beliael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">VP now has a -10 mod on resists!<br />

Beliael</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">VP now has a -10 mod on resists!<br />
<br />
VP3 has a -30 mod - it looks like it scales up through the ranks.<br />
<br />
The changes to Winter's Roar will mean the shiny new FJBB and the original will now do less damage, unless by some fluke they do what they did with the SoW boots and create a seperate spell of the same name - fat chance of that though...<br />
<br />
Clerics and enchanters are losing their recast delay (even on post 65 spells), rangers and BSTs see theirs lowered from 30 to 18 seconds - in fact, pretty much every class with nukes is getting changes post 65 with the exception of paladins and a certain other class! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KB1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I see some decent changes in there for Necs too. I, how ever, do not see a resist check lowered on poison nukes, but do see dmg increase and lowered cast time and mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">wizards are getting crazily boosted throughout all levels.<br />

Edit: and recast on enchanter/cleric nukes is gone.<br />

As a Nec I want a damn MR debuffer or a better resist check on charm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
my two classes!!! (pally healing is getting a small bump, and they are getting a lower cast timer on their bigger single target heal.)<br />
<br />
we have been asking for a resist check on VP. not sure if -30 is going to be enough, but it will be nice to have some resist modifier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">looking over the change list again, it seems Auspice of the Hunter, Shield of Notes, and Dance of Blades are getting decent bumps.  god know auspice of the hunter really needed it (it was worthless before imo lol.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">On the other hand, wizard ghoul frog at low guk will nuke much harder if the change go live.    Lower to mid level melee will suffer from soloing caster mobs without good resist/hp  gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I saw one of the changes is making shock of magic from 1200-3k to 2400-3k random. /comfort PoFire kiters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well holy cow, I bet that port spell being a group spell, is like an evac from Time B to Time A.  Instead of having everyone gate or AE TL out from trials to get to the other, you can simply 'port your group' to time A.  That would be friggin sweet....no more melee bitching or raid leaders screaming because someone forgot a gate potion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Necs are the only class who can charm who do not have a MR debuffer. Why the hell shouldn't we get one?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hell the only thing I ever charmed is a rat or wolf in a lowbie are - not that I have ever buffed them fully and turned them loose on the unsuspecting populace  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Why would we need a MR debuffer for a charm? Our charm is worthless.<br />

Our then MT was screaming bloody murder after getting hit by half a dozen Garrison's Superior Sunderings in the deep. Best. Patch. Ever. :D</div></div><hr />

and<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5383&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
as i saw only enchanters have innate resist adjusts on their charm.<br />
<br />
while all the other classes do have MR debuffs to cast before thier charm, even druids, necros are the only class that can FD off the agro when charm breaks (outside of bard FM.)  That gives you a very heavy risk vs. reward advantage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>KB1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'm a nec not a shaman although I play one, a Shaman too. I was talking from my perspective. Sorry for the confusion. Druid charm &quot;used&quot; to have a neg resist mod, but looks like that got changed when ours did. Okay, I guess I don't want a MR debuff or a better charm. Wouldn't want to piss off the Druids. <br />
<br />
<br />
As for FD, well druids have that 14(?) minute snare that doesn't do damage to cast on the mob first. FD is fun when you got a 370 plus hitter hasted 70%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">All the various classes has their mr modifiers removed when the pop era charm nerf hit.  Maybe two years or so ago now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>KB1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Guess I will keep using my Tash orb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Why do you guys suck at linking?  Here's Druid Tash:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Necromancers ARE, however, the only class with charm that also gets Feign Death, Invulnerability, and the ability to deal 400+ dps (or whatever, I don't have a good number for necro) without a charmie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>KB1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">&lt;3 Necromancers. Funt to charm though, and it would come no where close to imbalancing since there are like 2 mobs worht charming outside of Veksar and Cahrdok. Chardok B is nice, but charm lasts aboyt 2 seconds, and Hate is an option.</div></div><hr />
