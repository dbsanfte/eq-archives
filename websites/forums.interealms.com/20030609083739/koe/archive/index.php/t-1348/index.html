<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cyrssi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm just looking for a few things...and I know it will much easier finding the stuff for my secondary than for my druid...especially since I'm pretty poor :p<br />
<br />
Stuff/Spells for Cyrssi: Blizzard (54 - rare I think), Girdle of Karana (55), Breath of Karana (56), Wake of Karana (56), Jade Reaver (for epic...can't make the scheduled CoM raid (fri night/weekends=bad...mmmkay?) and people ask 20-30k for them now)<br />
<br />
Stuff for my seconds (not as important as Cyr's wishlist): Ro armor (or a set of showing medium undyed fine plate), Imbue Fire Opal spell (have to buy from Ragefire before you pop him into a dragon)<br />
<br />
Send me an email at cyrssi@yahoo.com or send a tell ingame if you can help out. All the chars I play are tagged, so if you ask if I'm around in /gu I will see it and let you know :p</div></div><hr />
