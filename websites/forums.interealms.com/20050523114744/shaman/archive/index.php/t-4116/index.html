I usually say, you really don't need it.  It's a wasted buff slot.  Yet they insist since it improves AC.  So I'm wondering during raids if you give out AGI buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, plus I buff myself with AGI as well, especially when I solo since it does in fact give more AC.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
 Use the group version and just cast it on everyone, casters want it, healers want it, tanks should want it unless they are capped and they can click it off.....</div></div><hr />

Anyone asking for agility gets ignored. <br />
<br />
I notice a few do not agree with me or is it sarcasm?  Do you guys really consider it a wasted slot?  Just curious.<br />
<br />
I can see if your in a top guild with all stats maxed and have primals but for most in regular guilds that have the extra slot available I can not see why you wouldnt buff Agility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's wasted mana in most cases. In exp groups if I have people asking for it I use the free one off my boots. If it's on a raid I'll throw whatever the MA and puller ask for. Anyone else can wait till I get around to it. <br />
<br />
This might change when I get group agility and its not such a hassle to /rtarget etc. My main complaint about raid buffing period are the tards that won't send tells. They will continue to use  /shout no matter how many times you ask them. My Shaman's name is Cappi, it's not that hard to type out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Group agi and sta make buffing those two really easy for raids and xp groups.  No reason really not to buff unless its in the middle of the raid and your short on mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ryse_eq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My problem is.. sometimes these melees/casters have so many buffs (resist buffs, haste, vision buffs, ds, etc).  Many times they would ask for ... say focus or acumen when they were dispelled... you cast on them and it won't take hold because they're maxxed out (not only with good buffs but with AE dots, curses, etc).  <br />
<br />
My favorite line is when a group member is slowly dying and needs a heal.... &quot;Heal me!&quot;  (/cast Torpor)..... Spell will not take hold!.... shaman says - drop a buff man .... oh no to late, low hp = massive aggro. Chloroblast chlorobast... to late! Loading... please wait</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I almost never bother with agility because the AC it gives is so minimal. Can anyone confirm from a reliable source that it actually does help dodge, preferably with some logging?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cerdle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Do give AGI.  AC is comprised of 2 factors: mitigation and avoidance.  Your AC from armor helps with damage mitigation thus reducing maximum damage received.  Agility contributes to damage avoidance which means you get hit less often. <br />
<br />
I always give agi, sta to everyone, and any additional buffs on request.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I dont have logs but I do duo with my wifes pally, which due to n00bish stat distribution has an Agi that is right in the pooper (course the 2 neg 10 agi items she insists on dont help either)<br />
<br />
I can say beyond a shadow of a doubt that for melees for certain, and for me personally Higher AGI makes loads of difference in the &quot;getting hit&quot; catagory.<br />
<br />
Now at what point does it mean less... IE once your 60 lvl anyway will 50 more agi help a caster?? I dunno that, but I can tell ya it does make a diff to melee that are being hit. <br />
<br />
I also didnt take into account some people dont have the lvls yet to do group buff..... true that it would be a terrific hassle to buff the whole raid with this singly. Im also talking about lvl 58 and up... I dont really remember much about pre 55 its all a blur of XP grinding.....<br />
<br />
So I apologize to people that are to low or dont have group agi (I tend to forget that Im in not in the &quot;norm&quot; for shaman anymore), but I do believe it helps so maybe hit the main tanks and the debuffers. You can try your own experiments in places like FG..... grab a melee without max agi (preferably in the 120 range unbuffed) and let em take like 5 shrooms unslowed.... then try it with AGI buff and see the diff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My guild's main tank types will pitch a fit if you cast agi on them, wasting that slot.  The benefit is negligible at best, and according to them it has been parsed to be absolutely worthless.<br />
<br />
At this point, anyone on the raid that does not have Primal weapons who asks for Agility will receive Primal Essence.  Some Agility to pacify them, extra stam for hit points, extra dex for those that need, extra str for those that need.<br />
<br />
Melee who should know have done a ton of objective statistical analysis of agility, and have determined that the buff slot is much better used for some other effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Then those that dont want it can click it off.  With fungi and lodi on I had a standing agi of 70...and that chart is totally inaccurate for agi less than 80 as I would jump a good 75 points of ac when I went from 70agi to 120ish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I boycotted agi buffs years ago. It's a placebo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I don't buff agi on anyone unless they specifically ask for it to get them over an ac threshold (1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, etc).  Or, they suffer from wearing say, a Fungi and a Lodi shield and take an AGI penality for being under 75.<br />
<br />
Otherwise it takes up a buff slot for no reason.<br />
With bard buffs, ranger buffs, pally buffs, aego, focus, sta, resists, sk/necro buffs you cant click off, and any clicky buffs they may have - 15 buff slots just is not enough be able to waste on AGI and its very minimal returns.  Well, 14 buff slots actually because people with me better have a slot open for torpor and/or celestial elixir.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>joebooracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Buff single groups with it..but probably not needed on full scale raids..maybe the main tank</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">1) there are no ac thresholds<br />
<br />
2) agi doesn't affect defensive abilities like dodge<br />
<br />
3) agi is pointless as long as you're above 75</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I'll cast it if they ask for it.  Go-go gadget boots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">You all forget that as long as your buffed AGI is above your base AGI (naked) while encumbered, you lose no movement speed.<br />
<br />
I used AGI a lot in my days of hoarding Fine Steel from Soldung B for cash. I could go 150ish points over my STR limit, and feel very little from it because I was constantly at my base AGI, or more. (Precisely 75, by the way.)<br />

<br />
AGI adds like 10ac at most.  If your monk is getting killed before he can get off a feign, 10ac isnt going to save him.  He would be better served by primal essence (60+ hp) rather than the 10ac from our agi buff.<br />
<br />
When I buff, I cast group focus and sta on every group, then if I am in a good mood go through and cast primal essence on everyone.  If I'm not in a good mood, then I leave out PE unless they ask for it by name.  If they ask for agi, they can have.  There's no point in trying to tell a melee that the buff they are asking you really doesn't do anything.  They won't believe you no matter what you say.  Just like the wizard (who doesn't have manaburn yet) in my guild who thinks that manaburn crits do 36k damage and can't be convinced otherwise (highest crits are like 21.5k) even when I directed him to several threads on graffe's proving him wrong /sigh.</div></div><hr />

well, some monks seem to think there is some kind of hurdle when you break 1200, so if they are close and request AGI to put them over that, I give it to them.  I would not be surprised if you are correct, but it's the most reasonable of all agi requests I get so I comply.<br />

In xp groups, I buff HoS and Agi. I never bother with stamina, because we rarely have a cleric and so complete heal isn't a factor. And fights don't last long enough for people to run out of stamina.<br />
<br />
I notice that mostly higher level raiding people are saying they don't bother with Agi buffs - it stands to reason that as your natural AC goes up higher, the extra you get from Agi will make less and less difference.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't bother with Agi on raids either, stamina is more useful when you've got clerics, and the clerics can add way more AC than we can anyway.</div></div><hr />

not to flame you or anything, but that's excactly the problem with all these stat discussions in EQ....everybody thinks it does something special, and in 99% of the cases, it isn't true. one of my pet peeves are people who think some stat does something it clearly has never proven to do.<br />
<br />
also, verant has stated that agi doesn't affect defensive abilities - not that verant isn't full of **** most of the time, but i'll trust them on this one. dodge/riposte/parry/block etc are simply fixed percentage-wise, based on your skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Zamnon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Interesting takes on the agility issue.  Yes, the extra 10ac probably doesn't do much.  However wouldn't everyone jump at the chance to improve their 20ac helm to a 30ac? Or improve their chest piece from 17 to 27?  Why?  10ac makes no difference?<br />
Then keep your lower AC items.  Obviously i'm talking items not mana vs benefit, but still.   Solo'd for most of my 52lvl's and always agil myself because I look at the boost of AC as an upgrade to one of my items, certainly groups and raids are entirely different animals as some of these very logical and experienced shamen have attested.  Perhaps if my gear wasn't so ghetto I'd feel a bit different.  Like most stat discussions to buff or not to buff is largely situational.<br />

<br />
People who think it helps will not be convinced they are wrong.  Perception is reality.<br />
<br />
Oh, and Zam, there is a big difference between &quot;Raw&quot; AC and Total AC.  the 10 Raw ac from a Breastplate is then modified by the character's defense skill modifier to add probably around 30 Total AC to the average melee type (Adds 25 total ac to me).  Buffs only add to this &quot;Total&quot; AC number.   So a buff that adds 10 AC = an item with around 3 AC.</div></div><hr />

Is it not so that a high AGI helps you avoid getting hit altogether, before a check is done to your AC?<br />

This thread has been a confirmation on what I have been thinking recently about some buffs - ie they aren't worth the buff slot for large encounters.<br />

<br />
Talisman of the Cat makes agil buffing a group easy.  Same with stamina and Talisman of the Brute.  Those are two of my regular buffs in group.  I buff Cat, then Brute, then Focus.  reason being some mobs dispell and I'd rather they lost a less important buff.  So the two buffs serve a purpose as &quot;fakes&quot; in addition to adding slightly to overall stats/hps.  <br />
<br />
My monk definitely benefits from increased agility.  When I am lucky enuf to group with a shaman and get an agil buff, I am amazed at how much more the mobs whiff on me.  Agil is considered a prime stat for monks if you look at the starting char creation menu.  I can't prove any of this at the moment, but it's definitely not as worthless as say . . charisma.</div></div><hr />

And as any puller will tell, FD with 1 hp is better than none ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Hail,<br />
<br />
I buff agility when requested in single group settings.  If pulls are slow and mana is plentiful, I give it to everyone. :)  Rarely am I in a situation where buff slot decisions have to be made for anyone except me.  I know that in a few more levels this will likely change, but for now it is rare that I have groupmates clicking OFF a buff to keep a spot free.<br />
<br />
I recently joined a Kael e-mail list, with set raid times &amp; a maximum # per raid to reduce/prevent pick-up raid debacles.  I did this since my guild only rarely adventures there, and the boots, pants, and bracer would be nice to win as upgrades.  The list is now almost 100 people, from those with Uber-guild tags to unguilded folk 45+.<br />
<br />
I am usually the sole shaman on the raid, buffing an ever-changing melee intensive group of 20-25 non-guildies, so mana conservation becomes an issue.  I usually HoS everyone at the start (during grouping), and keep buffs on MA/SA/puller as my buff priority. My next buffs are going to my group's melees, and then buffing other melees as mana allows, which happens rarely.  Usually nobody but MA/puller (or monks with my group) get Deliriously Nimble.  Last night the monk puller expressly requested it, and immediately noticed when it faded.<br />
<br />
If the puller wants a buff, he/she's going to get it from me.  Same for MA/SA.  If my cleric/ench ask, I'll give it to them as well, as their happiness directly affects whether I live or die after the third Turgur's gets resisted in many cases.  Everyone else can wait until I have alot of extra mana or just do without.<br />
<br />
As for myself, I almost always have agi up.  Fungi's -10 agility hit puts me in the red zone, and the switch from 120ish agi to low 70's makes a HUGE difference in damage avoidance and mitigation.  On the order of ~75 AC.  YMMV<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Funny to see some shaman write off the obulous death shroud as a shoulder piece because &quot;They have enough mana&quot; and yet they can't toss a 150 mana buff on the tank.    :confused: <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Heh personally for me it isn't the mana issue, it's the trying to find the spell, demem one, mem agi, then target the person and cast.

<br />
However, increased AGI will reduce the chance that you get hit in melee. There are 2 components to AC, as has been mentioned, avoidance and mitigation. The mitigation portion of AC does exactly jack and **** above a certain level. The avoidance portion of AC can only be increased by increasing Defense skill or by increasing AGI. Once Defense skill is capped, that means AGI is the only way.<br />
<br />
Not getting hit == GUUD. <br />
Not getting hit &gt;&gt; getting hit for lower damage.<br />
<br />
Anyone who is going to possibly taking rampage damage, ripostes, or getting aggro should get AGI.<br />
<br />
As far as xp grouping goes, adding AC beyond a certain point doesn't lower average damage per hit. Adding AGI does decrease the amount you get hit, which is essentially the only way to lower damage taken by a tank without modifying the mobs attack speed or debuffing its atk.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't hurt to give melee buffs they want, and at 60 with all the tools it takes me a few mins to fully buff 2 groups and get mana back, no biggie.<br />
<br />
However, when I remember back to the times grouping in low 50's when melee want all buffs and fast pulls, I'd always buff groups in my own time, with what I considered important first, and agi always came very low on that list when mana was an issue and I would argue about it for fun, or threaten JB buffs heh.</div></div><hr />
