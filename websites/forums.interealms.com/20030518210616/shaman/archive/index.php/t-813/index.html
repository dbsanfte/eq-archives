<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I camped this guy in Hollowshade Moor for a few hours and got the following:<br />
<br />
Ceremonial Smudging Stick<br />
Range, AC 3, Wis +3, Mana +30, Sv Fire +10, Sv Magic +10, Sv Poison +10<br />
not too bad - nice resists<br />
<br />
Staff of Living Sand<br />
2H Blunt, Damage 24, Delay 42, AC 4, Sta +4, Wis +4, Mana 40, procs Smothering Sands<br />
very nice item - I just wish I were still using 2H Blunt<br />
<br />
Ornate Shell Pestle<br />
Primary, AC 5, Wis +5, Mana +50, NO DROP<br />
this has replaced my Spine Chill Spear when I'm grouped<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what level the Chieftain is, as he's green to my Level 55 Shaman. If you need some mid-level gear (or you have a gimpy higher-level character like mine) you should definitely check this guy out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Chief was a dark blue con to a level 46.<br />
<br />
I have camped the chief for a total of over 12 hours so far, and I have got 1 lousy pestle for my troubles...I hate you Verant!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Grimling Cheiftan has a very low drop rate, as near as I can tell...Hollowshade Moor has quite a few nice items for Wis Casters, but it's tough getting the mobs to drop anything.<br />
<br />
The Chieftan was blue to me at 40, and a tough camp to solo.  Had to pull 2 shamans so they wouldn't heal him, then 2 guards so they wouldn't aggro when I looted...basically the Chieftan himself is a mana sink...lots of HPs but is rooted so you just DoT the hell out of him.<br />
<br />
I was unable to keep up enough mana to clear all 5 mobs before they started respawning...so it was a PITA camping this guy.</div></div><hr />
