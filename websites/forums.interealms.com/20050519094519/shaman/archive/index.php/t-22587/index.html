<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,<br />
Saturday, I decided to try to parse Cripple effect on some mobs.<br />
I headed to Qinimi and pulled a Noc Havocblade (266 max hit) to ZI and started killing it only meleeing up to 50%.<br />
My plan was to cripple it at 50% then finish it melee, then parse the results.<br />
<br />
Everything went well, except that at 50%, when I casted cripple, I got the “your spell can’t hold” message. /shrug<br />
Then I remembered that this happened to me already in txevu once, while bored being 4th or 5th shaman there, I loaded cripple and casted it on every pull, just in case it’s doing something.<br />
At this time, I thought someone was casting a spell or using a weapon with a proc that was blocking cripple. But after investigating, I found nothing.<br />
<br />
This time, I stepped back, rooted the mob and loaded annul magic.<br />
After annulling the mob 2 or 3 times, I was able to land cripple.<br />
<br />
That means the mob was buffed with something blocking cripple !! sigh !<br />
I finished the log, but I was sure the parse wouldn’t mean anything not knowing what was the buff I annulled and what it was doing.<br />
I was sorta right as the result of the parse wasn’t what I was waiting for.<br />
<br />
So, after this, I pulled a noc darklurch with annul and started again !!<br />
This time, at 50% cripple landed fine.<br />
<br />
Here is the result ! <br />
Not included in the parse, the number of times the mob rampaged me:<br />
Noc Darklurch :9<br />
Noc Darklurch_crippled :8<br />
<br />
Number of proc on me (Chaos Claws = 430dd)<br />
Noc Darklurch :20<br />
Noc Darklurch_crippled :21<br />
<br />
As you can see, the mob damage is the same : max 207, min 40<br />
The average damage is a bit lower when mob is not crippled !! For me that’s prolly some statistical aberration and doesn’t mean that the mob damage were higher with cripple on =) But that surely prove that cripple doesn’t lower mob’s dps<br />
Same with the accuracy of the mob. Not crippled &gt; crippled /shrug<br />
<br />
As I melee’d the mob to kill it, maybe cripple do something on my dps ?<br />
<br />
Ok let’s see that <br />
<br />
My dps is a bit higher on the crippled mob (8.72 vs 8.22)<br />
My high is still 117 (time’s antithesis no haste), my min doesn’t mean anything as I bashed the mob at some point.<br />
I can’t really explaing why my dps was better. My average dmg can be better because the mob dodged less or because I missed less /shrug<br />
<br />
<br />
For info : mob’s dps / type (kick/bash/hit)<br />
not crippled <br />
<br />
crippled <br />
<br />
And the first noc I tanked    (the one with the buff that prevent cripple to land)<br />
I don’t know what the buff is, but I suspect it’s some sort of melee boost, once annulled, that would explain why the dps drop a bit and NOT cripple.<br />
<br />
Here is the log of the Darklurch   fight if you want to parse it yourself.<br />
<br />
My conclusion is that cripple isn’t doing anything noticeable on those xp mob and so, is completely useless against raid mob.<br />
Nothing we didn't know already tho..<br />
A good parse would be against some mean raid mob, but again, it will be hard to get numbers that mean something.<br />
<br />
Now go get us some real debuff !<br />
<br />

Actually they recently bumped it up again after Necromancers complained about hitting the 30 mark without much trouble during raids.  Believe it is now 50 or more.<br />

<br />
There is only one mob, but hitting me for 23 minutes. That's enough hit  from the same mob to be able to see  if it's doing something or not. I poked the mob enough to be able to see if cripple helps my dps or not.<br />
I think someone missread the part I m saying that the parse are not showing the numer of times the mob rampaged me (17 times, 9 times before cripple, 8 times after) /shrug <br />
That's the only 17 I can see in my post<br />
However, 1 mob isn't proving anything, yes, but we all know cripple isn't doing anything, so feel free to go log 17 fights of 23 min or more, I don't have time for that  :p  <br />
<br />
<br />
Probably more of a conflict (like Focus and that Cleric self-buff), not running out of buff slots.<br />
<br />
yup, mob only had Malos and  Turgur on.<br />
I also saw that problem in other GoD zone when I was only casting Cripple (and I m sure I was the first to cast on it.. OUCH !)<br />
<br />
<br />
if the mob has chanter haste on him VQ cripple dose not take hold theres lots of chanter mobs who go around and buff the otehr mobs, the opiset is the same VQ will not take hold on any mob/toon/pet when there is a cripple line already one him.<br />
<br />
It wasn't haste, I don't think.<br />
The delay of the mob wasn't different before and after annul magic.<br />
This would be annoying if cripple was doing anything  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Might not always make a big difference. But as long as it does some of the time that's all good in my book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If you can't tell any difference after 17 mobs, sounds pretty useless to me.<br />
<br />
That's exactly the right conclusion to draw from this (just replace &quot;17 mobs&quot; with &quot;17 minutes&quot;. If you can't tell that cripple is doing anything after 17 minutes (or 8 minutes), it's pretty useless.<br />
<br />
What we're asking is: is there a difference in average mob damage after it is crippled? To answer this question, we compare the average damage uncrippled with the average damage crippled, taking into account the normal variation we see in mob damage. If the difference in mean damage exceeds the standard deviation by a certain degree, then we conclude that whatever we changed had a significant effect.<br />
<br />
Statistically comparing two sample means is pretty easy. I can't do it from the data presented, because there is no measure of the standard deviation on the mob damage per hit given; however, knowing what I do about how widely mob hits vary, I can say with a good degree of certainty that there is no chance that we would be able to conclude that there is a difference after the mob is crippled. The difference in average hits is just too small.<br />
<br />
Ergo, cripple is useless as far as reducing mob dps.<br />
<br />
Increasing player dps? That's another question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I agree.<br />
<br />
In the EQ of today, you need to have a noticeable impact in whatever you do.<br />
<br />
If you choose to Cripple a mob, someone doesn't notice the spell cast/land should be asking &quot;What did you just do to the mob?!?!?&quot; not &quot;Did you do anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
All the &quot;desireable&quot; classes in current EQ have that . . . a very obvious impact on the encounter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'm not disagreeing with the premise that cripple is broken(I think it is too).  I just think you need a stronger set of numbers.  Everyone knows EQs random number generator is VERY streaky.  Also, you may want to edit your original post and state the amount of total time it took to kill these 17 mobs because no where in your post did you mention it was 23 minutes a piece(I didn't notice those were links to data).  Yes, your data is much stronger with ~391 minutes of parsing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Razzaziah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Actually 17 mobs is IDEAL parse.<br />
<br />
If you could tell a difference above and beyond the randomness of eq number generator (tm).  It would be worth investigation.  If you can not then why bother?<br />
<br />
For a raid target sure you can say anything = better then nothing.  And shaman dont have a lot to do for a mob who lives for 3+ minutes.<br />
For an exp target you start asking: What if that mana was used for a nuke / dot / anything else.<br />
<br />
What cripple does:<br />
- lowers chance to rampage, flurry and proc (well i heard it ;P)<br />
- lowers average damage of an NPC<br />
- increases damage against an NPC (lowers ac)<br />
<br />
For sake of argument lets say cripple does all of the above.  If people need 100000 line parses to say cripple lowers each category (or increases dps) by 5% how useful is it for exp grouping?<br />
<br />
Clerics have known for a LONG time you plan for the WORST damage an NPC does, not the average.  Rotations are setup and 90% of the complete heals may heal for 0-500 damage and in exp groups a CH may be started when the tank is at 100% life simply based on previous experiences with a particular mob.<br />
<br />
Example: Ra`Tuk Decimator (vxed+)<br />
Max 1 round of combat: 10x1150 (4 normal, 6 flurry) + 200x10<br />
Worst case damage = 13500 damage (ignoring riposte)<br />
<br />
It's the worst case folks.  It can happen because cripple provides no guarentees.  The only thing on the groups mind is make sure it DIES before it gets lucky.  If the mana you spent on cripple goes to a spell you normally keep up, that may matter.  If you spend it on cripple, something you can't even parse as being useful on the per mob basis... you are likely just wasting mana.<br />
<br />
Cripple is useless because it cant be measured in a per battle environment above and beyond the randomness of the game.  So use it in long fights, not short.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Beginning to wonder if casting cripple on those rats was helping that newbie.... or making things worse.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hey folks, remember when we GOT Cripple?  Way back at level 53?  If you run this same test on Kunark and Velious critters you get vastly different results.<br />
<br />
I believe that stats on critters provide critters with the same diminishing returns that we see when we buff up.  Mobs with strength set at 300 and AC at some ungodly number won't be as affected by Cripple as Mobs who have strength and AC set notably lower.  Taking 75 AGI from a that has 300 isn't going to affect it as much as taking 75 AGI from a mob that has 200.  Cripple vs. High end PoP and GoD mobs is a dubious use of mana.<br />
<br />
Perhaps if they doubled the stat debuff it might show an effect, as it gets back into the area of the stats that shows noticable change.<br />
<br />
As it is, Cripple has an effect, just not one that works where most of us tend to hunt.  It's lovely for PLing my project-of-the-month.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">To sum up:<br />
 1) cripple has no noticeable effects<br />
 2) that means cripple is probably not worth it on trash<br />
 3) it may or may not be useful on raid targets (seeing as you do not expect every spell to make a noticeable difference - it is not like you can tell the impact of a single nuke either)<br />
 4) cripple is occassionally blocked by something</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The real point Murtak was to give us a baseline to compare what is coming.<br />
<br />
They want to give us a Cripple upgrade in OOW . . . I'm thinking we don't want it, unless it has something akin to the direct combat mods that our new buffs are sportin.  Right now it doesn't.<br />
<br />
When we start bitching about it, I want to have the data to throw at them to prove just how worthless Cripple (and any stat decreasing upgrade) is.</div></div><hr />

You gave us a good information.<br />
Based on these data and analysis, we can ask Dev team to examine whether Cripple works as it has to be or not.<br />
If they said it works now, we can ask them to show us objective perse.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, they usually only check the program code, so they might not know how does the spell work at real EQ.<br />
So, this kind of data and suggestion will be helpfull for them to adjust the spell. (Anyway I hope they think so.)</div></div><hr />

I'll look for the chanter parse on this later (don't have time at work), but I remember a parse showing that overall pet DPS went up.  Think it's posted on the same host as the Nurgalopedia.  If anyone is ambitious they can find it before I get home.  I have to believe it's reached a point of extremely deminishing returns.  <br />
<br />
Part of the issue is that the ammount of the debuff is hard coded and does not scale with the abilities of a mob.  For example (not actual #'s)- taking 50 STR of a mob with a base STR of 150 is 1/3 of his total, but with mob STR well 300 it means much less.  How can they justify in the world of norrath a Shaman having to use the same spell on a level 50 Mob as a level 65+ mob?  Or did they expect that whole spell line to be of limited viable use?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Geal Icehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I find the lack of difference in ramp rate concerning. However, I can't say I'm suprised crippling the mob did not improve a shaman's melee damage against the mob. I suspect that a mobs AC and ATK are softcapped much like players. Since cripple only lowers its AC 35 points,  it may not have been enough to drop it down into another catagory on the hit table versus the shaman's ATK. You might want to do another test using a melee with higher ATK. Hopefully this won't show such ineffective results.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Hmm I do remember in places like ssra cripple would reduce flurries and rampages. And back when guardian wurms and Gantru Dalkenr were tough, cripple did have a noticable effect I think.<br />
I reckon an upgrade to cripple would be great, however, with removed aggro and combined with malos. Imagine a single buff which noticably aids group members to hit the mob, and at the same time noticably helps caster classes land spells more easily. Also, I think they should add graphics with the new expansion so that a group can see a mob has been debuffed. You can see a mob is either slowed or snared by its movement. As another note, it would be good to have a graphic to show someone avatared.(&lt;-someone who has been playing too much warcraft)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think that it would cause a Shaman to suddenly be able to solo a Gates mob, but it could boost the power of melees in the group.  It would be really nice for Shaman to have a debuff they could throw on Mobs that are immune to slows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Kenneth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Cripple only has three uses for me:<br />
<br />
1) When I really, really want agro it seems to do a good job of adhering the mob to my ass.<br />

2) When PLing, it does seem to make a huge difference on the ability for my alt to hit red mobs (which are green to me).<br />
<br />
3) When someone says, &quot;Pretty please cast cripple on this unslowable mob,&quot; I'll think about it.<br />
<br />
Of course, I haven't done any of these things in months.  So, right now, Cripple is firmly planted in the back of my book.  An uprade could change that so long as it directly affects the mob's attack/defense and not its stats (or if someone parses it to show it actually has a worthwhile effect).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I think you need to look at a wider range of mobs. IMO the one that you have choson is not suitable for this sort of parse.<br />
<br />
For a start, GoD mobs have relatively low atk values, as can be seen by the average damage being relatively close to the min in the cited example. You would expect the visible effects of cripple to be small in those circumstances, and probably you would need much larger parses to pick them up. The sort of mob you want is one that has a high relative atk, but not so high that is max hitting most of the time.<br />
<br />
On the AC debuff part, if your atk is low relative to the mobs AC, it will likely still be low after you have debuffed the mob, in other words you wouldnt expect to see much of a difference. Ideally you should look for a mob with AC at a level where you are average hitting close to max but not near max. Likewise, if your atk is high relative to the mob AC (ie you are max hitting much of the time), cripple would be expected to have little or no effect.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure about how it might affect proc rates. Unlike weapon procs, mob innate procs only go off when a swing actually hits the target (weapon procs go off on the swing, not the strike). So, unless you can affect accuracy (which cripple doesnt do), it shouldnt reduce proc rate (unless the probability of a proc is tied directly to mob DEX of course).</div></div><hr />

<br />
17 mobs of this sort are more than enough for this type of parse.<br />
<br />
When you think about it though, what incentives does Sony have for implementing a spell that further reduces the dmg output of mobs?  And more importantly, what type of incentive do we have for actually using this spell in an environment where mobs die so quickly as it is?<br />
<br />
Quite frankly, until Sony learns the definition of the word &quot;creativity,&quot; there are not going to be any quick solutions to the problems faced by the developers and players today.  They can't continue to copy and paste old spell lines while changing the type of content they throw at us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Its a good first step, but Tugela's points are very valid. It needs testing over a wider range of mobs and PCs.<br />
<br />
Modal damage is all about ATK vs AC. These two values need to be within certain boundaries (relative to one another) to see big changes in DPS.<br />
Working out when it makes a difference (and how big that difference is), and when it makes no noticeable difference at all (as suggested by the sample above) would put us on a much stronger footing to raise the perceived issues with SOE.<br />
<br />
Meaningful parsing would best be done with a melee character helping. Use of FA on that melee could then provide some variation in atk (make sure str is constant though) to see if this varies the effectiveness of cripple. Parses would be needed on a range of mobs, e.g from kunark, luclin, PoP, GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Actually, while Tugela does make a good point, it is really not applicable here as the odds of all 17 mob types being less likely to show cripple effects is pretty slim.  If cripple is that specific in nature, then it doesn't hold any promise of balancing the class in the content it is needed most for.  Shaman need a spell that makes a noticable difference, something in the ballbark of 10-20% damage mitigation (depending on mana cost, resist mod, cast time, duration and not a slow based spell) consistantly on mobs especially in the GoD expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I really don't think we can expect Sony to do anything that allows players to decrease the damage output (in a DPS sense).<br />
<br />
The simple fact is that if they wanted that sort of functionality they would never have put Slow mitigation in place.  We were already able to decrease mob DPS and they didn't like it.<br />
<br />
I can forsee them allowing us to Cripple in a sense that it increases our output of damage against the mob, but not in a sense that we decrease the mobs damage output against us.<br />
<br />
Basically, I don't see a new Cripple (or our old one for that matter) as a means of mitigating incoming damage so much as a means to increase damage output.</div></div><hr />
