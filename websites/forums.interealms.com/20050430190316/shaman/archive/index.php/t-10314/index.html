<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It's just occured to me what is happening with EQ.<br />
<br />
Sony are pioneering a new kind of MMORPG, the 'disposable expansions' MMORPG.  The last couple of times, new expansions have renderd the previous one obsolete.  You get all the new stuff, get a bit more uber then move onto the next one.<br />
<br />
That's it, that's all they seem to be good for now.  Personally, I would love to see them work on constantly revamping what they have already now.  Norrath is plenty big enough, there are hundreds of underused zones.  Add more dynamic content, like have goblins coming out of the moutains and taking over another zone for a few days, before being beaten back by an army raised from Halas.  <br />
<br />
Spend the time on having some worth while GM events, but BIG events.  I've yet to see a GM event that comes close to rivaling the 10th Ring War.  If the Devs weren't so busy creating more and more expansions, they could pour that thought and energy into making EQ more interesting then hack n'slash=loot and exp, or time consuming quest = item.<br />
<br />
For one thing, EQ is taking more and more space up on everyone's computers.  The devs don't seem to be afraid of using up our hard drives.  Spend time revamping and changing the old world.  OK it doesn't bring in as much phat cash for sony, but at least you'll keep your customers.<br />
<br />
Because before long, you're going to run out of gimmics to use as carrots for people (ergo, PoP instant travel, uber exp).  Then you really will have a hard time selling your new expansion with go faster stripes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">New expansions = new money.  Just seeing a &quot;new&quot; box on the shelf will attract some new players to the game, not to mention the $20 we all pay to get the expansion.  It's also new content.  If the expansion stopped at luclin, a lot more people (especially those who had finished it) might be prone to retire.  New expansions keep that revenue coming in.<br />
<br />
And with EQ2 on the horizons, I doubt they're looking really long-term at EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Espansions make more money, the stuff that you suggest doesn't. So don't expect to see them.<br />
<br />
So long<br />
Nirtox</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah but like I said, theres only so many carrots you can dangle in front of people before they just get fed up with it.<br />
<br />
I was only just botherd enough to buy PoP, Ykesha looks even less inspiring.  Just before PoP, everywhere I looked I saw people writing their goodbyes, because they were fed up of the way the game was going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">EQ was never about dynamic content. The one instance I can think of is the Sleeper and the results of waking it were deleterious to the players.<br />
<br />
The 'next EQ' will have a huge database where the actions of 5% doesn't affect the rest of the game. Quests will be individualized and c0ckblocking of content will be removed.<br />
<br />
Progress at your own pace. If this doesn't appeal to a certain segment - fek you - continue to zerg tier-3 content in eq.  Better yet - &quot;beat the game&quot; and move along.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So what's the big deal about people saying their goodbyes?  You expect people to be able to play EQ hardcore for 3-4 years without moving on?<br />
<br />
From what I can see EQ is STILL attracting new players and still has a major grip on many, many people.  The very fact that people post their goodbyes to forums like this tells you what kind of grip it has - how many people have you seen post their goodbyes to Diablo or Heroes of Might and Magic or Age of Empires?<br />
<br />
I have no problem with one expansion a year.  I am having some trouble with one in November and another one in February.  If they are going to start coming out with $20 expansions once a quarter it's basically like raising the rate by $7/month.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Soulcraver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Scurvey,<br />
<br />
I think you're right on the money.  Expansion in the context of an ever present world isn't about simply creating higher end content that makes what you did in the past completely obsolete it is about transforming the &quot;old/original&quot;, which in and of itself &quot;expands&quot; things.<br />
<br />
As it stands now the world doesn't evolve things just come into being with the new expansions.  That does mean that some zones will move to higher level because you let some big bad mob out of the bag by killing something or completing some quest.  It also could mean that faction standing change making the world more dynamic.  Since some mobs were vanquished, &quot;new&quot; mobs could take there place within the same zone.  You will also add new zones that support and build off of existing story lines, thereby expanding content as well.<br />
<br />
So many more creative things that can be done than just adding more &quot;power&quot; expansion after expansion.<br />
<br />
How do they make money from this?  Increase the monthly fee by $1.  You'll still come out with a buyable expansion every year to year and half to make more money, but make the current content becomes more dynamic.<br />
<br />
I've said it before I'll say it again, EQ now reminds  me of a good D&amp;D game gone bad.  Where the DM keeps giving the players more and more uber stuffs and then has to keep creating more and more uber fights until there is nothing left to fight but the Gods themselves.  And then they are even wussies to be slaughtered with the uber stuff that the unwiting DM gave them.<br />
<br />
Creativity goes a long way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Something to think about, the larger Norath gets, the more spread out they will be, the easier it will be to consolidate servers in the future, when EQ begins to decline.<br />
<br />
Will be a while still, EQ very healthy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>talas213</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The people to whom EQ was a labor of love have since left.  EQ is now run strictly as a business.  There only reason to add dynamic content or fix old content is to help retain players.  If player retention isn't a problem, you simply churn out expansions to generate revenue.  Game tweaks are still made to try to keep from alienating entire groups of players.  Sony's gotta love the business model.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">hmm , i know its &quot;hip&quot; to jump on the  &quot;Lets Bash SoE&quot; bandwagon ,  but i think people forget reality sometimes.<br />
<br />
First off , i dont think they are disposable expansions , maybe to you cause you have moved past it , but thats like saying baby food has no use in life cause you have grown up. For my alts and many newer EQ players and just plain lower level people , the previous content is right where it should be. People need to get off the uber trip. It reminds me of PC in luclin. People come there to level toons , but then some FULLY decked out twink comes and takes a bandit camp then bitches when people try to take some too saying there isnt enough. Ofourse there isnt , its not made for you to exploint with your twink. But for people of the correct level for that zone , with the correct gear for that zone , its a great place to solo or share camps.<br />
<br />
Another important point is that this is real coding we are talking about. SoE doesnt wave a magic +14 int wand with a mod of +200 to game making heh. This is lil bits one 1's and 0' . This game you play day in and day out is MASSIVLY expansive . If you change one lil bit of code like adding bank slots , there could be a HUGE amount of code you need to change to make thigns in he 3d game world interact right , plus thsoe changes they made ther might have repucussions else where. THis sint opening up a lil window and clicking and making it all better , we are talking thousands of line of CODE that need to be searches and altered. Its VERY time consuming and not a trival task. So you know , when you get mad about a patch and something messing up , realize they DO ahve a lil test a server network where they do check this stuff , but there is so many combonations of hardware and OS and PC that someone can be using , it is IMPOSSIBLE for them to effectivly test it all.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse i want them to revamp old content , i wish VP was redone to make it worth while to get the key again. <br />
<br />
But realize that with SOL and PoP things were introduced to the game that DID make it better. With LoY this will continue. BTW , lets not forget that they DID put out a poll and the vote leaned to MORE content NOT revamping old content. SO you cant really blame them as they just keep giving us what we ask for in alot of cases.<br />
<br />
<br />
my 2 cents ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think they are on their last &quot;hoorah.&quot;  A suprise expansion not long after PoP for levels 1-60, will be coming out.   I bet in a few months, an expansion for upper levels will come out (new zones, maybe revamps of pre-PoP dungeons, new epics?, spells, quests) and that may be the end.  I think you can only build a wall so high, before it either tumbles or run out of bricks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">For my alts and many newer EQ players and just plain lower level people<br />
How many people do you see in EC, Qeynos, Shadeweaver, or Misty Thicket?  All previous newbie areas have at most 1 newbie in them at a time.  Even Palludal Caverns isn't all that crowded since every character on the server levels from about 5-25 there now.  The only way to drag more interest down to actually play low level characters somewhat is to create a new race or class.  This will get some of the old players nostalgic enough to go to places like Befallen (which is mainly used only by Rogues for lockpicking skillups) with their new frog.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If only that were truly the case.  Alas; however, it is not.  The GM events in WC and the like are not true &quot;events&quot; but simply coded &quot;scripts&quot; that run on set dates.  For it to be a truly dynamic GM event would require the GMs to actively play a part (ie. be present and directly speak with players) in them.<br />
<br />
I, for one, support the &quot;revamp and re-use&quot; theory and vote for more dynamic GM events on regular (non-Legends) servers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I played muds for many years before EQ ever came out.  The muds were more dynamic and had far better quests than I have ever seen on EQ.  Generally at least once a week, 2 to 3 gods would get together and there would be dynamic content.  Totally new and unique creatures and events would take place.  Sometimes there would be a new area added ( ranging from as small as adding a few rooms to an already existing area to as large as a 100 room new zone ), but most of the quests took place in already existing zones.  I remember lots of quests where the god would take over a new creature and would require us to talk/kill/interact with other npcs, but would only give obscure clues.  The older players who really new the world shined, and it wasn't always about who was the highest level or had the best equipment.<br />
<br />
This stuff isn't that hard to do.  I took a plane jane Diku mud and turned it into a massive multiclass world, and I am not even a coder by profession.  Special Procedures for mobs and rooms can be hard coded, but any advanced mud had a scripting language for adding these things, and no hard C coding was required.  If scripting languages were invented for free open source muds, I would have a hard time believing that EQ doesn't have something similar.<br />
<br />
I understand that in a graphical world, it takes more time to come up with completely new graphical models. But, they wouldn't have to use a new model every single time.  And, by god, they are paid to do this.  How is it that a couple of unpaid college kids could come up with more compelling and dynamic content than a full blown gaming company that has millions of dollars of profit every year?<br />
<br />
I play on stormhammer, and even there I am extremely disappointed with the dynamic content.  Almost all of the quests are offered during the day when most people are at work.   There is only soo many times that I can do a royal rumble in the arena without it getting old.<br />
<br />
I also wanted to make a comment regarding the emptyness of old zones.  I turned 60 after PoP was released.  I told myself that I was gonna stay 60 until I got all my spells for 61/62 and was able to adventure in some of the places that I had always wanted to go.  A prime example of this is CT.  I tried to wait until I was 59-60 to go to CT, because I understood that it was a hard zone, but had great rewards ( high risk / high reward ).  Since PoP has been out, I have been totally unable to get anyone to go to CT.  Not only that, but I understand that the exp has been nerfed there as well ( I heard the zone multiplier was lowered ).  Do I level up and make this content even less rewarding?  I told myself I would give myself until I got can 5 to visit these old world zones, then move on.  I now have can 5, and still haven't visited CT.  I am feeling more and more pressure all the time to level up, for the good of the guild, but don't want to be stuck in PoP.  I know that many of the hardcore / ubers say &quot;level up, level up, exp is great in PoP&quot;, but they have already experienced the old content.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hmm new players?<br />
<br />
The only time I see new players are when the game is released in another country.  Although EQ has been available in the UK for some time.  It is only recently that you can get it from somewhere other then EB.  That was the same time that similer releases were made in other countries.<br />
<br />
This is the only time I have seen a noticable amount of new players, and that only on the new servers designed for them.<br />
<br />
Soulcraver seems to have explained what I'm trying to get across best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>sir0die</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">i once found a website that posted the current server populations of each server. It was a rwal time count. I was amazed to see well over 3,000 people per server (about 2 am CST), no how many servers are there? oh, about 20-30<br />
<br />
<br />
lets do so real quick math here.<br />
<br />
3000 people times 20 servers<br />
<br />
3000*20=60,000<br />
<br />
so thats an average of about 60,000 active accounts<br />
<br />
60,000 x $13/month= $780,000 per MONTH<br />
<br />
$780,000 x 12 months =  $9,360,000<br />
<br />
<br />
for as much as they make off us, is it wrong to ask for some decent stuff to be fix/patched.<br />
<br />
those figures are ONLY considering the monthlyy account payments, does not inclue the cost of buying initial software or exspansions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Couple of comments:<br />
<br />
First - to BattleAxe - I took the reference to &quot;lower-level players&quot; to refer to people who have not done NToV/VT etc.  - not as referring to the levels that exp in places like Mistmoor, etc.  There are a large number of players in EQ (at least on The Tribunal) who are not capable of doing Tier 3 content.  The above poster who wanted more content for lower levels was not necessarily referring to levels 11 to 45.  I have decided, for myself, that I want to progress &quot;through&quot; the content, working with my guild which has just become comfortable at doing HoT and is still working on getting comfortable doing Vindi.  Those &quot;lower level&quot;, or perhaps mid'level, camps are still contested.<br />
<br />
Second:  sir0die  underestimates the number of active accounts by looking at the number of pc's on line at one time.  There may, or may not, be 400,000 accounts active now.  VI started concealing that information, but the last figures I saw were in that neighborhood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well you ahve to understand that adding a new zone to work flawlessly with the game is a lil harder then making a MUD , ive played and made my own muds , ive coded VB and a lil c++ . ITs aqnother level of development. Im not saying nothign should be done , just trying to point out the ffort it takes to do what they doing and to do anything new.<br />
<br />
And as far as there not being new players. There is , ive met them ive brought them to the game , they do exist ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Scurvy is sooo right.<br />
 <br />
  Lets compare EQ to D&amp;D. If your GM always had you fight, loot, and exp how long would it take before you got bored? What does Everquest stand for? An endless quest, right? Now, lets look at there quests. You go talk to someone they give you a quest and then you go kill, loot, exp bring it back and thats it. Very rarely you actualy protect something as it walks or even have a war (10th ring stuff like that) , BUT how often is this the case about 1 % of the time aka not worth considering. I have quite a few friends that I've wanted to play EQ with me and they say it gets boring cause its same ole same ole kill/loot/exp. Counting them thats 4 friends that quit cause it bored them. 4x12 dollors a month x 12 months chaching $$. I guarantee EQ would hardly ever have anyone leave or quit to play a different MMRPG if there content was like what Scurvy described. IMHO whoever is in charge and is putting out all these expansions instead of improving the quality of EQ needs to go back to school. Expansions are not the Chaching way to go. Content&gt;expansions .Who here will go on to EQ2 if there pissed off about how EQ ended up? No one will.  <br />
<br />
My friend even talked me into trying out UO. Although I doubt I'll like it more. Guess I'll just have to wait till it comes in the mail hehe.:D</div></div><hr />

Wow Harvyst, seriously how do you find the time to do all these quests and such? 8th cudgel, 8th shawl, chardok sleeves, and level 65 since when, May?<br />
<br />
I would love to be able to do these quests, but I don't even have time to gain exp much better yet do all that too. Playing since last december I've only accomplished:<br />
<br />
Lvl 61<br />
0 AA<br />
no significant quests or tradeskills. I have like half of whats needed for the shawl<br />

<br />
I think a lot of people haven't caught on to the fact that EQ isn't like anything else we've seen in terms of longevity and replayability. Sony/VI have stated numerous times that while they plan to release EQ2, they also don't plan to discontinue EQ1 while it's still so popular.<br />
<br />
What does this mean? EQ1 isn't going anywhere in the forseeable future. Enjoy the game, it's been here for 3+ years and is still going strong. It'll only go away when everyone stops playing (read -- not any time soon).</div></div><hr />
