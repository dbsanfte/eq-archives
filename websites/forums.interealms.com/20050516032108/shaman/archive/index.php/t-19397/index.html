<br />
The last week or two, the bazaar has been so wierd. I always sell very cheap, for quick sale. I have been almost unable to sell a thing. I haven't sold anything for the last 4 days despite having a trader mule on for at least 75% of the time.<br />
<br />
I am selling solid mid range gear: Dented Kunzar Helm, Moss Covered Cloak, Blade of Insanity, Weatherbeaten Shoulderpads, Pantaloons of derangement, Mantle of Ill Omen, Ribbon of Empathy.<br />
<br />
I always set my prices cheap - cheaper than anyone else in the bazaar, and usually 20% cheaper than the &quot;normal&quot; going price. But recently I couldn't sell icecream in the sahara. Is this just an anomaly, or is the EQ economy Fubar on your server too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm just guessing, but it could be possible that people are saving their coppers for any new, interesting GoD drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I hear that Gloriana, but I am selling this stuff for less than half the price it was selling for a fortnight ago...<br />
<br />
Damn, I am such a whiner! I will shut up now. I am just bitching because I still need a bunch of level 64 and 65 spells, and I have enough cash items to make a dent in the list, but until I turn those items into hard plat, I got squat...<br />
<br />
...such is the way of the unguilded ghettoshammy! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just the odd way bazaar can be maybe.. bazar isn't it? :) A few weeks ago I made 50k selling random stuff(that is aLOT to me), recently I can't sell 2k worth of stuff.. just bad run I'm guesin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Noticed the same thing on solro.  All my stuff is cheaper than normal, but I can't sell anything.  Lost a lot of plat the last few weeks due to some bad luck with tradeskills and being forced to sell for dirt cheap to make a sale.  It isn't even worth buying components to do a TS combine, because people barely pay enough to cover the cost, let alone cover fails.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I haven't noticed a problem, but I'm selling low-end stuff for 2-4k mostly.  <br />
<br />
I have noticed a gradual decrease in prices in the bazaar on Ayonae Ro.  I attribute it to most peoples' desire to hoard platinum right now in anticipation of better drops from GoD.  If people stop paying 100k for an item, sellers will have to drop their price.  I actually saw a Cloak of Flames last night for 80k.  They haven't been 80k on Ayonae Ro since the Befallen banker/shark plat bug/etc. problems that flooded Norath with plat.  <br />
<br />
It's nice from a buyer's standpoint to actually see prices dropping, but I'm sure it sucks to be on the selling end.  Like I said, my stuff is low-end and hasn't changed in volume lately.<br />
<br />
I do think it will get worse up till GoD.  A LOT of people will be stockpiling plat to buy those spiffy new items that start showing up.  If it's anything like other expansions, some items will drop way too often, they'll get everyone going to that zone to get that item, and then nerf the drop rate.  Long Sword of Ethereal Energy got nerfed - too good an item for such an easy quest.  Windblade drops got nerfed.  You get the idea.  The trick is knowing when the market has bottomed out for an item and get yours right at that point.  I haven't managed to do that yet, even for a single item.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aekhold</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">On Karana the Bazaar is almost always over 500 Traders, but the prices are growing weirdly (does this word exist ?) : Ornate from 50k (gloves) to 250k (BP)... FT1 stuff with very low stats for 60-70k, etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">on Prexus there doesn't seem to be anything to buy.  Ornate is way to expensive, my gear seems as good as i can buy at 63.  <br />
<br />
so a few days ago i blew 20k and bought a Pile Driver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sometimes days will go by and I sell nothing.  Then in the space of two hours half of my crap has been bought.<br />
<br />
I still have 200 freakin' basilisk eggs clogging up an entire satchel.  I can't even give them away to guildmates.  If any bakers want eggs on Nameless, shoot me a PM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>umpaa_the_prophet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Same thing for me on the Rathe. I sell alot of veskar drops (moss covered hood, gomdurig, soulscream belt) and recently I haven't seen too much buying. I ussualy sell under the normal price if there's compition but nothings been moving lately except the haste belts. Couple weeks ago I'd sell a moss hood in 24 hrs easy. Now I've been sitting on 2 for a week with a well discounted price.<br />
<br />
People are saving there money for GoD stuff. I think that's kind of silly since prices are sky high when the expansion just comes out and then ussually settle down. Why save up your money to buy high unless you got that 'first one on the block' mentality.<br />
<br />
I guess my vendor will just be bored for another couple weeks.<br />
<br />
UMP!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm with Umpaa on this - if people are saving for GoD loot, they are gona have to be patient...prices are always ridiculously expensive early on in a new expansion, and don't settle back for a month or two. Sure, new GoD loot will probably devalue existing stuff by a bit - as has happened in the past.<br />
<br />
I guess I am just going to have to bide my time. I didn't really wat BoU, BoS, Quiescence, etc anyway...vastly overated, Oh yes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">A crackdown on exploits has reduced the amount of  pp in game too, dont forget alot of the prices on stuff were inflated over the last 4 or so months.<br />
<br />
I have noticed prices dropping on Brell also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Numgrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yea Aekhold, the Bazaar on Karana is ridiculous. So many permatraders and full time traders. They control the economy. Most are plat site mules that buy everything and triple the prices. Disgusting, can't buy anything for what it is actually worth, but very sweet undercutting them. <br />
<br />
Ornate pattern pricing has settled down somewhat thankfully. For awhile it was something like 250k for tunic, 225k for pants, 150k for bracer, 95k for boots and arms, and 60-70k for gloves. Gimme a break.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lukeian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I noticed that all the items have not been listing lately in bazaar. when you look for the item you got for sale it doesn't always show up yet others have the same item and theirs pop up. Not sure what that's all about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've been doing some heavy farming last few days.  I have noticed that we've had to drop prices quite a bit to get things moving.  But on the overall, things seem to me ok.  We've moved everything we put up, plus all the lore banked duplicates of everything ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>dmuscat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I play on Terris Thule and for the last week and a half we have been at max traders 550 nearly every night.  Great for buying, bad for selling.<br />
Quiescence now as low as 9k, Other stuff is not really dropping though.<br />
<br />
Not sure what is causing it, maybe to do with GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Koridar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Dang. 550!.  We're just now getting a consistent 300  traders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fumorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Dang. 550!.  We're just now getting a consistent 300  traders.<br />
<br />
On Innoruuk, we've pretty much been at 550 every night since it's been bumped up.  It sucks actually, either have to get in early, or sit around pressing Begin Trader for 10-20 minutes trying to get in.<br />
<br />
I honestly think they could jump up to 750 max traders and we would probably still hit the limit every night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Thornebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">on the Q server we have about 300 - 400 Traders avg. Things are either Way Over Priced or trying to give away and cant.<br />
<br />
Ornate Chain gloves avg for 30K Bracer 80K if your lucky most often 120K for a Bracer. and you will only see about 6-8 Chain partterns being sold and that is mostly gloves.<br />
<br />
I too have see where I will do a search on items and my trade does not show up at times.<br />
<br />
and i agree about 3-4 months ago prices in the Bazzar shot way up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The Nameless, 550 every night after folks are done with LDoN adventures.  I get up early am EST and check my mule almost every morning, place is full of vendors.  Unfortunately, lately no buyers.  Everyone is selling, dumping unused items or trying to generate some plat prior to GoD being released.  Problem is everyone is in &quot;sell&quot; mode and no one is in &quot;buy&quot; mode.  Capitalism does not work well this way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yes, Thunder.  You should buy my eggs for the good of the economy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Heh, the bazaar on Xev is very far from dead lately.  For many days now it's at max traders (550) by 11pm PST or so and even when I check my trader in the morning it's still near max traders.  I do find the bazaar to be quiet lately, but that could be because my trader toon's /ignore list is overloaded with casino cretins and other scammers/spammers.<br />
<br />
As far as selling stuff goes...I find it's very random and I rarely have consistent selling.  Usually it's more like several days of minimal or no selling combined with that rare day that my inventory gets hit hard (and I love those days).  Of course, I'm a noob and I don't have that great of stuff for sale but I do always have a ton of stuff for sale that's gradually scaling upwards, I've always had some kind of tradeskill thing that's in demand for sale, and it's all relative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I have a very hard time finding REALLY nice stuff to buy - 20kplus items - BoC, etc.  I am trying to hoard stuff the new class can use and make some pp selling to twinked Berzerkers.  Also getting hard to log on at nite - after 1 pm est takes about 10 minutes of trying to get into trader mode on Karana.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Morrighan-VZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">VZ economy is whacky and very cyclic. Patience is a virtue. :)<br />
<br />
Also, there's rumours of the Happy Fun Platselling/Macroing/Duping Monopoly playing games with economies of certain servers floating around - go look at Allakhazam's or The Safehouse for more detail (because posting it here will just get the thread locked).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Seems a little slow on Bertox, though most people are back in school and work after the holidays.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Yeah, there seems to be a big lull in buying now.  I have stuff that used to sell overnight, everytime I put it up sitting in my bags for days at a time now.  I figure it has to do with a couple of factors: 1) the big SOE casino that drained literally millions of plat out of the economy during it's short run without really putting anything of value back in the market and 2) The great exploit crackdown.  Now that the massive influx of platinum has come and gone and the economy has had a lot of that plat taken out of the system, we've hit a recession in the EQ economy.  We all are farming gear left and right to sell, but very few people have the plat to buy it with.  <br />
<br />
Will the economy recover? Eventually, and when it does prices will be much more reasonable than they've become in the past weeks/months.  In the meantime, be patient and remember that there are other avenues to acquiring the hard plat to buy what you need with, like farming stuff that is vendor sellable and farming coin drops.  It's slower and it's much harder work..but in the end it gets you to the same goal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Reave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">This exact thing has happened for a few weeks before every expansion.  It'll pick up again when GoD is released, and people are shopping for new gear for berzerkers, and buying/selling new gear from the new zones.</div></div><hr />
