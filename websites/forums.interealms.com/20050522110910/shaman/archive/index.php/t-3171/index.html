<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ssik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ahoy hoy - <br />
<br />
I was wondering if any of yous oracles out there have any experience dueling a lvl 60 necromancer. I have a friend who plays one and he has a BIG chip on his shoulder.  Anyhow, I was just going to lie in wait and maybe just heal myself and when he's outta mana, I'd swoop in and kill his arse.  My lack of experience in the matter is what's leading to such vague plans.  Is this a good plan?  I'm just going to root his EoT pet and not even worry about him....<br />
<br />
thoughts?   <br />
<br />
yer pal,<br />
ssik</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bozarkia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have and won, dueling a necro is battle of patience.  <br />
<br />
Using my dueling rules, no one makes a pet or buffs prior to the duel.  Everything you do must be done once you start the dueling.  What I did basically was just ran her oom, she'd try to dot me and I'd dispell.  She lifetapped me, I torpored, nuking her when I wasnt healing.<br />
<br />
It was a long fight that's for sure =) but I eventually overpowered her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ssik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok, well in case we're not in yer jurisdiction, Bozarkia  :) , I'd like to know how ppl deal with the buffs and the necros pet.  Seems to me that it would be a battle of attrition, but not sure if there's a particular moment it's best to strike or to just lie in wait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">First off, do not make a pet of your own.  It'll simply be lifetap DoT bait for the necro.<br />
<br />
Root the necros EoT.  Continually move out of range of his spells.  If you have a horse it'll help alot.  If not, SoW vs his jboots/run3 should be sufficient.<br />
<br />
If he's smart he'll have cure poison and cure disease potions so nothing you do will really dmg him.  You should definitely outlaw potions or you have no hope other than meleeing him to death.<br />
<br />
Your nukes will be absolutely ineffective except for Torrent of Poison and that only if he decides to stand still under the 3 waves.  The rest of your nukes will easily be negated by his fast casting taps that will land on you while you're casting the nuke.<br />
<br />
This is not a fight that's easy to win and if it's in close quarters, I don't think you'll be able to win at all.  In the outdoors I have beaten necromancers in duels with the simple rule of no cure disease or poison potions.  If potions are allowed you can try to kite the necro and everytime he dispells insidious decay reapply it then run again so that he never actually gets rid of your DoTs.  This would be tedious and there's alot of room for error.<br />
<br />
Shamans are pretty terrible at high-end PvP vs prepared opponents.  Resist gear makes our poison DoTs, even after Malo, utter crap.  They get resisted way too much.  Our nukes suck.  Dogdog is no good vs someone with a much much stronger pet like a necro.  If you open up instant click items (which you shouldnt) then the necro can pretty much instakill you.  If he has lifeburn he's going to make your job even more difficult.<br />
<br />
That's fine though, we're a support class.  Even in PvP, we're a support class :).<br />
<br />
I know there will be tons of replies about how I am wrong and how you can just DoT up the necro or just torpor until he's OOM or about how our poison DoTs are good in PvP... but you're wrong :).  There's no way a necro should be able to kill a shaman but there's also no way the shaman should be able to kill a necro.  Running the necro OOM shouldn't work either as they can use liche and regain life from low-con mobs around the battle or if it's in the arena and the quarters are tight, just from you :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baludien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">First off, don't allow potions, that would just be shooting yourself in the foot. In a duel with no potions, I don't see why this is such a tough battle for the shaman, we should be able to win rather easily. One thing to know, the necro will likely have DMF up for poison resist. Malo overwrites DMF. Yeah, i'm pretty sure that's a bug, and it may or may not have been fixed. Thus when you malo him his poison resist will probably be negative unless he's decked in PR gear. (Caught this tidbit in a necro vs shaman thread over on eqnecro) Thus it should be beyond easy to stick him with Bane of Nife, and then run out of his range so he can't lifetap you. Of course, this is all easier said than done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There used to be a really long, really great thread about how to beat necros.  Most of it talked about buff slot management.  The key was to have two instaclick buff items.  The ones he suggested were your sow boots and some instaclick gnomish tinker telescope.  When you clicked the telescope, it cast the a zoom-in type spell on yourself.  You of course instantly clicked this off, leaving the buff slot empty.  You made sure that sow always occupied the first slot, and the second slot was empty.  Whenever he dots you, just dispell it and reapply sow (at least thats what I remember.  I could be wrong).<br />
<br />
That is how you avoid getting killed by a necro.  As to how to kill him... I haven't a clue.  The guy that wrote this thread recommended running him out of mana, but I don't really see how that is going to work.  I don't know the numbers, but I know that their final lich form is massive mana regeneration.  If he doesn't have potions and he has crappy resists, you can probably lay all of your dots on him and run away out of lifetap range.  Never done it though, just an idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I recently killed a fellow 60 necro in my guild (in the areana).  we started with no buffs up at, or pets in his case.  For damage i used pox, preceded by our disease debuffs, and epic.  Dispell is your best friend to avoid his dots, annul magic will take the first two icons off yoru buffs, i had two insta clickies to help make sure i only striped what i wanted to.  He also lifetaped me a bunch but i just torpored it back, and eventualy he went OOM, even with arch lich running.  The only time i got worried was when he casted EoT, and being the silly i was root was not memed.  Luckly an unbuffed pet has very slow attk and i was able to mem root between swings.  after that i just kepthis pet rooted and kept dispelling dots and doting him till he went OOM and died.<br />
<br />
was a semi long but fun fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gikk the Unholy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Kill his pet, then keep epic on him (if he stays in range that long) and counteract his dots with torpor till hes oom... how difficult is that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think I would try to make em OOM, and if he tries to Lich?  Why not melee?  His AC is so damn low that a Shaman could interrupt with bash, and spear to death considering we hit for 50+<br />
<br />
I have never dueled a necro so I really dont know.  However my stratagies would be to run him oom, save mana for heals, and melee.  If you can get it sown to a melee fight, hes done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless you have FOUR INSTANT CLICKERS his golem wands, which he will have if he cares anything about PvPing, will still strip your buffs.<br />
<br />
Even after Malo, Bane of Nife will be resisted a TON on a well-equipped and prepared necromancer.<br />
<br />
EPIC DOT?  LOL YOU MUST BE FREAKING KIDDING?  You at the same time recommend that shamans dispell the necro DoTs and yet you assume the necro will not be dispelling yours?<br />
<br />
We are not made to kill classes that can heal themselves, that includes necromancers.  Heck, necros even get counteract disease which with 2 casters can cure pox before it does too much damage (3 if they have to cure the insidious decay first).  You can try to constantly reapply insidious decay to protect your Pox, but that works better in theory than it does in practice.<br />
<br />
With AA, it only gets worse on the shaman.  Lifeburn is quite overpowering in PvP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rigu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">golem wands have 4.0 cast time. if you buff before the fight, being a shaman, you have at least 4 crap buffs+clickables and make sure your torpor's arent at the top slots. kill his pet fast and keep your pet on him, maybe he'll banish it at beginning of fight but i doubt it.<br />
<br />
shamans own any other caster at high end pvp, especially in arena-type duels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>TetrianBrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">EPIC DOT? LOL YOU MUST BE FREAKING KIDDING? You at the same time recommend that shamans dispell the necro DoTs and yet you assume the necro will not be dispelling yours? <br />
<br />
Theres a small difference between necro dots and the shaman epic dot, yeah thats right, its free - if the necro dispells it, he looses mana, the shaman doesnt - if he doesnt, then it hurts(such a nice dilemma)<br />
<br />
Caster duels, generally, is a battle on mana - shamans have several very nice ways of dealing free damage, mainly epic, bracer and melee, necros dont.<br />
<br />
Play defensive, there isnt a penalty on heals as there is on damage spell(lifetaps mainly in this case) - and dots are easily disposed of with dispell or cure poison, and desease - use your epic / melee, other free damage, and hurt him with that, dont use anything offensive that costs mana, just run him oom slowly with you advantage on healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gikk the Unholy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">&quot;What a bunch of misinformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
What an unimaginative poorly used waste of a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Domifuling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Play defence, make sure you got enough pumice so you don't have to waste your mojo on dispells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Mem:<br />
blinding luminance<br />
root<br />
canna4<br />
annul<br />
torpor<br />
chloroblast<br />
suggestion: alacrity<br />
suggestion: regrowth  .... both these are deciding factors in a drawn out battle, but they are gambles as they take quite some time to buff initially.<br />
<br />
<br />
Buff: (assuming you buff during the fight)<br />
sowboots<br />
spyglass<br />
coldain ring<br />
alacrity<br />
regrowth<br />
<br />
Click away spyglass asap.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dmg shield reporting on, /particle low. Watch his spells. Go offensive with melee, but never cast a spell unless it is to counter something he is doing. Remember that if you dispell the opponent while your pet has your opponent targetted, your pet will poof. Same goes for the necro.<br />
<br />
Blind and/or root his pet. I usually opt for blind since you cant dispell it.<br />
<br />
Tear him apart with a twohander, time the slams when he is casting. Strafe around him to hit him in the back as much as possible. Make sure you dont rip yourself apart on his possible dmg shield.<br />
<br />
Watch out for him using two quickcasting spells like siphon strength and vortex of shadows to mess with your spell list. If he casts one of them on you, thus filling buffslot #2, make sure your spell list is full so that vortex lands at the end. Then click away sow asap. This means his next dot lands on buffslot #1. If the spell he casts after siphon strength has a cast time longer than 1.5secs it is NOT vortex and thus probably a dot, cancel sow to receive the dot in buffslot #1. Annul it and reapply sow.<br />
<br />
Learn to recognize spells like annul, liche, all necro dots, and the drains by their graphics. Learn their manacosts and cast times. Inspect him before the fight (if allowed) to check on possible focus items.. especially dd and cast time items.<br />
<br />
If pvp toys are allowed, have pumice, cure potions, ds potion, instasummon pet neck (from KC) and rod of malisement from Phinny (great to use on his pet). There are more out there but i'll leave that to you.<br />
<br />
In general a shaman should tear up a necro using melee. With a haste item and alacrity buffed (not celerity, it has too long cast time) and regrowth ticking along and a fungi you should be able to wear him down. Sprinkle in epic dots and an occasional bracer to confuse him. Might be worth it to epic dot his pet, but you would have to root and buff his pet with bracer of hidden before epicing, so that his dispell doesnt cancel your epic dot. Reapply root and bracer when he annuls.<br />
<br />
Necro and shaman are both extremely versatile in pvp. It would be near impossible to write out a comprehensive guide that covers every little aspect of such an encounter. A well played necro is very nasty in pvp, but often most necros plain out suck since they are not used to having to flex their pvp muscles to score kills.<br />
<br />
Good luck... and let us know how it goes. Make a log please. 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zillanex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Lot of talk about using the shaman epic, but no mention if the necro is using his, free dmg and snare :)<br />
<br />
In arch lich form the necro regens 35 mana per tick,and could even cast the group mana tap(but that one is costly), not shure if you can get rid of spells like bond of death/vexing mordania(lifetaps over time)<br />
<br />
Can't say i know much about pvp, my 51 nec would probably loose to a lvl 5 paladin :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Mil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Crystalized Pumice is mana free too and a real PvPr will carry a ton of it.<br />
<br />
Necro epic is easily resisted.  It's worthless.<br />
<br />
Casting time on shmn epic is HUGE.  Even if he just annulled himself, I doubt he'd ever feel the mana impact from it.<br />
<br />
Golem wands do have 4.0 second cast time, so what?  They're still going to debuff the heck out of you unless you have 4 instant clickers to guard your buffs.<br />
<br />
If you really think that shamans rip up other casters in arena style fights you need to go fight a necro who actually PvPs worth a crap.  Sure if you're fighting a necro who has less AAs than you or has less lvls or is just a goober and thinks he's going to DoT you up and watch you die, you'll win.  If you fight one who is smart though, he'll beat you down and with lifeburn, it'll be dang near impossible for you to avoid sinking low enough to be killed.  High-end necros don't have that many less HP than we do.<br />
<br />
The premise that the shaman will be able to run the necro OOM is flawed.  Go fight a necro who is playing defensively.  Don't assumet he necro is going to be a moron and go all out offense since you know the shaman won't be chain nuking or casting Malo then trying to DoT him up.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there are threads on necro boards about how wussy shamans are in duels because all they do is DoT you up and you can outtap it ;).  That doesn't make it any more true than the assertions here that chain torporing while epic DoTing will run your necro enemy OOM or that your epic DoT somehow will not be dispelled or that dispelling that DoT every 9 seconds is going to run the necro OOM.<br />
<br />
PreLuclin Shaman vs Necro was an incredibly long and tedious fight with no clear winner in sight.  Post Luclin, Necromancers have a clear advantage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ssik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">He just turned 60 and has little PvP experience, no epic, no alt experience points, no funeral pyre, golem wands, or pumice stones.  He does have Nightmare hides or whatever from fear that cure blindness.  I think that's all that he's got going for him.  Oh, he does have extended affliction III hat, and supple scale armband for casting range.<br />
<br />
I haven't gotten him to engage me yet.  But I look at it this way - even if he strikes me down, I will become more powerful in death than he could have possibly imagined.  <br />

Thanks for the pep talk, great info everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Mil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Well if he has no AAs and none of the basic prep tools for PvP (golem wands, pumice) then you should beat him down just by having those.</div></div><hr />
