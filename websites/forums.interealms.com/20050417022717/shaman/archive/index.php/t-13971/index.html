<br />
I wanted to ask how everyone tests there xml without loading up EQ every single time.   I'V been very intrested in the customizable UI and id like to modify slightly a few that i have found.<br />
<br />
<br />
This may not be the place for it but i have been a long time lurker and the information compilied within these forums has made my life as a shaman much more informative.   Who would have known that you should look for AC/HP items over Wis/Mana gear.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance you any assistance you can aquire.<br />

Use Windowed mode and switch between notepad or whatever you use to edit the xml, and Everquest.<br />
<br />
Reload the UI with /loadskin every time you make a change to see the effect.<br />
<br />
There is no need to restart EQ every time you make an xml change.</div></div><hr />

Excuse my ignorance but i know how to get into windowed mode but my mouse will not be released by Everquest.  i read somewhere that to release the mouse you press [CTRL] + [ALT] + R, I suspect this is wrong can anyone clarify?<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />
