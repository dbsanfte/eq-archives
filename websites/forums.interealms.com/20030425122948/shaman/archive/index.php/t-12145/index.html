<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kriyn Nutzforcatnip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm new to posting here, but have been reading other's posts for a while.  I've just finished my magelo profile and would like some suggestions on my gear.  I've been changing my gear from high wis to ac, hps, mana and wis.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.   :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You look pretty good to me.  A few options:<br />
<br />
Head to Nadox and camp Spiritcharmer for the bracer (see my magelo) to replace your pbb.<br />
<br />
I'd replace the velium jaded ring with either coral ring (see my magelo, drops in Nadox, too), another 6.65, or a shadel bandit ring.<br />
<br />
Start working on Solstice earring.<br />
<br />
Look for the head slot in my magelo (forget name now.).  They're down around 50p.<br />
<br />
Other than that, you look pretty good to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Your bracers need upgrading. Do Coldain Military Bracer quest (from memory, 10AC +5str +5wis +5cold Extended Affliction III). Go to Karnors Castle and ask politely for looting rights on a Jarsarth Bracer. Buy a Sarnak Battle Shield (approx 500plat, depending on server) and keep paw of oppalla for use in primary hand when on large raids and you are just abuff whore and spot healer. You can buy earring upgrades reasonably cheap: Earring of purity / cleansing / twisted leaves are the obvious upgrades, or if you have more money to spend, skull charm or silver hammer earring</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Some cheap hp/ac upgrades you can make are a sarnak battle shield (500pp-ish), dusty soriz boots (500pp-ish), a spider-fur belt (200pp), coterie general cape (200pp), metal-linked crown (50pp).. those all have 40hp's each, except the crown (35).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kriyn Nutzforcatnip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've been solo'ing in Rm since 44 and now i'm 46.  The xp was fast and the pp was even better.  Since my last post i've updated my gear and I am very happy with it.  Thanks for all the suggestions from those that replied.  :) <br />
