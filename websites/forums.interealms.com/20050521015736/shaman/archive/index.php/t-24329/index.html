<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have noted several posts both here at the crucible and on the SoE boards regarding stacking issues with the Ancestral Aid AA . Im going too be attempting too assist in gathering some community feedback on these issues .<br />
I personaly have the AA only at rank one currently . I have noted that it dosent stack with Diaku . I have noted that it dosent stack with the druid &quot;Spirit of the wood&quot; AA . I have gathered that it dosent seem too stack with the Rabid bear AA &quot;I dont have rabid bear personaly but I gather from my fellow posters that they dont stack&quot; .<br />
<br />
Are those all of the major stacking Issues with this AA ? Are there more Issues that I may have missed ? If so I would appriciate any feedback that anyone may care too share .<br />
<br />
My personal veiws on this are as follows . I like the AA a lot . While it would be nice for it too stack with SotW it may be 'intended' not too .<br />
However it is very agrivating that it dosent seem too stack with some of our own buffs .<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance too anyone who cares too share information . My hopes are too attempt too bring the stacking Issues with this AA too the attention of the SoE guys &quot;Brenlo , ect&quot; as soon as I feel I have done my job in gathering the opinions of the community on it .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Level 1 is blocked by Daiku.<br />
Levels 2 and 3 are not.<br />
<br />
This may be an irritation at lower levels where the buff is still cast but at my middle of the tier level (elemental, 1 kill from time) it's a buff that isn't cast, thus it has no bearing.<br />
<br />
It does not stack with SotW but I see no reason why it should.<br />
<br />
Until I get another 800 aa I won't be getting Rabid Bear so I have no idea about that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes I have serious stacking issues with this spell beyond diaku.<br />
<br />
Something else is blocking it other than Diaku, it usually doesn't take hold on group members and diaku is no longer up. I haven't figured yet what is the issue.<br />
<br />
Ideally I wish someone would make a definitive list of what blocks it and what doesn't. I think a bunch of things may be blocking it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes I have serious stacking issues with this spell beyond diaku.<br />
<br />
Something else is blocking it other than Diaku, <br />
<br />
It seems this way to me as well . So im trying to nail down all possible stacking issues before i go to Brenlo and friends with it .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">probably no more empty buff slots.<br />
<br />
i get the 'did not take hold' message more often when i group with a cleric and druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Diaku is still used by higher end guilds (Post Time) during an Uqua raid.<br />
Some folks just lose so much Str they cant move without it.<br />
Usually on classes where str is not normally a stat they would care about.<br />
Though I have to say it is a fun side effect to snare people you heal (Torpor style!) ;)<br />
<br />
The other times I have noticed it not taking hold is usually buff slots.<br />
However agree there does seem to be times it doesnt stick on others.<br />
One explanation I came up with is Pets.<br />
Mages with Frenzied Burnout and the aa for group buffs to hit their pet.<br />
<br />
There is one other bug I noticed it doesnt tell you who it lands on.<br />
Other group spells will but this one does not.<br />
That makes it pretty hard to pin down who it didnt land on to ask them why.<br />
<br />
While your at Diaku issues another to add to your list would be the fact single and group Diaku dont have the same affects.<br />
<br />
Talisman of the Diaku  <br />
  <br />

5:  Increase STR by 45 <br />
6:  Increase DEX by 35 <br />
 <br />
Strength of the Diaku<br />
 <br />
Slot Description <br />
5:  Increase STR by 35 <br />
6:  Increase DEX by 28 <br />
 <br />
While not a pressing issue its still a bug from the PoP era that remains unfixed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you Maccuul , noted and I will make sure to mention both of these Issues .<br />
<br />
On a side note ... when you get above rank 1 in ancestral aid does it then totaly OVERWRIGHT diaku ? Thusly forceing you too rebuff people if your trying to keep diaku on them ?<br />
Again I personaly only have Ancestral Aid 1 so i cannot test this myself .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Baman the Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I haven't tried it yet, but on a raid last night I was told Spirit of Might (the damage modifier buff) blocks Ancestral Aid.  I can check tonight once I get home from work though.  If that's not the case, sorry for the misinformation :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i dont have this AA, but a guildie has rank 1, he said it didnt stack with regen, could that be the 'other thing blocking it?'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Here are the ranks and what they don't stack with:<br />
<br />
To read this.  Each spell has a specific stacking ability with other spells/items.  The spell itself has different slots.  Therefore, ancestral aid 1 has seven slots.  Each slot has specific ability (for instance, slot 3 has the ability of increasing the dex cap)  If anything is in the same slot as it, it will either not stack or override it.  Now, it will override if the features of AA are better or the same than what each person already has on.  This is why it will not override Rabid Bear or Diaku (cause of them having a higher dex and str value in the same slot) and also why it won't override Spirit of the Grove AA until you get AA2/3.  However if the druid has spirit of the grove 3rd rank than you could only override it if you have the 3rd rank of AA.  If you don't notice, there is nothing on here stacking issue wise with using it in combination with our HoT spells and epic click on at the same time $$<br />
<br />
To cap this off.. if you ever have a question about what will and will not stack on any spells, I suggest you use this website: Lucy (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/) and imput the name of the spell.  After that look to the top right and click on the stacking button.  There it will tell you exactly what it will and will not stack with.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">And to show you something else that doesn't stack with stuff... check these two out <br />
<br />
Talisman of Sense (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/stacking.html?id=5399&amp;source=Live)  <br />
<br />
Slot 1 will not stack with anything that increases chance to avoid melee.  So, if you warr uses their fortitude disc, you will have to give them sense again cause the disc will override it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Talisman of Might (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/stacking.html?id=5409&amp;source=Live)  <br />
<br />
Using might on a melee, you will have to recast it if a beastlord uses their Bestial Furry disc, or if a say rogue uses their duelist disc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Just to give you guys an update I have submited the info gathered by myself and the good shamans that have posted in this thred . Also the wonderfull info about Ancestral Aid stacking Issues that was submited to me by PM &quot;thanks guys&quot; .<br />
So anyway I have gathered the info about this issue and it has been submited through the proper channels . If I get an update I will gladly pass along the info to you guys here . Also note that if some time passes and I hear nothing I will press the issue further .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i would like to have back my aa's i put in that one,imo it will take a long time until it's been fixed (if it's ever fixed).<br />
<br />
i casted like 15 times since i got it,and never landed so far :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>ribeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">OK, been experimenting with AA lvl 1.  Found that it DOES stack with spirit of might, spirit of sense, all the regular buffs.<br />
<br />
However, it does not stack with the chanter haste buffs that add stats, which is extremely frustrating.  So imo, at lvl 1 anyways, its almost useless unless you find melees w/o chanter haste.<br />
<br />
I can't follow all that Lucy stacking nonsense either... its just goobly guck to me and I don't feel like staring at it anymore.<br />
<br />
So that leaves me...should I take a chance and put 5 more AA into getting Aid lvl 2 or just scrap it =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Azmaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I Have Ancestral Aid at lvl 3 and it does stack with Talisman of the Diaku and Strength of the Diaku just fine.  The onaly time it did not stack is when it was at lvl 1 or the person did not have an open buff slot.  It will not stack with the druid SOTW but will stack with Bst MGB Heal and Clr MGB Heal. Ancestral Aid can be used with MGB so that the raids can now have shamans on the MGB Heal chain :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">thanks azmaria..............<br />
<br />
i was so frustrated whit that aa(lv 1),but if we don t have stacking issues when we got the lv 3,i will go get them as fast as i can :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Azmaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Update Just found out last night Ancestral Aid stacks with the new druid group heal aa. SOTG just FYI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yeah as of the last patch the changes went live to make ancestral aid stack with pretty much everything. They did how ever take one little typo live too. The 3rd level only adds 30 str instead of 90 str now. Not that I care but would be nice if they fixed that too =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am very happy to know the Stacking Issues were fixed as per our request . I will get on the 30str thing .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dirkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Aye that just seems like a typo to me, they need to be more careful :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Got with Kyth just now and I have an update regarding Ancestral Aid .<br />
<br />
Firstly the stacking Issues that I reported last week , which Kyth in turn reported to the Dev's were indeed fixed in the last patch . So much thanks to all of you that helped me in gathering feedback on this issue .<br />
<br />
Secondly I informed Kyth of the reports concerning that rank 3 Ancestral Aid was only giving 30pt stat boost . She got with a dev right away and reported back to me quickly that this was indeed a simple &quot;typo&quot; . It is now known to the proper dev and should be fixed soon .</div></div><hr />
