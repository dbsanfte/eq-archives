<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mhaim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First post on this board, there seem to be a lot of really knowledgable folks here, while not nearly as many sh!theads as some other boards *coughSKOcough*<br />
<br />
Anyway, the topic pretty much says it all...I am a level 38 shaman, been leveling alongside my 2boxed SK...and have spent pretty much the whole time on my butt. My defense skill is a whopping 7. My AC is 244. If my SK loses agro, I go down like a jonesing crack whore. It's not really that big of a deal now, but I realize the higher I get, the more of a pain in the ass it's going to be to raise Defense. I don't want to be level 65 and die in 2 hits from a PoP mob. So I'm looking for easy ways to raise it now.<br />
<br />
I did a search and found a related topic, but it was for a level 25 shaman. I understand that you can't raise Defense from green con mobs. What about light blue? A few of the needlites in echo are still lb, and they seem like a good choice due to low damage and high rate of attack. I let one beat on me long enough to have to back off and heal three times, and didn't get a single point.<br />
<br />
Also, what about dueling a PC? I tried giving my SK a shiv and he beat on me for about 5 minutes, again no skill ups...I have heard of people dueling pets, but that's not really an option as my SK's pet is waay green.<br />
<br />
So am I basically stuck to fighting dark blues? Or did I just have a bad run with the RNG?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pronigious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Defense is rough to raise, it takes a LONG time.  there are some traps in TOFS that will hit you continually that you can use to raise defense (they are on the second floor) they work into early 50s IIRC.  Another choice at your level would be something in old world.  maybe south karana, or guka, or sola.  Most old world mobs hit like wizards compared to newer zones.  I personally recoommend getting level 44, and picking up Stoicism, then raising defense, so you don't have to back out and go back in as often, just keep stoic on yourself.  Entrance to lower guk may be good for this, as there is a zone out near-by if you run into trouble.  I'd also use that time to pick up weapon skills if you haven't yet, just for fun, and they will raise a LOT faster than defense, and its nice to see numbers come up.  Also, AGI will help your Defense score go up, and DEX will help your weapons skills go up, so buff/buy some gear that will help you a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">pc's wont get you skill increases, pet should though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you duel someone and they have a blue con pet, that'll work.  Other shaman and enchanters have really weak pets, so that's your best bet.  If you want to do it while exping, the Overthere was a good spot for upper 30's.  The mobs are generally lower level blues (except a few tougher varieties mixed in), that you should be able to handle tanking.  You'll probably want to get to 39 and get the new slow though, to make it just a little bit easier.<br />
<br />
I'd also agree on possibly going to 44 and getting stoicism.  You can keep yourself alive for a long time against blue con mobs with it.  Look for old world stuff, it's generally incredibly weak compared to other expansions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">arent some needlites still blue at that level ? Even if its light blue i think you get a skill up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">you can get skill ups off light blues, but REALLY REALLY rarely.  I have even heard it tell that someone got a skill up (just one in all their life) off a green con mob, though I'm not putting stock in it.<br />
<br />
Really, the best thing to do is get a shaman friend, have them summon their dogdog (whichever is just conning blue to you) have them haste it, spirit quickening on it, and then duel you.  Also, have them give it two weaps so it'll double attack.  That's quite a bit of hits, so your skill will go up fast enough.  I have heard (though have not confirmed) that you get defense skill ups from misses, so make sure it's the lowest blue con they can summon, and cast your highest version of cripple on it.  The shaman can heal you from time to time, and you'll get your skillups soon enough.  make sure to hit back a bit,  as it's also a great way to train up those neglected weapon skills.</div></div><hr />

Well that's helpful advice...<br />
<br />
I have even heard it tell that someone got a skill up (just one in all their life) off a green con mob, though I'm not putting stock in it.<br />
This used to happen before there was Light Blue con mobs.  They were &quot;high-green&quot; mobs.  The con color was simply changed to differentiate between them.  If you could get XP off of 'em, you can get skillups off of 'em.<br />
<br />
You might want to try getting a druid to DS you, then pull some of the giants at the FM fort (I think...not 100% sure on their level) and just let them hammer on you for a while.  The DS'll eat 'em up, plus you'll work on your offense/defense.  I did this with some friends (65 druid, 65 SK...both bored, so decided to kill some time with me).  SK pulled, Druid DS'd and healed, and I just melee'd.  I do know that I finished my last few points of DEF on RM giants, but actually finding enough to fulfill your needs might be problematic.  Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Gunthak skellies/undead mobs. They will be blue to you but hit like wimps once slowed and crippled. Solo them from 38 to 44. By the time you are 44 (pretty quickly as these are great xp mobs) your skill will be maxxed or close to it along side your offense, dodge and weapon skills.<br />
<br />
If you don't have one, get a soulstripper to melee with. The 75 hp lifetap proc saves tons of mana once you get above 100 skill.<br />
<br />
If you can get a druid to assist, don't slow the mobs. You will get hit more often (swung at more often) which will increase chance to raise skill and the DS will take the place of the slow benefits (in short, DS will just about break even on mob dieing in same amount of time).<br />
<br />
You will have to fight these as standard mobs ... meaning, slow, dot, cripple and be prepared to step back (root or dog aggro) and self heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Drolvargs at SoNH/FV zone line (NE corner) would be great for this...they are wimps and there is plenty of room to move around if oyu need too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yes, you actually can heal someone that you are dueling with (I use this meathod to work up my guildie's alt's weapon skills all the time).  You can even buff them...<br />
<br />
Want to hear something cooky though?  You can't heal anyone outside the duel.  You can't buff them either.<br />
<br />
Every damn time I am in a duel, I /feedback this, as it's just stupid and annoying.  I usually am bored stiff when training up a friends weap skills and it would be nice to be able to pass out free buffs or something while doing this.  Not that THAT is the reason why it is stupid and annoying, but it adds to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I believe you can also go to the trainer and pay for skill-ups. Whent eh cost gets to be too prohibitve, then follow the advice of the Elders above.<br />
<br />
Heck, it'll cost a few plat at most to raise your defense to 25.<br />
<br />
BTW, what is your gear like? My Necro (24) who has a pretty crappy defense (iirc) still has an AC &gt; 300.  Not gonna do you a lot of good to fight the appropriate MOB if your HP's stink too, but you have a WIS of 250.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You can't buy defense skillups :). At round 38 I was soloing crazed goblins by the PoK stone in Butcherblock for defense skillups - might have been a little lower. max hit would be about 60. Get your agility as high as possible - that's the stat that helps raise defense. It's gonna take you a looong time to raise that skill though - My mage has nowhere near your lack of skill &amp; he hardly gets any skillups. Chain classes might be on a different table though, I've noticed my SK gets skillups way faster than my shaman did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Defense skillups seem to happen faster if you get multiple mobs beating on you too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
also if you can scrounge up some shaman friends you can all head to the arena and have several pets pound on you while the pet owners help keep you healed. that would probably be the fastest but also requires much more outside help.<br />
<br />
dont slow whatever is beating on you. that defeats the whole purpose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">have not seen it suggested before but if you have luclin, just go to DSP at the NL zone, set your camp on the right side so you will avoid the fungi's train and the wolf that pop near the trees and simply hunt zelniaks :)<br />
<br />
they don't hit much, are still blue at your level and also have no faction.<br />
<br />
pull one to camp, slow it (or not, as stated above: more hit = more chance to have defense raised, but it would be wise to start slowing them first and when your defense will be a little more decent, stop slowing), root it and let it hit you..  then heal yourself when needed and wait for defense to increase.<br />
<br />
just remember it'll take a damn long time to cap it (level related) so don't hope it to increase like that.. and while raising your defense take the opportunity to train your weapon skills too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">dont slow whatever is beating on you. that defeats the whole purpose.<br />
<br />
I disagree. Theoretically, not slowing makes sense, but in paractice, slowing the mob allows you to heal yourself, canni, root and back off, etc.<br />
<br />
To me, maxing defence is not about gimmicks and pet class duelling exploits. Maxing defence is about changing your attitude to how you play your shaman.<br />
<br />
It is about getting out of a root n rot or poor-mans druid / cleric mentality, and getting in a mob's face for a while. Its about tanking for your puppy. It is about realising that you can go toe to toe with mobs and win. Rasing defence is not some chore that you take time out to achieve. Rasing defence is something that comes with the territory, and if it doesn't, one might wish to consider re-rolling something in leather armor....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Razir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">A few observations.<br />
<br />
Pet dueling works great.  I had a cleric I had 2 boxed with a warrior that needed his defense skill fixed.  Got it from 17 to 184 in about 5 hours by dueling my shamans pet.  Interestingly the shaman's pet would poof if I healed the cleric.<br />
<br />
I have PL'ed using druid's DS before, never saw defensive skill up ever.  I can't say that's not the RNG at work but my gut tells me that a DS prevents defensive skill ups<br />

<br />
Gotta second the pet dueling thing.  Had  a friend get an alt enchanter to 60+ with a defense around 10. (He was a good enchanter, just I don't think he started getting hit until he was high 50's, and by that time, it gets REALLY hard to raise defense normally)<br />
<br />
I was able to heal him, so all I did was buff him up as best I could, (lvl 65 buffs) and keep him healed while pet beat on him.  Of course, FA and Q helped a lot to make this fast; due to the level requirements of those spells, your best best would be a shaman with Stoic and HoS/Agi buff.<br />
<br />
As far as the DS thing goes, I had a monk getting PL'd in SolA, and with Druid DS was still getting def increases, but this was a while ago, maybe things have changed, I don't know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>thorvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">A good blend of AC/HP and wis would be a good way to restart your gear, but if you've got a bit of coin your best bet is to go out and buy yourself an agi suit. This armor is gonna have all the agi you can stick on it. <br />
<br />
I've duo'd up a couple casters now with my shaman and it REALLY helps to get yourself an agi suit and thorn em up for a level or two just to raise that defense skill. Couple that with your agility buffs and you're golden. <br />
<br />
Don't feel bad man, it's very good that you're catching it now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I've seen many theories about what will raise the skill more quickly... one theory is that the mob's ATK plays a factor, the higher the ATK of the mob the faster you defense will go up.  This would explain why light blues are bad choices to raise the skill since typically they will have lower ATK.<br />
<br />
This would also seem to indicate that you shouldn't Cripple or otherwise stat debuff a mob if you want to get defense skillups.<br />
<br />
At your level, you are going to need to rely on the pet duel crutch some, IMO.  But Weyalen is for the most part correct - you need to change the way you use your shaman to make sure defense gets maxed.  Solo mobs that are DB to you, the best way you know how, and you'll get skillups.<br />
<br />
I distinctly remember my last Defense point - I got it on my first trip to Hate from a badass mob that hit for more than I'd ever seen a mob hit for.   I died right afterwards, hehe.<br />
<br />
The 8-10 points before that were soloing Drolvargs in Dreadlands.  I rarely got skillups when grouped, even duoing with a melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">and have spent pretty much the whole time on my butt. My defense skill is a whopping 7. My AC is 244. <br />
<br />
What does this mean, time on my butt?  Cannibalize I is level 24.  Butt sitting does not compute.  Seems like there are bigger issues than just low defense.<br />
<br />
To fix it, you will need to be the puller for a while.  If its possible to pull singles do that, and take a few hits each time from the mob before your SK friend joins in.  Other than that, there is really no reason you should spend time not playing the game.  I find it a bit odd when people put their gameplay on hold to max some specific skill, when most skills will improve themselves during your natural gameplay by just making a small adjustment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">ummm...  Ronax, he's two-boxing.  he's playing the whole time, just more on his SK than on his shaman (because he most likely wants to hurry up and catch the shaman up to the SK in level, so he can two box them together for exp purposes).<br />
<br />
Furthermore, a defense skill of 7 isn't the type of thing that you just work up while fighting.  With that skill, his ac is in the toilet, and he can't take the hits to train it up (well, he can, but he's gonna have to be careful, and set aside time to work up that one skill).  I honestly think the pet route is the best way, if he can find a shaman friend.</div></div><hr />

Kunark is your friend.  At 38, you can pull a mob in Frontier Mountains and just let them beat on you for a while, or you can go into The Overthere and solo while getting your skillups.  That's what I did.  I spent a few weeks going from 39 to 46 in Overthere and maxed out defense, offense, piercing, and 1hb along the way. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess I didn't really make this clear...I 2 box a SK and Shaman. Started them together at level 1 and have never leveled one without the other. The Shaman is and pretty much always will be a slow, heal, and buff machine. I guess I'm not a &quot;true&quot; shaman as some of the purists in this thread have suggested. I never made this character to be able to take hits well, but it's become apparent that a lack of defense will hinder me more and more the higher I get.<br />
<br />
I will do some soloing for awhile, OT sounds like a good place. Also, the suggestion about taking a few hits from each mob while duoing with my SK sounds like a good idea, I'll give that a shot. It seems like that may take longer, but will be far less boring. I was hoping there'd be an easier option but, oh well. I didn't know that AGI was the stat that affected Defense skillups, just assumed it was DEX. That's good to know. Time to start digging myself out of this hole. Bleh, why are Offense and Defense not trainable?<br />
<br />
Thanks again for all the advice.<br />

AWESOME!! I went and checked this guy out (just happened to be camped in Warrens) and his max hit is 19...even I can handle that...only thing is, he's still yellow to me, so he hits almost every time, and as I understand it, only misses can raise Defense. So I think I'll come back at 44 w/ stoicism.<br />

Thanks for the tip, very useful guy to know about.<br />

That is a pretty arrogant statement. I assume you mean every shaman solo's? I've played godamn melee who if I'm not carefull fall behind on defense. People level fast nowdays, I don't WORK at defense, I have no choice. If I&quot;m not the main assist a few groups a level, I lose out on def. <br />
<br />
I'm sorry you are wrong. A shaman that soley groups, does need to work at defense. Its not like the old days when it took 3 years to level 65, with plenty time each level to max skills. With todays leveling rate a shaman can play well, do his job and lose out on def raises, among other skills.<br />
<br />
Having low defense isn't indicitive of a badly played shaman. If anything its often a sign of a shaman who grouped more often that us oldtimers through 1-45.<br />

Oh well it does't matter, shaman suck, I'm a hero and a prophet.</div></div><hr />

I disagree with your argument for the following reason.  Even at 64, using Malo (might be different with Malos, cant wait to find out hehe), I sometimes can get multiple resists on my slows in zones like HoH, BoT, etc.  If that happens, I am likely to draw aggro unless the tank is amazing.  When an unslowed MoB from one of these places has you in it's sights, you really need to have your Def maxed to mitigate as much damage as possible until the tank can get it off you.  If you get max quadded for a couple rounds, even with Torpor/Q running, you might just end up a grease splat.  So then your cleric has to either heal you or rez you, both take time away from the group while the cleric meds back up.  You make a valid point that not all Shammies solo, I havent for a long time, but I learned the value of Defense skill quickly when I grouped with another shammie in a BOT group and he got owned quickly because he drew aggro and had a low defense skill and nothing but druid (+WIS) gear on....  Just my 2cp :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Kenton, I think that you misunderstand what I am trying to say here. I did not mean to come across as arrogant. I would however say that a shman with low defence is a sign of a badly played shaman because that shaman has not acknowledged the benefits of improved defence and taken steps to accommodate the necessary steps to raise defence into their play style<br />
<br />
I am not saying that all shaman should be soloing shaman. <br />
<br />
What I am saying is that the role of the shaman will involve getting aggro some of the time - whether it be through multi-casting slow because of resist, or overpulls where you are root parking or whatever, it will happen. Surviving these situations is more likely with maximised Armor Class. Now we can argue AC over hp over wisdom, etc until the cows come home, but the bottom line is that increased AC through raising defence is FREE. <br />
<br />
Raising defence is about soloing. Yes, there are other ways (try deleting that &quot;/assist&quot; hotkey hahaha), but soloing is simple and easy.<br />
<br />
The whole point I was trying to make was that to maximise your potential as a shaman, you need to acknowledge that you will get bashed, therefore acknowledge that you need to max your defence, therefore make allowances in your play time where you will consciously work on getting those defence skill raises (by whatever method). Not maximising your defence is (to me) like having a really nice BP and choosing not to wear it, only worse, because you get more AC from maxing defence than any BP in the game!<br />
<br />
Soloing is not necessarily better or more fun, and as a way of getting exp, it sucks, but it is at least a &quot;necessary evil&quot;. In the old school days, when HHK raider rooms was THE place to level, I would still go solo in one of the Karanas whenever my defence was not maximised by the time I levelled, and I don't think I ever fell less than 5 points behind max possible defence...and I was nto a soloign shammy by any means - I prolly soloed about 20 - 25% of the time.<br />
<br />
The reference to the leather armor was a somewhat tired cliche...druids still get a lot of snide comments abotu papier-mache armor and running around screaming &quot;gettit offme! gettit offme&quot;, but my tounge was pretty firmly in my cheek - a well equipped and competent druid can tank pretty much as well as we can these days (insofar as we can tank these days), and a well played druid is a beautiful and powerful thing...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">only thing is, he's still yellow to me, so he hits almost every time, and as I understand it, only misses can raise Defense.<br />
<br />
That's what careful parsing seems to indicate once you realize that, unlike arcane skillups, melee skillups are recorded in the log file before the action that grants them. We had this discussion a while back here.<br />
<br />
Anyway, another thing to consider is the fact that you can rather easily and painlessly raise Defense while duoing with your SK by means of judicious application of Root. Rooted mobs will attack whoever is closest to them, so just root the baddy, move the Shaman in its face, take a few rounds of melee, step back. Rinse and repeat as needed. That's what I did with my occasional BST/CLR dual box combo when they were in their 30s and it worked fine until the Cleric's Defense got into the high 170s and then it slowed down. But at least at that point you no longer crumble like a dry leaf.<br />
<br />
Oh, and you can still get Defense increases when using a DS. Interestingly enough, you have a chance to raise Offense every time the mob is hit with the DS, you don't even have to be attacking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
She's level 52 and only has a defense of 70.  I solo'd most of the time with her, but I guess I learned how to charm solo a little bit too well.  ;)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice here, now I can get her skill up to par.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">OK OK...no big problem here.  Some people don't get a chance to tank in the lower levels but it is easily remedied.<br />
<br />
Dreadlands:  At your level, goto the Yeti caves and summon your dog.  At 38, the Yeti's should all still be dark blue, but their max hit is something like 72.  Pull them with slow (hardly never resist), and tank away with dog dog beating up on them.  You can get XP off these fellas til 50.  Once you get Stoicism, just dont slow them anymore and your defense will go up much faster.  This is a good way to raise offense and whatever weapon skill you use too.  The best thing about this place, is you can still get XP while working on your skills.  <br />
<br />
Just a note, there is a roamer in each of the caves.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what rotation you should pull in.  And with slow, even two Yeti's arent much of a challenge.  Get your Defense up now, or you will hate yourself in the 50's trying to solo or park adds.  BTW, keep AGI buffed at all times.  It will make your trip to the caves a bit shorter IMO.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Nobody is saying that you have to solo to get defence raises. By soloing you will get defence raises (provided you do not expcluively root n rot, of course). The point is not that you must solo to get defence raises, but that you must recognise the need to get defence maxed. Once you recognise the importance of maxing defence, then you can get defence raises in almost any environment...solo, duo, group or raid, but you do have to realise that defence raises don't necessarily come to you, you have to go out and get em...by whatever means works for you</div></div><hr />

Just because you choose to bastardise (not &quot;bastardize&quot; (sic), by the way, but &quot;bastardise&quot;!) the English language, does not mean that everyone must do so.<br />
<br />
Defence is a perfectly good word. It predates the Americanised defense (sic), and I see no need to compromise my own written English standards in order to conform to some lowest common denominator of phonetic ridiculousness.<br />
<br />
I should point out that I am happy to acknowledge that language is a living, changing organism. Therefore I do not object to the fact that you choose to change words to make them phonetic, or indeed for whatever other reason you feel obliges you to adjust perfectly good words. So, by all means, use &quot;defense&quot; (sic) or &quot;realize&quot; (sic): That is fine. What is not fine is to presume that because you choose to do something, that everyone else must as well.<br />

<br />
first, look at my magelo's.<br />
it is VERY difficult for my 64 shaman to out aggro my 65 SK, if your taking aggro from your tank, you need a better tank, or educate him. my SK will use darkness to pull, and my shaman will malo, slow, Nife, epic asap, and as long as the SK is in melee before the slow lands, i never take aggro off the SK. and i'm not that uber either. and i am duoing in BoT (some downtime from having to heal alot, but i accept that).<br />

even with these new melee disc's, the Coffee Makers even make it hard for me to get aggro when i cast the same spells just as fast.</div></div><hr />

Something similar happens with the “-ize” / “-ise” words, like “civilize” / “civilise.” In this case, though, the etymological spelling is that with “-ize” (which derives from the Greek suffix &lt;-izein&gt;), and the “-ize” spelling was universal in English until around the 18th century. But then British writers noticed that the French had changed the spelling of their cognate suffix from &lt;-izer&gt; to &lt;-iser&gt;. The British began aping the French, and writing “-ise” instead of “-ize.” This new spelling was endorsed by Dr. Johnson, and it has since become very widespread in Britain. But not universal: some conservative quarters in Britain still insist on “-ize.” An example is the august Oxford University Press, which still prefers “-ize.” If you look up the suffix in the second edition of the Oxford English Dictionary, you will find a firm little lecture on the foolishness of writing “-ise.”<br />
<br />
In the US, none of this ever happened, and Americans continue to use the traditional “-ize.”</div></div><hr />

Variant of defense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Whether &quot;defence&quot; or &quot;defense&quot; is correct is not the point here. Either is acceptable. One could equally well justify the use of lbeweredon - it is just as good an English word as an alternative, as is feorh (although not many people would understand). <br />
<br />
Furthermore, you might say &quot;honored&quot;, I might say &quot;honoured&quot;, or one could equally well use weorðode and not be incorrect, as would wígweorþunga or even árstafum. Perfectly good English words all. You may choose to &quot;recognize&quot;, I might prefer to recognise, or we could, alternately gecnáwan and still be talking the same language.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, I do not insist that you use obscure or archaic idiom, therefore it seems only fair that you do not require that I speak your obscure dialect either, especially since we seem to understand each other passably well<br />
<br />
It is not about which is right and which is wrong. Feel free to mangle the language as you think best. I have no issue with how you choose to spell, pronounce or justify. What irritates me is the automatic assumption that your way is the only way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Oks while going up in level I did not just solo but duoed a lot with a warrior and here is my sujestions:<br />
<br />
First off I will say I relize that you said you where 2 boxing, so you have even more control doing this then I did with my normal duo partner. You will most likely kindof slow down your level speed a bit but you can still work at it while normal leveling. with the warrior when we where level since we both where Iksar we made a contince desistion to try and let as much of the damage done to our team to be healed by regen so he and I both worked on keeping our aggro so that the mob was pretty much equally hitting on us. on one side would be me and my pup an don the other would be the warrior. so we spread the damage amongst us both. and also my wepaons ( even at the level your at ) where adding a decent amount of damage to the fight ( had a posin wind cencer which if you decided to work 2hb its a great one to get and a howler wich the stun proc is just awseme for reducing some damage ). since you have control over the SK I am also sure that you have regen up at all times becouse 5 to 10 damaage a tick healed is that much healled as long as you never reach full life very efficant thsi should be great since thay can pretty much steal aggro with one spell just keep your aggro right up and equal with them and there you go you will get a couple of hits every fiogth to half of them if the guy is unlucky and misses.<br />

Just a note I was able to keep up with his ac for the most part the whole way up since all we had on was banded, cabilis scale ( I made ), and some rygor mail. not todays high end stuff.</div></div><hr />
