<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Foradce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was in the ruined city last night and decided to parse my pet along with a couple other pets. My pet had full mage gear, Speed of Salik, Wunshi's Focus, Spirit of Might, and Ferine Avatar. The SK pet had all of those as well, except I'm not sure if he had Speed of Salik, but I'm pretty sure he did. I'll check next time I see him or the chanter. The last was a mage pet and the only buff I know he had was FA. The mage has a bunch of pet AA as well.<br />

What is the mage pet's max normal hit?  92?  Also, which classes get the pet crit AA's?</div></div><hr />
