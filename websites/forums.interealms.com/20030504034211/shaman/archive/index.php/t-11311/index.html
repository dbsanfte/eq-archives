found a vial in the new zones, lore/nodrop called Pure Blood...clr/dru/shm only my guess turn in for the spell somewhere....now just to find him <br />
<br />
found, as in purchased off an npc venodr or looted it?  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>iamagator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">spoke with NPC grennik neltrin in a hut behind the lighthouse and she seems to indicate that you might give that pureblood to another npc named high priest nadox.  not sure where she is though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sabore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nadox's Crypt is a zone connected to the entrance zone to LoY.  ?  Doesn't make sense if the guy's dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">looted it , found a spiritseeker nardox today in the crypt of nardox...but everything is kos there, so turning into him might be...not right...i dunno ill check out what u said tmw when i get to log in</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I got the vial of Pure Blood and turned it into Grennik by the lighthouse - she accepted it - but no spell return... so it's a multi-piece quest.<br />
<br />
I guarantee you it's for the new ghey 51 cure... the Blood was Clr/Dru/Sha No Drop... she speaks about the curing powers the High Priest developed in Norrath.<br />
<br />
Still no clue on mini-torpor.  :(</div></div><hr />

 <br />
  Unlike some of the other quest NPCs there, that one eats anything handed to her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I was trying quite a few quests yeterday and mobs gobble items just like the old world.  None of this PoK &quot;here is your stuff back&quot; niceness.  You are basically stuck with guessing or somehow wrangling more specific text out of the mob with the right words.<br />
<br />
If we have to monkey faction with Nadox to do the new spell quests, people are not going to be pleased.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">And the good races are suppost be do this?  I doubt it.  No its got to be a simple quest.  With RC available, its crazy to make this spell a quest.  I just dont understand their logic.  The mini Torp spell, ok I can see a quest of some difficulty, but a poison cure?  Thats just dumb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kellk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Although it's &quot;just&quot; a cure spell, disinfecting aura has been changed (nerfed) to only cure disease.  Pure Blood is now the poison/disease cure we want.  <br />
<br />
(Edit) yes yes, Radiant Cure makes this sort of moot, but not everyone is over 61, as shocking as that may seem. (end Edit)<br />
<br />
We can debate whether a quest is appropriate, but this is definitely a spell that shammies are going to want, so we will do the quest.   Now all we need is for some shammy to figure it out!   The chanters have already figured out theirs:  http://www.forbiddenunion.com/forum/index.php?board=1;action=display;threadid=3137</div></div><hr />

Grennik Neltrin says 'Hello, Giden.  Have you been exploring the island?  I came here to discover the secrets of the Broken Skull trolls but I have yet to even explore the island.  Rumors that their high priest Nadox held the power to cure any disease have been drifting around Norrath for some time.  I've come to see if the rumors are true.  Unfortunately the island is much more dangerous than I had imagined and I haven't found anything useful.  If you find anything having to do with the troll High priest, please bring it to me.'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>kilokeo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I was rushed by my group, but I tried to get her to respond to something other than a hail.  I had no luck however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sithliss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I foraged a vial of Gunthak Bay Water I believe it was called ... no drop  clr/dru/shm I'm thinkin it might have somethin to do with that quest also.  Or maybe a diff one ... the mini torpor possibly?</div></div><hr />

Oh, and she's a wood elf.  Also saw a dark elf necro hail her and she responded differently.  Forget exactly what she said but it was something about the weather ... so she must be for us.</div></div><hr />
