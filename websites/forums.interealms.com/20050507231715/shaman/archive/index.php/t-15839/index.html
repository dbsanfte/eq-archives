<br />
Hello all!  New to these forums and the Shaman class, though I've leveled my mage to 65 /nod...<br />
<br />
Anyways, my question.... how do you guys feel about Froglok as a beginning shaman race?<br />
<br />
Honestly though, this post is mostly just me wanting to introduce myself to the community  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KaerzanMM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If i'm not mistaken frogloks have the best overall advantages, but barbarians are a close second, pretty sure frogs have no xp penalty, and night vision, correct me if i'm wrong, plus they have good faction, i just don't like the way they look and could never part with my barb :(<br />
<br />
All in all i think frogs have the best stats, but most people would say go ogre/troll/iksar<br />
<br />
troll/iksar have regen, but i think in higher levels that doesn't matter much, i wouldn't use that as a factor of leveling making, since obviously he is gona have gear since you have a 65 magician<br />
<br />
Ogres have immunity to frontal stuns, which helps with casting, so if i had to do it over again i would pick barb or ogre, barbs have no nightvision, but the town is easy to navigate and easy to get started etc etc. but thats just one mans opinion :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Frogs do have the least downsides.<br />
Ogres have the best innate ability. (frontal stun imunity)<br />
Trolls get the innate regen bonus, but that is overrated at higher levels.<br />
Iksars also get the regen bonus. They cannot wear one of the shaman staples. (JBB) They can Forage. Best race to choose if you feel like tradeskilling at any point.<br />
Barbarian is the coolest race to be. But also has the blindness factor. But we're cool.<br />
Vah Shir eat faster, so they will consume more money at lower lvls on food. They have safe fall innately though. Another good choice and the definite choice for the quester (Vah Shir newbie quests are second to none)<br />
<br />
Oh, Froggies are good and all. But be aware that if you do choose a frog you'll get fobbed off as just another know-nothing shaman twink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">pick what looks coolest in the character select screen when you think about a shaman, the rest will even itself out.<br />
<br />
Seriously</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just remember, at the end of the day, you will be an egg laying frog.  Can you live with that?<br />
<br />
It is pretty much agreed that Ogre's are the best race overall because of stun immunity.  Think about it, you are a shaman, you piss stuff off early and often on a regular basis, and the only thing between you and the grave when you get a resist, is channelling a slow spell.  Not being stunned from the front is HUGE.<br />
<br />
P.S.  For god's sake, don't got frog, just say NO!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am a barb, but if I had to do again, I would roll an Ogre for the stun immunity.  My first character was an ogre and I didn't realize what a pain in the but it is to get stunned when I rolled my shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ultimately, you don't really miss the frontal stun immunity if you never had it to begin with on any of your chars .. by the metagame .. ogre probably is the best.<br />
<br />
But I am of the school that says you will be the one playing your char, and if it makes you happy then it was the best race choice for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Pick the coolest looking one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ScRuBbA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">anyone else think that the uglier looking ones are often the better choice??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Make your froggy really colorful and choose a real silly name...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I hate to say it, but I play a barbarian shaman, and its not all that often that I get stunned. And most of the time that I do get stunned, its by a mob that got me from behind.<br />
<br />
Lack of night vision is a problem for barbs until we get our first night vision buff, which I believe is at level 19. After that, just remember to keep it up, and its never a problem again.<br />
<br />
Lizzies get forage. Which means that as long as you remember to smack that forage button every once in awhile, you wont have to buy food or drink. The extra regen is nice too, and they start out with swimming at 100 I think it is.<br />
<br />
I personally would HATE being a troll or ogre. They are so freaking HUGE that people hate them just because of how big they are. And if you stop somewhere and block a door or passageway, expect hate tells.<br />
<br />
Kitties are cute, in a way, and yes, they have nice newbie quests, but they also have one of the most frustrating cities around. I started a kitty rogue once, and deleted him at level 2 because without tracking, I had virtually no way to find the NPCs I needed to talk to to progress in the quests. And besides, how long do  you plan on being a newbie?<br />
<br />
Frogs... They are something I havent decided yet whether to love em or hate em. I made a level 1 froggy cleric the day they went into the game. And he is still level 1.<br />
<br />
It all boils down to play what you like. Starting stats, regen, etc... will have no virtually effect on you at all once get you past about level 50 or so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just a note:<br />
<br />
As a 65 Troll my natural regen is 18 sitting/24 standing, add in Regen3 AA and I'm at 21/27 add in Replinishment and I'm at 46/52.<br />
<br />
This really helps for Mana regen via Cann.</div></div><hr />

at 65 i find myself can4 alot less, i just can5 and Quiescence, so in my case, regen of life isnt really mattering much, especialy once you factor in FT items.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At 65 I find myself using can4 just as much as I always did, but I like to do alot of casting with buffs, debuffs, haste, fa, cc, etc. I love my natural regen, and keep replenishment up at all times still for max mana production.<br />
<br />
Guess it depends how you play your Shaman, but I couldn't live without my regen or can4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">50% or more of the shaman population is barbarian (think the real number is closer to 70%).<br />
<br />
For the person that complained about trolls/ogres being big... hello - you're a shaman, shrink thyself if it's an issue.<br />
<br />
For me, troll/innoruuk was best.  You get the innate regen, used to have the most abandoned city in the game (cong frogs on that now), and could get the clicky snare necklace.<br />
<br />
Ogres have stun immunity but it so rarely is an issue that there is no way I'd ask to go back and change now.<br />
<br />
I love my troll.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If FT is so important, please remember that at 65 troll/iksar shaman have inbuilt ft7 or so compared to non regen race when using canni, which stacks with all ft gear ;)<br />
<br />
I don't know how you can play just using canni5/Q. I constantly hit canni4 in between doing other stuff, no canni4 would cripple my playstyle ;) (and yes, I have a lot of the efficiency aa's...)<br />
<br />
As for the original question, go with whatever race you like the look of best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sancha Delnocha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Frogs have the best emotes bar NONE. <br />
 Not sure about them having best stats overall, I'd prefer a char a bit bigger that can take some damage.  But they are cute for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sinria Shadowfyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">All races have their advantages so you should go with the one you like the best.<br />
 Froggies have night vision and you do get cultural armor. (One downfall of playing a Vah Shir) Just play what you like and you won't have a problem :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Frogs do have better overall starting stats than Iksar (only 5 less wisdom).  However, that isnt saying that their starting stats are all that great.  Proper gear can take care of that deficiency.  Frogs do have faction issues with any evil races, but that doesnt mean much anymore.  You'll run into problems trying to get into some old world and Kunark areas.  Other than that faction doesnt matter.<br />
<br />
I chose barbarian.  At the time my shaman was made there were only 4 races to choose from and I didnt want to be evil.  I aslo didnt want to have to contend with big exp hits in a time before Paladual caverns and PoP when it took you as long to get from 51 to 60 as it did to get from 1 to 51.  <br />
<br />
If I had to choose over I might choose differently.  The only thing that would influence my decision would be the exp penalty though.  Id choose Vah Shir just to not have to deal with it.  (and the ability to go to evil areas is nice, as vah shir are indiff or dubious to all races)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Definitely go with what looks the coolest to you. When I chose my shaman (3 years ago) there was only 1 good race, all my friends had good race toons (such newbs we were lol) so I wanted to group with them and I chose Barbarian. <br />
<br />
I regret that choice to this day, the EQ world is over saturated with Barbarian shamans (you see them as much as Vah Shi..r beastlords)... Though I got that part a bit fixed for my liking with the Woodelf Illusion clicky item (quest) ...<br />
<br />
Honestly, if I were to choose a new shaman it would definitely be an Ogre. To me they are the coolest. Than again, choose the ones that are coolest to you.. If it is frogs... than so... be ... it... /shiver  :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I play a frog and love him. I mainly chose him cause I didnt want to have to deal with any exp penalties, which ruled out ogre, troll and ikky. I dont like the way barbs or the cats look that much, and the frog I kinda liked from the get-go. Plus I love having 4 stats at 100 starting (sta, agi, dex, wis). It helps a bit in the sub lvl 60 game, not to mention the extra resists that are higher than most if not all the other classes. Doing flips when you cast is teh groovy!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Play what you think is cool. Personally I find the fat races unbearable, and would make an frog if I could start over, their emotes rule and they are pre-shrunk =p The advantages of the regen races are squat at the end, and the xp penalty is no fun at the high end.<br />
<br />
 I cant remember the last time I even considered any type of regen spell or item or effect as important to my mana.. er well not true.. I think it was lvl 59 =p To be honest with mp4/scm3/ft10/c3 or VoQ/9 etc that I normally have in groups I find it difficult to dump mana between can5s much less have a need for can4.. and thats with tossing in a ancient scourge and chain nuking after slowing. *Shrug* Consider the xp saved by not being a troll or iksar or ogre as free aa points to spend when you get to 65th =p<br />
<br />
Admittedly pre stoicism(nowadays) levels the regen is probably a huge plus.. but *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I first was a barbarian shaman... no night vision at lower levels was horrid.. this was pre kunark. I made it to 45 and quit.<br />
<br />
When LoY came out I wanted a frog... the only class I saw them good at is a shaman... I FLEW to 65... I'd have to say they are on par with halfling exp. My girlfriend, who cursed me for playing EQ, saw the frog and wanted to play. I no longer have a 65 frog, but I have a gamer GF.<br />
<br />
I made an ogre shaman. EXP is friggin slow.. I mean REAL SLOW. <br />
Another problem I see is trying to run up steep inclines... you have to get in bear form or lev if the zone permits it. It's a pain.<br />
Frontal stun immunity is very noticable advantage.. you'll also have more HP's as an ogre due to you'll be maxed in stam, something the frog will lack without very expensive gear(or hard to get)<br />
<br />
At this point... I wished I made another frog shaman. <br />
<br />
I'd play a barbarian but everyone is a friggin barb... try this /who all 65 shaman</div></div><hr />

My other half has been playing his pally for almost 2 years, I started playing in April. He hit 65 less then a month ago and I am 57 and I dont xp everyday, I am soloing for faction atm. I chose the Frog because there are SO many Barbs, the Trolls and Ogres just dont cut it for me, I dont like grouping with them unless I can super shrink them, The Lizards are ok, but I think make better monks and the Kats, well I like the way they look and all, there are many different styles, but I saw them everywhere, mainly as Beasties though, I LOVE being the only frog in group and sometimes in raids. The emotes are way Groovy~!~ The only thing I am not real impressed with is they have HUGE feet and popeye forearms, oh and their head is way bigger then their body. But as far as getting stunned, I rarely get stunned, I time my slow, cripple, dot, ect where I dont get aggro in a group and I dont get hit or stunned that often. There are times I have an itchy trigger finger and it goes off prematurely and I get my bum stomped, but oh well a good tank can take aggro back. Regen really isnt a huge problem to me, I either am in bear form or on my mount when the zone permits. I just dont really like being called a dude, man or bro, I am PINK/PURPLE for Petes sake. that and with the last name being Lassnite, Lass means girl... I dont think I would have made any other race for a Shaman.<br />

Later on gear can make up for any racial stat differnces, but that doesn't help you much early on.<br />
Oh, and Troll shamans can snare also...beat that :)<br />

As far as the frontal stun immunity goes..I think I might get stunned 1% of the raid mobs we fight, if even that much.  Im either killed or simply interrupted more than anything else.<br />

Just kidding.  Play what you want, but I *personally* think the Oger is the coolest, even with all of its downsides.  I like being freakin huge, I like the high starting Stamina (~50 more points than Iksars) and I like the no-stun.  Plus we're uncommon compared to other races.<br />
BUT, I saw a blue froglok in PoK last night that was actually so cool looking that I just stopped and stared.  I don't have LoY, but I would definitly consider frogs if I wanted to make a twink.<br />

<br />
Forget the trolls, go iksar.  Yes, yes, do what looks cool, that's good advice.  After all, when you've gone 50 levels, if you're sick of looking at your plain jane Barb, there's some enjoyment taken away from your experience.  Iksars are the slickness, looks wise.  The ladies love us, too. (Think forked tongue and a tail.) That being said, this thread wouldn't have been started (for the nth time, btw.  Search is your friend.) if you didn't want some stat boil downs.  XP penalties are laughable, especially when grouping.  People have two boxed a penalty and non-penalty char side by side, and when the non penalty hits 60, the other is 25% into 58.  Sure, a lot of that is because 59 to 60 is a bitch.  And it will be more of a bitch for an iksar.  But you've had 59 levels of ass-kicking lizard greatness, and you're playing when most of the hell levels are no longer an issue.  Considering what the regen rate will grow to before its usefulness curve begins to head down, which also goes hand in hand with the best base wis of all, it greatly reduces downtime.  This will  save some groups you get into.  Besides, you have to take downtime into account. Depending on your play style, you might actually level faster. If you have to stomp a few more mobs to get to a level (other than 59, see above), isn't that better than sitting down a few minutes longer anyways?  The answer is yes, even if the regen doesn't end up saving you time.  Killing is fun, sitting is less so.  Secondly, as for the jbb, it's really only a nifty tool for about ten levels, and then it becomes a toy.  Fun, yes, but not really something to worry about.  Especially when you have the AC bonus AND the iksar-only armor.  Plus a high agility, although agi's usefulness is.. iffy at best.  We also have forage, which wouldn't be too shabby for trade skilling.  Then think about newbie zones.  Lots of other race's newbies come to FOB and Kurn's before heading to Paludal because it simply rocks.  And as a lizard, you can head right over to our well supplied Sham guild whenever you hit the big levels.  No books, no being afraid of guards, nothing.  You like questing?  Here's your cudgel.  As for faction, let's be honest.  If you have Luclin and PoP, it isn't something that will make you lose sleep.  Besides, you can hunt guards in other cities without thought.  Can't lose what faction you didn't have in the first place.<br />
<br />
So let me summarize the lizard's selling points.  Regen, base wis, Cabilis (w/ FOB and Kurn's, plus everything else Kunark has to offer), AC bonus, Iksar-only armor, forage, cudgel quest line.  And, as this post opened up with, an Iksar just looks cool.  Sure, we don't have the flipping, dancing, prancing, swishing, baton twirling emotes of frogs, but we are bad ass.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Ogres are the powergaming race of choice.  The best thing about ogre stun immunity is not the immunity to actual stuns, but rather the fact that successful bashes do not force an immediate channelling roll for ogres as it does for all other races.  I don't get stunned from the front very often, but I get insta-interrupted by bashes often enough to notice.<br />
<br />
Do not overlook the utility of the troll snare necklace.  It is avery, very useful item that I have used regularly since I got it years ago.<br />
<br />
If you are into questing, the vah shir sneak skill has a lot of obvious utility.<br />
<br />
If you have any kind of aesthetic/rp preference, go with that.  None of the differences are that big, but I am sure you already suspected that.<br />
<br />
Really, the only race with a serious disadvantage is froglok, because they suffer an innate &quot;nobody respects you because you are a goddamn froglok&quot; penalty.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Two things you might want to keep in mind, <br />
<br />
1st, if I had to do it all over again I would have played a female frog. They look exactly like a male frog except the females have better skins. Personally I like the white frog with black tiger stripes.<br />
<br />
2nd, the froglok race looks the same to everyone regardless if they have old school graphics turned on or off.<br />

Edit: oh, just thought about something in three letters, if you wanted to say: &quot;H x H&quot;, then yes I am ;)<br />
<br />
Sorry, I forgot that W T F would be blocked.  www.W T F comics.com (without the spaces) is an online comic I read.  They just had an issue about the wood elf female falling into the Troll Shaman's arms.<br />

P.S. I have no idea what &quot;H x H&quot; is.</div></div><hr />
