<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Celadreal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The rain fell all around him as Celadreal walked into the plains of Karana. He let out a sigh as he looked upon his homeland. Night had engulfed the land well before the rain began to fall. A pair of feet caught his eye in the dirt. It was definitly that of a gnoll, however it was lightly placed while the usual gnol was very heavy footed. His honed sense of presence told him he was not alone in the field.<br />
       The night squeezed the light from the area around him not to mention the fog bank brought on from the rain. Celadreal resumed his travel this time keeping his wits well about him self.<br />
He began to recall where he had his soul bound when a figure cam into veiw. He darted behind a tree and peeked out from around the trunk. The figure was canine and must be a gnoll of the split paw. The gnoll did not notice him and sniffed the air then howled. Celadreal knew that call and another gnoll came bounding out of the fog on all fours then stood to sniff the air. <br />
       &quot;How many are there?&quot; celadreal whispered to himself. He had to get out of there beacause after 17 seasons in the world he could barely handle 2 of these gnolls. <br />
      He began to sneak away from the path and found no sufficient footing for perfect silence and a stick snapped under his foot. The Gnolls spun on their heels and looked into the mist. Celadreal sped off to avoid the gnolls. Like any gnoll the canine creatures gave chase. Celadreal ducked into the forest attempting to lose the gnolls over a hill instead another was there faster then his eye could record the gnoll appeared there. The creature raised a brutal sword to cleave the ranger’s head from his shoulders. The sword was to slow and celadreal was already underneath the gnoll’s arm and on his way away. The Forest spoke to celadreal telling him the ground was coming to an end. Celadreal jumped through a bush as he went over a cliff and fell. The cliff quickly turned into a steep slope causing the rangers to tumble down the hill until the ground leveled out. When Celadreal finally stopped he got up clutching an arm that had met a sharp rock on th fall. The Gnolls were perched on the cliff overlooking him. The half-elf stood there watching the trio of gnolls for a few long moments before the gnolls let out a howl and walked away into the trees. <br />
	::Later in The dockside tavern in Qeynos::<br />
	“Splitpaw Assassins their called.” Tumpy spouted over his mug of ale.<br />
	“Really? Assassins are ordered with targets, I’ve never done anything to Splitpaw why would they target me?” Celadreal queried the dwarf over a cup of tea.<br />
	“You should have some ale to calm yer nerves.” The dwarf suggested. Celadreal put a gold coin on the table next to and empty cup and sighed. He stood up and fastened his cloak and belt on.<br />
	“One day you will learn That in these dangerous times it is best to keep your wits about you.” Celadreal said with a grin. The dwarf shrugged and lifted his mug to his lips. The ranger turned and walked through the door into the rain. <br />
	‘Ill go to blackburrow those gnolls must have something to do with this.’ He thought to himself as he walked out back to the gate and out to the plains.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Celadreal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You must be new to the glade somewhat. Before the glade was reformatted this section (tales o' ranger) was filled with stories of ranger's experiences from a roleplaying perspective. This story just continues the tradition.</div></div><hr />
