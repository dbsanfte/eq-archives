<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i put up an idea on the druid board for the priest covenant thing .. it's in a post so i figured i'd post it here to see what you guys thought:<br />
<br />
how about a recurve triggered by a slow mitigation message.<br />
<br />
an example would be something like a partial slow message would cast a recurve buff ala sk's and necros that would add a 20% increase to shaman healing, a slight slow would add 40% healing and a mostly slow would add 10% increased healing that stacks with all other healing focus.<br />
<br />
this would increase shaman healing on ONLY mobs that mitigate slow and wouldn't affect any other slowing class in any way.<br />
<br />
this could last for say .. 30 seconds ..<br />
<br />
that way the healing solution is directly proportional to our slowing problem on short fights with mitigation<br />
<br />
edit - maybe tack on a 60% increase when we get a slow-resist message or a slow immune as well .. to make up for not being able to slow at all<br />
<br />
this would also probably increase shaman healing on raids .. where most bosses are slow immune or resist a ton or are only slightly slowable</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So you would have to bounce a slow on an immune mob that hits bloody hard just to heal 60% better? <br />
<br />
I'm not a big fan of that concept, sorry. I want healing capabilities that I can rely on. This seems too random to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hardly random, it works 100% of the time to address the weakening of our slow without inflating us at all when we can get a 75% slow in, specific solution to a specific problem</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ok, I'm not arguing. You asked for feedback. You got it. <br />
<br />
You put slow resist, meaning I would have better healing if a slow was resisted. To me, that means I would heal randomly better (as it is somewhat random that a slow is resisted). <br />
<br />
So, 2 mobs in camp, I slow one and therefore my heals are altered.... the other one resists..... how does that work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Let's get 1 mob in camp that mostly mitigates.  Slow it, then mez it.  Keep it in camp and then you can heal like a cleric!  :)<br />
<br />
Nice idea, but hard to implement, I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Exactly Chutoi. Dragging MOBs around for necromancers to manawrack is weird enough for me, no need for more of that.<br />
<br />
The basic idea is good, but I would prefer to just give us a new heal in the content where slow is mitigated. It will not be perfect but it seems a lot easier then implementing your idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i like the idea, but as said i not sure if could be implememted.<br />
<br />
i would say a shaman only aa or item that increase our healing alot would be better, something to do with spirit. that way can only get when you get the content it needed for.</div></div><hr />

From a coding standpoint alone this would be a nightmare.</div></div><hr />
