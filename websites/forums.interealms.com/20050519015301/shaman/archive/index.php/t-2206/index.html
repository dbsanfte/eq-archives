<br />
I took a sampling last night and posted it.. I wonder what you all think of the results.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My thoughts about this are the guy running the tests conclusions are all wrong. What was he expecting to happen?<br />
Most of this stuff has been known for years, why are they ranting about it now?<br />
<br />
The pet did more damage with avatar. It's the single best thing we can do next to haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>AlynaRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The guy running the test is me, and I'm expecting to see hit/miss ratio increase with avatar.. and it doesn't and actually declines. <br />
<br />
There is also another discussion going on that maxium amount of haste a pet can have is 65%, rendering some of the magician higher level pet buffs useless. <br />
<br />
60 Shaman <br />
60 Mage<br />
57 Wizard<br />
53 Warrior<br />
53 Ranger<br />
51 Rogue</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">as far as haste caps on pets thats prolly not entirely true.  As you can see with a beastlord pet buffed with Omakin's Alacrity and another buffed with Sha's Ferocity that there is a large difference.<br />
<br />
Omakin's Alacrity: Increase Attack Speed for between 65%(L55) to 70%(L60) in 175 ticks; Increase Strength by 60(L55); Increase Armor Class(AC) by 30(L55); Increase Attack (ATK) by 40(L55) <br />
<br />
Sha's Ferocity: Increase Attack Speed for between 84%(L59) to 85%(L60) in 175 ticks; Increase Strength from 99(L59) to 100(L60); Increase Armor Class(AC) by 60(L59); Increase Attack(ATK) by 60(L59)<br />
<br />
Regularly standing next to a beastlord of higher level and both using pets with these two haste buffs (same pet level buffs), his pet will beat my pet every time in just a pet on pet battle.  <br />
<br />
I will make some logs tonight hopefully when I get home from work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ormak D'Grump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hit/Miss ratio has nothing to do with Avatar.  Avatar will increase the average damage per hit and the max damage but it does nothing to the hit/miss ratio.<br />
<br />
Looking at your data Avatar is doing exactly what it is supose to, your pets Average damage went up and the Max hits were more common.  Your tests were a bit short as well, if you did a 30min test or so you would most likely see the hit/miss ratio even out and the change in Average damage and Max hits would be even more pronounced.<br />
<br />
If you do a Histogram of the hits you will see what I am talking about more easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There is also a school of thought which suggests that dual wield and double hits are 'procs', and their likelihood is increased with dex. Your data would seem to support this idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My understanding, and this could be WAY off, is that the hit frequency and attack are only related according to the relative conn of the target.  You hit a red mob less than a green mob with the same attack value.   Soulbinder in SH conned green to my lvl 18 SK, meaning it would be VERY green to a 50+ mage.  I figure the hit miss frequency is already capped on a soulbinder.  As for the damage, I thought that was relative too although the tests seem to show an increase in damage output.  What do I know, I don't play a pet class ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">DEX has absolutely nothing to do with double attack or dual wield rates. Those are based completely on skill and the RNG.<br />
<br />
Hit/miss rate is dependent on weapon skill, offense skill, and avoidance AC of the mob you are fighting. Avatar doesn't affect any of those variables.<br />
<br />
Max hit is dependant on weapon skill, STR, and + atk buffs.<br />
<br />
Damage distribution is dependant on STR and + atk buffs.<br />
<br />
Avatar will raise the max hit (up to a ceiling of 5.7 times weapon damage) and will increase the average damage.<br />
<br />
In the test linked above, the parse is a pet against a soulbinder. Average damage did go up by a reasonable amount. If the parse had been against a mob that didn't have such insanely high mitigation AC, the increase in damage would likely have been more dramatic. Can ranger attack buffs be cast on pets? Will they stack with pet buffs? That might be worth trying, there is likely an attack threshold that would yeild greater returns.<br />
<br />
Try parsing against average xp mobs and see what the difference is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">hit ratio is fixed at 66.6%, at least for a lvl 60 melee</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Avatar will raise the max hit (up to a ceiling of 5.7 times weapon damage) and will increase the average damage.<br />
That 5.7 is off, primal 2hb on a monk hits for 299 max (45 base dmg, 37 bonus at 60)<br />
<br />
hit ratio is fixed at 66.6%, at least for a lvl 60 melee<br />
Uh. I'll have to scan some logs when I come home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">OK, let me rephrase. 5.7 times weapon damage is the non monk max. Better? ;) Monks have different damage tables and damage caps.<br />
<br />
5.7 times weapons damage + damage bonus. <br />
5.7 * 45 + 37<br />
<br />
If he was any other melee class besides a monk, his max would be 293.5 (294) with that weapon.</div></div><hr />
