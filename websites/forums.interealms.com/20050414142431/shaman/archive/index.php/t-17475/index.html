Depends on what o/s your running. If your trying to run XP or 2k, then  you barely have enough for overhead much less EQ - get 384 or better yet 512.<br />
If your running 98 or Me, then you should be just fine.  I ran EQ in phase4 with 64mb.<br />
<br />
If you have a ram problem it's easy to tell. There will be massive hard drive activity while your trying to walk, basically making the game unplayable.</div></div><hr />

And generally, it is easy to do now.  Just be sure you find the right modules for your motherboard.</div></div><hr />
