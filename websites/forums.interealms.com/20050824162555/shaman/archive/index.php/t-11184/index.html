<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have noticed that any &quot;off-topic&quot; thread about anything not related directly to &quot;general shaman stuff&quot; (however the moderator on duty defines it) goes to &quot;The Grey&quot; forum.  This annoys me at times but made me realize something.<br />
<br />
Everyone go to THE GREY forum and read a post and reply to a post!  There are some good posts there and I'm sure you will find one that interests you!  <br />
<br />
On my server message board, the &quot;Rants and Raves&quot; section of the board was where all &quot;inappropriate&quot; posts got moved.  This backfired when the majority of posters started visiting that part of the board FIRST!  And checking the general section only if they got bored.<br />
<br />
I suggest everyone who agrees that this could be a good idea:<br />
1) /bump this post and<br />
2) Post or reply to a post in The Grey forum.  <br />
<br />
Here's a link so you don't have to refresh needless pages:<br />

I just went to The Grey today and was SHOCKED at how many cool topics were there!  If we start reading that forum more, it will be a pretty cool place to post that stuff . . . and best of all, it can't be moved!  MUAHAHAHAHAH! <br />
<br />
(I predict this post will be moderated to &quot;The Grey&quot; at some point.  If so, I'm gonna repost it exactly as is, on this forum, as many times as it takes!  Mods, this is not a threat, this is a promise!)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The one with positive connotation as determined by the mods was left here and the other one was moved to the grey. that effectively implied that one side of a discussion was acceptable in this forum and the other wasn't acceptable in this forum. <br />
<br />
It's their boards and their rules ... but more caution in moderation choices like that would be appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Something else to consider -- just because a post is moved to &quot;The Grey&quot; does not mean that it disappears forever.<br />
Take a look at the moved posts in &quot;General&quot; -- they are still clearly displayed and able to be clicked on.  So, in essence, even if your post got moved, it is still viewable in the most popular forums until it gets bumped down (which can take a while).<br />
Quite frankly, I don't see what the big deal is about having your post moved.<br />
<br />
And yes, The Grey does have some nice threads in it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kind of... a new post in a moved thread will not bump it to the top of the area it was moved from.  At least I think so...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Eatbugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Sounds like someone didn't like all his favorite threads being moved. :P<br />
<br />
Really, what's the difference?  They're still there and people can (and do) still reply to them.  If you want a laugh about board moderation, go check out the FoH boards sometime - don't see too many moderators start out their posts with &quot;Listen, you f***ing retards...&quot;<br />
<br />
(Actually, some boards might be better off if they were moderated that way.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Only moderation issue I've seen that's valid is Corwil's.  If we have duplicate threads, perhaps rather than moving one, they can be combined?  Dunno if that can be done on this board.</div></div><hr />

Sure if &quot;war on iraq&quot; posts appear in general then move them no problem with me but if it has to do with eq in ANY way then it should stay in GENERAL. All threads moved to the grey die a few days later or immediately cause nobody ever goes there save for a few ppl.<br />
Moderators please stop.<br />

Thank you<br />

personally though i think anything that has somethign related to EQ in the first post should stay in an EQ type forum<br />
just me tho</div></div><hr />
