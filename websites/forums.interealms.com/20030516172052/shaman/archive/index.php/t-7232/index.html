<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ramma2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I just hit 21, and I need a break from the exp grind.  So I'm looking for some good quests to do.  Does anyone have some good ones?  Allakhazam has a good list, but its too big and there's too many crappy ones to go through.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I started the Totemic armor quests around that level.  That stuff is pretty outdated now though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ramma2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, I bought some boots in the bazaar that are better than the totemic for less than the dufrinite (sp) costs from a vendor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What race are you?  Also do you have a group of friends that will quest with or will you be doing these solo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ramma2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm barb, and solo 99% of the time, I only play at work during off peak times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Linanae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Quests good for faction and some loot is the Kitty quests in Stone Brunt. There is the dice quest I noticed movement in experince at 25. Another quest to build up your FV is to kill the pirates on Sea Furry Island. Turn the belt of purity and the bracer of erolsi to the head wood-elf chic you get exp and a piece of small ring mail to sell or give to newbies. There is also a quest for the ear rings they drop. The other part is the True spirit spawns everytime you kill the Captian. Another quest even though the armor is out dated is the armor of ro. If you get into a group you can do the ear quest in HHk. You can do your testament of vanear.</div></div><hr />
