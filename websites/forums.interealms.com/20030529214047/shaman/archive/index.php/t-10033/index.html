<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ScRuBbA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Need a little info here... with the new bard buff windows available, do mobs dispel from that window as well as your &quot;perma&quot; buff window? or does it only dispel from the regular buff window, and bard songs will continue playing as long as they are being twisted?<br />
<br />
reason i ask is because my UI currently doesnt show the bard buff window so when i go raid i cant exactly see whats going on, and since the random factor of dispels, i cant tell if im actually losing less buffs than i should, or whatever..<br />
<br />
one more thing, has anyone noticed that the lower level buffs tend to get dispelled the most? i heard it was so supposed to be random, or most likely the first couple, but ive noticed that in raids the buffs are being dispelled from lowest -&gt; highest... not sure if its always been like that, but ive been used to them being the first couple of buffs... thx for any help u guys can provide :)</div></div><hr />
