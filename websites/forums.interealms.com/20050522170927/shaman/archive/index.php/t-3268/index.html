<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Regen BP might be your best bet until you can get your hands on some high end chest pieces.<br />
A Fungi or Ikky BP would serve you well. I'm currently saving for Ikky BP myself seeing as how a Fungi is WAY out of my reach.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Rygorr would be good for a cheaper option than the iksar regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">42 might be  bit low to go for the TT cycle, I myself got my CIB when I was there at 45 with a 45 - 50 group.  A nice intermediate is the jarcrap BP from KC, try to get into a LCY group, or just hang out there and wait for someone calling it our as rotting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ry'Gorr or the Giant Woven Vest, both from EW... are good options. Totemic is also not a bad choice, I'd definently get one if you can.<br />
<br />
Also, Barbed Ringmail has been dropping in price over time... might want to take a look at that if you have some extra cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vadmir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Here are the pieces I have used in the order I used them:<br />
<br />
Rygorr AC18 + stats (don't remember em) - 500pp on Zeb<br />
Froglok Scale AC24 +5 wis/int +3 cha 2k-3k<br />
Ceremonial Iksar CP AC19 Eff: REGEN 6k<br />
<br />
The Jarsath Chest Piece in KC isnt bad at AC20 +stats.  42 is too low to hunt in KC (or so most think) but you can sit at zone and ask to loot it.  Also the JS legs are nice AC15 +5 wis/int and usually rot.<br />

Something to think about. <br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The Jarsath Scale breastplate is easy to get, depending on the people hunting in KC.  I got mine at level ten.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure the Suple Scale Armband is extended range, not enhancement.  So, they would stack since they do different things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ahhh , the light bringer cometh .<br />
<br />
suddenly it is looking pretty good cause of its high AC and that . i just with it had a wisdom stat :( <br />
<br />
my wisdom is only 153</div></div><hr />

I don't know about you but I like big boobs in my face ! <br />

/em feverishly right clicks his Skyshrine Hottie ring while holding a dollar bill in his teeth. <br />
Drop it like its hot !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Not sure of your financial situation, but realy have to second the Iksar Regen BP.<br />
<br />
5-7k on Xev and as the others have said Regen &gt; alles.<br />
<br />
Ok so your little group is too 'young' to handle the spawns in TT.<br />
<br />
Get thee to Warslik and whack gobbo's for faction and a possible Earring. (Drops off of Grachnist - RARE drop).<br />
<br />
You can sell earring for almost all of what you need.<br />
<br />
Maxxed faction? Tired of Warslik?<br />
<br />
Hop over to RM for a day or so, group with friends, kill HG's. <br />
<br />
Still bored? Go to CC, kill spiders. (You can solo them up and until Queen I * THINK *). Keep the silks and sell them for 100 pp a stack.<br />
<br />
Oh - join /auction channel on your server. Watch prices and keep your eyes peeled for the BP going cheaper than usual.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">thnx faern . i think that RM is going ot be my best bet to getting one of these . maybe i should stop leveling for a week and just focus on cash in RM.<br />
<br />
a snare item would SO help me there though :(<br />
<br />
any tactics on fighting the HG's a lil more efficiantly ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'm currently in RM hunting HG's for cash. This is how I solo them. <br />
I make a pet buff him with haste, Talisman, and SoW then I turn taunt off. I buff myself to the hilt...Agi, Dex (need it for proc on my hammer), Str, Talisman, Haste and Shifting Shield.<br />
Pull out my Ugly Stick (Drakkel Ice Grinder)<br />
<br />
Find a giant and pull with Malisement. <br />
Slow him with Togors and DoT him with Venom of the Snake.<br />
Me and Cujo pummel him into the ground. Depending on how the fight goes I occasionally have to heal during battle but, this method has been very effective for me. <br />
I tried Root/Rotting but that took too long and took too much mana. <br />
<br />
Exp is slow but I've made over 600pp there and gotten half way to 42.</div></div><hr />
