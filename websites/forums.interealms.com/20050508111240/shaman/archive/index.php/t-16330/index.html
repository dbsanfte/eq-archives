<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I *only* solo or two-box. I was bummed when I found out that I wouldn't be able to play in an instanced dungeon because it required a group of four. Really bummed.<br />
<br />
But I got over it. <br />
<br />
I was willing to buy the expansion if for nothing else to get the new spells. Now I'm reading on the necro board that I won't be able to even get the new spells unless I do the LDON dungeons? <br />
<br />
Is there ANYTHING that a soloer/two-boxer can get out of LDON?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hmm well i havent tested this out for myself yet but you could do an adventure with 4-6 people, then after it is over there is usually some mobs left in the dungeon, you can tell the rest of the group to go and you can just solo/2 box the mobs and have the whole thing to yourself. Im not sure if it kicks you out of the adventure after a certain time but would be a good thing to try.</div></div><hr />

I've been playing since the Day eq launched btw, and still having fun.<br />

And yes, it does sound like you wasted your money, Corvus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kilokeo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I either wasted my money or I'll have to find a new guild I think.  The guild I'm in isn't big and so far it's been only a set crew to do the adventures.  With the time limit between adventures it kind of leaves the rest of us to try and find pick up groups.  The problem I find with those is that so many people don't seen to understand how to do dungeons any longer.<br />
<br />
It also upset me when I had been logged on and LFG when a lower lvl shaman logs on and gets told to report to the adventures.  Maybe the group wanted to lower their ave lvl.  If that's the case, then I don't see a reason for me to stick around if they think I'm only going to make things harder on them because I'm 65 and make their ave lvl higher.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Amen.<br />
I think, maybe, there is a little jealousy hidden inside those people who post opinions like the one Jenguran put up above. I've seen it on many different boards and just let it pass, but here on the Shammny boards its a bit absurd. I have no problem with you grouping all the time, why should you have a problem with me soloing? :confused: <br />
To me, the strength of the game is that it ALLOWS you to group with other people, but should never FORCE you to. I too was a little dissapointed to find that you could only enter the new areas if you were grouped up. I was looking forward to being able to have a nice relaxing hunting session without the worry of some group coming along and taking over the camp I'd been in for the last hour carefully planning the spawns, so I would be able to handle them without training everyone else around on my way to the zone line.<br />
As for whether or not you wasted your money-<br />
If you never plan to group with anyone else, yes you did waste your money. You will never be able to experience any of the content of the new zones otherwise. While there is nothing wrong with soloing, there is nothing wrong with grouping either. You should try it out, the new zones sound like fun and would be a change of pace. Besides, it will keep all those unable to handle themselves in a camp without the help of others in LDoN zones and open up space in other zones for us! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tappion Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just have 2 extra people get a dungeon adventure with you, and have them disband from group adn go do it. You get points even if you lose anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not that I have seen. Due to various reason we lost a few and received nothing as far as points go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You get absolutely nothing if you fail.  <br />
<br />
In my first adventure, we had what I would consider to be a very solid group (65 warrior, 65 am3/eq ranger, 65 shaman, 63 wizard, 65 enchanter) and we absolutely flat out failed.  We killed, and killed fast but the 90 minute timer came and went and then the 120 minute timer came and the instance terminated.  We were about 3 mobs away from the end-mob of the dungeon (it was a &quot;locate and kill mob x&quot; type of encounter).  We took no wrong turns, and never once stopped (even for a second).  We received 0 points.  <br />
<br />
Later this evening, we took a similar group on a different type of adventure (&quot;kill x number of mobs in y amount of time&quot;) and beat it easily.  We got 51 points for that. <br />
<br />
I'd say that there needs to be some tuning done.  Perhaps award some points if you come close to achieving your objective, or at least change the time limit to be a little longer.  I realize that if you form the perfect group, these encounters are doable.  The perfect group is not always available, though.  I also realize that it could have just been that we were unlucky in our choice of adventure, but only time will tell on that score.<br />
<br />
Challenging is fun.  Impossibly hard is not fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Just got finished with one of the Guk ones.  Its nothing more than PoJ Executioner trial writ large.  needed 25 items to win, we got 15.  2 pallies, cleric,wizard,shaman enchanter.  All 65 but one of the pallies.  We did not even come close.  Next time I will take my monk and leave the shaman at home.  If the mobs live long enough to need slowing, you lose.</div></div><hr />

Right click on the Adventure Recruiter, and click the Leaderboard button (can't remember if you have to go via a 'stats' button here or not).  This handy feature gives you a quick list of all the 'casual' players in your server's uber guilds.</div></div><hr />

&lt;--- 5th on the leaderboard atm =P Only below the people I grouped with all day (non-guildies) who had one dungeon run more than me =( We didn't fail once so I'm 11-0.<br />
Do admit though some of the adventures could do with some tuning, our group consisted of 65 Shaman, 65 cleric, 3 x 65 Wizard (min 200 aas each) and for the majority a 65 Paladin. Most of the adventures we finished with 30-60 minutes left. Oh, and when we did this we didn't stay with one dungeon or type of adventure. Only one I haven't gotten to try is the rescue which is a bit of a bummer.<br />
I used to love soloing, came from playing a necro. But now, I'd rather get a pickup group. Meet some cool people and learn how to adjust to how other people play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>steveo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">&quot;You get absolutely nothing if you fail. &quot;<br />

<br />
I've got a baby to take care of and I'm constantly going afk to tend to her. Even if I did like grouping (which I don't), I wouldn't put a group through that. <br />
<br />
The multi-player aspects of this game that I enjoy can't be replicated in a single-player game. Selling/buying (and now the bazaar) is a sub-game within itself. Not to mention the fact that I have yet to find a one-player game that can hold my attention for 3 months, let alone 3 years like EQ has.<br />
<br />
At least Horizons has a Shaman class and seems to be more solo-friendly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Get over thinking 2boxers or solers are antisocial. I am a two boxer and i do group and do things with a few friend. Is all i need generally so i two box the rest of the time. Doesnt make me antisocial. I help out tons of people who i dont know if they happen to be in the dungeon/zone i am and they are stuck.     I also find alot of two boxers are pretty helpful when you need them. Sometimes i think people mix up antisocial and self effcient. There is plenty plenty to do in eq and not all of it requires me to be in a group for an hr where nobody is talking anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Hamenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Many two boxers stay parked in a decent xp spot. The problem with LDoN is you have to manuver both toons to one of the wayfarer camps (which is not an XP spot), then sit and wait for a group. <br />
<br />
Two boxers don't always get as much xp per kill as your average player grouped in PoP, but they make up for it by being able to start killing immediately when they log in.<br />
<br />
This is the biggest drawback to LDoN, 2 boxers/soloers have to start playing the LFG game, which really isn't fun compared to logging in and starting to kill right away.<br />
<br />
FYI: 3-4 years ago, it was much more anti-social to solo. Since they added chat channels, there is nothing anti-social about it. You're still typing words into the game, you're still reading words on the screen; it makes no difference if its group chat, guild chat, /ooc chat, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've only tried one adventure (lots of fun btw  ;) ), and we didn't rescue the person within the time limit, but we stayed for the extra half hour and completed the quest and we did get some points.  <br />
<br />
I don't know if we got the full points (suspect not)...the lvl range was 54 to 61 and the point range was 6 to 8.  I was surprised we didn't all get the same number of points.<br />

I'm a 95% soloer/2-boxer.  Got a buddy's monk who didnt have time for EQ (don't start me on monks).<br />
<br />
I'm not anit-social at all.<br />
<br />
Maybe thats why I don't have several uniterrrupted hours to play a video game.<br />
<br />
I solo/2-box because its not fair to a group to be AFK all the time, and RL &gt; EQ everyday.<br />
<br />
Not to flame hard-core types, to each his own, do what makes you happy.<br />

Btw LDoN does appeal to me, maybe I can squeeze out an hour or two to play a mini-game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Hyurtices</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">What really sucks is that I am the only level 65 in my guild, a very small one of close friends. Last night we attempted an adventure only to find that we could not do it as a group because of some stupid requirement that the group all be within a 6 or 7 level range.  :mad: <br />
<br />
It is too bad because we group together often the next highest is a level 63 druid followed by a 60 warrior, then the rest of the guild are only in the mid 50's so this precludes us from adventuring in LDoN until we can PL some of the others up to at least level 58.  :confused: <br />
<br />
In my opinion this just plain sucks, I thought this expansion was to allow the opportunity for small guilds to experience some of the more interesting places that if in the Planes they would never be able to enjoy.  :( <br />
<br />
Now the 3 high levels in my guild will probably spent the next week or so trying to get a couple of level 55's and 56's up to an accpetable level so we can adventure and enjoy each others company.<br />
<br />
You would have thought that SOE would have at least figured to set the level requirements at a 10 level parameter, that way a level 60 could be group leader and have a level 65 as the high and a level 55 as the low.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">shamans are very good at PLing melees.  Perhaps you could group with them in some tuffer spots they can still access?  PoV, even droga would be fun and good exp. <br />
<br />
Or you could just joing a pickup group for purposes of checking out LDoN, but I'm sure you already know that.  <br />
<br />
Myself, I prefer to cherry pick people I know to be solid players for groups.  Going LFG WILL get me a group fast, but it may not be a group I want.</div></div><hr />

********************<br />
You can justify it all you want, but if you solo or 2-box in a massively multi-player game, you are being anti-social, no matter what your reason is.  There's nothing wrong with being anti-social, if that's what you choose to be, and I myself can be anti-social most of the time...  but don't deny being something that you most likely are.  You sound real silly when you say &quot;I solo or 2-box most of the time, but I'm not anti-social&quot;....  When you are soloing or 2-boxing, you're being anti-social by definition.  It's just hard for some people to realize that perhaps they are capable of being anti-social.  There are millions of anti-social people in the world, I find it hard to believe that no one in this thread is anti-social.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">So are you psychic, Sancha, or on the Horizons development team?  Because the beta doesn't even include CONTENT yet, so there's absolutely nothing upon which you could base that wild accusation.<br />
<br />
Must move past the &quot;four legs good, two legs baaaaad&quot; mentality.  It's definitely different, but there's no way to tell what's going to come out of this coccoon yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Trust me Horizons will never equal EQ, its a complete joke.<br />
<br />
I assume you, like me, are in Beta then? I'm enjoying myself.<br />
<br />
Another aspect of multi-player games that I don't get from single-player games is tradeskilling, which I enjoy. Horizons has an incredible tradeskilling system already.<br />
<br />
Sony has acknowledged that soloing is a viable style of play by including it in their polls a couple months ago. I'm still shocked that they not only released an expansion that is completely inaccessible to soloers AND gave no warning about that being the case. <br />
<br />
Are the spells NO DROP or will I at least have a chance to buy them in the bazaar?</div></div><hr />

Hmm, I for one knew that it was going to be for groups with minimum of 4 members quite awhile ago, although it didn't seem like most people were that interested in the info that was out there about the expansion untill after yesterday.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like I said in the first post, I knew I couldn't get into the dungeons. I didn't know that I wouldn't be able to get the spells without doing the dungeons. The irony is that the new shaman DOTs are more useful to soloers than to groupers/raiders.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually I used the bane dot a lot in groups during beta, and as far as dots go, they are the most useful ones we have for grouping since they run their course before the end of most fights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">why should you have a problem with me soloing? :confused:<br />
<br />
The only problem I have with people who solo is that they expect to be able to do so when and where they choose.<br />
<br />
You cant move a couch in the trunk of your car like you could on the back of a truck... why? because it wasnt designed for it.<br />
<br />
EQ is the same.  You cant always solo, because the game is designed for groups.  Soloing and PvP are both just add ons in EQ.  They arent part of the design, they never have been.  You CAN solo, you CAN PvP... but allowing something and supporting it are not the same.<br />
<br />
Maybe the next game will do a better job of handling these niches, but dont expect EQ to.  Think of soloing as a priveledge, not a right.  &quot;hey, I can solo here! thats sweet!&quot;  vs &quot;I should be able to solo here! Grrr...&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was referrring to a complete failure.  If you DID get points for a complete failure, then I am happily wrong, you are happily right, and the world is a place filled with joy and bliss.<br />
<br />
I personally received nothing whatsoever for 2 failed attempts.  Ah well, such is life.  The successful attempt was worth 51 points.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I knew this would be the case as long as 3 or 4 months ago. Why would you shell out money for a pre-order without doing research into what you were buying first?<br />
<br />
And spells are nodrop. Have to buy them with adventure points. This wasn't specifically discussed beforehand, but anyone with experience in how SOE does expansions could have seen it coming a mile off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">From what I have seen so far this expansion is going to make live very difficult for the non-DPS classes (cleric, chanter, shaman).  The way the timing is set you need a solid dps output to beat the encounters.  More then 1 of the above classes and you probably get into trouble.<br />
Does anyone know if the engine looks at gear when generating the difficulty of the adventure? I went with an elemental gear group, and we had no problems.  But doing the same with a &quot;just 65, Turgadin gear, no AA's&quot; group would probably been a disaster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">As near as I can tell its purely average level, and the difficulty you select.  Doesnt matter 4-5-6 people, 0 aa-250aa, naked or time gear.</div></div><hr />

Well at best your statement was misleading. We &quot;failed&quot; the dungeon, but yes, we were 3 mobs short of the count when timer expired, so we killed the remaining 3 before we were booted.<br />

There are millions of anti-social people in the world, I find it hard to believe that no one in this thread is anti-social.<br />
<br />
Your attempt at reason is so laughable I won't even bother writing a unique response to you...here is a cut'n'paste from another thread. You tell me how I am being anti-social:<br />
<br />
<br />
I always have to laugh everytime some bright genius claims people shouldn't solo because this is supposed to be a multiplayer game and soloing isn't social.<br />
<br />
I used to solo pretty much exclusively. You say I wasn't being social?<br />
<br />
On the average night, I would wander over and buff a few dozen people in the zones I passed through. I'd jump in and help save the asses of a few groups or other individuals. Hell, it was for that ability (plus the ability to solo) that I made a Shaman to begin with.<br />
<br />
Others would jump in and help save my ass. In all cases, I am chatting with everyone I know, and everyone I meet.<br />
<br />
You, Mr. Social Grouper, probably don't interact with anyone outside your group. You can't head over and help someone running into trouble, because your group of 5 other people are expecting you to be there for their buffs and slows.<br />
<br />
When that guy you helped three days ago asks you to come recover his corpse on the moon, you can't...you are too busy at your static camp.<br />
(Update: This exact scenario happened last night. I thought of the original post and laughed)<br />
<br />
That great Enchanter who always gives you free KEI now because he saw you getting way too many adds one day and stepped in to mez, and you became friends while chatting? You didn't meet him. <br />
<br />
Now, of course, I hardly ever *get* to solo. My guild members found out that showing up where I was camping meant easy XP and loot. This is especially true now that I dual box a cleric (Epic as of this weekend, woot!)<br />
<br />
Of course, now I have to institute a new rule: &quot;Thou shalt not bitch when the Shaman and Cleric head off for 15 minutes on a Rez Run. Thou shalt pull or sit on thine asses while they are gone, as you choose, but thou shall not bitch.&quot;<br />
<br />
(In fairness, my guild members and friends have never, ever bitched about lost time due to rez or buff runs...but I expect them to happen a lot more now that the cleric has his epic, and I should probably make sure they understand that I *am* going to have people drag to us for Rez, or go chasing across several zones with little or no notice)<br />
(Update: As expected, their response was &quot;No problem. See ya when ya get back&quot;. Nice of them considering we were in the Hole, and I had the only keys...)<br />
<br />
Yeah, I'm such an unsocial bastard, playing EQ like a single player game. Idiot.</div></div><hr />

I will go to Velks and kill spiders or something...I'm not being anti-social...I'm doing what I want with the eq time that I have.  It's not because I don't like people...it's because I want as much &quot;action time&quot; as I can get instead of me waiting around for or starting a pick-up group.  Me being 57 I would think it is silly for me to form a group to kill green rockhoppers for superb pelts&#8230;don't you?  I like grouping much more but I will do what time permits.  Last night I solo'd the Frost Giant Outpost in GD with Gralk Dwarfkiller and Fergul Frostsky.  They were light blue but they had me on the ropes for a little with a wolf add or two it was still fun as hell.  With a group that would have been pretty lame.  It's all on how I want to play the game.  Slurm said it.  &quot;I will solo where I want, when I want.&quot;  As long as I leave you alone there is nothing you can do about it.  Now get over it.  Slurm &quot;Soloing is a privilege, not a right.&quot;  What are you going to do to stop me?  Why do you want to?  Why do you care, as long as I don't cause any unannounced trains or badger your group for buffs and heals and what not?  <br />
<br />
The crap people pick to get worried about, start paying my subscription and I will group with you every night&#8230;even when I have 15 minutes, that should last just until the buffing is done&#8230;then I will leave.</div></div><hr />

Poguk, Your trying so hard to make a point, your not reading your own definition. <br />

I have been on raids where I was much more anti-social, then times where I have been soloing. <br />
<br />
Soloing does not mean I turn off all my chat channels and ignore the world. <br />
<br />

My guildmates think I am a big soloer, because when they ask what I am doing my answer is &quot;nothing, just soloing some XYZ for a bit.  Got a spot for me?&quot;  I dont do LFG.  I say hi to people i know and ask on my channels if anyone has a group for me to join, then I go kill stuff by myself or with a bot.  If someone else comes on later and says hi, I will ask them if they want to partner up.  If I am LFG somewhere its because I really want to experience something... like LDON.  I will be LFG at the places I want to build points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Trena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">If all you do is solo or 2box, then yeah LDoN is prolly a waste. I was in beta but didn't buy the expansion primarily because by my experiences, the dungeons are best done with folks you're familiar with. As a dps class, getting pickup groups wouldn't be a problem. But given my experiences in PoP, I didn't have much confidence in the quality of the pickup groups I'd get more often than not. My regular groupmates are on hiatus from EQ for another 3 months so I figured there wasn't a point to me buying the expansion just yet.<br />
<br />
Nice bit of stereotyping in this thread. I 2box most of the time now as well but I bet the groups I play in wouldn't agree with the 'antisocial' tag being placed on me. Though I do agree totally with Slurm, I just think folks need to realize one thing. 2boxing just gives you an option to wasting time LFG. I would think that the antisocial label would apply to those who 5-6 box (but from personal experience with a few folks like that, it isn't an absolute with them either).<br />
<br />
and btw Corvus, I hate you too :) I have 4 friends in Horizons beta and despite what people are spouting (&quot;It sucks!&quot;, &quot;It'll never replace EQ&quot;, and other such tripe........even though actual content isn't being tested yet), I like what I'm being told and shown. Keep in mind guys, new MMOs are not being made to appeal to everyone. Think of it like music. EQ is N'Sync and J.Lo (basically &quot;Pop&quot;) and the other games are choosing to stick to one or two niches.</div></div><hr />

I know at least 30 people in game who love to solo and do it all the time, that's even more $$ for SoE.  I myself solo alot when my regular grouping buddies are not online.  An entire CLASS (necro) solo's almost exclusively.<br />
<br />
If there were no way for me to solo in this game, I wouldn't play it for months at a time.  Would I pay for it then? Hell no.  And neither would alot of other people I know.<br />

It makes zero business sense to attempt to discourage a large group of your customers.   Now I know for this expansion in particular, with instanced dungeons it might have become a problem for them to create so many more servers.  But cmon, what the hell else are they spending all that cash on?   You guys do know they make a killing with this game, they could have splurged a little.</div></div><hr />

Poguk, exactly what is the difference between me typing words into a chat channel, and me typing words into the /group channel?  From a roleplaying aspect, sure soloing seems anti-social, but honestly, Who is more anti-social: Someone who joins a group and says little or nothing for an hour, or Someone who solo's and spends most of the time chatting away in guild chat?<br />

My understanding is the Horizons is PvP.  Does it have the option to completely disable PvP (server choice, whatever) that EQ has?  <br />
<br />
This is a serious question as LDoN has convinced me that not only do the EQ Devs have little interest in catering for casual players, they don't even know what a casual player is.  I am interested in changing from EQ as I don't like being a 3rd rate citizen simply because the developers seem to pander to a minority of the playerbase.<br />
<br />
I was enthusiastic about LDoN because instanced dungeons meant I would no longer have to contend with the antics of 11yr olds or adults with an 11yr old's mentality.  Changing to a game where they could even kill my character would be a step backwards.</div></div><hr />

I agree, when I'm playing EQ, I'm being social on the game, but I'm not being social in RL.  I know that can of worms. ;)<br />
<br />
But there is more to being social than typing a few words in a chat channel.  It involves grouping, working together, having roles and responsibilities that are relative to each other.  It's about interaction.  You don't do that when you're soloing.  Typing a few words in a chat channel while soloing is not exactly the epitome of being social.<br />
<br />
The quiet person in the group is still interacting with others more than someone who is soloing, for all the reasons I mentioned above.</div></div><hr />

That's fine and I can accept that, but the bottom line is that not everybody wants to group with other people, and not everyone enjoys playing the game the same way you do. <br />
<br />
I do want to be able to solo to get my xp. If I have more downtime and take longer to level (hello - over 3 years to get to level 58), then that's my choice and my problem. <br />
<br />
The point of my initial post is that I seem to have bought an expansion that doesn't offer even the smallest amount of content (beyond buying equipment that other people have augmented) that I, as a soloer/two-boxer can use. PoP was all about planes that were supposedly (at the time) un-soloable, but it was still an expansion that benefitted *everyone* immensely. <br />
<br />
Is there a glimmer of hope that they might reduce the required group size to 2 or even 1 in the future?</div></div><hr />

It's not Sony's fault you bought the expansion.  As an investor, you should have done your homework and made the financial wisdom on whether to purchase the product or not.  They've clearly stated for months now that the expansion was based on 4-6 player groups.  The new features coming out in this expansion have been known for a long time, and readily accessible by everyone.<br />
<br />
And like the above poster said, it's all about having resources to allow the 100s of thousands of instanced dungeons created by every soloer out there.  A 4-6 person group takes up 1 instanced dungeon... as does a 1 person group.  It's less efficient.  Each instance piles on that much more consumed system resources.  <br />
<br />
This game is still a massive-multiplayer game... people demanding soloing options just don't make sense to me.</div></div><hr />

Please, Poguk, tell me where on the official website (http://everquest.station.sony.com/lostdungeons/index.jsp) it says anything about group size. All I had heard was &quot;single-group&quot;. I group everytime I play - with myself on another box. Based on that, I didn't expect to be able to spawn a dungeon for one, but I didn't see why two wouldn't qualify.<br />
<br />
I was done with this thread when I found out there's a chance they'll drop the group-of-4 limit, but you keep drudging up your anti-soloing rhetoric. You fail to realize that it's people like *you* who make so many of us prefer to solo.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't say you're a &quot;bad guy&quot;, but your anti-soloing zeal definitely makes you annoying.<br />
<br />
First you said that they clearly state the group must be 4-6, so I pointed out that no, it doesn't. TWO toons can make a group, as I do every time I play. The NDA on beta-testing wasn't lifted until last Friday, which was well after I'd pre-ordered my two copies. But like I said, I'm over my initial rant if there's a chance it will be changed like they did with the Velious TP keys, the POP flags, etc...<br />
<br />
Next time I see one of your guildies solo farming the Soulstripper, should I tell them to stop being anti-social and to get a group?</div></div><hr />

If you think that Sony doesn't consider soloing to be a viable style of play, then you are nuts. How many groups are targetting light-blue monsters? Why did they add light-blue a couple years ago? I'm at work now, but I'm 80% certain that it says right on the character creation screen that certain classes make good soloers. If Sony made it impossible to solo, I guarantee they'd lose at least 20% of their customer base, because a lot of us have families, jobs and other assorted lives and can't LFG for an hour when that's all the time we have to play.<br />
<br />
I am definitely PRO-soloing, but that doesn't make me anti-raid or anti-group. I've never earned a single drop of xp in a PoP zone. I don't expect to solo in NTOV or CT. I just want to be able to be able to kill *something* for experience somewhere (not &quot;anywhere&quot;) when I have a short time to play without having to make a big coordinated event out it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Never said soloing wasn't in the game, or that Sony hasn't accomodated soloers.... but the game is based on group-interaction as it's premise.  They design it to allow people to achieve more things in groups than in solo.  Basically, they encourage grouping.  That's why you see those posts when Suchinsuch uber shaman solo's a major mob... 'cause that mob wasn't designed to be solo'd.  It was designed to be grouped.  It makes the feat that much more incredible that a single player can solo a mob designed to be challenging for groups of people, but the underlying fact is it was designed with groups of people in mind, not the Uber001 class in mind.  I have nothing against soloers, if that's what you think.  I'm just saying that soloers need to understand their limitations in this game that is based on grouping.</div></div><hr />

I always have to laugh everytime some bright genius claims people shouldn't solo because this is supposed to be a multiplayer game and soloing isn't social.<br />
<br />
I used to solo pretty much exclusively. You say I wasn't being social?<br />
<br />
On the average night, I would wander over and buff a few dozen people in the zones I passed through. I'd jump in and help save the asses of a few groups or other individuals. Hell, it was for that ability (plus the ability to solo) that I made a Shaman to begin with.<br />
<br />
Others would jump in and help save my ass. In all cases, I am chatting with everyone I know, and everyone I meet.<br />
<br />
You, Mr. Social Grouper, probably don't interact with anyone outside your group. You can't head over and help someone running into trouble, because your group of 5 other people are expecting you to be there for their buffs and slows.<br />
<br />
When that guy you helped three days ago asks you to come recover his corpse on the moon, you can't...you are too busy at your static camp.<br />
(Update: This exact scenario happened last night. I thought of the original post and laughed)<br />
<br />
That great Enchanter who always gives you free KEI now because he saw you getting way too many adds one day and stepped in to mez, and you became friends while chatting? You didn't meet him. <br />
<br />
Now, of course, I hardly ever *get* to solo. My guild members found out that showing up where I was camping meant easy XP and loot. This is especially true now that I dual box a cleric (Epic as of this weekend, woot!)<br />
<br />
Of course, now I have to institute a new rule: &quot;Thou shalt not bitch when the Shaman and Cleric head off for 15 minutes on a Rez Run. Thou shalt pull or sit on thine asses while they are gone, as you choose, but thou shall not bitch.&quot;<br />

(In fairness, my guild members and friends have never, ever bitched about lost time due to rez or buff runs...but I expect them to happen a lot more now that the cleric has his epic, and I should probably make sure they understand that I *am* going to have people drag to us for Rez, or go chasing across several zones with little or no notice)<br />
(Update: As expected, their response was &quot;No problem. See ya when ya get back&quot;. Nice of them considering we were in the Hole, and I had the only keys...)<br />
<br />
Yeah, I'm such an unsocial bastard, playing EQ like a single player game. Idiot.<br />
<br />
Holy crap, this is a really.... really bad response.  Whew!  Alrighty then!   :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Onte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">There are a bazillion places a level 58 can solo and 2-box.  Some ain't that great for xp, but minimal xp is progress and progress = happy.  Burning Woods, Skyfire, Tier 1 PoP, Dulak's Harbor, The Grey, ME, Akheva, SolB, Seb, some Nadox - I'm sure I missed a few.  But my point is that there is plenty of mid to high end solo content without wanting more for a few more months, at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Why did they add light-blue a couple years ago?<br />
<br />
It was added to distinguish between greens that gave XP and greens that did not. All the greens that used to give XP are light blue now. It has NOTHING to do with soloing.<br />
<br />
I never expected to solo in LDoN - I thought I could 2-box.<br />
<br />
You are like Bracy...making up your own definition of something that is at odds with the one that everyone else uses. You are the only person I know who considers 2-boxing to be &quot;a group&quot;.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, I could, with trivial searching, find probably a dozen websites/messageboards with specific mentions of the 4-6 per group requirement. That you did not do this is ENTIRELY YOUR OWN FAULT. You have absolutely no ground whatsoever to complain about this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Kamm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Poguk, makes a fine example, Thats it's impossible to make your point with someone that knows everything. <br />

You seem to have a Holier then tho, thing going on.<br />
<br />
I never knew about the Group size, level or time limits, either. Till a week or so ago, and I read the boards daily. No, I am not complaining about the expansion. I think its great.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Just havin' a good ol' fashioned debate, Kamm, which happens occasionally on a forum  :rolleyes:  Not really about being &quot;holier&quot; than anybody.</div></div><hr />

You call it debate, I'll call it a flame. I feel dumber for becoming part of it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Wow! Holy Flamage batman.<br />
<br />
If you are that anti-social that you will only solo or 2 box (as in you REFUSE to play with ANYONE), you just wasted your money. Buy a good one player and you'll always be happy though(ok, yea, guilty on this sentence).<br />
<br />
If it I had just put up the first sentence would there have been half the response there was?  I know the whole go buy a one player line is lame/stupid/bull****, I'm sorry it slipped in, wasn't thinking and I apologize.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Heh, listen to yourselves. You are equalling being in a group and serving a function as social. Sure being a janitor is being part of society to, but that not being &quot;social&quot;. Social is interacting with people, chatting, saying hello, joking about their girlfriend or what happened in the football game last night. Remembering to snare and /assist Bob_the_tank doesn't make you social. Hell, half my pick up group members are silent xp grinding forgettable people who'm I equate more as necessary parts of a machine than social people.<br />
<br />
Point is, you can be social in a chat channel or a /tell as much as you can in /group chat. On the flipside you can a boring silent automation while surrounded by a full group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Tuibumbi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">It amazes me how some people can pass judgement on others as to label them anti-social in a GAME!! I think some therapy is in order for some of you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why isn't that a social interaction?  It's activity within a group.  Your actions are interacting with each other's actions to perform a function.  Being social isn't limited to just verbal communication ;)  Ants are a social insect, and I'm not aware of any verbal communication between them. ;)<br />
<br />
Sorry if I linger on this topic, guys, it just interests me :)  Plus it boosts my post-count.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, passing judgement happens to be a common activity for people.  And the game we're talking about is a social game.  Is it really that amazing?</div></div><hr />

I need therapy?  Is that your judgement on the matter?  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Shazzog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">My understanding is the Horizons is PvP.  Does it have the option to completely disable PvP (server choice, whatever) that EQ has?  <br />
<br />
<br />
The new Horizons will be no PVP at all...not even consensual, at first.<br />
<br />
There was a huge black out period, then Horizons development came back revamped.<br />

Dragons are still in.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">If you *ONLY* solo/2-box, then no... there's not really much, if anything, for you in LDoN.  I'd have thought that would have been obvious months ago when they announced that you'd need a group of 4+ to get into any of the dungeons.  As far as getting spells from LDoN, does seem kinda a shaft for those soloers who were ill-informed enough to buy LDoN... <br />
<br />
Suppose they were to make the spells droppable, anyone wanna take a guess as to what the price would be like for Bane?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">I wish someone could explain to me the difference between me talking in tells or guildsa when someone is beside me in a group or 10 zones away.  When I send a tell or guildsa, you get it whether you are in my group or not.  I communicate with you the exact same way with people whether I am grouped or soloing.  Whether the person I am talking to is inflicting some sort of damage on the mob that I am attacking is moot.  I find it funny that anti-social is one pixel in a room and social is two or more pixels.  It's just a pixel.<br />
<br />
Reasons to solo<br />
No rolling on loot<br />
No waiting for afks<br />
No waiting for groups<br />
No &quot;I need agi now&quot; messages<br />
Don't have to deal with other people's stupidity (my own stupidity is quite enough some nights)<br />
<br />
Reasons not to solo<br />
Limited targets<br />
Longer downtime<br />
<br />
Reasons to group<br />
Have a good time with other people<br />
Faster exp gain (sometimes)<br />
Chance for better loot (but 1/6 of a chance of actually winning it)<br />
Capable of hitting targets that are impossible to do solo<br />
<br />
Reasons not to group<br />
Invert all reasons to solo<br />
<br />
Please feel free to add your own reasons.<br />
<br />
I may read this post later and think...what kind of peyote flashback was I on when I wrote this. It makes sense to me now so what can I do? :confused:<br />
<br />
I guess the question is...do you think anti-social is a bad thing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">No, I don't think it's bad.  It's just the way you are.  But some people get so damn defensive when you say they're being anti-social... it's as if they regard it as an insult.  You're either being social, or anti-social.  It's not like you're either one or the other 100% of the time.  Sometimes I'm being social (being a shaman entails quite a bit of socialness), but other times I can be anti-social.  Like I said, I can be anti-social sometimes, and the &quot;reasons to solo&quot; that you mentioned above are exactly why I solo.  But it's still being anti-social, even if you have good reasons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Kamm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">But some people get so damn defensive when you say they're being anti-social... it's as if they regard it as an insult.  <br />
<br />
Bingo, I think you got it. I find it insulting to be labeled as something I'm not. Well, at least I did find it annoying at one point, that was before I classified you as trolling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">Kamm is correct.  It is a label and people (myself included) just get pissed when one is applied to them/us.  You took a large group of people and slapped a label on us.  What if I said that anybody with 4 or more everquest characters over lvl 50 were shut-ins with no social life.  Now that is an extreme example mind you and I actually feel bad typing it but I can guarantee you it would get you and many other people pissed off.<br />
<br />
This is totally not even worth talking about any more.  Wasting web space for two people to argue about playing styles, which is all this is.  Even the original poster has stopped posting here.  Lets all just smile and get on with our day.  It's the weekend for Tribunals sake!  Crack a *insert favorite liquid beverage here* and enjoy life doing what ever it is you love doing most!</div></div><hr />
