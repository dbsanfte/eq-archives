<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bajen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Currently I am in Gunthak beach getting a tan with the undeads. All is splendid, kills are fast and our pets enjoy the fun. <br />
<br />
We get ok XP and drops of bone chips and zombie skins. I have seen that some necros dislike the XP in Gunthak in favor for Echo caverns for example.<br />
<br />
You guys have any feedback on a zone/spot where you *just* can solo with a shammy 39? I figure my duo team will do well there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Solusek.Spirituous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you can try DL...as long as u pull the mob to one of the designated camps so you dont get any adds</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bajen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the tip. I havent left the gulf yet but I will as soon as my necro ding. Then I will have Shammy 40 and Necro 38. The closest I have been to death was one of two pets being killed since my necro was feared away from the battle.<br />
<br />
I guess things will be rougher in DL but the pulling is easy enough.</div></div><hr />
