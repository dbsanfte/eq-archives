<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Codlugarthia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What's the longest camp You ever had to go through?<br />
<br />
I've heard that Raster in LGuk can take pretty long.<br />
But my longest camp was the AC in OOT. It took me 54 hours to get him to spawn with my first character, a necro.<br />
That was back in the days without AA's and I absoulutely needed those Boots...<br />
<br />
It was not one session though, but over the course of 3 months.<br />
So it would also be interesting to hear what Your longest ONE session camp was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think I waited 2 hours for a Elder Wolf Hide.<br />

Other than that, I can't camp.  I have camping narcolepsy (sp).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My longest camp was the Pained Soul in TT for my VP key quest.  I did two 7 hour sessions and hated every second of it.<br />
<br />
One of my guildies camped Ragefire in Sol B for 140 consecutive hours.  He quit the game soon after acquiring his epic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I gave up on Grizzleknot after 2 days , then found him up twice by accident later on !<br />
<br />
Oh and I suppose trying to find Gorenaire up for more than a micro second for my Bard epic, hmm about 6 months and rising.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I spent over 80 hours camping comm2 for my emperor key.  I lost on the roll to guildies over 30 times (if you do the math on that, its astronomical how bad my luck is) until last night when we killed him on the way to xtc and everyone agreed I should get the piece by default :)  Thank god I finally got it, because having to spend every day in ssra for a month was completely sapping my will to play the game.  I just didn't want to log on any more I was so burned out and frustrated.<br />
<br />
My other really bad camp was the glacier bear when I was level 35.  I killed his placeholders (the two roaming skeletons) 11 times in a row, and he never spawned.  I spent an entire weekend waking up every 7 (or is it 6?  been a year) hours to kill him and I got so frustrated that I quit EQ for about a month.<br />
<br />
The student's log was a real pain in the ass.  Took me two 6-hour sessions to get him.  It was the hardest part of my epic, for me.  Wasn't too bad, though, in comparison with the other things I have done.<br />
<br />
Other notoriously bad camps are:<br />
<br />
Stormfeather (for the eyepatch of plunder).  Spawns every 12 hours I think, and skips spawns a lot.  Most shamans never do that quest, though.<br />
<br />
Old School ragefire.  This was just a terrible terrible camp.  The cleric would have to be there for days at a time, and the guild had to keep a small force there at all times to try and prevent another guild from KSing or moving in and taking it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Com2 for me.. Camped 18hours straight for that piece and I still dont get it.. I havent been there since either :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Spinashe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">On my ranger, 500 hours camping Stormfeather over about 4-5months. Got about 6-7 lodizals in that time (pre-spawn time change on lodizal). <br />
<br />
I saw 5 stormfeathers in total I think it was, 2 died before I could log on my main (after 100hours defending a spawn you get bored of pvping for it and spend some time with your gf WHILE camping it ;P 2 were KS'd and the other I got :P<br />
<br />
My shattered emerald of corruption from PoH for my primary epic took me 1year 3/4 to get, did 20+ hate raids for it killing all mini's.. eventually I bought an MQ for 20k+30k in items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Xahra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Heh, I can't camp stuff.  I get too bored after not long at all.<br />
<br />
That said, my longest camp ever was a 4-hour run in Kurn's Tower for those damned skulls with x's.  I was getting up and walking around the house constantly though.  In total, I spent about 12 hours getting skulls there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">28 hours in CoM to get my students log.<br />
<br />
6 hours to get my piece for testement of venear (Back in the days when it was usefull and you had to fight off KSers)<br />
<br />
Now whenever I run through High Pass I always swing by, always up, how depressing :(<br />
<br />
The longest time I spent in one spot was killing the back IG spawn in EF. Probibly 25 straight hours there, had a mule doing bank runs and was PLing him at the same time. I was a rich bastage when that was over :)</div></div><hr />

Started working on that at level 12,  camped it a few hours at a time on and off till I deleted my charater at 51.  Once at level 48 I slaughtered everything in the zone for 10 hours straight.  I swore I would own that tunic but I saw exactly two bloodbulks in all that time and neither one dropped a carapace and you need 4 to complete the quest.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to try any more with this character!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Laktose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Raster only took me about 12 hours on my monk.<br />
<br />
Overseer in Nurga?  Hehe, on my necro I basically lived there from 39-44, saw him up 3 times within one hour.  Nada any other day.  <br />
<br />
Weird.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Raster - got him 2 times in 3 hours. (Here's how you increase your chances)<br />
<br />
(All times are EQ time)<br />
<br />
0800 Mino spawn - allow to despawn<br />
Kill next spawn<br />
2000 Mino Spawn - allow to despawn<br />
Kill next spawn<br />
(Kill everything in between)<br />
<br />
Overseer / etc in Droga / Nurga. 6 hours. Got lucky. Have ally faction with Chardok and tons of salts and skins to repair faction after I whack a noble or 5.<br />
<br />
AC - got him in about 4 hours. BOOORING. Think I practiced fishing while my poles lasted. (Monk tends to break a fishing pole 1/20 casts - Faern has the same one he's had since level 1 - go figure)<br />
<br />
Ochre Clay, and Cann 2 weren't bad - I was still able to get exp and get help (respectively) for both quests.<br />
<br />
OH OH OH - the damned item that spawns BEHIND the bed in Dalnir for Enchanter Epic quest. 24 hour spawn that ISN'T. I was blurry eyed after that nightmare.<br />
<br />
Enchanter Epic is crazy. (16 items, 15 are ND). Rare drop off of Hate MOB, rare spawn in Fear that is KOS to MOBs around it. Guess I can be thankful the spoon off of Cazic is tradeable.<br />
<br />
Camping is ridiculous. Guess it goes along with abashi's line: &quot;Sometimes people like to be the victim.&quot; (Hey abashi - two words - Jarret diet)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Silvergun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">When the Arisen Cultist camp in TT briefly started spawning MOBs again, my guild noticed it first on Zeb and held the camp for most of the time they were up.  We farmed dozens of copies of the Band of the Arisen Cultist, the rare drop, and assigned loot priority based on longevity and quantity of rings attained (Ring: Ac5 Str5 Sta10 Wis10 Int10 Hp25 Mana25 Svd15 Svp15, Not Lore, No Drop).  I arrived around noon on a Saturday to go for my second ring, and was third on the list.  Of course, to be fair to the people in the guild who had none, we let those with zero rings get bumped ahead of those who had one already.  During the day, my position on the list slowly dropped into double digits as those new to the camp got ahead of me to get their one ring.  By evening, I was back to maybe 5th or 6th, and held there until around 1 or 2am Sunday, when people started dropping off.  Back to third.  Second.  FInally by 5am, I was next on the list.  We ran into a dry spell for drops, and at 8am, I was mortally exhausted- and still empty handed.  No one I knew was awake to spell me, and I didn't trust anyone at the camp with my login info.  I had to log- it was that or risk falling asleep within minutes and leaving my toon standing at a dangerous spot- potentially earning me an unrezzed death while I slept.  So after setting my personal record of twenty-one hours, I came up empty. =p  Since then, I haven't camped a damned thing.</div></div><hr />

Sad considering I could have killed HGs and made enough to buy two JBBs in that time. (I know I know, the gems in seb over 100+ hours probibly add up to more then 20k, not to mention all the rare drops in 4D, but damnit I just can't hand on to money)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Grizzleknot here too, spent probably 50 real hours looking, about 6-8 grizzles popped, killed by trackers and lucky people, not one of them would let a shaman loot without paying alot, so i didn't.<br />

Finally just killed ocully and got the chest.<br />
<br />
Never got glacier bear either<br />
<br />
<br />
but longest ever probably, off and on, was finding Mortificator Syythrak(spelling?) I hunted on and of for a year before finally found him. Loved that staff.<br />

The longest and most frustrating of all was the D*MN SNOW GRIFFONS in EW.  I got four eggs in about 2 days, made the souffle, and turned it in to the WRONG #!$*! DWARF.  Took me 2 WEEKS of additional camping every night to get the next four eggs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You'd think I would have learned my lesson not to camp stuff like that which quickly becomes junk.<br />
<br />
But then I spent about 20 hours camping the gnome in Shadowhaven for the cloak of truth.  Gave up, randomly checked one time and there he was.  <br />
<br />
It's really rare I'll camp something like that now, where I just stare at walls.</div></div><hr />

Never found Grizzleknot up although I spent multiple long hour sessions looking for him for weeks.  Just ended up buying the bark.<br />
<br />
Spent an evening and most of a night, around 10hours I think camping AC in OOT for JBoots for my rogue, never showed up and still havent been back.<br />
<br />
Right before I quit, I was pleveling my druid on a second account at Chief Rog'Kus or whatever his name is for an Idol of the Thorned for my rogue.  Spent about 14 hours straight there and never got the drop, was so pissed off, probably one of the things that drove me to the edge of quitting for a year.  Went back a couple of weeks ago to begin factioning and got one the second day after a few hours.</div></div><hr />

People would just log on, stay in line and go AFK, checking in every 2 to 4hours.  I still have bad dreams about that camp.<br />

Well, lets just say that when Peqi spawned(he immediately starts buffing himself) I almost jumped right through the roof, but I did get him once I wedged myself out of the hole in the ceiling.<br />

<br />
Never did delsna but did camp jboots for my enchanter but that was only a couple hours.<br />
<br />
The enchanter epic is pretty crazy. Been down to just the shissar for probably a year. Seen him up twice. Once lost the roll, other time he aggroed on the amgs while being pulled and got killed =(<br />
<br />
That bastard pained soul in TT was pretty bad for me too.<br />
<br />
Over all there has been enough pain the ass long annoying camps it's hard to pick just one as the worst or longest.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Haed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">I've learned not to camp. Period. Ever. Here's why.<br />
<br />
Monkly camps:<br />
<br />
Raster: 27 hours (I got lucky). One spawn. Happy monk.<br />
Raster: Up, uncamped, 2 of the last 5 times I've been in Lguk.<br />
<br />
Targin: 17 hours. Straight. One spawn. One exhausted, but relieved monk.<br />
Targin: Up the last time I went to SolB. Uncamped. I could puke.<br />
<br />
Fingered skellys: 16 hours. 4 fingers. Grumpy, but accepting monk.<br />
Fingered skellys: Taking a friend to show him Kurns. /ooc Ranger here camping IBC. Got all four fingers if anyone wants them.<br />
<br />
Minimonkeys (for intact mandible): Countless hours... until I learned to turn up the SOUND on my PC. You can hear them when they're up. When they're not... go away and come back later. 10 for 10 (for guildies) in less than 15 minutes per camp that way.<br />
<br />
Kwinn: 9 hours. No spawns.<br />
Kwinn: Chillin through FV omw to a druid epic fight in sonh. 2 Kwinns in less than 5 mintues.<br />
<br />
Brother Qwynn: DAYS waiting for the bastard to pop.<br />
Brother Qwynn: Running through SK on my way to an event at the arena. Thought I might get lucky and find quillmane up for a guildie. BING! Brother Q.<br />
<br />
Misc. camps.<br />
<br />
AC: Never camped him. Killed him twice. 2 of the last 3 times I was in Sro, he was up. Zone was empty. Just running through, or decided to pop in and see if I got lucky.<br />
<br />
Shammy camps:<br />
<br />
Oh dear god the snow griff eggs and miscellaneous crap for rings quests. Way too many hours to count. /puke<br />
<br />
...<br />
...<br />
...<br />
<br />
Quit in disgust for 6 weeks.<br />
<br />
Come back and...<br />
<br />
5th shawl.<br />
Another AC ring.<br />
19 more eggs in the bank, stacks of hides for ring quests. 8th ring on a buddy, 7th on the way for me and monky.<br />
<br />
... how? ... <br />
<br />
If I'm in a zone for another reason, I check to see what I can get for my quest stuff... ONCE. If it's not up, fook it. Go do something else.<br />
<br />
Running to Kael working on faction to turn in Skyshrine armor. Detour over to orc fort instead of going straight to Kael.If anything's up on the way (rhino, cougar, griffon, kodiak, walrus), kill it. Then move on to Kael.<br />
<br />

You got the story backwards my friend :D Up until late august I was in an active raiding guild, actually got to PoM from a night of triplets in NToV in June I think. Then a couple months later I deguilded because of the very fact I had little time to invest into eq.<br />
<br />
October/November I wasn't playing, but before I took that break I decided to stay bound in PoM, and around Xmas time, I played again on and off, and finally got those boots a couple weeks ago :cool: <br />
<br />
The very issue is I cannot afford to join a raiding guild anymore because of rl constraints, and that's why I felt kinda proud of myself over obtaining leet boots all solo :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">ah, cool.  RL &gt; EQ and all that.  I know the feeling exactly.  I was an inactive member of my own guild off and on for a while.  Right now I'm pretty darn active.  Raiding cycles wax and wane.  I just wanted to stick with the same guild for when I could come back and raid some.</div></div><hr />

I spend eight straight days in those caves.  I would log on every 8 hours and wait for them to spawn while working on my spell casting skills, then log off and repeat.  <br />
<br />
Miragul and I got along just fine after that.   Talk about exciting when he did finally spawn!  MONSTROUS bear.<br />

Of course I took 4 months off from EQ after that.  Couldn't stand it.  =P</div></div><hr />

<br />
One of the worst experiences I have had actually camping things was with the old gold ring camp for the Paw of Opolla.  I havent been back to kerra isle since then and if I did the slaughter would just be too much for the server to handle I think. :)  I remember I took the day off work, it was one of those use it or lose it things, and I sat down in the morning to camp that wench Mitty.  I keeled that cat all day and was visited by several occasions by friends and would be camp stealers.  On the 13th hour of madness I looted what looked to be a gold ring! but alas it was non magic... it either was put there by an invised sick person or she had that on her drop table as well.  About an hour later she did drop the real thing and I was sick of EQ I didnt even finish the quest (had all the other rings except gold) for a week or so after heh... A friend of mine took over after and got another gold ring about an hour after I left... :( heh such is life.<br />

Raster at a little over 80 hours.  Most people seem to agree that his spawn time was upped -- You can talk to the really-older-than-old-school monks out there who spent 100 - 250 hours camping him.<br />

<br />
Something like camping Kwinn the Outlander in FV for the monk shackle I'll do, but I'd camp the main there, get up a group of the right lvl, exp there and hope he pops. I don't consider that camping. <br />
<br />
My worst camp personally was 8 hours at the Fear portal, watching 3 guilds wipe trying to get our corpses out on one of those days when the whole zone had chain agro that just wouldn't settle down. The lucky ones only ate 1 or two unrezzed deaths that day. That was the closest I've come to quitting EQ (at least pre-PoP). <br />
<br />
On the other hand, I really don't mind helping friends camp an item. I guess because I'm under no pressure to stay for a certain length of time. The absolute worst was 2 weeks in Skyfire waiting for Rage. The first week wasn't too bad since he wasn't first in line. The second week was hell, servers would come for a patch right as his spawn window was set to open and reset everything back to 3 days minimum spawn. I never could decide whether the clerics that did that camp were just a lot more dedicated than me or fools. <br />
... probably a bit of both. ;-)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>tangurena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">Pained soul was not too bad, about 8-ish hours, but at level 53 or 54 it was decent exp camping the guy for several evenings. The rotting skelly seemed to take forever, until I turned off the /ooc and /shout in the zone, then it turned out it was only 2 or 3 hours.<br />
<br />
Undead Crusaders are the pits. I've been in Kurns for about 12 hours and managed to snag only 1 skull out of the 6 needed. Offering 100pp for any of the skulls with an X just gets me the sound of crickets. It is looking like this camp will take longer than the time it took to max all factions in cabilis.<br />
<br />
Drusel is the worst. I have been held up for 8 months on that quest, killed her 3 times in that period, lost the race 10 times to folks that leapfrogged past us while we were in the zone heading for her. Folks sell the MQ for 80kpp to 100kpp on Luclin. Bastards.</div></div><hr />

Raster pops. I don't think it gets any better than that. The guy had been there for like 40 hours.<br />
<br />
Last night a Bard friend of mine asked if we could help her in KC to get the skull from the Warlord. We get there and it's camped so we just kill in LCY for about an hour. Finally the group that's got the Warlord camp leaves frustrated with no skull drops so we head to the hand room. We get a spawn of hands, clear them out then 2 warlords pop. Guess  what?? both had a skull on them! AND not five minutes later Pawbuster pops!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">Worst camp ever:  Mitty.<br />
<br />
Not for me, I never got a gold ring, but for this poor erudite cleric that was there in front of me.<br />
<br />
See, I got there to camp Mitty and she'd been there for several hours already.  She's actually paid for a babysitter so her kids aren't being ignored while mom camps something in EQ.  I say, hey, that's cool, I'll sit here with you and we'll kill Mitty until you get your ring, then I'll get mine after you.  All is good.<br />
<br />
So we sit around chatting and killing Mitty.<br />
<br />
Third person shows up, and a fourth, everyone's OK with this arrangement - first there gets ring, then second there, then third, and so on.  Very friendly bunch of people really, everyone's in about as good of a mood as you can be in.<br />
<br />
We're in a line, and we're all killing Mitty when she pops and cheering for this poor cleric.  She got a gold ring at one point but it was the non magic cheap loot variety.<br />
<br />
18 hours in from MY point of view - so figure 24 or more hours for this cleric - some dorf cleric shows up.<br />
<br />
We explain how we're doing the camp, where the cleric who's been there over a day will be getting the next gold ring to drop.<br />
<br />
He's not happy about this.  Calls a guide to enforce PnP.  (PnP had just been implemented, I think the week before)<br />
<br />
Guide says, basically, that we all have to take turns at Mitty and each of us gets every fifth Mitty.<br />
<br />
The four people that were there when the dorf showed up all immediately announce that we'll give the erudite cleric the first ring that drops if it drops on any of our turns.<br />
<br />
The dorf immediately uses THAT to say that we're a group, therefore one entity, and that he now gets every other Mitty instead of every fifth one.<br />
<br />
Guide backs him up.<br />
<br />
Erudite cleric logs.  I put her on my friends list, but didn't see her again.<br />

<br />
So I target him, and who do I see?! Then we go to Kedge for the shark fin or whatnot, that actually took an hour, and good thing he was there too because I felt so gimp with my ice nukes :(<br />
<br />
Glacier bear was super easy and did it multiple times for friends, once you figure it out its easy anyway, and I did it when lots of people were still after it.<br />
<br />
He was always my Moby Dick, and in the end just ended up buying the helm for 5k.  Didn't really appreciate that one time I waltzed in the caves, uv wears off, it's night-time, and have the liche play a little game of knock knock :( <br />
<br />
Think I actually made the 5k and more by repeatedly questing Paw of Opolla, and I do believe Gynok is the one mob in EQ I've spent the most amount of time camping without any breaks, without any sleep - 27 hours, got so bored in the end I took my laptop out and started playing solitaire :p <br />
<br />
Then a week later, I got him twice in 2 hours, once dropping gold ring then plat, so go figure :D</div></div><hr />

Grizzleknot I hunted off and on over a 3-day period, but only for 2 to 4 hours at a time. Found him on the third day and got the bark. Have seen him probably 3 times since then, and killed him two of those times.<br />
<br />
Never bothered looking for the glacier bear because another shaman friend of mine was always camping him and telling me the horror story. Eventually that friend did send me a tell one day to come down and kill the bear and I got a helm. I think I got my RE helm about 2 days later.<br />
<br />
Shield of Bane Warding and Talisman of Benevolence took some camping, but I think I got pretty lucky on most of those pieces. No sleepless nights there. Got real lucky on that gnome in Shadowhaven, I think...found him up and uncamped, but the quest was still new at the time.<br />
<br />
They're not really 'camps' in the traditional sense, but the things that have taken the longest for me have always been armor sets. About 9 months to complete my Rune Etched armor, and now I think I've been waiting about that long for a bp and legs to drop in ToV.</div></div><hr />
