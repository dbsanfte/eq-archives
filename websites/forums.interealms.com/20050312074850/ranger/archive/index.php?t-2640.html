<br />
Can anyone give me any info on this dude pls<br />
<br />
I'm thinking of having him as a target for our guild to fight<br />
<br />
just post info you are certain over, ie. hitpoints, flurries, how much he hits for, what spells he cast (like knockback, blind)<br />
<br />
I understand theres a *ring* event to spawn him, if anyone has the info on this I would be thankful<br />
<br />
thankyou  brothers and sisters of the glade<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lothoris</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">this is the info I have found so far<br />
<br />
anyone able to add anything or confirm/deny stuff<br />
<br />
Burrower Beast is an event similiar to Ring of Fire. Once someone steps <br />
into his lair, the event will start. A Massive Burrower which is not targetable <br />
spawns at entrance , and Burrower Beast (untargetable) spawns at left side of dead-end<br />
tunnel <br />
There are 11 waves: first 3 waves of 11 worms doubling 230~, 4th, 5th, 6th waves contain 6<br />
medium size of worm in each hitting 400~, and final wave of 2 giant worms flurries 400. In<br />
first 3 waves, 3 - 4 rocky worms are mezzable while others are not, so splitting tanks on rest<br />
of unmezzable worms. 6 medium worm will be easier since some tanks from first wave would<br />
start assisting to kill 6 unmezzable worms in next 3 waves. Final wave before Burrower<br />
Parasite has 2 giant worms which flurries 470~. Main tanking each till they both dead. During<br />
each wave, there is 2 minutes break to rez, heal-up, and buff. Burrower Parasite will now<br />
spawn in the back of lair, so you dont want to sit there or get chewed up first. He only double<br />
and flurries 1170, but he is not slowable or crippleable. Even you failed attempting Avatar of<br />
War, you will not lose to Burrower Beast once you get cleric healing chain setup right.<br />
<br />
<br />
thankyou<br />
