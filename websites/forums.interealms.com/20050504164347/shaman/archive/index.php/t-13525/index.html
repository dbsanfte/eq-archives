<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Seekrit documents uncovered in SOE garbage bin reveal Plane of Time conspiracy:<br />
<br />
Here's the scoop. SOE recently advertised it was going to provide &quot;incentives&quot; for EQ1 players to play EQ2.  The languishing EQOA for Playstation 2 also features in their plans.<br />
<br />
Apparently, at the far end of PoTB are two portals called &quot;Portal of the Future&quot; and &quot;Portal of the Past&quot;.  PC's that reach one these portals are rewarded with the following:<br />
<br />
1.  An SOE account flag that gives the owner of the account an automatic 15% discount on EQOA (for reaching the Portal of the Past) or EQ2 (for reaching Portal of the Future).<br />
<br />
2.  The ability to transfer one droppable item to a character in EQOA or EQ2 by dropping it in the appropriate portal.  In order to obtain these items in either game, the character in that game must reach a comparable portal.<br />
<br />
3.  A t-shirt inscribed with the phrase &quot;Absor rulez j00&quot; in bright orange letters on the front and  &quot;l337 ph4t l3w7s r0x0rz&quot; in blood red letters on the back.  Sorry, only one t-shirt per account.<br />
<br />
4.  A booster pack from the upcoming tradebable card game &quot;EverQuest: the L3wt Meister's Revenge!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Isn't playing and paying with SOE fun?</div></div><hr />

<br />
A 15% lifetime discount on EQQA MONTHLY fees ... would get real interest.</div></div><hr />
