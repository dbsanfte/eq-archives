<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was just sitting here thinking what would be cool for a shaman.  <br />
<br />
Spiritual Essence<br />
Can be used 2 ways<br />
1st component of it is that it is a 5 minute solid duration invis and invis vs undead.<br />
the 2nd component would be that it drops you off agro list  (not rampage).<br />
<br />
A reuse time the same as Escape<br />
<br />
Oh well, back to work ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Interesting idea, Wildaar.  Would really be nice to use after debuffing a flurry drake, eh?<br />
<br />
I would like to see an AA that gives shamans more offensive power.  Fixing rabid bear so that it lasts longer would be nice.  I would even be interested in a longer lasting rabid bear that blocks a shaman from casting while using it.   By longer lasting, I'm thinking something on the range of until you zone :p.  No?  Ok, how about as long as form o' da great bear?<br />
<br />
If not a rabid bear fix, how about something along the lines of focus-type effects that speed up and increase the potency of DoTs.  You could even restrict it to one line (e.g., poison or disease).  Or even better, have separate AA's for each line.<br />
<br />
Heck, I'll trade Alchemy Mastery any day for that.<br />
<br />
My 2cpp's for what it's worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wildaar has too many AA's :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Good fix for rabid bear to make it worth it kinda but not overpowering really...make it lock spells as long as its in effect and make so you dont regen mana while Rabid bear is on, but then make it have like maybe 30 min reuse max and last 25 mins (most of the time would be clicked off to cast but at least this way its long enough to actually do dmg).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Spirit of Cheetah for druids and shamans. Same reuse time as regular spell, but in a box. I always have SoC memmed and it has saved me I dont know how many times, but I wish I could free up that spell slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bah, are you a shaman or a chicken? :p <br />
No retreat, no surrender! And one more free spell-slot :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">this is kinda neat from RP perspective as well.  Being able to transport yourself into the spirit world heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Because Sunstrike sure hurts when it is aimed at you. 1k damage? No thanks. SoC. <br />
<br />
Some of you should check out the red servers. It will at least make you paranoid, if nothing else.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There was an extensively detailed idea about shaman going into the spiritworld about a year ago by one of the Cruciblers. Think it was posted as a response to the tedium of medding and being a slave to the manabar.<br />
<br />
Basic idea was that you would enter the spiritworld and do miniquests to gather totems/symbols which acted as spell reagents when you casted. The shaman class would become manaless and use only these totems/symbols.<br />
<br />
Very cool idea but too different to ever see the light of day.<br />
<br />
<br />
Back on topic, I'm remaining an absolute cynical pessimist. I don't believe Verant will introduce anything radically new with PoP. The game gets by as is right now.  Players aren't quitting en-masse. No reason to change anything, just add more of the same under the slogan 'Bigger is better'.  Posh new surface and flashy effects to cover up the same old goblininfested engine.<br />
<br />
Sometimes it strikes me what a splendid game us players could design if we ever would agree on anything and had the resources to do so. Unlike the dear folks over in San Diego, we certainly have not run out of new ideas and imagination just yet.<br />
<br />
Or are they just saving all the powder for EQ2?</div></div><hr />
