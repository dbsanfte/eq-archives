<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vivala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all,<br />
<br />
Just a quick question,  last night my group was just about to win an adventure, and I went link dead.  I couldn't get back in til the next morning.  When I logged in, I got the &quot;You Failed Your Adventure&quot;.  However, a member in my group claims they won the adventure.  Something doesn't seem right here.  I can understand, not being in the group to get the win, but should I get a loss?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sinjuneq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Unfortunately, that is the way it is. If you start an adventure and cant finish for some reason, it's a failure. /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you arent online when the adventure is over (regardless of result), you lose. It's to avoid people trying to avoid a loss when people lose</div></div><hr />

Inocent presumption doesnt apply with SOE. <br />
<br />
Going LD means you are trying to avoid a loss, so SOE gives you what you are trying to avoid (a loss).<br />
<br />
They see every player as a cheater, so everything that happens is treated as a cheat attempt.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't go that far...<br />
<br />
There is no alternative for them... If, when you went LD, they made it so you got a &quot;no result&quot; - well, if the timer was about to run out, and the mission was not winnable, anybody who cared about their rankings would just /exit - so the rankings would be meaningless, as those who were bothered would all have 100% records.<br />
<br />
Getting a loss is absolutely no big deal. If it bothers you, then you are probably the type of player who would /q in order to avoid a loss. So... /shrug<br />
<br />
Yes, if it's a genuine LD, you can think yourself unlucky, but my first adventure was a loss as a result of the server crash, so... /shrug<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>vivala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I can understand the anti-cheat code,  that all makes sense.  But since the adventure was not lost,  I don't think I should have been given a loss.  Since i'm a software engineer, the way I would have coded it would be this:<br />
<br />
With every adventure, 1 of 2 things will happen:<br />
<br />
1.  An adventure is won.   So, everyone CURRENTLY in the group gets a win.  Those that went LD get nothing.<br />
<br />
2.  An adventure is a loss by the timer running out.  So, every member of the original group gets a loss, regardless of them being on line or not.<br />
<br />
Simple as that,  you can't cheat that logic.<br />
<br />
<br />
To me, this is simple, but christ, were dealing with egg heads.  They never have written user friendly code.  Everytime they do a patch, they can't even put up a screen saying what exactly is going on, we have to assume by reading some crazy error about login server being down.  Go figure.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Diashan Malkier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was playing 2 adventures at once, one on my shaman another on my rogue, connection dropped for a while, when i logged back on my shaman had failed, yet rogue had won. I am assuming it was one of those weird group bugs you sometimes get.<br />
Seems then you may get lucky sometimes :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>UbahShammy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">2 nights ago our Enchanter got pissed at another player in group for breaking mezzes and gated out of our LDoN dungeon adventure.  We went on to win it without him.  I'm real glad he took a loss and the rest of us took the win.  Nothing ****tier than a player getting pissy and leaving you high and dry in a Dungeon.<br />

Please post your server and char names so i can avoid you like the plague.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If the adventure is still active (IE within 30 minutes of win) and you log back in you will (or at least should) get credit for the win. Had a bard go LD as we were killing the very last mob once, but he did get credit when he logged back in about 5 minutes later. <br />
<br />
If you log back in after dungeon is closed you lose no matter what.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We were doing a hard miragul's mission today.  Bard went LD a few minutes in.  Then the wiz.  Wiz came back after 3 mins or so.  Bard came back after another 4 or 5 mins.  Then we all went LD at once.  10 mins later, we get back in.  If we had the extra time spent LDing, we would've been able to beat it, we were fairly close to the boss when we ran out.<br />
<br />
It was annoying to say the least.  More because of all the wasted time rather than getting a loss.  Who gives a crap about your record?   :D</div></div><hr />

Since it means nothing, save for status symbol, who cares? Warcraft 3 is the only place it matters, and even there marginally so.<br />
