I bought VP 3 last night but it was breaking about 15 seconds in.  Was using only epic, breath and blood of saryn on Doomfires in PoF...something wrong here or is 15 sec all we get out of VP3?<br />

It's diseased based too, try casting malicious decay and see if sticks any better. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>FloppyDisks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">VP is like all other roots.  It can break in 1 second or it can last about 2 minutes.  I have level 3 and I regret not having gotten it a year ago.  It really is that handy and certainly changes how LDoN normal adventures are played for me.<br />
<br />
Melee attacks will break VP VERY fast though.  Nukes break it semi often but DoTs do not appear to break it or if so, rarely.  But melee will make it break very quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">VP can last full duration, I find it often does. Some mobs you'll need to debuff first, and those Doomfires are like that. Stick a malicious decay in first, and you should be able to keep them rooted until dead.</div></div><hr />

Noticed this the other night as well, with regular root, I think it has to do with every melee and their mother augmenting all thier weapons with dd procs, when I started paying close attention, root always seemed to break with someones weapon proc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If a mob is dotted, say with 3 dots, and thats all, the mob will get 4 chances to break root each tick.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if you have melee beating on the mob, its probably getting something like 25 to 50 chances to break root every tick. And if they all have procs going off, add in some more chances.</div></div><hr />

WRONG. Roots get chance to break every tick and every time they get hit with DD. Dots or regular melee DO NOT give it a chance to break. The initial dmg on most of our lower level dots is a dd so gets a chance to break the root. The dmg every tick from the dot definitely does not get a chance to break root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Taraddar is correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I pull table mobs in fire with Mal Decay, and have NEVER EVER had a VP break before its time is up. I set my watch by it, in fact. However, other mobs in Fire do break it early, most notably the Magmas and Spiders from the Yellow Yard. I would love to be able to farm them for tradeskill drops, too, but the unpredicibility of VP on them makes it much more difficult.</div></div><hr />

Almost correct. :D The longer lasting (3 minute) roots only check on certain ticks with something like 10 checks over the 3 minute period. Not sure if VP also works that way though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">A mobs DR resistance is the biggest factor in it breaking. I dont know why someone said melee will break it, since level 1 thats the one thing that wont break root. Now if a melee has a proc on his weapon then yes, but that falls under the nuke category. DoTs seem to almost never break it. Pretty much like regular root, I suggest trying it on different mobs or debuffing it.. I solo in PoT and it generaly lasts very long and i only have vp2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Remember also that stuns are considered DD and give the mob a chance to break root.<br />
<br />
So if you have a mage with an air pet in the group, expect a quick break.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">VP is awesome, but as the others mentioned, use Malicious Decay first. Some mobs are going to be more resistant of course, so you may need a normal root up as well. For instance, I've never had it break early in the HoH entrance but the Diaku Sentries/Armsmen seem resistant to it. Not overly so, but resists do happen. It really shines in LDoN though. Almost guaranteed removal of one mob pulled when multiples are pulled. :)</div></div><hr />

Hmm I've never heard anything like this do you have any test showing this? Otherwise I would tend to doubt this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>trolebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I dont know, but when my non-alpha dog hits a rooted mob , it usually breaks sooner than when the mob is untouched.</div></div><hr />

I can't say I have ever seen our pets bust up root and Spirit Call definitely does not break root.  I regularly Dogburn on mobs just for the 1.5 seconds of entertainment the pooches provide before going splat. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Always debuff while rooting.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This prompted a question that I had about game mechanics.  I think I know the answer, but I figured that I would ask anyway.<br />
<br />
Is the resist check throughout a root based on the current resist stat or the resist stat at the time that the root landed?<br />
<br />
For example: (numbers made up)<br />
<br />
I cast VP on a large rat with a DR of 100.  Every tick the rat gets a resist check for a chance to break root against a DR of 100.<br />
<br />
Now lets say I cast Malicious Decay on the rat AFTER I have him rooted, lowering his DR by 52.  The rat now has an effective DR of 48.  For the rest of the period that the root lasts, does the rat check against a DR of 100 or 48?<br />
<br />
I suspect that the check is based on the current resist and not the starting resist (i.e 48 in my example), but I have no proof to back up that theory.  I am just hoping for some input and maybe some proof to prove or disprove my theory.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Tarelan</div></div><hr />

<br />
I saw a pretty detailed test a couple of months ago but no, it's not something I've tested myself. It was front loaded, more checks for root break during the first minute than the 2nd or third and that does match what I've seen in game.</div></div><hr />

Alpha dog will still bash....turn your pet messages on and watch it if you dont believe me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">soloing I pull with decay then disroot, if disroot lands it NEVER, I reapeat NEVER breaks on its own.<br />
any of our dots with nuke components can and usually do break it, if the mob is a necro or sk their Taps can and often do break it. I have solo'd 6ish lvls and 60ish aa's in tactics. (well most of it solo or duo with a druid whos on voice chat) and outside of nukes from me or taps from the mob I havent ever had a VP break early if the mob was decay'd first. without decay VP is about as strong as regular roots, i.e. it can break easily on its own through the usual checks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">It isn't the melee damage that causes roots to break so much, its that most melee characters have DD procs, which will cause the root to break just as if you nuked them with a spell.  Having melees with a proc effect (spell or weapon) or pets with those magician swords with proc will kill your roots pretty quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Many moons ago I did some tests on Root, with and without the mal* line (and once with CHA...don't ask) and found that most of the time if Root didn't break within the first 2 ticks, it lasted right through to the end (42 or 48 secs).<br />
<br />
Most often it ran right through, especially with mal* on, next highest was breaks within the first 2 ticks, and then there was the occasional break during any of the other ticks between.<br />
<br />
Never tested PE, but I can see there being something similar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This isnt true, I have seen a number of mobs that break the VP root early, after MD lands. Especially Magma Guardians in Fire. Kinda sucks too because they drop a nice Pottery item that sells really big by itself, or can be turned into an Incense Burner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Tarelan,<br />
I am pretty sure that the current &quot;root break&quot; check is against the current modified resist level. In other words, throwing Malxx or Malicious Decay on an already rooted mob is still a good thing.<br />
<br />
I use to solo dwarfs in pauldal caverns all the time, and they always spawned at the same level, same name. It was very noticeable with mal on or not. Even after they were rooted.</div></div><hr />

You are hurting your capabilities badly if you do not get VP3 at some point.<br />
<br />
I paid for VP3 early on in PoP and have never regretted it.</div></div><hr />

LOL VP is the 2nd best AA I have. Its invaluable in LDoN, awesome for soloing, and works great in tons of other situations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
48.  So if you don't want to take melee damage for a mob for whatever reason, sometimes I'll pull with root (or vp) and immediately debuff the appropriate resist afterwards so it will stick better.<br />
<br />
I'd have to agree with everything taraddar has said here.  My observances of root have been that once it lands, there is a chance to break every single tick, and also when a DD spell (or stun spell) hits the mob.  No crazy theories about facing north when rooting, or doing it between 2 and 5:00, or anything like that. =P  So melees with procs have a habit of quickly breaking root.  So do paladins getting agro.  I have never seen anything that indicates the longer roots have a better chance at sticking, they just have a longer max.  Open up lucy and look at 2 of them.  Here's Petrifying Earth (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3196&amp;source=Live), and here's regular old Root (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=230&amp;source=Live).  They show exactly the same stats, except the resist adjust (is that applied on each tick?  I would think so, which would also help to keep the root lasting longer).</div></div><hr />
