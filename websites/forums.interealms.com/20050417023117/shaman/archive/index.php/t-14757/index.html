<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">True, this should go into the hunting forums, but I'll take a stab at the question anyway.<br />
<br />
And as was listed in the appropriate forum, Sol A can be a great spot at 34.  Most goblins drop a steady plat or two each, and many also carry fine steel weapons.  You can also loot HQ ores here which can sell to a PC for 10 to 40 plat, depending on the need and laziness of the other PC.  <br />
<br />
I recently went there with my shaman to MQ a Staff of Temp Flux for my wizard.  In the 2 hours that I was there (killing every goblin I saw) I made close to 400 plat in coin and another 150 to 200 in FS.  The ore I used my self, but I walked out (albiet very slowly; I was about 200 stone overweight) with 21 blocks of varying quality.<br />
<br />
The only thing to be carefull of in this zone are the casters.  There are 2 types; Wizards and shaman. The wizards are pretty stupid and just nuke you with the occasional snare thrown in, but the shaman are the nasty ones.  Seems to be thier favorite tactic to dispell you a few times before they do anything else.  ( I had just picked up a kei from a guidie, and the first shaman I met there dispelled it.  I didnt care really, but it was annoying to be dispelled by a level 20 mob)<br />
<br />
If you want an outdoor zone Id recommend Stonebrunt mountains.  LOTS of mobs here, and about 80% are animals, so you can use some of those dusty spells in the back of the book like Invis V animal and charm animals.  Adds can be  a problem here; keep root up at all times to deal with them.  Any money here would be from selling pelts to tradeskillers.  Some will pay upwards of 20plat for a single HQ skin.<br />
<br />
You could aslo go to Iceclad and hunt cougars( sell the earrings for cash) or go to ToFS (Tower of Frozen Shadow) if ya can get a few mates together.  ToFS is still one of my favorite zones, and the money that you find there is very good. Its also a lot of fun to charge up and down the tower.  There are some drops here that you can sell for a couple hundred plat (still) and if yo can get to the 4th floor and the wedding party your money troubles are over for a few levels.  I camped the 4th for about a month straight when I was trying to get myself into better armor.  (this was when Velious was still the newest expansion and Iwas still in mostly Totemic, I was saving and scrimping for Rygorr (moderately expensive) and still trying for Jaundiced (still very expensive, the arms, which I ended up buying with the cash from here, ran me 1.3K in EC)<br />
<br />
Crystal caverns is also good cash/exp at this level.  Get a friend of two and run willy nilly all over the well area and collect cash and velium blocks to sell to PCs or NPC's if none want them.<br />
<br />
Thanks for letting me relive a few special times in these zones.  Hope the list helps some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At 34, go kill guards in hhk, including the fs sword they all drop they drop plat(average pp per kill:7, average exp per kill:2-3%) great exp and amazing plat for the level. <br />
<br />
At 38 or 39 head over to dulak. Grab a partner or group and kill near the zone in or anywhere there are scouts as they should be right for your level range. These guys drop weapons, not awesome cash for the level, but better than a lot of common spots. You can also work on your stoicism quest here which is an amazing spell. Spend about 10 or 15 levels in dulak and you should make a nice steady income. The boats should yield at least a few hundered pp per hour and you can start camping them around 44, great place to solo or duo. <br />
<br />
Early 50s you will be finding most of your groups in the planes. If you can find a necro, grab the nightstalker camp in PoN. You can duo fear kite this camp pretty easily. You will want to resist debuff these guys, then just buff and toss your dots and puppy in, they die pretty quick. They drop 3 variety of diamonds with decent regularity, also lower end words, and a few other things.<br />
<br />
After that just hit up planes hard until 65, then go farm various cash camps if you need pp, its much easier and you should have made enough in those mid levels to afford many of your spells, a mount, and some decent enough gear.</div></div><hr />
