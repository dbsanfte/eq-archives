<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Keldrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Repost from http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=59786 <br />
<br />
<br />
Cheaters and the recent up swell of concern (12-8-03)<br />
<br />
Over the last few days there has been a growing community concern about possible cheating, exploiting and platinum duplication.  Rumors and speculation have begun to run rampant, and I've received a lot of concerned email on the topic.<br />
<br />
First of all, I want to thank you for your concern.  The fact that you worry about this stuff as much as we do makes me feel good about the community that I work for.  I want to especially thank those that have sent in detailed information about what they thought might be dupe or exploit situations.  That information has been very helpful.<br />
<br />
With your help, we have been able to discover and eliminate some unusual ways of cheating.  Obviously I can't go into detail about exactly how this cheating was done.  I can tell you that several of our programmers and designers took lengthy breaks from working on their current tasks to define, investigate and smash those exploits.  Most of these methods for cheating have been removed.  The few that remain will be fixed shortly.  We will be watching, and anyone using them will be banned.<br />
<br />
At the same time, our Customer Service folks have been diligently tracking down the cheaters.  We have banned accounts and deleted characters in the hundreds.  It's never a good thing to be forced to remove so many accounts, and we're not happy that such cheating was possible.  We are pleased, however, to let you know that we are confident that we have located the majority of those that exploited the game and have removed their characters or accounts.<br />
<br />
Obviously we won't be able to prevent all of the possible ways to cheat.  The folks that insist on trying to cheat have proven to be persistent and clever (and here is where I wonder why they don't apply that energy and skill to something beneficial...).  We need your help to locate these issues.  The multitude of eyes and ears of our players is always the best source of information for us.  If you ever suspect that you have discovered something that seems like an exploit, please send that information to us through the Developer's Corner AND through /bug.  Please don't assume we have heard the information already.  We'd rather have ten reports about something like this than none.<br />
<br />
I'd also like to address a rumor about the nature of some of the cheating that people have been talking about.  There has been speculation in the community that in order to pull off some of the rumored exploits someone had to be working on the &quot;inside&quot;.<br />
<br />
We take such possibilities very seriously.  And we have investigated this very thoroughly.  We keep track of all special EverQuest commands issued.  We have looked into the possibility that someone working here had a hand in helping others cheat, and we have discovered no evidence that indicates that to be the case.  Also, the nature of the cheat did not require such inside help.  I can't describe the cheat method in any detail, but there was an experience cheat that allowed extremely fast leveling.  This required some rather sophisticated cheating, but was being done without inside help.  Obviously we have removed that exploit and banned any accounts that used it.<br />
<br />
Thank you for playing EverQuest.  And thank you for you help making the game fun.<br />
<br />
Have a great holiday season.<br />
<br />
<br />

Yeah it was just &quot;oversight&quot; that led to the 1:10 banker in Befallen.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not to be a VAK, but I have not seen any credible evidence that the Befallen Banker story was true.  Not saying it isn't, but I haven't seen any evidence.<br />
<br />
There has been a big tradeskill cheese tactic that allows people to make a lot of plat purely with vendor bought components and vendor sellbacks for a while now, and I presume that there are large groups of macroers exploiting this 24/7 for some time now, generating many millions of PP on every server.<br />
<br />
No idea what the xp exploit was though.</div></div><hr />

(Announces)The situation is under control, players.  There is no cause for concern.  The economy is stable and exp cheats were eliminated.  Offenders have been banned, this was not an inside job, and classes are pretty much balanced.  Please remember to pre-order Lords of Everquest and get in on the EQ2 Beta.  That is all.<br />

No mention of the vendor who was selling Coldain Velium Tempers for free, the sharks who were droping ungodly plat, or the mystery banker, etc.  Not even to say &quot;Yeah, it was a bug and we fixed it&quot;.<br />
<br />
All this talks about (imho) is the 'super-PLing' that was advertised by Yantis and co.<br />
<br />
I doubt they've done ANYTHING to address the massive inflation of the past cpl weeks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Enron, World Com, Mutual Funds, Accounting firms, Boeing, AOL Time Warner, etc etc etc... all have had huge disclosures recently of massive FRAUD. <br />
<br />
Do you seriously think that SONY is not on the scale of these firms? Do you think they would care for an instant what we want or think about this game if it got in the way of the Bottom line?<br />
<br />
Here is the bottom line. Account selling makes GOOD money ($13 a month takes over 3 years to make the $500 or so a single item! or character!  can sell for). Do you really believe someone at Sony hasn't realized this? Do you really believe someone at Sony hasn't rationalized this behavior?<br />
<br />
Please don't be naieve.<br />
<br />
They see the writing on the wall. They know EQ won't stand 3 to 5 more years of competition, so they are looking for faster ways to cash out before it goes bust.<br />
<br />
Good business move ($) but bad for players :( ... and which of these is more important to accountants and CEO's?<br />
<br />
At my company (One of the top 10 electronics companies in the world and a household name) we sacrifice customer satisfaction ALL the time for either a) more profit. b) more profit!!!<br />
<br />
So, I have a bit of experience in what they are doing here. This is not some kid in a basement trick here.</div></div><hr />

true. For the people that bash SoE on a regular basis, keep in mind that there are lenders and board executives that oversee things and that understand if the customer isn't taken care of and happy then they will have no business. Its suprising how much can get done with angry customers. Do keep in mind that changes require changes in code and in the databases. Sometimes these can be trivial, sometimes they can require hundreds of lines of fresh code. Its not really easy to pull hundreds of lines of code out of your ass on a regular basis, unless you are as big as microsoft.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">&quot;Its not really easy to pull hundreds of lines of code out of your ass on a regular basis, unless you are as big as microsoft.&quot;<br />
<br />
Or unless you can actually keep your programmers happy and working for your company. <br />
<br />
SoE has had HUGE turnover in the programming department, and has reshuffled most of the other programmers that were working on EQ. <br />
<br />
This doesn't exactly make for a great and consistent flow of knowledge. <br />
<br />
However, why would they do that when they have the best product on the market? <br />
<br />
Why pull in your second string or newbies to work on your flag ship project that is still paying your bills to this day?<br />
<br />
2 words... they are not ... customer satisfaction<br />
<br />
More profit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Now, before someone says &quot;But it is a big project and they need to do such and such&quot;<br />
<br />
Please tell me how this works? They have had YEARS to produce an extendable database system that dynamically can be updated, and the tools to make this easy.<br />
<br />
ANY game company is looking for serious trouble if they have not done this BEFORE putting a game on the market at all. So, we are saying that the tools they have been using for years, have been doing everything wrong?<br />
<br />
Your saying they don't have a test server? or they don't log the results of their changes? or that they have no Quality Assurance department? Or customer service department? <br />
<br />
Does any of these have to do with customer satisfaction? oh yeah. All of them do. <br />
<br />
But they are all obviously under funded to get more to the bottom line.<br />
<br />
I am not Sony bashing here. I am just pointing out the finer (actually there is nothing fine about it, it just goes against most of our ethical beliefs so we fail to want to see it and would rather believe somthing else.) points of a system of business that some of you haven't been exposed to, or have failed to see in SoE's business model.<br />
<br />
I will write a sudo-coded program with some loops later that will show EQ's business model. It should be easy to read.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeap ... Litgruv seems to be walking around in my head. I would rather see SOE make an attempt at doing the right thing than ignore our concerns completely. Whether or not they banned and deleted people by the hundreds is impossible to confirm, but it is not the point. The point is an attempt was made. The proof do be in the pudding, IMO, and we'll just have to keep our ears to the ground ... <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Moregar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I guess as a casual player these kinds of cheats are not noticable, since I do not do a lot of farming, PL'ing, or selling.  However, after reading all the comments here, and working for a large company as well, I have to say that there is no way of KNOWING what Sony's agenda is unless you are one of the executives.<br />
<br />
If in fact they are looking at EQ being a money-maker for years to come, then they are probably doing everything they can to keep it fun for the people playing it.  Cheats always ruin a game for everyone, as it introduces very undesirable effects into the game such as lack of uber items for sale, and high level people with no clue how to play their character - but just like spam, no matter how good you make your controls, someone will find a way around it eventually, and you are always playing catchup.  <br />
<br />
If they are not, then I would have to agree that they are putting Customer Service at a lower priority than profit, just to milk it for what it is worth - and then move on to EQ2.<br />
<br />
If any of you actually KNOW for a fact, and are not just griping to have some drama in your lives, please fill me in on the facts so I can sell my stock =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Detron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I wonder how you guys come up with so much comments as if you had the knowledge and experience of what is going on behind the scenes at SOE headquarters.<br />
<br />
With that said, there are no threats by SOE ever made. Breaking their rules is obviously going to lead you in banning anyway sooner or later. Its just a matter of time :)<br />
<br />
I am quite pissed off on people who take benefit of these bugs, exploits or whatever. For half year now I've been looking for a GRC spell among other items and never had the money to buy them at these high prices until finally SOE fixed the issue and I got my spell.<br />
<br />
I second what Tordail and Litgruv said. A company who's employees monthly payment is based upon the income from our monthly fees wouldn't lie to us. So whats the point to bitch around with hypothetical arguments of how, why, yada yada.</div></div><hr />

Honestly I think you are naive...<br />
<br />
EQ can live well for more than 3-5 years. As long as they support it, they will turn around a nice profit. Undermining your own game for short-term profit is just like peeing in your pants to keep warm! Keep the cow healthy and milk it for years to come.<br />
<br />
You can call Sony a bunch of things, but short-term is not one of them ;)<br />

I agree, they deserve what they got. Always those little guilds running around servers with disreputable leadership. They cause more harm than good. As far as I am concerned, it doesn't matter what someone may have done that is illegal, nor does it matter on what account, or how long ago, those people suck.<br />

I have a nice clue for you guys, every large guild shares accounts amoungst officers. Another clue, whether you know it or not, someone in your guild uses third party software to check things like spawns. <br />

I just have one question for the conspiracy theorists. Some here has suggested that SONY did this on purpose to squeeze more money out of EQ before it goes belly up. How in the world would pissing off a huge amount of the customer base because the server economies all went FUBAR'd be in Sony's interests?

<br />
I agree.  Complete Tin-foil hattage.<br />
<br />
The company (as a whole) wouldn't because the money involved is nothing compared to real subscribers and you cannot maintain a conspiracy that involves grunts.  The grunts will rat you out.<br />
<br />
As long as SoE can keep the proper proportion of maze to cheese, they will make money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">It just wouldn't, and you won't come up with a scenario that makes the slightest bit of sense to explain it, I'm sure.<br />
<br />
Too easy.<br />
<br />
Couple of premises:<br />
<br />
1) Sony is only interested in money.<br />
2) Removing items creates a pixelated gap which can be overcome via more play time. (See 1))<br />
<br />
Programmer(s) at Sony_EQ division comes up with an idea to generate some $$. Either for him or for Sony. The &quot;Befallen Banker&quot; is created. This is easy to do as: a) The Banker is not on the worldwide network. The Banker exists only to do one thing and that is convert gold to plat at a 1:10 ratio. <br />
<br />
Banker is not there 24/7. He pops up at a particular time then despawns. So your (player) chances of finding him are not good. Note that this &quot;addition&quot; to Befallen occurred after the change a couple of years ago.<br />
<br />
Person_at_Sony makes one of two mistakes. He either: a) tells a friend at Sony or in game, or b) he gets greedy. (That's how they got caught).<br />
<br />
Sony or individual came to this decision because: a) subscriptions are slowing down or b) there are too many items, or c) they did a cost analysis and determined that the money generated via plat sales &gt; loss of cash from P.O.'ed subscribers. (See 1))<br />
<br />
Side benefit of creating massive amount of platinum is they can clear the bizaare of tons of high end items that forces casual players to work (read play and pay) much longer to come up with the required amount of plat. <br />
<br />
It's win-win for Sony. They generate loads of short-term income, remove a slew of items now requiring the majority of their player base to play (pay) that much longer.<br />
<br />
It's about money. No more, no less.<br />
<br />

<br />
Um ... Apparently SOTA doesn't qualify as a large guild, per se, which is just fine with this Barbarian. However, a nice clue for you, Korbis. You do be flat wrong. I know every last member of our Council, and there is no account sharing save between the husband-wife couple. And rest assured, third-party software is unheard of in SOTA. When they want to check a spawn, my guildies get three or four people together and hoof it. Other times they just run it solo, but nothin' like sitting in the jungle with your buddies and a stack of ale.<br />
<br />
If it happened to my guild? Heh. In the ridiculously rare chance that it did ... accounts banned or not, I'd be cleaning things out with /guildremove right quick. If I wasn't a Council member and had no authority to remove people from a guild, it's as simple as /guildremove Tordail, and I'd be headed off to find some reputable, honorable people.<br />

Sure I use EQW now. Started using it a few weeks after they lifted the ban on 12/20/02. I had been tempted previously, but decided against it.<br />
<br />
Account sharing is probably even more common than EQW was before they realized &quot;hey everyone and their mom is using this, lets just make it legal.&quot;<br />
<br />
There are two kinds of account sharing that I am aware of.<br />
<br />
First, there are big time (no pun intended) raiders, who share accounts all the time to maximize their raids' efficiency. Second, there are people who let their RL and/or online friends share their accounts to make their day to day lives a little easier (rezes, buffs, porting, etc) or because they want to try each other's classes.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I have seen both types of accounts sharing end up in disaster :( And, of course, there are people (kids, usually) who share their account information because they fall for a scam.<br />
<br />
Account sharing is rampant. Packet sniffers are rampant. <br />
Sony suspending/banning people because they shared their info with someone who supposedly did something that at least half the population does is just incredibly stupid.<br />
<br />
I don't think that account sharing is that popular outside of the large raiding guilds. For example, we are a small guild/alliance of guilds that does some raiding on weekends and none of us share account information for raiding purposes, although I know a few people who exchange account information casually. Certainly none of us would consider packet sniffing anything but an open and shut case of exploiting the system.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have a very poor understanding of the eula. I suggest reading past the first 2 sentences.<br />
<br />
quoted from: http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/customer_service/cs_EULA.jsp<br />
<br />
9. You may not use any third party software to modify the Software to change Game play. You may not create, facilitate, host, link to or provide any other means through which the Game may be played by others, such as through server emulators. You may not take any action which imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure. You may not buy, sell or auction (or host or facilitate the ability to allow others to buy, sell or auction) any Game characters, items, coin or copyrighted material.<br />
<br />
First off, SoE makes no provisions for modifying your UI files. You can get banned for doing this. Second, they forbid making changes to game play, not the environment that ther application is called in. Yes SoE can ban you for any reason. Hacks and emulators change the play of the game, eqw affects the environment. Yes I agree that you have a point and that its questionable, but when contrasted to running a bot to check spawns its negligible. SoE knows well that section 9 of the eula is fuzzy. They left it that way on purpose. And furthermore, EQW isn't much different a change to the intended environment that EQ normally runs in than running EQ in Wine under Unix/Linux.<br />
<br />
I rest my case.</div></div><hr />

I know what you meant, Korbis. Scroll up a bit and read my post again ... I believe I said SOTA does not qualify as a large guild and that was perfectly fine with me ... Yeap. I'm a Prophet. Want to know something? Our guild now has two full groups of 65 characters, and 6 groups of 60+ characters. That may just be worth a snicker to some of you, but when I announced it in Guild Hall last night, my guildies were pretty damned proud. You've got to start somewhere, and if we need to start as &quot;a bunch of level 50 people that do Velious crap&quot; ... you know what? That's exactly where we'll start, and I'll be proud to take my Prophet butt to Velious and raid with our &quot;bunch of level 50 people&quot; any day of the week. And when they are successful with their &quot;Velious crap&quot; they will get a huge WOOT from me and we'll put together a raid and head to my favorite bar in Halas.<br />
<br />
Also, noone in your guild uses eqw?<br />
<br />
Hell no they don't. Not many people in my guild mess with me, truth be told. They know better than to use crap like that, cause they'd have my size 13 boot up their butt real quick. Not to mention the fact that my guildies are actually honorable people. Imagine.<br />

<br />
No my friend, I'm not in a *RAIDING* guild, thank you very much. I'm in a well-heck-we-need-some-practice-raiding guild. I'm in a guild where our members are considered my family members. I'm in a guild where we might traipse over to Kael and go slay some giants, where we're proud to take out Ixiblat Fer in 42 seconds, and where the idea of doing a POJ trial is enough to fill guild chat for hours on end with excitement. I'm in a guild whose members help one another and that takes the fun of the game as being more important than *RAIDING* and those nice, shiny items. I'm in a guild that has FUN, dammit. Oh hell we're not perfect, and we're not Elemental flagged, and we've not done things like Ssra or what-have-you ... but dammit ... who cares?

EQWindows lets you run Everquest in a window or, if your PC is powerful enough, run 2 copies of Everquest on the same PC. It's not a cheat or a hack, just a tool that makes multi-boxing a little easier. You can have the same functionality under WinXp and the regular EQ client, although it's not quite as seamlessly implemented. Heck, I have 4 PCs at home, but prefer to dual-box on one of them using EQWindows because I like Alt-tabbing better than using two keayboards and two monitors.<br />
<br />
You may be thinking of ShowEQ, a totally different program.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If our leader and officers were banned because of that person (I could swear someone mentioned that somewhere in this thread) ... wow. That'd be quite the blow to the guild. I have no idea if banning a guild leader means the guild is disbanded, I've never had any experience with that sort of thing. If such a thing happened to us, I have no doubt in my mind there are guildies who would step to the plate, elect a new leader and appoint a new Council and move on. They're just like that ... I kid you not. We wiped terribly and horribly on our first Vindi attempt, and the vast majority wanted to rez the raid and try again right then and there.<br />
<br />
If I were banned along with someone(s) in my guild doing something going against the EULA ... ohhhhhh OMG I'd be pissed. Pissed at who? Myself for not knowing that kind of thing was going on and dealing with it right then and there before any banning took place. I'm an officer, it's my responsibility to stay abreast of what's going on in my guild and deal with it accordingly. And if I missed something like that and it resulted in us losing family members and it hurting the guild ... wooh, you can bet I'd be irritated. The other Council members would be just as irritated they'd missed it, believe me.<br />
<br />
If I personally were banned because of someone having violated the EULA and doing things I didn't know about ... well read above ... but I didn't earn the nickname Rubbermaid Shaman for nothing.

Keep an eye on who is entering un-frequented zones such as Dragons Necropolis.  Watch oh lets say, a lvl 9 cleric log in then log out.  A couple hours later watch Guild X (who by the way may just have a bad rap for unknown reasons) go hit a raid target.<br />
<br />
Now, even though SOE would have no actual record of someone sniffin packets they could ban the lvl 9 clerics account along with those comeing from that IP address just for the hell of it.  Which btw, would end up lopping off most of the guild leadership of Guild X probably.<br />

There is no way to fix the economy, prices are stuck at those insane inflated rates. This is what counterfitting does to any economy, real world or simulated. There has never been a legitimate way of making high amounts of plat with in a reasonable amount of time. (Considering that your average player actually works, and can never sit online for more then a few hours a week.)<br />
<br />
Even if every single exploit is fixed, it will take a very long time for the economy to balance out to the actual rate of income that your average, honest player can generate. And I do not count the thieves who sit around scamming people in the market, as they are one of the many problems which ruins the economy and thereby the playing experience of the game (as they do in life).</div></div><hr />

Please don't post on what you don't understand. For someone that knows what they are doing it is trivial to rewrite a packet stream between client/server and do what you want with it. The majority are probably just script kids, aka someone with no knowledge of RL programming languages, just a mouse, google, MS Windows and a internet connection.

Keep an eye on who is entering un-frequented zones such as Dragons Necropolis.  Watch oh lets say, a lvl 9 cleric log in then log out.  A couple hours later watch Guild X (who by the way may just have a bad rap for unknown reasons) go hit a raid target.<br />
<br />
Now, even though SOE would have no actual record of someone sniffin packets they could ban the lvl 9 clerics account along with those comeing from that IP address just for the hell of it.  Which btw, would end up lopping off most of the guild leadership of Guild X probably.<br />
<br />
In that particular example, that would be quite legal.  Zlandicar is non KOS until you actually start killing rats, so you can just CoH a lowbie down there and it will be quite safe for him to log in.<br />
<br />
I'm sure that wasn't your point, but it was a particularly bad example.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your assertion that &quot;everyone is doing it&quot; is just patently absurd.  I've played this game since beta IV, and never once used either EQW, MacroQuest, ShowEQ, or any other 3rd-party product.  I STILL don't use EQW.  One of the reasons I enjoy EQ so much is that morons like Korbis are largely prevented from doing anything particularly malicious via hacks and cheats.  Any of you who played UO from the very beginning (as I did) remember what a joke that game became from all the griefers.  They basically ruined the game until there was no one left but an angry little group of 24-karat morons with no one but themselves to annoy.<br />
<br />
I recently read a post from Furor, the butthole-extraordinare from FOH who thinks he's God's gift to EQ and all things MMORPG.  He admits to being the same kind of griefing/pk'ing/hacking lame-ass, angry-at-the-world UO player.  Every post I hear about from that guy is bashing on EQ.  I thought he quit a long time ago - why the hell doesn't he just shut up already if he hates this game so much?  He must have absolutely nothing of value to contribute to the world.  I'm sure he and his entire posse of leet-doodz are down with all the latest cheats and hacks.  After all, &quot;everyone's doing it&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'm beginning to believe, in no small part based on the idiotic comments from some people in this post, most notably Korbis the Simple, that most of the &quot;elite&quot; &quot;top end&quot; &quot;end game&quot; &quot;uber-****-look-at-me&quot; children share these same characterics, and I'm quite happy to never associate with them.  I'd much rather stay in my little guild of under-achieving level 50s &quot;doing Velius crap&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Korbis, and all others who share your putrid views:  good riddance.  I hope they ban all of you who cheat and expect to get away with it.  In real life, there are consequences to your actions.  Maybe someday you'll grow up and realized that.<br />

Personally, I find any guild that's &quot;full of themselves&quot; and thinks their &quot;all that and a bag of chips&quot; needs a reality check... and needs to get knocked down off their pedestal. Unfortunately, I've seen a grand total of, like, 6 people on Maelin that are in Elemental or higher guilds and not full of themselves (though I haven't run into many as they tend to stay cooped up in the upper-tier Planes... and thank goodness for that)</div></div><hr />

To me this is what the game is about.  It's not how fast you can get something.  It's the fun in getting it.  I was an officer for 2 years in a guild where the average player was 60.  The raids we had, no matter how pathetic to the high end game players, were a thrill because we worked hard to get there. Our guild had started from a gimpy level 15 guild 2 years ago and made average raid level of 60.  Uber by any means?  Not at all.  Fun times? You bet your arse.  <br />
<br />
People who are using cheats to move ahead are missing the point IMO.  Maybe cheating is their thrill, but I say nothing beats the thrill of working hard and earning something for yourself.  Some of my best EQ memories come back from the days when you had a wipe in MistMoore or you finally fought Gorenair for the first time and won.  Hard earned accomplishment is what makes this game fun.  Shortcutting it just sucks the life out of the game and makes it far less enjoyable.  Forgive me this quote &quot;It's not the quantity of time, it's the quality of time&quot;  It may have taken me 2+ years to hit level 61, but I have enjoyed it and continue to enjoy grinding my way along.<br />
<br />
Scammers and dupers should not have a place in EQ and if they are getting banned for it then GOOD.<br />

I know a fair number of people who are in (or used to be in) high level (Time/Elemental at this point) raiding guilds. They are all over the place.<br />
<br />
Some are teenaged kids, but most aren't and at least one is in his 50s. Some are very immature and are, basically, &quot;griefers&quot;. Most, however, aren't. Some are VERY result oriented and extreme minimaxers in terms of choosing raid targets, upgrades, etc. Others are quite relaxed and enjoy the process as much as they enjoy the end result, they just play A LOT - as in many hundreds of days /played since March 1999, often on multiple accounts.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is that, at least on E'ci, there are a few &quot;family style raiding guilds&quot; that are currently Elemental and the description above, thankfully, doesn't apply to them.</div></div><hr />

Every guild has its bad members, but raiding guilds don't have more (maybe even less) than any other guild, proportionally.  I am in the top raiding guild on my server, and it is made up almost entirely of working adults and college students.  We tell dirty jokes in GC, but that is as far as the immaturity goes.  I've only been a member for a month, but so far the people have been nicer to me than I believed possible.  I fit in pretty well in my last guild, but in my new guild they really make me feel like I belong there, and I am loving every minute of it.  I enjoy killing end-game mobs for their nice shiny loot, but it is only enjoyable night after night because of the excellent company.

<br />
On my server, we have 4 or 5 &quot;raiding&quot; guilds who are very decent and honorable, filled with great people, and are ready at the drop of a hat to help &quot;baby&quot; guilds do epic hits or assist with REAL raids.  A request from just one can often net a baby guild about 20 65's with time on their hands, willing to help someone do something that they otherwise wouldn't have been able to do.<br />
<br />
Of course, then there's the rest of them...which fall under that definition.<br />
<br />
I think that's why those guilds are filled with those people.  I think they got tired of whiners, power maniacs, and guilds who engage in dirty tricks like cockblocking to keep mobs to themselves, so they gravitated towards guilds full of people much like themselves.<br />

Very cool Jinheim. That's exactly the point of this game, IMO ... fun, friends, fellowship. You're lucky to find that end-game. I've not had that many dealings with people in end-game raid guilds on my server (Karana), though the few I have had have been with polite (*gasp) people. Yep, this Barbarian will raise a mug of ale to what I quoted above from Jinheim.<br />
<br />
I'll agree with what you said at the end of your post about stereotyping, but I must point out that one bad apple can ruin the barrel, so-to-speak. There are those out there who represent their guilds badly, and sadly it is the bad actions that fly through server gossip. A guild can be marked very, very quickly. I believe it was Twain who once said that a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is still putting its shoes on.<br />

<br />
But its certainly true that a very great many raiding guilds do have this problem.  A friend of mine who is a guild raider was complaining to me only the other night about an example.  Some stupid little kids from my friend's guild messed up another guilds raid in SSRa by killing a mob they needed, and for no apparent reason.<br />
<br />
My friend was seething at it: its like being stuck back in the school playground, something that a lot of us haven't had to contend with for a great many years.<br />
<br />
But he also explained that without these same stupid little kids his guild would be finished.  SOE's failure to design a massively multiplayer environment for what is supposed to be a massively multiplayer game means that his guild has to race with other guilds to kill mobs on patch day.  And stupid little kids can start earlier than most working adults, so the guild that doesn't have them in significant numbers doesn't get the mobs.</div></div><hr />

Not knowing all the particulars, your friend's guilds reputation may be finished anyway.  If he is the leader of a good, quality guild, then he WILL attract likeminded folks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed.<br />
<br />
If he is the leader of a good, quality guild, then he WILL attract likeminded folks.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the number of mature adults who want to raid, who can devote enough time to raiding, and who can log on early enough to participate in races for key spawns, seems to be quite limited.  Admittedly there would be more if they knew that they wouldn't have to contend with playground antics: but even if you clear your guild of the kiddies you still have to put up with the antics of those in rival guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>KeiriV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">My guild disbanded in September due to a high number of our key classes wanting to move on to the bigger and better.  So we decided to end the guild on a high note, finished a shaman epic, and saluted all our members and let them move on with no hard feelings to guilds that held more opportunities for the high end game.  Naturally we all still keep tabs on each other because lets face it 2 years of guilding together you make some great friends.  Well my hubby and a bunch of fellow guildies went off to join the high end raiding guilds and it is just amazing to see the battles that these guilds have over mobs and on patch days especially.  I mean it gets down right brutal and viscious to the point where people from an opposing guild are actually trying to leap frog or in some cases actually trained the other guild to attempt to steal a mob.  I really hate that aspect of the high end game.  I mean some competition does make the game fun, but I think those kinds of antics are what ruin the game for me at least.  A lot of it has to do with maturity and I have met some pretty immature adults in this game besides your typical teenage stupidity.  Every guild is going to have their idiot(s).  About the only thing I can see that may help with this high end mob fights is having:<br />
<br />
1. More desirable mobs 60+<br />
<br />
2. LDoN type Zones for these High End mobs<br />
<br />
3. Code of ethics between these high end guilds that no one engage a trigger unless a certain number of guild members are available to successfully start the hit.  (i.e. 30+members when engaging).  <br />
<br />
I myself have never done any high end raids so I cannot truly sympathise with these issues and my viewpoint is solely coming from an outsider perspective.</div></div><hr />

While this is not neccassarily true I do think that most &quot;stupid kids&quot; &quot;immature adults&quot; and whatever else you wish to call them do gravitate towards the raid guilds.<br />
I think it is a &quot;shiny thing&quot; syndrome where they can brag about all their uber loot and the mobs theyve killed.<br />
<br />
Raiding does not interest me too much of a timesink etc.<br />
Know quite a few people in raid guilds and theyre some of the nicest most helpful people in game and they also seem very adult.<br />
<br />
Think it may be the fact that when you do come across an asshat if you see he/she belongs to a big guild it tends to stick in your mind rather than if he/she belonged to a normal everyday guild.<br />
