<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lemiak Purdyun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Do we still get mana using the Boon of Recovery effect I was under the impression using a rune type spell doesnt give us mana is that true?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, using rune + canni gives mana.  It always has.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah you'd still get mana from the cann but i never really saw a point in it if you have torpor. You can get mana faster by just straight out canning and then torporing rather than alternating clicking cann and the boon of recovery item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Oaklanbash_Vaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We got 2 of the orbs last time we killed Shei, the effect is a joke.  It doesn't stack with Protection of the Glades or Blessed Armor of the Risen.  It is only a 150hp rune and takes a full 6 seconds to cast.  Needless to say I will just stick with Attuned Spire Shard instead of trying to get one of these.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Spellshield also detracts the dmg from our canni.  I found that out when we were prepping for Gore and a wiz cast spellshield on me.  Well I was just about to do a canni5, and when I did, I took only about 1200 dmg instead of 1900.  Then I noticed the spellshield buff was gone.   Interesting.  Fairly expensive dmg mitigation tho. <br />
<br />
Still I wonder how it would work with a wizard chain casting that on the MA?  Nah, wizards have better things to do, like Dragon Bane and sheet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I like it, but you have to know how to use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lemiak Purdyun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ah oki :(<br />
<br />
trying to decide on a new range item now, im down to CT Brain, shard from burrower, grieg shard or the IV one ah decisions decisions :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Darkwind-ciw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">/rude oaklanbash</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Range item? I want that thing with DL port, I can't imagine anything cooler.<br />
<br />
I always like things that give us &quot;extra&quot; abilities, like unvis to undead potions or snare spear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>WulfTyger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Despite having an effect of questionable value, the range item from Shei is still very good.<br />
<br />
With 1 exception (the lack of ac), it has just about everything we look for. Wis, mana, sta, hp, and resists.... and plenty of each.<br />
<br />
With more and more shamen (high level, often in high end guilds) placing less and less emphasis on maxing ac and going more for hp/sta, this item becomes quite attractive.<br />
<br />
Not that the Spire Shard is all that shabby either ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Oaklanbash_Vaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hehe Darkwind,<br />
Think you need to log on now, ssra key camp take hour 12....</div></div><hr />
