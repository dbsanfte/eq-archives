<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok i havent drag through the whole post to see if someone came up with this already so if they have i sorry.<br />
<br />
but want i was thinking is the rabid bear aa summons a new shaman pet, a spirit rabid bear! this much improve pet over true spirit i think would be nice to be based on the beserker class.. it seems to fit and would be unique:)<br />
<br />
so our pet would be a summon beserker with bersker skills to its level which i would put at level 59 or so (true spirit 58) i dont know how they work out pets but this pet should be able to hit named in elementals. so it would have the speical throwing skills and stuff.<br />
<br />
bear shape already on world file just make it like our dog , translucient.<br />
<br />
obviously would need tweeking but what yer think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't like it.<br />
Rather see rabid bear do this:<br />
<br />
+Bash skill (250)<br />
+1h blunt skill (50)<br />
+2h blunt skill (50)<br />
+piercing skill (50)<br />
+double attack (250)<br />
+Haste 100%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">why? so you can mellee that named whitha 3k riposte? though i would like slightly better mellee skills for easy ldon, i wouldnt want to be melleeing in elemental planes. therefore instead of give us better mellee so we can do that extra  few dps and kill oursleves , give it to our pet would be much better i think. rabid bear already does something similar to what you suggest (ie increase attack and 99% haste) and it useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Given up on the concept of creative ideas being adopted by SoE. And call me weird but I would prefer we got rabid bear and not be used on the pet which not even the pure pet classes have anything like. <br />
<br />
Rabid Bear is an exciting concept as so many people are curious by it and ask about it, but in reality it pulls of badly. Due to stuff like the miss rate, like the reuse time, like the proc and its sheer uselessness in so many situations.<br />
Rabid Bear could be used as a game mechanic in theory, imagine a proccer like clerics get, and then imagine being able to summon a rabid bear friendly weapon with a &quot;useful&quot; proc, perhaps a spell we commonly use. Clerics get a proccer from Time which enables them to heal the group frequently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Meleeing is sometimes the only way of doing dps on mobs. And you won't be eating any ripostes unless you're up in &quot;teh face&quot; with the mob.<br />
<br />
What Juujuu said, but make rabid bear either stick us on bst dmg table OR allow the haste from rabid bear to exceed the haste cap. Cause right now that rabid bear haste is pretty useless with a decent haste item and a normal haste buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">oh well just a thought:)<br />
<br />
i must admit i liked the idea of being albe to suddenly do a large amount of damage from mellee, but as said the way it is done just doesnt work.<br />
and you cant mellee and cast spells at the same time, which also makes this not so handy..it be a run outta mana thing. which limits use i think.<br />
which why i thought that to increase our pets might be better. but obvoiusly not perfect.<br />
<br />
the only other thing i seen was to make it proc on our pet and our pet becomes insane damage for 60 sec but reuse is like spiritcall, but i imagine that would have the same draw back for you.  mind could make a seperate one called rabid wolf:) actually now a think of it that could a  all in one pet buff  new spell:) or perhaps aa be better .. oh a so confused:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Due to stuff like the miss rate <br />
<br />
i would like to take the time to say our miss rate is horrid because of our skill levels <br />
<br />
<br />
as we all know we are &quot;preists&quot; since our skills cap at 200 while pure melee, knights, and hybirds cap at 250 correct ?    and doubble attack means more swings / more misses.  skill caps deermine hit miss max hit and proc rate i belive<br />
<br />
*Edit*<br />
<br />
i like the skill cap uppage idead for rabid bear but add the 200 atk :P  cause i dont like stacking fa with another spell :)  if it stacked great ~ and lower the reuse to make it worthwhile hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Rabid Bear - I don't like it, won't buy it.<br />
<br />
But it is aimed at shaman melee, not more generally at shaman dps.<br />
<br />
good idea, but Rabid Bear is not the slot for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You want a creative idea for Rabid bear? Here is one:<br />
<br />
- Duration extended to 2:20 hours. Recast shortened to 15 minutes.<br />
- remove the haste, the proc, the stats, etc<br />
- slap on +20 to all resist, +250HP (not stackable with rangers/BST/pally hpbuffs),<br />
- add 2 focus effects: +20% DOT damage stacking with bard song and item focus, -50% aggro generation from spells.<br />
<br />
And make hastened hastened rabidity lower the recast time by 4 minute a level as well as increase  the buffs by 10% (22/24/26 resist and DOT damage +%, 275/300/325HP and -55%/-60%/-65% aggro generation.<br />
<br />
Make the freaking AA something useful instead of a &quot;lookit! Not only I can heal and do spell damage like a lower level hybrid, I can also melee like one&quot; AA point blow-out.<br />
<br />
Oh.. and update the freaking skin. I'm tired to look like a reject from the pre-Kunark era everytime I bearform. They already had a better skin than that for bears when they introduced the concept with Velious, for crying out loud. One on which they could have put hard-points for both weapon and shields and that, one expansion later, could have been able to use a horse same as the necro and SK skel-illusions... another ****ing missed opportunity because they couldn't sit a developper down 5 minutes to think through the shaman spells for that expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Drachen183</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I really like the idea to have it give skills... that would definitely improve the aa. I dotn want to melee like a god all the time, i just want a fun toy, which RB is sposed to be, but i wont buy it till it is AT LEAST a fun toy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Nice imagination, but the point of RB is to upgrade OUR melee skills. Its a melee AA.<br />
<br />
On that basis, i dont like your idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Nice imagination, but the point of RB is to upgrade OUR melee skills. Its a melee AA.<br />
<br />

<br />
Have an open mind for a minute.  Right now it is intended to upgrade our melee.  But as we have learned, what do you get when you polish a piece of crap?<br />
<br />
Just because right now its meant to upgrade our melee, doesn't mean that it wouldn't be useful to summon a buffer pet instead.<br />
<br />
The idea is kinda good, you can put your old pet away with suspend, call out the bear for 5 min or whatever, then have your pet come back out.  I think this idea improves rabid bear 10fold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">now i thinking direwolves, a seperate direwolf spell or aa with a dire speical attack:)(could be alsorts) due to spirit call u/g:) <br />
rabid bear should be something esle. more a shaman buff  with some mellee enhancement (double attack maybe) but i would perfer more hp,ac and defensive. and last a long time.</div></div><hr />
