<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Maelin.Dakor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok, im currently lvl 24 and cant think of a good surname, any help is good help... i think, im just interested in what you all can think of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shamphibian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ated?<br />
Ismeltin?<br />
Ator?<br />
Isrotten?<br />
<br />
ok enough funnies.  A surname in my opinion tells something of yourself. I myself am a lil bit of a joker. <br />
<br />
My surname is Batrachophobe. It means one who fears amphibians. The punchline if there is one is I am a froggy shammy. Frammy?? Heh. <br />
<br />
I see so many that take off a movie char, place, time, title, etc. I prefer some originality myself. <br />
<br />
So, what's your fave mob to kill?<br />
What tradeskills you do?<br />
Where you like to hunt or hate to hunt most?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Mine's O'Flanishanihanigan because I wanted something ridiculously long, and to go with the &quot;kilt&quot; theme of barbarians.  Just figure out what general themes you want, then ponder it every once in a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I fizzled a lot with my druid at those levels (druid being my first real main 1 year or so ago) so i called him fizzlecast, this guy was the same with nukes (grouped a those level in HHK) so i called him fizslecast :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tailz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Isn't &quot;Dacourt&quot; a French football player? Just wondered...saw a Thierry Henry on my server so maybe it's spreading ;)<br />

Dakor Rappor<br />
Dakor Radok<br />
Dakor Rakod<br />
Dakor Kador<br />
<br />
...last three with the first name anagram'd :)<br />
<br />
Short on inspiration at the moment ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Who says you need a surname?<br />
<br />
I'm level 51 and still haven't bothered.  Then again what goes with Cattywumpus? :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Level 65 and I haven't bothered either....  If I <br />
DID go with one, it'd be DaBear though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What race are you? That matters a lot in a good surname<br />
<br />
I picked my surname cause I thought Shamans were cool for summoning animal pets (at the time... they were the ONLY ones who could)  so I choose the name Beastmaster.<br />
<br />
Now everyone used to think I was a beastlord, (until I got epic) so I'd get a lot of &quot;What shield is that?&quot; &quot;I didn't know beastlords could use shields&quot; &quot;Shouldn't you be dual wielding instead of using a shield&quot;<br />
<br />
But when beastlords FIRST came out... I got a lot of &quot;Woah Porgy, they made a class based on YOU!&quot; &quot;You are the master of the beastlords porgy!&quot;<br />
<br />
I always thought verant shouda let me become an honerary beastlord (my two mains were a monk and a shaman :-D) But now... Shaman are cooler.<br />
<br />
Though.. my monks surname, was much easier, I use to freak my friends out in low levels cause I would spam feign death to work on skill, and they use to laugh at my  Urgghhgh.  So I went with the creative surname &quot;Somaa Dirtnapper&quot; I remember the day, cause it was a big deal when I dinged 20, in unrest :-)<br />
<br />
I always plan my characters surnames ahead of time.  though its never what it ends up being.  Originally, Porgy was gonna be  Porgy N'Bess and Somaa was gonna be Somaa Fortis (soma means honor and bravery in a dialect of hindi, Fortis means strength in latin)  But they always change as my character get's a life of his/her own.<br />
<br />
Porgy Beastmaster</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Redspeed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Dakor Dude</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Letari Lemew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah, race helps in picking a surname :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think that being a Troll, my surname fits perfectly with my first name..<br />
<br />
but for you Dakor, maybe a surname of Tasteslikechicken???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">last names are overrated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah, still haven't decided on a surname for myself either.  Was thinking hard about something to do with Spiritcaller or Spiritweaver for a while, but I just kinda lost interest in it for a while though<br />
<br />
Did manage to create a beastlord and had a name that I liked:  Ticking Timebomb<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Turley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My rogue's name is Sewage Mouth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sinjuneq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I had one....deleted it at lvl 59 or 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Purtyoogly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">/shownames off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tailz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well I went with Prower (based half on me being a cat, and half related with a certain character of the Sonic world..though he was a fox ;p)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Dakor, hmmm....<br />
<br />
Kor is a froglok in sebilis (and guk I believe, been a while), and you are a frog, so... Frenchie?  :p<br />
<br />
ok being a little more serious, how about Gukkin, Gukite, Sebilite, or something tying you to those zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">well i pondered a surename for god 15 lvls my first name Windfinder was realy a last name/title in the books i was reading so did not go to well with trying to make it a first name and addign a last name. so when i finaly got down to it my last name was Spiritweaver couse it sort of went along the lines of a shamanistic type name and such ....... THEN veliouse was relisead 2 month later and low and behold i had a WHOLE suit of armor i apparently left just laying around in PoG, I have finaly managed to colect teh whole thing and some times i just run around in MY armor so that i can say i have finaly got it back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Mine used to be Outofmanamaam. Was given to me by a good friend because I was always complaining about no mana. It was cute at lvl 20, but as I got higher lvl, I decided to delete it. I many times have thought about a new one but kinda like having it short.<br />
<br />
I totally agree that it should be something you like and has to do with your character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Trix N'Treats</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">:D Tradeskilling is another good way to pick a a last name  :p <br />
For instance, my kitty shaman is a baker so thanks to the help of a really sweet GM I was able to name her Trix N'Treats! :D<br />
<br />
But if your just looking for &quot;anything goes&quot; last names :) then some cute ones out there are:<br />
<br />
Wolfcaller, Truthseeker (this one kind of ties in with the epic), Fateschylde, Spiritcaller, and another cute one is Spiritstrike.  :) <br />
<br />
Personally, I like to look at what the class does when making up a lastname or even the race and how it is judged. :)  <br />
<br />
The other day I saw the cutest name though Gneme Anklebiter.  Couldnt help but laugh :) stuff like that is what makes the game fun to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Who says you need a surname?<br />
<br />
I'm level 51 and still haven't bothered.  Then again what goes with Cattywumpus? :confused:<br />
<br />
rumpus.<br />
<br />
<br />
heh, I like my surname, it fits the character, and my brand :)<br />
<br />
I have no idea what to do about my warrior, I don't even remember what gave me the idea for the name, and I created less than a month ago...<br />
<br />
I've been thinking gromor, but I am lost. until then, I stay without surname.</div></div><hr />
