<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chewy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok.  Yesterday, I hit the EQ icon, download the patch.  Get in, click connect.  Type in my info and get slapped with the username/pass is wrong error.  Ok.  Check caps lock, good, type it in again.  Nothing.  I type in all my old passwords.  Nothing.  Check to make sure I'm spelling it right, and nothing.<br />
<br />
Ok, my password has randomly changed before, so I go to the station site and to password recovery.  Enter in the username and I get a password recovery screen.  This time, it's different then any other time I've recovered my password.  Rather then ask me for my zip code like usual, it asks me a secret question: &quot;Where were you born?&quot;.  Uhhhh... Ok.<br />
<br />
So I enter all kinds of different things into that slot (the rest of my info in as well) and I don't get anything.  I'm starting to get a little pissed off by this point.  So I go to username recovery.  I put in my email and sends me back some username I haven't used in AGES.  It was a backup I made, just in case.  I've emailed sony, and am going to call them Monday if I don't get a response.<br />
<br />
And no, I've never lent out my password to anyone.  I've never given anyone my info.  I'd post on the EQ Tech forums, but my alternate account is not subscribed to EQ.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any idea what I could do to fix this on my own, or at least, why it happened?  The password changes happeneing monthly was annoying enough, but this is just damn stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First thing you need to do is disconnect your computer from the internet. Now run an antivirus scan(using an up to date signature) on your computer. Odds are you have a keystroke logger installed on your system. <br />
<br />
It sounds like someone ganked your login and password and used it to change your secret question. You should eventually be able to recover the account and hopefully with all or most of your gear.<br />
<br />
Edit: One thing I forgot to add. Whether or not you find anything I would change any passwords for any accounts/games/etc. that you have used on that computer.<br />
<br />
Good luck and remember to keep your antivirus signatures up to date and run a scan periodically. Passwords just don't change on their own. :)</div></div><hr />
