Plenty of people have fruitful lives in the &quot;real world&quot; and still have time for everquest...just because you couldnt manage to accommodate both doesnt mean others cant. <br />
<br />
Regardless, have fun doing whatever brings enjoyment to your life.</div></div><hr />

Easy - don't buy the expansion. Pretty simple.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It never amazes me the number of people that make comments like this.  People act as if anyone that saves up 30aa for an ability obviously have no real life.  In the case of the above quote, why would you have to save the AA over the course of a week?  It's not like your saved AA bank resets to 0 every Sunday morning at 12:01am.  It is entirely possible to take a month or more to save those 30aa and then spend them on an ability that further allows you to enjoy the GAME that you are playing.<br />
<br />
Our world is too dead set on instant gratification.  We want everything NOW.  Personally, I play the game about 10 hours a week, and spend most of my time (when not working 10-12 hour days), out enjoying life with my friends.  That doesn't mean I won't ever get these 30aa abilities, it just means I won't be getting them within a week of the expansion going live.  They'll still come in handy some time next year when I get around to &quot;purchasing&quot; them.<br />

Lotsa people can keep eq balanced with real life.</div></div><hr />

I agree, it is.  I've played this game since day 1, and have always been damn good at what i do.  When your accomplishments are cheapened they mean far less to you.  Though this cheapening can occur through other methods than easing of the game.  I thought long and hard what eq was about.  Was it about being the best, satisfying my will to compete, was it about gathering items so that i could impress others? Maybe it was about my friends in the guilds and helping each other out.  It must of taken a huge stretch of the mind but i realized I have friends in real life.  I have friends and family and i have more important things to do.  Maybe its because i love my job so much now, that i'd do it for half what they pay me already, maybe its that i realized I hadn't visited my dad in almost a year, or helped at all with his volunteering.  Yes i can do the minimum with them so i have time to be on eq.  Most people call this neglect.  I wont let this game hold me back from myself anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I limit my playtime to:<br />
<br />
1) Mon and Wed, 8:00 to midnight.<br />
2) Whenever I can log in for a quick LDoN or two while working from home.<br />
3) Any time my wife is working or otherwise engaged in doing something I don't care to participate in.<br />
<br />
Down from (probably) 50+ hours a week this time last year, to about 20 hours a week now. Still gainfully employed and very active in spiritual work, yard work, house work, Freemasonry, and miscellaneous hobbies. And I still read to my wife every Sunday afternoon.<br />
<br />
You just have to put it in perspective and find a good fit. My personal balance will keep me out of Elemental, Time and (whatever the top end of GoD is) guilds. So be it. I'm not even close to being totally geared up with the best I can get from the places I can go and the mobs my guild (with no manditory raiding policy) can drop. Hell, I was 65 for over a year before I got my Vindi BP. And I had a 40 HP aug on it 15 minutes after I looted it. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Again i say dont stick the blame tag on the game. Stick it on yourself. What you can/cant or could or couldnt do while playing eq doesnt mean its the same for everyone. If i am playing to much eq i dont need to quit to fix that. I just need to own up to it and moderate it simple as that. People find plenty of ways to be lazy and not do the things they need to do or be a better person. For you quitting eq pushed you where you needed to go and thats great. But why are you posting on an eq board if you are done with it and sterotyping all people to be behaving like you did while playing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What bothers me is how people are constantly saying things like &quot;This should be free, I shouldnt have to buy an expansion&quot;. That arguement is quickly losing any credibility with me. Modifications and adjustments are a part of any world that is constantly evolving. Yeah, Shaman got trivialized, now they are &quot;fixing&quot; it. So what? Not buying an expansion for these kinds of reasons are just excuses to complain more about the game. <br />
<br />
Sorry if you dont want to be lvl 70, or get some of the cool AA or see new places, and even &quot;old&quot; places if you havent spent a lot of time in Gates yet (because you will once you hit 70, trust me. Its worth it). But if your going to sit there and whine because &quot;you have to buy an expansion to become more balanced&quot; then its time to move on. Balance issues are honestly about 3rd or 4th on the list, after Content, Loot, Progression (levels, non-balancing aa), etc. Heres a clue though. NOT buying this expansion is going to leave you in the dust.<br />

<br />
Each person's priorities are different. To me, any sort of loot is dead last. I don't care where I am, or even if there's any experience or loot involved, if I'm having fun and contributing something worthwhile, everything else is insignificant.  I'm sorry to hear that loot takes priorities over having a good time or hanging out with friends.<br />
<br />
As for having to buy the expansion to get any &quot;fixes&quot;, I, really, have no problem with that. It's additionally having to grind out AA to get those fixes. Not that I'm saying they should be handed out and included, but at least make them in the way of obtainable (to the general public) spells.<br />
<br />
While I didn't necessarily like the PoP way of distributing spells, it was better than LDoN's and hugely better than Gates'. Would I rather see the Kunark distribution? You bet! (Some vendored, some dropped, some quested off the dropped, but the stupidly rare, even now, would need to be eliminated).<br />
<br />
Now, as for the AA fixes, suppose it depends on the cost of these AA. If they're ridiculous like the Gates AAs, that's just dumb. If they're reasonable like the PoP ones, then it's not so bad either, but would rather see it done without AA, period.  Even though a shaman rez is great and all... but isn't the shaman usually the corpse?</div></div><hr />
