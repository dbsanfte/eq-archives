<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Busstah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey there, I just started going on a SK/Shaman duo dual box team and was wondering about what kind of equipment to shoot for for the Shammie, as well as the best mana regen tactic.<br />
<br />
First, equipment.  Basically, I out fitted him with more +wis stuff than a normal Shaman would cause I figure I won't be Canni-dancing (more on that later).  Is this the best approach do you think?<br />
<br />
Mana:  Since I have to use the SK to tank and pull, etc, not to mention casting during battle with him, I have no time to Canni-dance the Shaman.  What I've been doing is when I get full on hp, I chain cast Canni until I'm down to 2 bubs of health, then sit and regen it all back.  This may not be the most efficient way of doing things, but it is what I have to do.  Now, that being said, is it still better to go with 6ac/65hp rings instead of, say, +7wis rings?  Also, should I go for an Ikky Regen Bp and a Horse, or would I be better off with something else?  Should I use Forest Loops or +hp earrings?<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what the best tactics to use are.  I realize that later in life my Shaman will get hit some (slow aggro, etc.) and that I need to get defense maxed, and I will work on that, but I just think ac isn't that important, and I'm questioning whether hp is, and whether I should just go with +wis stuff.<br />
<br />
I know there have been tons of posts on the wis vs. hp debate, but I can't find a thread that goes at it from the point of view of what is essentially a bot on a 2nd box.  Any tips you can give would be appreciated, thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bubub the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have been weighing th esame problems with my shammy as ok late, but I straght solo more than anything so I have been getting some HP gear 1300 unbuffed! hehe, If I were you I wouldnt go one way, if you can get a Red Dragonscal BP that's +20wis right there (10k thoguh), I would split rings, 1 VFR and vellum Jasper I think is the +7ws, if you can hunt floops go for it, I havnt found anything else atm that I want to go hunt for.  ANd if your bank alows for it grab that little pony and regin bp.  Also if your not doing it already....I think it's a  34 spell :) Go bearform adds abother +5hp per tick.  Plus regin spell and troll regin you get those hp back perty fast. I hope this helps ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Candi dancing isnt that hard 2 boxxing ... just map your sit key to the minus key and your cani hotkey on the 0 position.  You can also make your cani hotkey make you sit after a pause but with fizzles and needing to change your mind i stopped using pause in all of my hotkeys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Maivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Umm Bearform adds +1hp/tick and +5 wis lvl 29 spell<br />
<br />
Greater Bearform adds +2hp/tick and +10 wis lvl 55 spell<br />
<br />
still good but definatly not +5hp/tick,wish it was tho =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Busstah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the suggestions all!  I might try canni-dancing as you suggest.  I suppose just nuking my hp down all in a row by chain canni'ing isn't too bad, though, just inefficient compared to dancing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">well, I have a 2 box war/shammy currently 52/51. I started these guys together at level 1, and they have been heavily twinked since. My gear for the shammy is standard ac/hp with horse/fungi/jbb. Obviously plat can play a roll in what you can get, but a horse and ikky bp aren't very expensive. <br />
<br />
Currently I rarely Can at all as all I have to do fighting seafurbies is keep hos/bin'li and haste up for the war and haste on dogdog. Then I slow and jbb, dont need to heal or even cast regen as the seafurbies are such pansies. <br />
<br />
This said, I caned a lot earlier and I will begin to more as jbb damage gets outclassed with dots and I need to regen mana faster. The horse is by far the best piece of gear for your shammy as it takes away sit agro and the need to sit unless swapping spells. This makes your 2 boxing much easier.<br />
<br />
When I fight, I am not worried about adds because I know that the shammy can tank until the warrior gets around to taunting the mobs off. I can easily deal with 3 blue con mobs due to the fact that the shammy can tank when need be, and the war can tank 2 or 3 slowed mobs no problem. Knowing that she has the hp to tank a mob lets me explore places where I know that I cant get singles. Getting singles will be easier for you, as you can fd split when need be, but you wont always have to, and roamer adds need to be dealt with some how, shammy tanking is often the best way.<br />
<br />
To sum up, go for the standard hp/ac route and get your defense up. Definately buy a horse and ikky bp, and really work towards getting a jbb if money is tight. Warrior/sk dps isn't super high so the shammy will need to add damage in addition to dogdog. The easiest way is jbb, and for the late 40s/early 50s, this is also the fastest way.</div></div><hr />
