<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rahvyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone else had or heard of this problem?  <br />
I logged in and did /newui, relogged and proceeded to fix my spell book when I start getting this message.<br />
You are hungry<br />
You are out of food.<br />
????????????? hmmm My wife had just bought me 3 stacks of food the night before right before we logged off.<br />
So I look in my inventory and what do ya know all of my bags are gone except one!  Now it's not a big deal because I didn't really lose anything just some food and an extra spear I had but still. <br />
Has anyone esle had any problems?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Alliza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No, however a couple times I've gone afk and found summoned loaf's of bread on my cursor, haven't been able to figure out why.  Heard other people say the same thing a few times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Intrestingly enough, I did too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Fingers crossed I come back from afk and find a bag with a fungi, OoIV and a Lodi Shield in it :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Fingers crossed I come back from afk and find a bag with a fungi, OoIV and a Lodi Shield in it  <br />
<br />
Me too ! A REIF would be nice too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I got 20 summoned water once :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No such luck (good or bad) here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There are two items that drop in VT.    One is an AOE summon bread and one is an AOE summoned water.<br />
<br />
No joke.<br />

<br />
So, if you find summoned bread or water on your cursor, a VT keyed person is having some fun with the people around them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Heh, from past experience that would be a sweet item ;)<br />
<br />
I can't count how many times I would see &quot;dude, have any spare food&quot; halfway through a raid :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hmmmm, except that it's AOE and puts a stack of food on EVERYONE'S cursor.<br />
<br />
Shaman also have an AOE shrink item in VT, now THAT would be useful!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">That works for me ;) Last raid I went on I personally fed 9 people :\</div></div><hr />
