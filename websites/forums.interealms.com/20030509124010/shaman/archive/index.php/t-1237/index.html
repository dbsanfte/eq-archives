<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moriar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">All,<br />
<br />
Here's my problem:  I have a level 16 Barb shaman.  He was my favorite toon to play until level 14, but then he started to be very frustrating.<br />
<br />
Here's some background:  I was doing the normal hunting and stuff in the Karanas and everything was &quot;normal&quot;.  I could group or solo and get experience at a rate that I thought was acceptable.<br />
<br />
Then, a couple of my RL friends said that I should go to LOIO with them.  Their toons are a level or two above me, but nothing drastic.<br />
<br />
As soon as I get to LOIO, my shaman sucks the big one.  Even light blue mobs resist my spells on a regular basis, and I can't compete with anything in HTH.  I die a lot.  Basically, the only way I can play my shaman now is to group with the 2 or 3 toons that I went to LOIO with, and my job is main healer.  Keeping the group's tank alive with a 30 point heal spell isn't the most effective thing in the world either. <br />
<br />
I make it to level 16 by grouping with my friends, and then I try to solo again.  No luck here, either.  Sabretooth cats conn lt blue/dk blue and it's all I can do to take one down and stay alive.  Sarnak juveniles also conn blue, but beat me up without really breaking a sweat.  My plan for soloing mobs is basically this:  1) root , 2) DOT, 3) melee while the DOTS do their thing.  The only problem is that my root rarely lasts long enough for me to get off all of my spells.  <br />
<br />
So, what am I doing wrong?  Is LOIO just the wrong place for me to be?  Or is it that the mid-teens are just a bad time for shamans?  All of my magic skills are at the level cap, but my HTH skill (piercing), is only in the mid 40's.   Would getting my piercing skill maxxed help me much?<br />
<br />
Any advice you can give is appreciated,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What are you doing wrong?  You're in the wrong zone!  :rolleyes: <br />
Get over to High Hold/High Keep Pass, and get in an orc or gnoll group.  I don't know about the XP in LOIO, but I did levels 16-20 on the orc side in High Pass relatively quick.  Loot is pretty good for the level.  the orcs drop ringmail and rusty/bronze weapons.  It's safe as well.  The zone line is right behind where you're camping.  You can sell in the zone (oops, forgot you're an iksar).<br />
<br />
Also, hunting there will increase your faction with freeport militia and qeynos.  Also, turning in orc scalps in High Pass will eventually make you non-kos to the guards inside the keep.<br />
<br />
Go inside the keep at level 20.  you can level in the basement there until 35 if you want.  It gets boring though.  I split my time between the basement there, spires in S Karana, and SplitPaw.<br />
<br />
I've only been through LOIO twice, and promptly vowed to never go there again!<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />
<br />
If I haven't been specific enough , ask for some clarification.  I'll happily oblige.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Between your current level and Level 24, things will be rough. The Level 19 spells are a joke. Even the upswing at 24 is short-lived, and you'll seem sort of weak until Level 34. At Level 39, you become much more powerful, and at Level 49 you ascend. Unfortunately, Shamans take a while to come into their own.<br />
<br />
The best advice I can think of is to get into a dungeon group and level as quickly as possible, so that you can put these dark years behind you. Try to tank/melee as much as possible, to keep up your Defense skill (very important) and your weapon skills (somewhat important). Also, unless you have some great weapon, Piercing is generally pretty weak for melee output. I'd recommend 1H or 2H Blunt instead as your primary weapon, and that you devote some time each level to keeping Piercing at a reasonable skill level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I had same type of friends...&quot;Get to the lake.  It's the best zone in the game.  Get to LOIO. etc&quot;<br />
<br />
I was 14 or 15th at the time as well.  LOIO isn't worth going to until you get around 20.  Most groups WON'T want you if you are in your teens, and as you've learned the mobs are too tough to solo.<br />
<br />
I told my friends to stuff it and I stayed in Oasis, NRo, SRo until I hit 19 and got my spells.  Then went to LOIO...then FM, and then I wised up and went to Luclin.<br />
<br />
Nowadays, skip the entire damn continent of Kunark.  Go to Paludal Caves, Netherbian Lair, Marus Seru, Dawnshroud Peaks, Hollowshade Moor, Tenebrous Mountains, Maidens Eye...and suddenly you are well over 50 and you have managed to pick up some very nice equipment along the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">One thing I noticed about your tactics:  you were not slowing the mobs.  Use walking sleep and melee dot them down.  Keep tainted on them the whole time and nuke when they get low.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As the others said, if you want to fight in LoIO, you should probably wait until you get to level 19. You need the upgraded healing spell to be effective in groups and also if you solo. Mobs are pretty tough, especially at your level. I went to LoIO with some RL friends around 19-20 (I forget) and basically played healer for the most part, soloing just enough to keep my defense/offense and weapons skill maxxed. If you're gonna solo, you do need to max out your weapon skill (I used piercing once I got a good spear.). Also, try to up your ac (by defense primarily and good gear secondarily). Your strategy sounds good, but I think you're just a bit on the low side to hunt in LoIO. The others have posted good suggestions as to where you could hunt as an alternative. See if you can get your friends to go somewhere else for a while. It won't take long to get a few levels and then, if you like, you can go back to LoIO. It's not going anywhere. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nothing wrong with you except the zone you're in. I wouldn't go to LOIO until 19, you'll be hard pressed to find a group in  your early teens. You'll become a designated buff whore at that level...no fun. And your heal spell is relatively weak until 19. Go to The Overthere at the pond you can solo or duo there from 16-20, good exp and relatively abandoned. Plus there is a vendor at the pond you can sell your goodies to. Highpass is also a good zone, I didn't care for the trip through Kithicor to get there though, very nasty zone especially at night, avoid it like the plague.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Adding in a vote for the OT mudpit:<br />
<br />
Good solo and group possibilities.  Non-KoS vendor for supplies.  High-level peeps pass by all the time for buffs and exp rez's.<br />
<br />
Zone to WW is not far away..and if you have a really good group you can go pull giants from the WW giant fort.<br />
<br />
Of course..the new Moon zones seem to be FAR better designed..and they are all indoor zones which seem to carry that exp bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Setantha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They removed the zone experience modifier from Ill Omen some time ago I'm told..nowhere near as lucrative for exp these days. I spent half a level there and decided the effort wasnt worth it. Paludal is good at these levels assuming you and your friends have Luclin. If you dont have Luclin, there is a nice solo spot in Erudin that will help with maxxing out you AC (repeat after me...''I must maxx out my AC every level'')  ;) and has better than average loot.<br />
<br />
There are two named npcs here near the library - Phloatin Highbrow and Tol Nicelot. Phloatin is good til about 22ish and then move onto Tol Nicelot til about 26. There are guards but they will not assist either of these guys and the zone to Toxx is quite close in case you get into trouble. From memory Phloatin doesnt drop much coin, but Tol drops a 1-5pp. Be advised, leave Tol until he cons blue...he is a Paladin and will CH himself.<br />
<br />
Hmm...the spot in OT sounds the place if you're grouped with your buddies. However, if you all have Luclin, take my advice and go to Paludal...you will NOT regret it hehe.<br />
<br />
As regards tactics this is what I normally do..<br />
<br />
Solo:<br />
Pull with Slow<br />
Melee and channel a DoT<br />
If you're taking a beating..root, back off, heal, re-DoT if necessary, rejoin.<br />
<br />
Grouped:<br />
Slow, heal and root adds.<br />
Normally, situation allowing, I will root the tank's mob and step in and melee it for a while...keeps your DEF and OFF up in grouping scenarios.<br />
<br />
NB If your spells arent sticking..pull with Malaise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Carthage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">May have been mentioned but - I hear Paludal caverns is excellent exp around your level...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Moonhaawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There may be a faction problem, but, I spent 14-19 on Kerra Island fighting only the 3 wharf rats.  The one inside was the tougher of the 3.  Got the exp and the zone was empty (had to gratz myself when I dinged).  Then it was off to LOIO.</div></div><hr />
