<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Talsondar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all:<br />
<br />
Been reading the boards on and off since I started my shammy back in 99' and have rarely posted.  I wanted some input on what upgrades you all see fit for my shammy.  I use the slow, tank, dog method and with the 265dd proc with my hammer and my dex self buffed to around 190 or so, it works quite well...:D <br />
<br />
Anyways, I am not really worried about wis at this point, looking more towards AC/HP.  My upgrade slots are probably legs and bracers but I am open to suggestions.<br />
<br />
I have ~10k to work with.<br />
<br />
Thanks all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think thats a pretty nice battle shaman outfit for your level, I'm a big fan of Sentry Bracers in the mid levels too, always impressed by people who seek them out.<br />
<br />
You could easily wear that outfit until planar/velious armour but you might look into some cultural if you're keen to spend some money. The bracers are lovely, will probably blow your budget but you could likely wear it for the rest of your career.</div></div><hr />

Jarsarth leggings are (from memory) 15AC +5wis +5int. These legs drop extrememly frequently in Karnors Castle, and just rot on the corpse (because they are no drop) - go to KC and ask nicely if you can loot a pair. Alternatively, do the Kromriff Miitary Leggings quest (but you will need a higher level friend (50ish) to help you with the final battle)<br />
<br />
Back:<br />
Wet thorn Cloak goes for around 150plat<br />
Totemic Cloak is possible for you to quest at your level, although it is one of the tougher of the totemic quests.<br />
<br />
Wrists:<br />
Totemic Bracer is very very easy to quest<br />
Jarsarth Bracer is common drop in KC<br />
Coldain Military Bracer is awesome (but need level 50ish friend again)<br />
<br />
Earring:<br />
The player made imbued ivory earrings will give you more AC<br />
<br />
Range slot:<br />
Ceremonial Smudging stick might be worth a look?<br />
<br />
Weapon:<br />
since you like 2hb, keep eyes open for Granite Face Grinder, its faster and does more damage (but no proc)</div></div><hr />
