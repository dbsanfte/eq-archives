<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can a barb shamy buy the bag by default or do I have to kill kobolds? As far as I know I haven't killed anything that will positively or negatively affect my faction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So as long as you haven't killed any of the little guys, I would say you'll be alright.<br />
<br />
Don't think you'll need any faction work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zukasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think good/neutral races start non-kos with the nomes (maybe even all races do). Do keep in mind that faction and CHA can make a difference in price of up to 1.5kp. Lowest price possible is 5250, but 'out of the box' faction with decent CHA, the price can be 6500+.</div></div><hr />
