<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Herburt_Brell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have heard more than once that a Ranger can turn in his Runed Scout's Helm from the Thurg armor quests...but I have yet to find confirmation whethere this is possible or not. If it is possible, who the heck do I turn the helm into? I believe it is in Icewell Keep somewhere? Please help :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nephyrbreeze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have always wondered- where is this customization quest, and what does it do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Telloran Treehugger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Custom helms for Velious quest armor is only available to the plate classes.<br />
<br />
However, the Corwn of the Kromzek Kings, Cowl of Mortality, and I think the White Dragonscale Helm are customizable by all classes that can use them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>timcooper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">dain crown is as well ,im not sure on white dragonscale helm but not many about we never merited kt head for helm, boots are just to good for casters.<br />
And of course helm of the tracker<br />
Square helm also gices graphics</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kysumu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">HoT can be customized you say?...I would love to hear how as i have just recieved it and not feel more like head butting mobs than swinging my blades at them....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>walkerofplains</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When you customize a helm you turn a non-graphics helm into a helm that has special racial visual looks if you have Velious graphics turned on and not the new luclin characters.  All the Thurg, SS, and Kael armor quests have chain graphics already and can't be customized because we're not plate classes.  As Telloran said &quot;Corwn of the Kromzek Kings, Cowl of Mortality, and I think the White Dragonscale Helm&quot; can be customized and the Helm of the Tracker is already customized to show special racial graphics.</div></div><hr />
