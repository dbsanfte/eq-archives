Where are you hunting? West wing you'll need giant faction. Storm giant ally and realistically tormax too.<br />
<br />
East wing aka halls of testing, you'll need ally with skyshrine.</div></div><hr />

Ever consider the fact english may not be their primary language? Or that they may suffer from dyslexia? Maybe even just a bad typist or tired or in a hurry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Firstly, the answer to your question is pretty much &quot;yes&quot;.  You will need ally faction with the quest NPC's for all ToV armor.  It can't be done at kindly like the Thurgadin armor.<br />
<br />
Secondly, which faction are you on?  With giants you will need faction with 3 groups and with dragons only one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You might want to take a look at your own spelling as well before becoming a critic. The last word in your sentence is spelled &quot;explanation&quot; not &quot;explaination&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mukkrakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Unsure about CoV faction items yet but from what I've been told by my friends, you need to be Ally to the quest giver and non-KoS to Yelinak. I'll find out soon enough. :)<br />
<br />
For Kael quest armor, which I have direct experience with, you need the following faction:<br />
<br />
Kromzek: Ally (since this is the Questgivers faction) If you're hunting in ToV (non-HoT), then you should get to Ally very fast. I was ally after 2 hunting trips into Western Wastes, actually.<br />
<br />
Kromrif: no bearing -- only issue is getting past a see-invis mob on the way to the quest hall<br />
<br />
Tormax: Only for shaman, you need non-KoS since the area the quest giver is in has Tormax faction mobs. Best way to be non-KoS is to turn in Icepaw paws and Coldain heads to Bevellos (sp?) -- or kill Dain. Another way to do this is to have someone train out the Tormax faction mobs as you're getting CoH'd right in front of the questgiver. A shaman in my guild did that. Was a sight to behold.<br />
<br />
Since I'm KoS to rif, I've always been CoH'd into the quest hall. /shrug<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Uurgugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For Skyshrine you need ally CoV faction and Yelniak doesn't matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yep, COV Ally is all that matters for HoT quest armor.<br />
<br />
Getting in there is a bit of a bear what with the teleport maze and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Holdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">yeah went on my frist trip through skyshine to turn in some quest armor...jesus the zone is freakin huge.  Who ever figured that out the first must of been there for an hour or two.</div></div><hr />
