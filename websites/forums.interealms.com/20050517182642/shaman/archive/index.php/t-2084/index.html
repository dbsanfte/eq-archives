<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gvivi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There is a post on the new faithstone and spiritstone. i see some people are confused, i was too.<br />
<br />
according to some ppl, it appears a 200 potter would have same succuss rate as a level 1 potter since the trivial is so high.  so if you have specilized in another tradeskill, and only objective of pottery is to make stone, might as well not try.<br />
<br />
at 220+ chances of making a stone is quite good, i probably would recomment people make it after 110 or so.  i was at skill of 188 before the smithing drive leather padding dye, for rest, best option will be unrest to 188.  be consistent, there will be a newbie with few stack of zombie skin.<br />
<br />
after 188, it kind of a headache.  basically, u need a chanter who can stay there enchanter hour hour hour of item for you, and skilling up is terrible until 200, about 40 combine for skill up seem right, some skill up r much higher thru.  if you have lot of money to spare, use the ceramic band route since everything is stackable, otherwise, use opal stein, both will get you to about 220.  be rdy to burn 20k+ here.<br />
<br />
gathering iron oxide is kind of pain, but if you can get to 220, you have the patient to get the component.<br />
<br />
if you happen to be in Dru Ro, you can also send me a tell if you don't want to go thru all the trouble.</div></div><hr />
