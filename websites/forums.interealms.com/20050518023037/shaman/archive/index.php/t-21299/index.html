<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know it's been said before but I just wanted to point it out again...  We went to Ferubi for 3 nights with my crew and blasted around for a good 6-8 hours each time just making cycles of the named spots.  In that time we killed probably 1 named per hour (Heh we left a room 3 times but turned around because the named pop behind us next spawn cycle :) )<br />
<br />
Anyway, in that time we recieved exactly ZERO spells that werent for BL or Berz.  When I brought this up on the guild website of the group that I raid with their first post was &quot;There is no way the RNG is THAT messed up, you just had a bad streak, I'm sure there are others that have gotten 12 Wiz spells in a row&quot;  Want to know something... I've yet to hear ONE F'ING person say that!<br />
<br />
What I do hear a whole lot about it how many Berz tomes are rotting.  *** are they doing? Berz are all of 0.5% of the community yet their tomes drop the most.  Behind them are BL coming in at a solid 3% of the community and their spells drop the second most.<br />
<br />
I know ONE shaman that has BoN and one that has the new heal because he was forced to loot the spell when it was the crappy DoT.  Not only do they need to retune Gates for more named to drop but for the love of god, make anyspell that drops a rune or something like the high end so anyone can turn it in for their spell.  This rotting spells is crap after you wipe 3 times a night to a random romer that pops you from behind and takes out 3 of the casters before you can get a heal off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The drops will be fixed with the next expansion.  Most everything will probably be fixed with the next expansion.<br />
<br />
It sure was nice of SOE to sell us a &quot;broken&quot; product and sell us &quot;the fix&quot; at a later date.  GoD bless um'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How many people wil be willing to purchase the next expansion though?  Sure, there will be those that will buy it because they always buy the latest expasnion, but Gates made many people stop and actually look at the stuff that SOE is crappng out of its development department.<br />
<br />
IMO, fixing Gates with with Omens is the worst possible thing they could try and do.  Not only would they lose sales for those that didnt even buy Gates, but they will also lose sales for those that bought a broken expansion but refuse to pay another 25-30 bucks to fix the crappy thing.<br />
<br />
Its going to take a hell of a lot more than some new fancy graphics and a guild tribute system to make me want to buy it.  And raising the level cap is really not helping.  Time will tell, but I think I already know the story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have people in my guild bitching about every spell dropping being a Shaman spell. We had 2 Balance spells drop in 5 minutes in Ferubi. One person has had a couple Shaman heal spells rot in Vxed. That being said, it's not evenly for all classes that's for sure. Go back to runes if they are going to be this rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My biggest complaint about GoD is trying to get people to go there.  Seems that nobody wants a challenge anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Like he said..its allready been said before..../sigh/holds out open hand...&quot;Choke yourself!&quot;</div></div><hr />
