<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Helek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Please sign here if you will be coming to the regularly scheduled program.  I want to get a good idea of who is coming.<br />
This week i would prefer to play Helek on Wed for a specific reason.<br />
There are two things I personally need to accomplish in Sol A as Helek.  These two things are both related to the Burning Rapier Quest that i have been working on.<br />
<br />
Find the Outcast (Lynada the Exiled) in Sol A in the High Shaman room. Killing the outcast gets you the Sparkle Purse (NO DROP). Lynada is a ~35th level caster with a pet and can be nasty if you have to fight goblins nearby as well. She is a 4hour 15min spawn with no placeholder. <br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
Clockwork Oil Stout - Clockwork CX, Solusek A near Gabbie Mardoddle - Can be pickpocketed.  or looted upon the kill.  Beware... i think this will hurt your Gnome faction!  Im not certain.<br />
<br />
If this is feasible please let me know.  If not I will try to arrange other plans and play overflow on Wed.<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

33 necromancer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'll be there with either Draganite or Beridian. I won't kill any gnomes or clockworks though. The goblins back around the area with Lynada would certainly be a challenge. That is where you begin seeing the Solusek goblins and champions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Helek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">THe gnome portion has been completed.<br />
<br />
I have an acquaintence that is willing to take care of the Lenada the exiled earlier in the evening.<br />
<br />
So... I will be ready and available with Overflow at the appointed time.<br />
<br />
I will also be completeing the BR quest tonite at some point.   before or after the lowbie event.<br />
<br />
Thanks ...<br />
<br />
have a great nite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm..<br />
<br />
Calon will be there, but he is only 27. I know that Morsisa will not be. (Down one healer and the other shaman). <br />
<br />
Bomar has a primary that plays on another server and does not check our boards, so I am not sure on his status. I would think Terackia will be there, but she can run late or might have something come up. <br />
<br />
*Edit* ok.. I was going to recommend Overflow, since we know we will be down Morsisa..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I wil bring Draganite then. I can also bring Shamashin for a change, but both on same account so one or the other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Drognar Thunderfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Count me in Helek, im currently in Ot, but will make my way there.<br />
<br />
See ya in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Draganite makes more sense to me (snare and cross buff), but bring what you feel like playing..  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bearan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I will be there with Griss and Lassha.<br />
<br />
I was pulling the Solusek goblins and champions last week from the big room with the pit in it outside of the High Shaman room. Also pulled a Solusek Mage from there, (nasty caster).   It is a little long to pull from there all the way back out to where we have been setting up.  There are alot of spawns in between, which makes for a narrow window of time to pull them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Terackia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I should be there.<br />

If we run into any inferno goblin wizards tonight remind me I need to loot a piece for an Ivy Etched quest.<br />
