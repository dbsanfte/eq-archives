<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sivilon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Any suggestions of where I can hunt on the  moon at level 24? <br />

Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Netherbian lair, Paldual Caverns, Marus Seru to name a few.  Paldual totally rocks if you have a good group or a good ency.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ralahast-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ive been in Paludal for 20, 21 and 22 the last few days, played about 3 hours total, and made 3 leves. Great XP if you get a good enchanter or solid group with a couple melees, SOloing is kinda slow as you can manage to pull about 15 recondites by accident :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Paldual caverns start to get light bluish, somewhat at 24. It's still pretty decent exp.. actually it's the best exp I've seen in the game, lvled my shaman there from 19 - 24 in to days ( was using a lvl 25 SK to &quot; PL &quot; him by killing blues. SK did lvl to 27 by the time i was done, but bandits are turning light blue to the shaman now :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kervin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Pair up with a Tank in Marus Seru. Or see if you can find a solid group that could use your buffs in DS (other end of Netherbian). In DS MOBs are likely to be too high for you to do any damage. But Any group without a healer should welcome you. Also, chain pulling the Netherbians should still yield good exp and good amounts of coin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gamanae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Kervin can you saay more about hunting in Netherbian? I'm not familiar with that zone at all (except to run through).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">theres a pillar in the middle, and branches of to nex/marus/ds.<br />
<br />
there are 3 types of mobs, fungoids, trogs and netherbians.  Neth's are the best exp, and their camp is right at the pillar.  if you get in a group w/ a solid tank then you should be fine.  the neths hit hard, and have pretty high HP, but drop great coin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gamanae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks that's very helpful. I assume it's like the Paludal camps where you can count on multiple pulls, so an enchanter is needed or at least useful?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Stilts Stonebender</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you have a monk puller they can usually split it down to at worst 2 at a time. Root the add and slow+poison dot the pull. Give a few ticks and jump in if you have a healer.  Otherwise, med and debuff the add. Keep him rooted.<br />
<br />
The long dot (disease) isn't too helpful. The mobs rarely last long enough for it to really add up. I use the 7 tick dot for max effect. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Andoriner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I would like to add something, Paludal is crap when at lvl 24, was fighting there at lvl 16 - 24, when i hit 24, everything was light blue and green...<br />
Dont go to paludal at 24 :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">if you want cash, don't go to marus seru. you will get hides from the hoppers, and some words/runes from others, and ultrarare some random jewel. I know the hides are good for tailors, so they will fetch a decent ammount, but otherwise you don't get anything.<br />
<br />
however, the xp here is beyond unbelievable for an outdoor zone. IMO the rockthingies are underconned, so start beating up on them as soon as you feel comfortable.<br />
<br />
anyway, if you want cash, it is best to do other things with your time to make it, cause you won't get it here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gwaihir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I faught in netherbian from 24-27 solo. You can pull the neth's single, if you are carful, and they should con dark blue to you. I root-rot them to one bubble, then finish them off melee.<br />
<br />
At level 24/25 you get a good 1/2 blue from a single kill on a drone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Maelin.Dakor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have noticed that a sham/wiz/chanter group in PC is massive exp, i did it for an hour yesterday at 16, dinged 17 and 18 and about to ding 19, if all members can get KEI, the kills whould be non stop.</div></div><hr />
