<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kekenewah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have had my main account for 4 years.  3 years ago I got a second account when I got a notebook computer.  For most of that time I soloed my wizard and just played around with my alts.  Lately I have been duoing a lot in Gunthak with my alts.  First I duoed my druid and chanter to 34.  Then I duoed my shammy from 31 to 34 with my now level 40 monk this weekend.  Here are my two accounts.  Any thoughts on good duo combos that would allow me to get one of my pet classes up to 39 the quickest?  I am also interested in getting my cleric up to 39 ASAP.  I am open to doing a transfer between my two accounts as it would be nice to have a porter on each account.   <br />
<br />
Account 1<br />
60 wizard<br />
40 monk<br />
34 druid<br />
29 cleric<br />

22 bard<br />
21 chanter<br />
<br />
Account 2<br />
34 chanter<br />
34 shaman<br />
32 bard<br />
30 magician<br />
23 rogue<br />
22 ranger<br />
22 beastlord<br />
22 paladin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Beastlord + Cleric. I'm pretty sure that's one of the best duos. =P<br />
<br />
Plus if you die you've got the cleric to rez. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Several possibilities.<br />
<br />
Main = 21 Chanter (acct 1), 2 Box = 34 Shaman (acct 2).  Chanter is currently two levels too low to group with shaman, need to PL it up first.  Chanter charms best available pet for dps, shaman is buffs and heals.<br />
<br />
Main = 30 Magician (acct 2), 2 Box = 29 Cleric (acct 1).  Mage is dps and pet tank, cleric is buffs and heals.<br />
<br />
Main = 34 Druid (acct 1), 2 Box = 22 ranja or 22 bst or 22 paladin (acct 2).  Level 22 is one level too low for grouping, need to PL up one level first.  Druid is heals, buffs, DS, and dps, melee is tank and some dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Beastlord/Druid.<br />
<br />
Hella fast experience leveling.  Lots of DPS, big heals, snare, slow, mana regen buff x 2, stackable hp buff x 2 or 3, I can't remember, huge nukes, dot mania.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Also in reference to your &quot;pet class to 39 quickest&quot; question, druid again.  Even though the DS is weak-ish, it's still something. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">my first reaction was about to be to say &quot;beastlord and shammy&quot;, until i saw the way your accounts line up. druid/bst probably the best way to go for you.<br />
<br />
i've been going duo with a bst friend for awhile now on a very regular basis, and we scream through things. root parking and diseasing mobs ahead of the one you're fighting in zones where you can get away with this kind of thing helps a lot (ie...melee mobs in Droga, some mobs in Umbral Plains, etc). we can usually go a few hours without taking a break, as long as i already have a 44 oz mountain dew by me. otherwise we have to break only when i make my Dew run.<br />
<br />
i'm sure it'd be very similar for druids, with the added bonus of snaring and nuking...but druids can't canni, which is the tie breaker, as far as i'm concerned. i burn mana like crazy when we duo.<br />
<br />
<br />
ahhh...too bad i have to go to work now...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Granted, BST/healer is a good combo (I have a 45 BST/40 Cleric myself), but if it's just a question of getting a pet class to 39 fast, then you have an alternative strategy available to you assuming that the Wizard has his Epic. Have the Wizzy tank with the Epic rune while the pet is making mincemeat of the mob. Root and /pet back off whenever necessary and reapply the Epic. Rinse and repeat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">necro/druid combo = aggro kiting or root rotting. Necro grows without need for KEI; druid provides regen. Both can snare, though recommend use necro snare (key to nec maintaining aggro.)<br />
<br />
Currently I duo with a necro/druid combo aggro kiting PoP zones with quick and efficient kills. Without KEI or virtue on either toon (self buffs and PotG/Pot9/regen/buff pet with necro haste/druid buffs) they can constant pull with no downtime.<br />
<br />
Druid brings portability also (no real biggie anymore) while necro brings corpse summoning / rezzing in a pinch (those far off, hard to convince a cleric to come rez you kind of places.) Toss in necro FD when/if it goes bad and you don't even need to travel back to the bodies ... just clear aggro and rez.<br />
<br />
Combo of druid dots (and nukes) and necro dots is massive dps. At higher levels both can charm (undead and animals) and both can DC pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Mage/shaman. Mage gives high dps, focus items, pet weapons, damage shield and a tank. If not that, then ranger/shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">In order<br />
Druid bl<br />
druid necro<br />
shaman mage</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Druids are amazing PLers, period. At all levels of the game. No other class can even come close. They can even PL someone from 55-60, honestly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kekenewah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thank you for your suggestions.  For now I went with using my shaman to help level my necro up.  I did all of level 29 in 90 minutes in Gunthak aggro kiting undead mobs on the beach.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kiebler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Delete the chanter off the first account and make a rogue.<br />
<br />
You can duo the shaman/rogue to 65 rather easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Enchanter + Druid.  Charm duoing.<br />
<br />
All the way to 65 and AA heaven.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I swear there was a post about almost the exact same thing just this week.  Im kinda getting sick of seeing it actually, the answers are always the same.  Maybe ill start another one just to put together an average list.  Ugh....<br />
<br />
<br />
But for my answer on best duo class, i like the necro/healer(dont matter who the healer is, i use cleric for 96rez)<br />
<br />
<br />
But thats just me...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Sub elemental level would be Mage/Shaman<br />
<br />
Elemental would be Shaman/Necro. Not good if you suck at boxing (like me, though thats what I box, haha)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Vizxor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I play a shaman, wife plays a Bst, friend plays a necro. Any combo of the three and we can pretty much take anything. For 2 boxing I suggest the shaman/Bst. I do it quite often. I have a 55 druid I 2 box with my wife's bst too occasionally, not a bad combo. Guessing druid level is what makes that duo difficult.<br />
<br />
65 shaman, bst, necro<br />
55 druid</div></div><hr />

<br />
Based on the question, if he wants to level his cleric that must be one of the chars to be duoed.<br />
<br />
That leaves either the mage or BL on the other account if he also wants to level one of his pet classes.<br />
<br />
Since both cleric/mage and cleric/BL are good duos, logically the fastest one to level to 39 would be the mage, since it has an 8 level head start on the BL.<br />
<br />
Check the mage boards... cleric is regarded as being one of the favored duo partners for them...<br />
<br />
So this is not opinion... based on the question there is just one logical answer...</div></div><hr />
