<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I keep hearing that stat buffs are useless after a point and while I am not disagreeing, where is the proof?<br />
<br />
I know there are number crunchers out there, so where are all these facts??? Let's compile and organize the data and put it all in one place and prove the point rather than eluding to it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Steel Warriors has been parsing numbers around stats, haste, AC, weapons and everything in between for years. Head there, all the answers are there. I am too tired to link today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">While there could be a double-secret hidden modifier for buffing those stats already at the 305 max, I just dont see it show up in my hitpoints (or anyone else's) when I throw out a Sta buff.<br />
<br />
That would be the easiest proof you could ask for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There was a fairly lengthy analysis of stat buffs on the beastlord forum a while back, as well.  Agility in particular, if I recall correctly, was shown to be almost completely useless.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Siroro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I dont believe we should just test the Shaman Stat buffs.<br />
We should compare them to Beastlord Buffs and other classes Buffs this is the only way to see if Shamans are the master buffers (i know we aint but i still like to cling on to these fading memorys :( ) . Im sure druid Damage Shield does more DPS then our buffs!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree with Siroro, I think we need to get some logs and compile fresh data!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Fatsow had run a parse a while back (think it was about a year ago?).  His parse was to conclude whether agility helped you avoid more.  His results:<br />
Lvl 45 Sentry of Justice. 1280 ac. 1 agi.<br />
Hits: 4234 of 6997<br />
Misses: 2763 of 6997<br />
Miss percentage: 39.49%<br />
<br />
(Had alot of money with me to attain 1 agi.)<br />
<br />
lvl 45 Sentry of Justice. 1315ac. 188agi.<br />
Hits: 9845<br />
Misses: 6149<br />
Total:15994<br />
Miss percentage: 38.45%<br />
<br />
While I do not know how exactly he ran his parses and I don't know if they were totally valid results, I do know that 1 agi or 188 agi are basically the same for his test (1 agility performed better even).<br />
<br />
I think the beastlord result was 3%? change (in avoidance?? not sure and I'm too lazy/uncaring to look) for ~200? agility increase.<br />
<br />
The best quote for the uselessness of stats appears in this thread:<br />
While there could be a double-secret hidden modifier for buffing those stats already at the 305 max, I just dont see it show up in my hitpoints (or anyone else's) when I throw out a Sta buff.<br />
<br />
So, stat buffs are useless to those already capped, and present almost no increase in character prowess if they were to increase the cap further.<br />
<br />
P.S. Why must we (the players/customers) be forced with the burden of proof on what stat buffs do?  WHy is it that dev Rytan &quot;the spell guy&quot; can't say something along the lines of &quot;guys (and girls), listen up, this is what stat buffs do exactly: X.  This is the increase the over-buff would provide: Y.&quot; ?<br />
<br />
P.P.S.  My feeling on the matter?  SOE, Give us proof or give us something meaningful and stop trying to pull the wool over our eyes.</div></div><hr />

have fun. (i sure ass heck didn't (so far doing 11+ hours worth)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">your best bet to find parsing mobs is in &quot;katta&quot; in luclin.<br />
<br />
one of the mobs there doesn't attack back, and has insane regen, and did i mention doesn't hit back ?<br />
<br />
i haven't been there in ages. but yes the mb does exist. i think its one of the bankers or temple mobs.</div></div><hr />

because, they are buying time.<br />
<br />
once OoW comes out, we can buy all our fixes (the ones that should have been free)<br />
im basically doing this now because WoW server is down for maintenance ( i don't know what happened but i crashed )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Siroro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yes, thats why we need to check how much it increases DPS by and if it is worth Sacraficing a DOT to FA a Rogue or Ranger</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
wich means he has to max the str of the warrior and parse it, then do FA after and parse it.<br />
<br />
but your right and wrong, if the warr has any worn attack it skews the results, FA would only mess with the results if the warrs or other melee didn't have max stats.</div></div><hr />

IF you had really low stats, like all around 20 or so, think how powerful 140 atk and 140 to stats would be?  that would be better than a decent ammount of haste.  But is reality this won't happen, so imho we are being screwed over by the possibility of a chance of abbuse.  Kinda like needing linked canni's, becuase we could chain 2 different canni's for even better regen...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Razzaziah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">In a nutshell this is how stats work:<br />
<br />
Agility = Avoidance (dodge, block).  The gains were about 3% gain in avoidance from 1 to 305.  The proof as was mentioned was the beastlord forum.<br />
<br />
Stamina = 4 HP at 65 up to 200.  Then its diminishing returns.  To a point where 300-305 adds 1 HP.  (class dependent).  The rule of thumb on the other forum of having 1/2 effect every 50 above 200 is reasonable.  So for every 50 above 200 multiply the hp gain by 1/2.  So if you have 299 and earn 1.  The effect of that 1 stamina is 1/2*1/2 * 4, or 1 hp.  Please note that in reality these numbers are fractional (not whole numbers).<br />
<br />
AC = Lower damage you take.  More specifically it &quot;lowers the probability an NPC hits for max damage&quot;.  The steelwarriors brought out the proof with their whole Damage Interval (DI) discussion.  Basically an npc has a Min Hit and a DI.  The mobs max and min damage are Min Hit + 1*DI, Min hit + 20*DI.  AC directly works against this 1,2,3,...,18,19,20 roll an NPC gets in damage calculations.  There are well known cliffs of ~ 1300 AC and ~ 1900 AC where the return on investiment of an individual AC point is not noticed.  An NPC counters AC by having high ATTACK.  Since HP buffs for shaman are ~36 and the scale of importance is measured on 100s for practical purposes a shaman AC buff will not help in combat.<br />
<br />
Attack = ~ 1% DPS per 10 attack gained.  The proof was on the rogue forum (so figure its less for other classes).  There is a worn item cap of 250 (including proc avatar items).  In this world Ferine Avatar adds 14% DPS to a rogue.  Since rogues do nearly twice the DPS of other classes, expect 1/2 the effect on other classes.  Realize that Luclin Mobs are known for high AC.  AC reduces the effect of Attack (read AC).<br />
<br />
Dexterity = ~ 10% gain in proc rate, and 20% gain in channeling range.  Proof was Steel Warriors (maybe 8 months ago) and Graffee.  Note that when a player casts, they can move X distance in /loc units without being interrupted.  Dexterity increases this distance by 20%.  So if you can move 0.25 loc, you can move move 0.4 loc (the channeling aas have greater effect).  Proc rates are typically 2 per minute, so a 10% gain would be 1 extra proc every 5 minutes.  Note both are VERY basic tests.  Channeling in specific.<br />
<br />
You can make your own conclusions.  Nobody should accept the developer saying we should prove it, as the results of many many hours of labor are still available on the various boards.  Even look at magelo.  As they had to implement the forumlas approximating the stats effects on Atk and Ac and Hp and are widly accepted as pretty close to true.<br />
<br />
The statement that buffs &gt; 300 are meaningless or offer trivial advancement is justified.<br />
<br />
NOTE: NPCs and PETs have a proc rate of about 10 per minute (2 per minute for players).</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. but if your stats are that low at level 65, i am speechless, but honestly, not everyone is playing in Pre-Kunark, a bazaar warrior can easily be 6.5k unbuffed and have some nice + to attack items and other such cool things.<br />
<br />
<br />
2.  i agree with you on the second one, haste is over powered. its more powerful than FA. its true, parse it yourself, haste added to any melee is more DPS than FA (unless he has like 5 in all stats)</div></div><hr />

Yep, it might be better then a 20% haste! I doubt it would be but I guess that might happen. 20% haste is what, quickness?</div></div><hr />
