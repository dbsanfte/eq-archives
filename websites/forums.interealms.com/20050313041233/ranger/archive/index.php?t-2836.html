<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krux</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 08:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been using this method to raise my archery skill while getting some nice experince too.<br />
<br />
First choose a blue mob to fear kite. This mob depeneds on your level. Right now I'm using Mammoths and rhinos in EW.  Find a animal at your level.<br />
<br />
Fear Kite with normal weapons till you get the mob to the point he turns and can't run while snared.<br />
<br />
At this point back up and start firing arrows till it dies or you run out of arrows.<br />
<br />
I've found this to be simple and safe way to work archery. <br />
<br />
Also at lower skill levels of archery you can usually dump all your arrows into the mob, since some generate HP at a decent rate.<br />
<br />
Using this method at 48, I've gotten 4 points of improvement on one mammoth and close to 1/2 blue of exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Odile Champagne</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 11:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My favorite archery target is Tarbul Earthstrider - the named hill giant in East Karana. He's not terribly magic resistant, so I snare him and fill him full of arrows. He has mad regen so there's no fear of him dying on ya. I kite him around down by the water near the fishing camp to avoid people xping and can usually get some nice skill increases from him. At 57 he's still nice and blue and so a perfect target. When I run out of arrows I simply camp out to remove agro and then log back in, summon more arrows, rinse and repeat :)</div></div><hr />

Just root and shoot, plus you can usually get a nice dex buff from a shaman close to make the skills move faster.  You do have to wait for him to respawn, but by the time I could summon enough arrows to kill him again, he would be respawned :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krux</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 05:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing nice about the method I mentioned above is you can do it at many levels. Lions, Pumas, Mammoths, Zelnaiks, Tundra Mammoths,  Rhinos, rockhoppers.<br />
<br />
With any level of equipment.<br />
<br />
It's also mana effcient. after getting the mob down to the point he stops running, all you need is a snare to keep him place.. Which last longer than roots or panic animals. <br />
<br />
Also when you the mob is standing still you don't have to worry about  running backwards  firing while possibly argoing something else or falling off the cliff.<br />
<br />
The best part is when your done or run out of arrows you step in finish off the mob and you get the exp for it also.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the other tips.</div></div><hr />
