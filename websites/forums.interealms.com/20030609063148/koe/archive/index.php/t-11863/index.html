<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>itchyban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There are reports that trods have been changed to once again allow you to kill yourself. Apparently, the check is now on total HP, not current HP so rodding at below 450 HP (i.e., immediately after a rez) will kill you (again).<br />
 <br />
Nothing really solid on this, but I'm not about to check it out myself...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nadonius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Rods were changed sometime back to check off max hitpoints, and would not work unless you had the required max hitpoints.  I think mainly that was to stop mages from killing newbies with em.  Even then it said that you could still kill yourself with em if your current health was too low but you have the total hitpoints to do it.</div></div><hr />
