Level 18 Shaman on The Rathe<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First, and I just have to get this out of the way...  &quot;I hate you&quot;.<br />
<br />
Okay, now that my twink jealousy is out of the way...<br />
<br />
For low levels (like you at 18) I seriously think you'll get the most benefit out of the haste gloves.  Especially with the REIF, you should be doing some great damage for your level, and the SCHW augment that nicely.<br />
<br />
For later in life, you'll probably want to switch to crystal chitin gauntlets in your 40s (when melee starts to bite, even with the REIF), then to Coldain skin gloves in your mid 50's (when HP &gt; All).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Haste is the only thing that will make a difference at level 18, given those choices.  I was wearing leather gloves at that point and got along just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Question about that coldain milit. wristguard. I am looking to do the quest, but it appears you must have good faction with BOTH dwarves and giants. <br />
<br />
Lame.<br />
<br />
Anyway, how did you get around that? The acid from CC is no drop and the gem that the guy in thurg gives you is nodrop also. <br />
<br />
And when you start the quest and the broodmother runs over to the cave, I guess she attacks Brokenhammer? I just need to make sure he dies right? The writeup on Allahz. was kinda lame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I wear coldain skin gloves.  Keep wondering if I should go to the CC Gaunts but just dont really wanna lose the hp from the coldain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think the way most people did that quest was start out a rallow zek worshipping Ogre.  You start un kos to the giants, and he can be your Kael mule.  He is also unkos to the dwarves, so that isnt a problem then.<br />
<br />
I actually had started my cleric on Kael faction, and there is a point where he was dubious to both giants and dwarves.  I had gotten all the way to the final turn in Kael for the control harness, and my items were at for to low faction.  Guess dubious is fine for the first, but you need higher to get the harness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Trolls on RZ faction work too, I have a level 2 one named Baggy (female, very cute, /nod) who does my muling for that quest.  You need a partner to help you out tho.  <br />
<br />
I would say go Coldain gloves cause soon you won't melee that much anymore and those are the best gloves you can get for a long time.  Lots of hps and mana and good ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">All characters that worship Rallos Zek start Dubious to giants...so you don't  have to just make fatties.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zaspacer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for the advice, makes a lot of sense.<br />
I think I'll buy the SCHW and a Reed Belt (for the Affliction Efficiency II) to replace what I have.<br />
<br />
Sorry Bigguss,<br />
Remember: &quot;don't hate the player, hate the game&quot;<br />
(love that quote, it is such a cop-out)<br />
<br />
My only other real char is a 52 non-guilded bard.<br />
A lot of my gear is the leftovers from his farming or leftovers in his bank inventory.<br />
I did buy the REIF and SBS, but I figure they will make a HUGE difference. (my bard would KILL for a 12/19... and it has a proc on top of that... that is disgusting!)<br />
I also did buy a lot of the Focus Items, but I got em for my bard (who is turns out can't use them), and now I am just sitting on em as they are likely to get harder to get.<br />
<br />
KraksterSlanginbuffs,<br />
for the Coldain Military Wristgaurds I made a Troll Warrior on RZ faction and stuck a 6/65 ring on him so he wouldn't die if he stubbed his toe.<br />
<br />
If there is any Shaman on The Rathe interested, I will redo the quest and sell/trade the Coldain Military Wristgaurd drop to them or give it free if they can take out two mobs for me in Katta (Arbogast and Miller) to complete my Cloak of Truth quest.<br />
Or I will give you a Medicine Totem if you can kill those 2 Katta mobs for me. Only hitch is that I cannot help you kill them, I do not want the faction hit (it is needed to do/redo the quest).<br />
<br />
I would HIGHLY recommend checking out Hollowshade Moor for some nice SHAMAN useable gear there including:<br />
Shell Trimmed Bracer<br />
Belt of the Grimling Skullkraker<br />
Brain of the Beaked Bear (adds 4% to meditate)<br />
Mystical Headshrinker's Skullcap (adds 3% to meditate)<br />
Preserved Owlbear Eye<br />
Ceremonial Smudging Stick<br />
Staff of Living Sand<br />
Elder Wolf Hide<br />
Fang Shaped Stone Earring<br />
Ornate Shell Pestle <br />
Skull Shaped Sacrificial Hammer <br />
Feathered Owlbear Mantle<br />
Sinew Wraped Owlbear Ribcage <br />
Broken Fang Earring<br />
Shield of the Pack Slayer <br />
Owlbear Feather Circlet <br />
Owlbear Feathered Spear<br />
Black Feathered Circlet <br />
Owlbear Claw Earring <br />
Gore Covered Horn<br />
Battle Scarred Wingblade<br />
Horned Beetle Mask<br />
Mask of the Blind Wolf<br />
Cloak of the Blind Wolf<br />
AND MORE!<br />
<br />
Seeing all these drops in Hollowshade is what helped me decide to make my Cat Shaman in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My shaman currently wears these:<br />
<br />
Shissar Scaled Gauntlets<br />
AC12 Wis 5 Int 5 40hp 40mana <br />
<br />
Allakhazams doesn't list them as shaman wearable, but they are.  Also, they're not hard to get.  I believe they're off the named snake Rev with the hissy name in The Grey :)<br />
<br />
Merro Xmas<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I was using the Coldain skin, but opted for the grey flesh for the focus effect.  Up to 20% mana saving on every single dot, debuff, slow or root you cast is amazing.  Unfortunately Affliction efficiency 3 items are a lot harder to get.  I still have the coldain skin in the bank, if it ever gets to the stage where Im not casting enough &lt;44 spells to make the effect worthwhile Ill switch back.<br />
<br />
PS  You can probably tell from the profile I love focus items  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zenyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">yeah I like the shissar scaled guants, they seem to give me more HP's then the coldain skin do, so I am with them for now.  They are in my magelo profile.<br />
<br />
Your gear is pretty solid, with that I imagine you could almost be MA in most groups ;)</div></div><hr />
