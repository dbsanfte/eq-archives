<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xarn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was wondering on the black fur boots, if I get some friends to kill Black Dire for me to hand in the pelt, can I get the boots at say, level 20 and use them? Just curious about this</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think you can, I never heard anyone say there is a minimum level on the furry boots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, it's all faction, not level based, I believe.  (except for the final turn in for Spear of Fate)<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xarn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What faction do I need to turn them in and with whom? Also how can I raise it? THanks =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">make sure you do all the epic steps up to the black dire and you should be fine. good luck on tha boots =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>guice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aye, it's all faction, not level based, I believe.<br />
<br />
You are right. No where in the quest does it say *you have to be 51*. And when I say in the quest, I mean from the NPCs.<br />
<br />
After all, if it fails, you can petition. What's a guide gonna go? Say you're too low? You did all the work and got all the required faction hits, I don't see why you can't get the epic? :p<br />
<br />
<br />
btw - I got my SHM his boots at lvl 24. :)<br />
<br />
As stated before, just make SURE you run all the steps first, it's all Faction level based.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xarn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So I have to do EVERY step in the epic up until that point? I was reading it and noticed the NFP part, I am a troll and very KOS in North FP...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">KOS shaman would use invis to get around NFP, so use invis potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>guice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Or use Wolf form. I used a 46 druid on my other account and wolf formed him. Work'd and never had to worry about it dropping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Xarn - yes - just follow the instructions the NPCs give you and you'll be fine. Invis works in north freeport, so does wolf form, or if you can find people killing Lucan (an evil Freeport guard) you can tap him for a faction hit that will make you non KOS in North Freeport.</div></div><hr />
