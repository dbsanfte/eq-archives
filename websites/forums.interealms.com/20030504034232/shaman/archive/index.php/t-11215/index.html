<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I guess I am the minority here when I think Shamans got ripped on the new expansion spells.  Lets see if I got this right.  640 max heal.  Thats nice.  30 percent decrease in speed for 24 seconds and rooted for 24 seconds as well.  That blows</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It takes up a buff slot so that means it works with more Focus items and AAs than our other heals (like Torpor and Q) and its 3.56 hp/mana, without any AA or focus, that is much higher than the 2.33 hp/mana of superior healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yea but rooted?? That does blow. I still don't get it. :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's a 30% snare, not a root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Henina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Effect:<br />
<br />
<br />
Heals 160 hit points every 6 seconds <br />
-30% attack speed <br />
Decreases movement by 100%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sshasta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">no . .its a root(or tries to act like one  :D ). . 100% movement reduction, 30% attack speed reduction.  Its a mini torpor basically.  I personally am looking forward to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KaisonIcebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">it dosnt root ya  just a snare  has the same exact same neg effects as topar<br />
<br />
walking ya wont be able to move much at all  running ya have a managable movement with sow ya move littel faster then if a druid had snared ya<br />
<br />
closest i have experanced to it being  a root is ya cant  back up  with topar on ya have to turn round and walk forward</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well a heal is a heal.<br />
<br />
Plus it is free mana.<br />
I have approx 1600 hp and 2300 mana... canning (Can3) down to 1 bubble and healing back up with this spell will net me approx 320 mana per 60 seconds... approx 14% of my mana bar per 60 sec. It would take about 7 to go from empty to full.  Not the greatest but its free mana.  Add in a horse, kei and/or perhaps some focus/AAs and that time goes down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">so what? the real point of this is for free mana, th ratio means u can jsut canni down 600hp stoicism and canni down again, fast mana!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">OK, for those of us not high enough level to mem torpor yet, what focus items should we have to get the absolute most out of this spell?  There are tons of discussions on how to max out the benefits of torpor using AAs and such.  I'll go search for those also, but maybe someone can post the quick summary of &quot;how to get 5 or 6 ticks out of stoicism&quot; here for everyone who doesn't feel like searching out the info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well the AAs are a bit out of there... but with mana preservation 3 you can shave off some mana costs at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sshasta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Mana Preservation 2 should also work . .works on 44 and under spells</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This spell is a lot better than it looks at first glance for regaining mana for those of us who have canni4 but not torpor. Sure the ratio of healing is less than KM but it also means you don't have to canni down as far thus exposing yourself to a low health aggro situation.<br />
<br />
Look at the numbers this way. I have 2300hp self buffed(sorry I'm non uber). Let's say I canni4 13 times from full HP giving me 1066 mana and chewing off 1924hp.  If I were to KM at this point I heal myself to full HP and spend 400 mana for a net gain of 666 mana. Not bad but very dangerous to be hovering at 376hp. Plus when's the last time you were at full HP and LOM? Usually you are canning down while fighting and are 1/2-3/4 hp varying greatly on the situation.<br />
<br />
With stoicisim I can just canni4 7 times giving me 574 mana and chewing off only 1036hp. I then cast stoicisim gaining me 640hp for only 180mana for a net gain of 394 mana. A much less dangerous situation unless the snare side effect of it inhibits you to run full speed if the sitatuation is needed.<br />
<br />
I'd certainly love to have torpor but stoicisim will defintely be useful to me at 61. Somone check my math, I wrote this up hastily :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sorell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If Stoicisim fires every tick (6 seconds) can't you cast it, and every tick canni down? That way you get mana with no HP loss essentially. Would work great during a canni-dance, if ppl still do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ridgey Didge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I can't see how a 100% movement reduction is a snare. 100% of something is 100%.<br />
<br />
Just imagine using this spell on the PvP servers. Cast this on the oppostion and have your wizard freinds blast the crap out of them before this could even get the chance to heal them :) <br />
<br />
OOROO!...Ridgey<br />
<br />
P/S Both are crap spells, I would've just rather something like improved invisibilty. But wait!... that's the next expansion due out in 6-7 months. Or, only available if you play the play station version.:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Frankly, Stoicism is awesome for the levels this expansion is designed for (up to 60).  This spell gives Shaman 44-60 a real shot in the arm.<br />
<br />
Torpor at 60 is still a game changer, but younger shaman now can get a taste of our true power.<br />
<br />
It's the reasoning behind giving us Pure Blood that I just can't work out quite yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Slomoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Anyone complaining about Stoi should be shot. Torpor changes the game for shaman, its the running theme in every post. Its a mini version of Torpor so wouldnt you think that for the appropriate levels its gonna be a life changer too?<br />
<br />
I used to borrow a 60 cleric to bot with my shaman, cann4 and celestial elixir myself. After I got Torpor that cleric usually is used to aego then gets put away.  Does that open your eyes to what kind of spell Torpor is? Im guessing most who have negative comments now will be changing thier tune as soon as they use it.<br />
<br />
P.S. To those who say it sucks and wont use it, good. Dont use Torpor or Q either and give them to your shaman brothers if you ever get those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">About how root / snare works in EQ.<br />
<br />
Root= Player is rooted... no movement possible, there is no &quot;movement speed decreased&quot;.<br />
<br />
Snare= &quot;movement speed decreased&quot; - try torpor yourself - and use WALK - with no sow or movement speed increasers. Tada - you cannot. Try put run on.... Moving slightly now... Put sow on... moving yet a bit faster...<br />
<br />
What im trying to say is that base movement speed is 100%... it seems like the torpor only deducts 100% from the total movement speed, instead of - like it should be - making it impossible to move... so if you are sowed and have run on, you can move...<br />
<br />
<br />
At least how i understand it, i cannot see any other solution for this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">i'll use stoicism probably, but rarely at 60.<br />
i like KM more, it's easier to just cann down to 40 and then km.<br />
but i'm not complaining, i'm glad the lower level shamans got something</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">and rooted for 24 seconds as well. That blows <br />

http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1576&amp;source=Test torpor<br />
<br />
its not root, same neg effects as torpor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Genine Goosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Stoicism will help shamen solo 44+, it still won't fill that healing problem we had in groups at this level though. Unless there are any tanks you know that don't mind being healed with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>artmer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Well maybe not tank with it but off tank add with it....just put a paladin, SK, ranger...or even beastlord, monk, shaman on it and they keep agro with spells and you just trow them a torpor(or any other) from time to time...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I think alot of people are forgetting that this expansion isn't aimed at all you 60+ level shamans out there.  People in the high end of the game got PoP and are seeing huge benefits out of it.<br />
<br />
So the spells in LoY see pitiful to you.  Think about it for a second.  Until you get Superior healing at level 51 (or is it 52, I forget..) the most you can heal with a single spell is around 300-350 hp.  Now with Stoicism you can heal 640 over 4 ticks.  Hmm, Superior only heals 580ish..  Yet a 640pt heal over time sucks.<br />
<br />
Wake up and smell how much of an improvement this is.  Sure it slows and snares for 4 ticks, but even if you just use it to reduce downtime between mobs it is gonna be incredibly useful.  Hell, I'm level 55 and I can't wait to get it, until I get Torpor or Q (if I ever get them) this spell will probably never be unmemmed.<br />
<br />
Mind you I think the other shaman spell in the expansion is moronic with disinfecting aura at 52..but then 1 out of 2 is pretty darn good for SOE.<br />
<br />
As for the complaints by you uber shammies who are level 60 and have torpor already, just go back to your tier2 and tier3 PoP groups and quit whining over the fact that us lowbies are finally getting a bone thrown our way.  I swear some of you shamans are starting whine like druids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>artmer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Ho what makes Torpor last longuer...more Tic?<br />
<br />
Mana Con 2 will cost less mana<br />
Haste 2 make you cast faster<br />
Extend enhancement make it last 5 tics healing ya???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Didn't think focus items touched Torpor.  Spell Casting Reinforcement / Mastery is what'll extend it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh, just for kicks I searched on &quot;mini torpor.&quot; <br />
<br />
Lots of threads, including a couple that have &quot;OMGS THIS WOULD BE GREAT&quot; kinds of comments from some of the folks that are griping about Stoicism now.<br />
<br />
I also searched and found that we've pretty much established that extended enhancement items don't extend Torpor.  Other foci work as intended (faster, less mana, etc.)<br />
<br />
Search button:  On a web page near you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Well, the reason extended enhancement items increase spell duration by 15%.  15% of 24 seconds is 3.6 seconds which is less than 1 tick.  Therefore there would be no noticeable effect from it on stoicism, torpor or Q..<br />
<br />
I have no idea about the effect of enhancement duration extending aa's on these spells cause I've never really given much consideration to doing aa's beyond getting cann 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Snarky of Cazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Actually, the reason extended enhancement won't work with Torpor, Stoicism, or Q is because it has a restriction that <br />
<br />
Limit: Min Duration(48.0 sec)<br />
<br />
Oh, and also:<br />
<br />
Just imagine using this spell on the PvP servers. Cast this on the oppostion and have your wizard freinds blast the crap out of them before this could even get the chance to heal them <br />
<br />
While I have none of these spells, I'm quite sure that they will only work on self/group. An unresistable snare would be pretty amusing though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Give torpor / stoicism a buff box then... what is so wrong with that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Ahh, missed the minimum duration restriction on Extended Enhancement, never really looked past the amount of increase in duration for an explanation.</div></div><hr />

It's a good day for sub-58 Shaman.<br />
(Level 58 1950hp heal is more mana effient than Stoicism).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">going to explain the 100% snare for all u folks that plain just dont get it....<br />
<br />
ok when u have RUN OFF( as in walking ) and no runspeed of any kind and have 100% snare then u are rooted...<br />
<br />
if u have RUN ON ( as in running ) or any kind of runspeed buff on...and 100% snare ....u have ure speed which w/ just normal RUN on is abover 100% movement speed....so u still have SOME movement speed left w/ even just plain and normal run and no SoW or innate runspeed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I think that at level 50 i will love this spell - but am I right in thinking that if, say, you were self buffed with Spirit of Bih'Li and Alacrity, those buffs would be removed by the slow and snare effect?<br />
<br />
If so, that is very annoying. Not annoying enough to stop it being a good spell, but certainly enough to take the shine off it. Kinda like being given a Porsche and finding someone has keyed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Tallanas, <br />
  Torpor doesn't overwrite either the sow or haste icon. It stacks with Sow in the sense that you move faster with sow and torpor active than with just torpor. Last I heard it doesn't 'stack' with haste, <br />

  It looks like the only people complaining about how useless this spell is are the ones that aren't 60 yet and have never used torpor. If you really want to flame people you might want to work on your reading comprehension a bit so you at least pick the right target. Otherwise, you just come off sounding like an idiot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I did sound stupid for which I apologize.  My &quot;angst&quot; wasn't directed at anyone specifically here.  I had just read (between a number of different sites) a ton of 60+ level people ******* and whining that LoY was pointless and that it was ridiculous to make an expansion aimed at this level range, and the spells were ****.  Then I read people complaining here and sorta snapped and shot my mouth off over a general frustration with narrow minded people who couldn't see the potential in the spells.  <br />
<br />
SO, take the apology for it what it's worth, and try not judge me overly by one idiotic post.</div></div><hr />

Would be nice to have both on me as I try to slow a dragon in HoT.  Doubt they will stack since torpor won't stack with cleric elixir (which sucks, btw).<br />
