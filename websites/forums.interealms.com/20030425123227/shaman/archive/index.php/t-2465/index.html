<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>JoarAddam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I'm going for the first time to Hate this weekend.  I won't be primary shaman I know since I'm only 47.  Was curious if I should whip up any potions to help with the raid?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you break in by clearing from the port in spot out, Shrink potions for the bigguns :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shrink is the only really usuable one at your level..<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe Calimony for the main tank if you hit Inny but that's probably strectching it for your alchemy skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye, shrink shrink shrink.  <br />
<br />
The Rejuve potion, tho spendy, can really be a life-saver.  Mana-free stacking Regen.  You'll feel like you have a fungi :) -- for about 3 mins :( .<br />
<br />
Null potion's handy if your resists need work, like my sucky ones do.<br />
<br />
And Calimony is AWESOME if ye can make it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Molnarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">One of my RL friends is the MA for our guild. For big raids, he wants me to bring some damage shield potions, especially the more expensive kind. They stack with druid/mage damage shields, and he ends up with a combined damage shield that does more than 50 damage per hit. I only consider this viable if the raid is for you or if the guild will at least partly reimburse you the cost of the potions, but it can make a real difference in damage and can help the tank maintain aggro.<br />
<br />
I also recommend bringing some shrink potions as mentioned by others. This is not so much to make it easier to fit through doorways. Instead, it makes it so more melee characters can get within reach of the mob. This is especially true for Hate since the mobs are small and shrink can not be cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">&quot;and can help the tank maintain aggro&quot;<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, damage shields count as environmental damage. Won't help anyone maintain aggro.<br />
<br />
If you don't have any velious pants wearing shaman, and you are light on priests, whip up a few cure disease potions (Kithor's Disease Treatment). Not essential at all, but good to pass around.</div></div><hr />
