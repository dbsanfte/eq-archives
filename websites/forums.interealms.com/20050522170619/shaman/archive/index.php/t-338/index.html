<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shakasa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok,  I got an issue.<br />
<br />
I need to have memmed the following type of spells.<br />
<br />
Str (For the damn whiny tanks)<br />
Agi (ditto)<br />
Dex (Ditto)<br />
Sta (ditto)<br />
Disease PreDot (Cause chanter never seems to tash fast enough)<br />
Poison PreDot (Ditto - though not sure tash effects this or not)<br />
Disease1 (Cause I am good at it)<br />
Disease2 (Cause I am great at it)<br />
Poison1 (Cause I am even better at this)<br />
Poison2  (Look out...I am on fire now...look at that agro grow)<br />
Poison DD (Cause it sounds kewl when casted)<br />
Cold DD (Keeps the fights short)<br />
Slow (For all the mobs that are chain mezzed by the chanter)<br />
Enstill (For all the mobs that where chain mezzed by the chanter)<br />
HP Buff (for me of course)<br />
SOW (group or otherwise)<br />
Shrink (for those damn ogres)<br />
Haste (Incase we have no chanter)<br />
Food (For the crazy warrior who forgot to buy some)<br />
Water (for me cause I never buy it)<br />
Spirit Pouch (For the silly monk who always forgets go bank prior to camping)<br />
DOH - (Almost forgot CANN so I got the mana for the above)<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes it is a joke...but man...are we versitle or what????<br />
<br />
VERANT...give us just 5 more gem slots!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i think 1 or 2 would be good but I dont think we should have 5 more...  I dont want this game to turn into more like quake with swords than it already is. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am slot gready....  i want an adition bank of 8 spell slots ...  the buff bank...<br />
<br />
The buff bank would only alow buff spells to be membed and would be inactive for 20 seconds after combat...  like autoatack or casting any spell from the fist bank.<br />
<br />
This would allow ous to skip the tedium of the mem/buff/mem/buff/mem/buff.....  grrrrrrrrrr without greatly impacting game balance or combat flexibility.<br />
<br />
Guud Bashing :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Do you really need all of those spells memmed at once?  I see a lot of 'buff' type spells (STR, STA, AGI, DEX, HP) and 'one time use' spells like Summon Food/Water/Bag (you actually use that?).<br />
<br />
Personally, what I do is keep sort of a utility spell slot, which is #8.  Almost always it's used for Cannibalize, but when I'm grouped or buffing or whatever, I use it to swap spells in and out.  Sure it takes awhile to swap STR, DEX, STA, AGI, HoS, etc., but it's sort of become second nature now anyway.<br />
<br />
If it's a raid situation or I don't have the need to keep slow, haste, heal memorized (say, if those spells are being handled by someone else in the group), I'll switch them accordingly or realign to take out the spells I don't need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yep, my spell line up is:<br />
<br />
Chloro - never dememmed<br />
Torpor - never dememmed<br />
Malo - swapped with group sta, acumen, ID, lev, invis while traveling, misc. spells<br />
Dot - swapped with group agi, malosini, POI, misc spells.<br />
Root - never demmmed<br />
Slow - never demmmed<br />
Misc - haste, focus, group focus, shrink, bind, gate, nuke, annul whatever<br />
Cann - swapped out with sow/group sow<br />
<br />
The swap out spells always go to the same slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">1 - chloroblast  (always)<br />
2 - torpor  (always)<br />
3 - root  (always)<br />
4 - dot<br />
5 - dot/nuke/haste<br />
6 - Canni (always)<br />
7 - Slow  (always)<br />
8 - often sow or malo/sini<br />
<br />
4/5/8 are always interchangeable.  With dots you've got time in between to swap them out for buffs / etc and put them back in.  No reason to keep buffs up otherwise, just keep a well organized spellbook so you can get to them quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Instead of /pet hold i would have liked an AA skill that allowed me to make a hotkey of a spell without taking up a gem.<br />
<br />
Like being able to hot key turgurs or torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sokath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Keep in mind I duo 99% of the time...<br />
<br />
1 - Heal<br />
2 - Slow <br />
3 - DoT or DD, or MalX<br />
4 - Haste<br />
5 - Regen<br />
6 - Canni - Always there <br />
7 - Root - Always there<br />
8 - SoW/Group SoW<br />
<br />
I swap out the DoT, Haste and Regen for Initial buffing then usually swap out haste for touch up buffs...I find i do less swapping this way because I am not always swapping out to Haste and regen ever 10-15 minutes...I do str, agi, and Dex with JB armor unless theres a good reason why they need the &quot;better buff.&quot;  <br />
<br />
For raids/groups it changes a lil and all depends on what my role is that day =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You think we got it bad?  Try playing an Enchanter. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Linora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">hmmmm I never seem to have a problem with gem slots<br />
<br />
--top 4 never move--<br />
1-torpor<br />
2-canni<br />
3-slow<br />
4-malo <br />
<br />
--in group situation--<br />
5-group regen<br />
6-bane<br />
7-focus (ok here if the tank is really nice i might swap in speed)<br />
8-group SoW or acumen depending if im inside or out<br />
<br />
--in solo--<br />
5-pox<br />
6-bane<br />
7-gate<br />
8-root<br />
<br />
If an emergency comes up and I need to mem something else if your fast you can do it even while tanking a slowed mob, and sta comes with the bp :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">1. Torpor<br />
2. Canna<br />
3. Regen<br />
4. Slow<br />
5. Misc buff/dot wahtever(usually FOS)<br />
6. same as 5(usually celerity)<br />
7. same as 5(usually root)<br />
8. gate(sometimes VoB)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Skarn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Agonizing over what to fill slots with is one of the things that makes EQ casters great.  The &quot;DAMN - IF I HAD GATE MEMMED...&quot; and &quot;OH MIGOD, SOW JUST DROPPED&quot; are great - you have no one to blame but yourself.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER<br />
<br />
I always thought an item you could mem 1 or 2 spells into would be awesome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">1-sup heal(always.. till I ding 55 in a day or so)<br />
2-root(always.. sometimes switch out for immobilize if Im ccing)<br />
3)cann3(always)<br />
4)Malosi(always)<br />
5)tugur(always)<br />
6)ebolt(solo) random buff(hos,stats etc for groups)<br />
7)plague(solo) random buff(usually regrowth for groups)<br />
8)rage or gate(solo) random buff(usually haste for groups)<br />
<br />
1 or 2 more slots would be divine.. more then that... overkill imo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shalara De'Tan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">What I would like is 10 spell gems (or like others have said, the ability to mem a spell into an item you could hot key) and 12 slots in my hot key box.  (how I ever managed with only 6, I don't know)<br />
<br />
Root (always up)<br />
Malo<br />
Slow (always up)<br />
Group Regen (always up unless I am grouped with a Drood)<br />
Celerity &lt;- I duo with my rogue often<br />
Torpor (always up)<br />
Canna 4 (always up)<br />
Cblast (always up)<br />
<br />
I was hoping that I could free up a slot when I got canna 5, but it just wasn't feasible.  I still need c4 to squeeze out mana between c5 recasts and when I don't have enough health for c5.<br />
<br />
Celerity is switched for any buff I need to cast at any given moment.  Malo is always there on raids, but if I am duoing/grouping someplace it isn't that needed, I might swap it for annul magic or a DoT.<br />
<br />
What I would love is to be able to keep all those 8 spells up at all times, and have a 9th slot just for swapping buffs in and out, and a 10th slot for other 'offensive' spells that might be needed - malosini, cripple, ID, PoI -- whatever is called for.<br />
<br />
That's it!  I am not greedy, just 10!<br />
<br />
And hot keys.. with extra AA skills needing boxes, and as I get more clickety toys, 10 spots just isn't enough anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hail All,<br />
<br />
With all the recent changes adding more spell slots would hardly make that much of a difference. They can always dumb the game down even more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think all casters should get a Gate hotkey at level 30. But I guess I'm just lazy and unskilled. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Keeping tanks happy - JB Arms and hands give strength and dex buffs, which, if you give em nothing else, will keep the whiny tanks quiet - and hot key wm to save time.<br />
