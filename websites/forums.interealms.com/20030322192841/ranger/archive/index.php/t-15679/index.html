<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kishin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">beastlords get spiritual dominion at 64, a 9mana 9hp per tic regen spell.  stacks with everything.  no drawbacks.<br />
<br />
paladins get aura of the crusader at 64, an hp/ac buff with 3 mana per tic regen.  no drawbacks.<br />
<br />
shadowknights get Pact of Hate at 64, a 15 mana per tic regen, with a 32hp per tic drawback.<br />
<br />
rangers get mask of the stalker at 65, a 3 per tic mana regen spell.  and that's all well and good, but druids have been complaining about this spell for a long time now.  the player size increase and magnification make it rather awkward.<br />
<br />
and i can't say i want PotC, because i don't, it's more potent than a hybrid deserves.  but i certainly wouldn' complain about a ranger-only spell with half the potency, like an ac/hp/mana spell, 19/415/3 (natureskin alternative).<br />
<br />
but my question is, how do you think we stack up?  are we in our proper place?  do we deserve to not be annoyed for using our available mana regen?  or am i way off base?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lasalle Stormreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I dunno, I think that having the option to complete the potc earring quest as well as the line of mental clarity AA's gives us enough mana regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rezz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Good point.<br />
<br />
I was pleased we got the spell at all but I did no research at what the other classes received.<br />
<br />
It would be nice to see a slight change to the spell, say, remove the magnification and the size change and increase it to 4 per tic.<br />
<br />
That would put us on par with the other hybrid classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gavving</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's interesting to note that Rangers and Paladins are the only 2 casting classes in the game that do not get some form of self mana regen spell or epic effect at level 60 or less. <br />
<br />
I do think that the increase player size for the mask of the stalker is quite unneeded and in fact a hinderance.  The magnification effect appears to be slight enough to not really make much of a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Gavving, what to clerics have?  Just asking out of curiosity, but I'm not aware of any spell they get that brings mana back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dalgonar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Clerics get a Blessed armor of the Risen (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2509&amp;source=Live) at 58 and an Armor of the Zealot (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3474&amp;source=Live) at 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Drunia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The later levels of the yaulp line also has mana regen on it, though its self only clerics get that to. Its an interesting point though, hard to tell because BSTs for instance use a ton of mana on their spells, so having a huge mana regen spell is good for them, though the fact they can cast it on other people makes it very powerful. As soon as I get 65 and mask of the stalker I'll post something more informed, shouldn't be more then two or three months. :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>timcooper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">mast of the stalker is always the first buff i cast on myself after res, increase in size is nice for archery and magnification is kinda cool. I love this spell makes huge diff when kei fades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Celt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Heh the change in size is non tangible other than height really, the point of view is very sweet however, as things appear farther than they really are, so our peripheral vision is much better.<br />
<br />
It's castable indoors, it stacks with EVERYTHING just about, it lasts forever, and it's gift of brilliance mana regen.  Why on earth anyone would complain about a mana regen spell that druids get at level SIXTY is beyond me, this is BETTER than cabbage folks, it stacks with virtue/focus/protwild, and 9/kazad/focus/protwild.<br />
<br />
It also stacks with the hitpoint regen on natureskin.  <br />
<br />
frostreavers blessing/marvelous visions/9/focus/kazad/protwild/crythunder/naturesprec/soe/stalker/bladecoat/VoQ/SoV/SDominion/eagleye = super no matter how you slice it :)  With stacking like that, there is little wonder why this spell is sooo endgame.  It rules :)  Granted it could give us a bit more mana regen, but frankly, I don't see us getting a better stack with justabouteverything buff manaregen spell than the one we have.<br />
<br />
SK's doesn't stack with VoQ or TQ or KEI, /wave silly pact of hate on raids<br />
<br />
Paladin's doesn't stack with 9.<br />
<br />
Beastlords stacks with a lot of stuff, but they need SDominion :)<br />
<br />
Overall I'd say having more manaregen than a paladin or sk is pretty darn fair on raids, heck we have more potential mana regen than some casters with full raid hitpoint/manaregen buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Relv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It does *not* change your player size, if you are already shrunk, or against a point of reference you can test this.  It's broke but I'm not complaining :).  As Celt mentioned the better peripheral vision is a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>decairn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Mask is a nice spell, it stacks well with other stuff.  Sure the mana regen is not insane, but I'll take 'playing nice with others' stackability over a larger mana gain.  The size/vision changes actually aren't noticable at all if you use it all the time, because then it is totally normal. ;)<br />
<br />
Within a raid I find to really hard to oom once every other classes mana regen bufs are up on me, it has to be a very long fight with sustained nuking/dotting/spot healing to deplete the mana pool.</div></div><hr />
