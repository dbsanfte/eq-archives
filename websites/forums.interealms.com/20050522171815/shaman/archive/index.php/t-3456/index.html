<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Quick Poll - best tradable wrist at level 60. Forget the JBB, I keep that in a bag and swap it in when soloing or when in a group that it makes sense to use it. I am interested in your opinion on AC / Stats, etc. I see 4 real options:<br />
<br />
Bracelet of Sense (AC:12, Wis:15, MR:6, CR:6, FR:6, DR:6, PR:6) <br />
<br />
Bracelet of Fortitude (AC:12, Sta:15, MR:6, CR:6, FR:6, DR:6, PR:6) <br />
<br />
Barbed Rubicite Bracer (AC:13, Wis:5, Int:5, HP:35, Wgt:2.00) <br />
<br />
Matchless Dragonhorn Bracers (AC:15, Wis:12, Chr:8) <br />

Might not be so valuable if you are close to maxing sta when buffed however.</div></div><hr />

Wisdom and hitpoints.  You would only get 10 more hitpoints with the bracelet of fortitude.</div></div><hr />

By far the best tradable bracers one can get. Wear them over my kael quest bracers even.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the smithed armor isnt available, I would say the bracelet of sense and Barbed rubicite.<br />

Opinions on my evaluation that 10 wis and 1 save vs all is worth not having 30 mana / hps?</div></div><hr />

Let's see.  You're deleting the items from the game and then complaining that prices are remaining high.  But, of course, it's the people selling who are jerks.  I'm sensing a disconnect here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Barb shammie cultural amor, is that the imbued northman armor?<br />
<br />
Nope, that's fairly easy to smith.  The nice stuff is Artificer's Ringmail.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Why!@# would you delete the umbral bracers?  The ONLY one I would delete is the cha, since it's so common it's sick, and you can't give it away.  As for the rest, my RL best friend has made well over 300k farming those bracers, and he's given away at least another 300k worth, or used them to help equip friends.  Dont' tell me those bracers are worthless =)</div></div><hr />

I wear bracer of Fortitude as well.  I wore a bracelet of sense for a while before I went hps crazy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd have to say that depends on the rest of the gear you have. If your at 255 unbuffed that extra 10 wis is compleately worthless. If your over 200 wis already thats 60 mana and i would take 30hps 30 mana over 60 mana any day. If your wis is below 200 still then thats 120 mana and thats worth more.<br />
<br />
Personally I'm at 255 wis with c3 up and not far from it unbuffed so I have no interested in the bracer of sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Are the Umbra bracers ALL/ALL or restricted to certain races/classes?<br />
<br />
Any quick info on where they drop, rarity, etc. would be appreciated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gothlips</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Was just about to poke about the smithers in my guild (Dware Mercs), thanks Henora =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Umbral bracers drop off gantru dralkener (named Gantru).  The mini bosses, Tawro and Radir, one everytime.  The tougher bosses Doomshade, Zelnithak, one everytime.  I don't know if rumblecrush drops them.<br />
<br />
all the bracers - one has sta, one str, one agi/dex, one cha, one int, one wis.  All are ac 12, +15 to their respective stat/stats and 6 save all.  They are all/all.<br />
<br />
Gothlips: does DM have any barbarian smiths with skill over 220 or so?  I am still interested in the artificers ringmail belt.  Artificers ringmail can only be crafted by barbs.  I have yet to want to cough up BDs for attempts by smiths at 190-200 skill, as kind as they are to offer to help.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gothlips</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I think our highest Barb smith is only 175, though I could very well be incorrect because I have yet to get the race-specifics of our higher up smiths. Though I do know that our highest smith skill is roughly 246 but he's a tall pasty =/ hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hard to say what's best for you. It depends what point you're at in terms of HP/AC/Wis/Resists. Obviously, you'll want to go with whichever bracer you feel best augments the stat you're currently lacking most in, right?<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm wearing a pair of WW dragon bracers and will likely swap one out for a +15 Sta bracelet when I'm able to do so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Heh - well I was hoping for some consensus, but people are all over the place on this.<br />
<br />
I have a Wolf Callers Bracer for one wrist, and I like it best for the good combination of AC/Hps/Wis. I have a Bracer of Sense in my second wrist slot, but last night we got a Barbed Rubicite Bracer to drop in Cazic Thule.<br />
<br />
I am trying to decide whether I would rather keep the Bracer of Sense, or wear the Barbed Rubicite instead.<br />
<br />
I am thinking that I will swap to the Barbed Rubicite, since that puts me right at 2k hp unbuffed, while leaving my wisdom at 202.<br />
<br />
Besides, I hate wearing anything that a Druid is also able to wear!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Verata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I think I agree with the post that Bracelet of Sense is probably only worth wearing as long as your wis is below 200.  Because of the amount of wis on it, it also allows for the sacrifice of wisdom in other areas for hp/mana <br />
(although thats redundant, we already should have made that sacrifice =)<br />
and not wearing something just because a druid can wear it is.. limiting... they can also wear HP rings.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">barbed rubicate is probably the best, if your sta needs help the the bracer of fortitude is alright.  The other 2 dont really compare imo</div></div><hr />
