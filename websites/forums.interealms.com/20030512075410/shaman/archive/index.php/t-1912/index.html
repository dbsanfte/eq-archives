<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Spraggon-Test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Do one of the bandit camps here with your duo.  The experience here is unbelievably good (probably the best you'll ever see and it will ruin you for other zones where xp is normal) ;)<br />
<br />
Remember there are two bandit camps, the one on the other end of the lake is usually less crowded.  You can invis to the spot and I suggest the ramp above the camp and not below.  Pathing is really good for runners and you have plenty of room to kill them.  Monk can split pulls, tho it can be a pain I noticed.  Of course root and slow and occasionally heal the monk and its all good.<br />
<br />
I recommend this zone to anyone getting frustrated with leveling, you can start here as early as 10th if you can get to the other side by shadeweaver thicket.  (need invis for that)<br />
<br />
10-16 bugs by shadeweaver<br />
16-19 fiends (ugly disease dot they cast, its like rabies on steroids and takes 3 cures to wipe out, or one counteract when you get it)<br />
19-26 bandits</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stilts Stonebender</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have a 19 shammy in PC now. He gets ~1/2 to 3/4 of a blue per Shik Nar. Near 1.25 for a yellow con higher level (ancient or elder?) mushroom.<br />
<br />
There is a nice &quot;loop&quot; north west of the fiend pond at the Hollowshade zone. I have duo'd with my wife (monk) in this area and we leveled very quickly. Hit with slow, poison dot,(or skip it if your partner is well equiped) wait a tick or two then jump in and start tanking. We made 2.5 levels (19, 20 and half of 21) on one KEI... Took another 3 levels to get my skills up though :( <br />
<br />
I've since restarted a different shaman and am following the same pattern.<br />
