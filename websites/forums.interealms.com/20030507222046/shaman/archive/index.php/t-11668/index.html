<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>WalkNot SoSoftly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is anyone else using this?  I love it but dont have the charm slot in mine.  I downloaded the LoY update but dont seem to be able to get the charm box to show up.  Leoice hasnt responded yet if its fixed or not.  Does anyone know if its been fixed? or is it a problem on my end?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Easy enough to fix.<br />
<br />
Just go into you EQ Folder, UI, Default.<br />
<br />
Find a file call EQUI_Inventory then copy and past it into your deep blue one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i use it and the charm slot..and the menu hotbuttons up top are not all there<br />
<br />
havent seen or heard of a fix yet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sorry, I'm slacking... i'll have a fix soon. And actually I'm pretty sure its just a graphic bug, meaning the charm slot is actually there but the graphic isn't. So you should be able to stick in charm in the blank space to the right of the ammo slot.<br />
<br />
Anyways... i'll try to get a fix done either tonight or soonish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hamman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I updated a copy of Blue from EQInterface before LoY came out and have updated it since then.  If you would like, It has all the latest stuff in it and some extra.  You can get it here. (http://mywebpages.comcast.net/mphinz/Blue2-24.zip)<br />
You can see a pic of it here. (http://mywebpages.comcast.net/mphinz/EQ000038.jpg)</div></div><hr />

See my post under A Shaman UI in this topic. I'm using a modded version of Icey Blue that's current with all of the most recent patches. All of the links are in that post.<br />
<br />
Telegar has done all of the fixes needed and the patched version can be found at HERE (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=1436)</div></div><hr />
