<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mohadeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A couple friends and I are looking into killing WW dragons and wondering if we can do it with only one group.<br />
<br />
Warrior (65)<br />
Rogue (65)<br />
Cleric (65)<br />
Monk (65)<br />
Shaman (64)<br />
and fill in class.<br />
<br />
Can we take down dragon's row (not Solk)?  Also the nest dragons?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />

I think you mean WW.  That group could probably do everything but Sontolak.  Harla Dar is annoying because she can charm multiple people.  Anyway, you can ditch your friends.  You can kill most of them by yourself.</div></div><hr />

Anyways, if you search it a bit, a good post were made on the subject, and it included a link to this:<br />
 http://perso.wanadoo.fr/jahislove/WW%20dragons.htm<br />
which should answer most questions =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, you could take out the whole zone, minus Sont, Klan, and maybe a couple of the gfluxing dragons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Coccyx Oracle of Thule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I dunno, depending on who the 6th ends up being, and the gear the group has, I think Klandicar is even doable...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Klandicar would probably be doable if ya can get him slowed asap, and if ya can avoid adds. Add a chanter and the add situation becomes moot. A bard would be good also.</div></div><hr />

If you have a bard friend its alot easier.  Malo(s) to aggro.  Then share aggro with the bard while you slow.   If the bard can hold aggro, you can just keep trying.  Or you can just keep zoning into DN, but thats a pain hehe.</div></div><hr />
