<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I got a new hunting ground.  I loved hunting here and until I hit at least 30, I'm gonna stick around in here with Sherazad.  I enjoyed grouping again with a lot of the KoE family.  Wizard, Magician, Enchanter, Cleric, Shaman, and don't forget, lovable Lenny (Lenonab the Earth Elemental).  That was definitely fun.  Well gonna log back on for some more fun in Neth's Lair, see you there!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thyndrael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have also been to Netherbian Lair, from about 23-28.  Very good xp there and some nice rare drops for lowbies like me :)  Marus Seru is right off there and is a good step to make after you start getting greens in the Lair.  I would avoid Dawnshroud for awhile tho... had some bad experiences there with some SK shrooms!  I'm currently fighting in Stonebrunt mts at level 31, and its pretty empty since everyone else is on the moon. Might be worth checking out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Acutally I switches to Frontier Mountains.  It's very very hard to get a group in Neth's.  Frontier Mountains, heck even level 35's don't mind grouping with me and I still get tons of XP, even moreso that I was in Neth.</div></div><hr />
