<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just happen to be reading the suggested changes thread when this came on the radio, anyone else find this kinda ironic? Below are the lyrics for Make a Move by The Lost Prophets. Pretty sweet song for shaman lol. (Feel free to grey this post if you want)<br />

<br />
Make a Move<br />
<br />
So are we lost or do we know<br />
Which direction we should go<br />
Sit around and wait for someone to take our hands and lead the way<br />
<br />
Cause every day we're getting older<br />
And every day we all get colder<br />
We're sick of waiting for our answers<br />
Our answers<br />
<br />
Wake up, wake up, wake up<br />
Yeah I'm so tired of waiting<br />
Waiting for us to<br />
Wake up, wake up wake up<br />
Yeah I'm so sick of waiting<br />
For us to make a move<br />
<br />
Are we meant to take the bait<br />
Should we sit around and wait<br />
Are we being saved, or was that another lie you made to make us hate<br />
<br />
Cause every day we're getting older<br />
And every day we all get colder<br />
We're sick of waiting for our answers<br />
Our answers<br />
<br />
Wake up, wake up, wake up<br />
Yeah I'm so tired of waiting<br />
Waiting for us to<br />
Wake up, wake up wake up<br />
Yeah I'm so sick of waiting<br />
For us to make a move<br />
<br />
Wake up, wake up, wake up<br />
And we will never lose<br />
Wake up, wake up, wake up<br />
It's time to make a move<br />
Wake up, wake up, wake up<br />
And we will never lose<br />
Wake up, wake up, wake up<br />
It's time to make a move<br />
<br />
It's not enough<br />
To let it work<br />
Where's the truth<br />
It's all wrong<br />
<br />
We're sick of waiting for our answers<br />
Our answers<br />
<br />
Wake up, wake up, wake up<br />
Yeah I'm so tired of waiting<br />
Waiting for us to<br />
Wake up, wake up wake up<br />
Yeah I'm so sick of waiting<br />
For us to make a move<br />
<br />
Wake up, wake up, wake up<br />
And we will never lose<br />
Wake up, wake up, wake up<br />
It's time to make a move<br />
Wake up, wake up, wake up<br />
And we will never lose<br />
Wake up, wake up, wake up<br />
Make a move</div></div><hr />

Actually, I'm pretty sure the Official Shaman Song is<br />
<br />
I think We're Alone Now<br />
(with apologies to the Shondelles)<br />
<br />
Shaman hush now,<br />
That&#8217;s what they say when we&#8217;re complaining.<br />
And watch what you say,<br />
They don&#8217;t understand, and so we&#8217;re<br />
<br />
Grabbin&#8217; straws as fast as we can<br />
Proppin&#8217; up the Vision&#8217;s Master Plan<br />
Tryin&#8217; to help them make things right<br />
And then we make another suggestion<br />
And never get an answer<br />
And then we say,<br />
<br />
I think we&#8217;re alone now,<br />
There doesn&#8217;t seem to be anyone around.<br />
I think we&#8217;re alone now,<br />
The gnashing of our teeth is the only sound.<br />
<br />
We&#8217;ve heard them say<br />
Buffin&#8217;s what we should be doin&#8217;<br />
And no more long fights<br />
&#8216;Cause no one likes &#8216;em, so we&#8217;re <br />
<br />
Grabbin&#8217; straws as fast as we can<br />
Proppin&#8217; up the Vision&#8217;s Master Plan<br />
Tryin&#8217; to help them make things right<br />
And then we make another suggestion<br />
And never get an answer<br />
And then we say,<br />
<br />
I think we&#8217;re alone now,<br />
There doesn&#8217;t seem to be anyone around.<br />
I think we&#8217;re alone now,<br />
The gnashing of our teeth is the only sound.<br />
<br />

 Return To Serenity<br />
<br />
[Music: Peterson]<br />
[Lyrics: Billy, James, Peterson]<br />
<br />
I'm gonna take you<br />
To a place far from here<br />
No one will see us<br />
Watch the pain as it disappears<br />
No time for anger<br />
No time for despair<br />
Won't you come with me<br />
There's a room for us there<br />
This innocent beauty<br />
My words can't describe<br />
This rebirth purity<br />
Brings a sullen tear right to your eyes<br />
No time for anger<br />
No time for despair<br />
Please let me take you<br />
'cause I'm already there<br />
<br />
I'm so alone<br />
My head's my home<br />
I'll return to serenity<br />
<br />
Rhyme without reason is why children cry<br />
They see through the system<br />
That's breeding them just so they die<br />
So please let me take you<br />
And I'll show you the truth<br />
Inside my reality<br />
We shared in youth<br />
<br />
[CHORUS :]<br />
I'm so alone<br />
My head's my home<br />
And I feel<br />
So alone<br />
You know<br />
At last<br />
I'll return to serenity<br />
<br />
Now that I've taken you<br />
To a place far from here<br />
I really must go back<br />
Close your eyes and we'll disappear<br />
Won't you come with me<br />
Salvation we'll share<br />
Inside of my head now<br />
There's a room for us there</div></div><hr />

Greenday - Basket Case Lyrics<br />
 <br />
Do you have the time<br />
to listen to me whine<br />
About NOTHING and EVERYTHING<br />
all at once<br />
I am one of those<br />
Melodramatic fools<br />
Neurotic to the bone<br />
No doubt about it<br />
<br />
Sometimes I give myself the CREEPS<br />
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me<br />
It all keeps adding up<br />
I think I'm CRACKING UP<br />
Am I just PARANOID?<br />
Or am I just STONED<br />
<br />
I went to a shrink<br />
To analyze my dreams<br />
SHE says it's lack of sex<br />
that's bringing me down<br />
I went to a whore<br />
HE said my life's a bore<br />
So quit my whining cause<br />
it's bringing HER down<br />
<br />
Sometimes I give myself the CREEPS<br />
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me<br />
It all keeps adding up<br />
I think I'm CRACKING UP<br />
Am I just PARANOID?<br />
Uh,yuh,yuh,ya<br />
<br />
Grasping to CONTROL<br />
So I BETTER hold on<br />
<br />
Sometimes I give myself the CREEPS<br />
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me<br />
It all keeps adding up<br />
I think I'm CRACKING UP<br />
Am I just PARANOID?<br />
Or am I just STONED</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dogpoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">hehe Tikolo,reminds me of that Southpark episode...<br />

<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">might have helped if I wasnt listening to 'I think I'm alone now' track (well, the wierd Al version - I think I'm a Clone Now) as I started to read this thread... Can you say stereo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dogpoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">hahahaha dude,not suprising in the least</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Shondelles?   They rip off a Tiffany song?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Not to run off on a tangent, but the punk movement of the late 70's has sadly come to an end...where do these new bands get off on calling themselves punk bands??<br />
<br />
Why do we even call these new bands punk?  Because they have spikey hair, tattoos, and a certain style of clothing?  Feel sorry for bands like stiff little fingers, the adverts, buzzcocks, cockney rejects, and art attacks who are lumped into that same category.  Not to mention the bands who made punk what it is (clash, sex pistols, the who, rolling stones, etc)  They had their fingers on the pulses of the world's problems and with intense anger they stuck their middle fingers up at the causes.<br />
<br />
Where's the nihilism and iconoclasm of rock in these new punk bands?  Mest and a few others have a chance, but so many have the label 'punk' and they don't deserve it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">alot of todays &quot;punk&quot; bands are labeled &quot;pop/punk&quot;.. /shrug.. would hate to be labeled pop anything :p sounds too britney-ish</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yeah Wildaar, about 40 years or so ago.  Being uber shaman, they then slowed time for Tiffany so hers didn't get released first.</div></div><hr />
