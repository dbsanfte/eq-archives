<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I often have to go LFG on a raid, either when the raid is first forming or before/after a COH when the raid temporarily breaks up.  I hate getting tells from random people for LDON groups or whatever while the LFG tag is up.<br />
<br />
I played with the LFG window and set some filters, but they didn't seem to work.  Last night I finally figured out why (I was setting the filters and then using /lfg on instead of clicking the LFG ON button).  So since I finally got it right, I thought I'd share.<br />
<br />
Here's the scoop.<br />
<br />
1. Type /lfg to bring up the LFG window (don't use /lfg on).<br />
<br />
2. Click &quot;Additional Filters&quot;<br />
<br />
3. Click &quot;Only include these guilds in my search results&quot;.  Use the ADD button to add your guild or the guilds in your raiding alliance.<br />
<br />
4. Click &quot;Only players who match my posted filters can query me&quot;.<br />
<br />
5. Close the additional filters dialog<br />
<br />
6. Click the LFG ON button on the LFG window.  NOTE: YOU CANNOT SIMPLY CLOSE THE LFG WINDOW AND USE THE /LFG ON.  The filters will not apply if you use /lfg on.<br />
<br />
I tested this last night with my non-guilded trader in the bazaar, and I could not see my character as LFG even though I had the LFG tag on at a raid.</div></div><hr />

why the hell would you go LFG on a raid?<br />
is this a closed guild raid ? or an open naggy/vow type raid ?<br />
if so, doesn't your guild know you enough to invite you by name and not class/lvl ?<br />
i see this alot on drinal with uber guilds, i think its kinda gimpy.<br />
my guild isn't that uber but we can do saryn,tt, and a few other pop raid targets and such, but it always buggs me when i wanna exp grind and need a clr lfg, and i see 9+ clerics lfg in VEX THAL...<br />
my guild has somewhere near 35-45 people on during raid nights, and yet we still seem to invite/know all of our members, is the uber guild heirarchy about being &quot;nameless_leet_player_01&quot; ??<br />

We now do a simpler method. We arrive at the raid destination and then we just group ourselves up. Clerics normally start a group, ask the raid leader for a group leader invite and then...invite the people lfg.<br />
<br />
Of course, we know all our members, but it's a lot easier to do a quick /who lfg and pick up the 5 guildies lfg then to look at the raid window, look at the /who guild list and then try to figure out who is lfg.<br />

<br />
And that has about 0 to do with why people use the lfg on raid. If they know each other personally or not doesn't effect the use of tools provided by the game to form a raid. Personally I've met tons of the people in my guild in RL and we have yearly RL get together yet we still use lfg constantly when setting up raids. As an officer and often the one setting up the groups it's damm handy to be able to do a /who lfg to see who we've got that needs a group. I know our enchanters and other who typically get lots of tells for groups tend to put up an /afk msg like looking for group in raid or some such. A few of them have from time to time listed the numbers of tells they get.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I fail to see your point at all. You are comparing Gloriana's post to mine and making an assumption that her guild is tight knit and I belong to an uber guild that know's no one. Well, I am not here to debate that. I answered your original question and all that seems to have done is give you some kind of ammunition for your lame flame fest.<br />
<br />
Well, I fail to see that Gloriana disclosing that the clerics begin to assemble groups means she knows their birthdays. My guild ensures that any priest class begins forming groups upon arrival. Maybe I should ask everyone I play with for personal information. Hell, I can't even remember some real life friends birthdays....<br />
<br />
Your definition of social seems to differ somewhat than mine. I log on to enjoy playing a game, and I belong to a guild because I want to play the game with other like minded individuals. However, it is a hobby, and while I really enjoy the company of my guildmates I am not looking to meet them in real life, or find my soul mate.<br />
<br />
By the way, I wouldn't assume that Gloriana's post of &quot;of course we all know our members&quot; means anything other than &quot;We know the classes of the members, and group accordingly&quot;.<br />
<br />
You do know what they say about someone who assumes I take it, after all, you clearly win at psychology 101.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ha, I definitely don't know all the birthdays of my 100+ member elemental guild :)  <br />
<br />
We use the /lfg tool to set up raid groups because it's the most efficient method for us, that's all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>zensation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think the /lfg is a useful work around for the trounle of setting up groups in a raid. Not in a guild myself but you sometimes have to work with what eq gives you and this is a good example. The one thing that would make both the people doing ldon (like me) and the raiders happy is put in a comment line about raiding. This prevents random tells from Butcherblock and helps the LDONers quickly eliminate people that they cant use for their group. just the way i see it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Light above, that turned flame-ish right quick, didn't it ...<br />
<br />
We're a tight-knit guild, 100+ members. Most of our guildies I know or have personally spoken to, though we've gotten practically a herd of new ones in the last two weeks that I'm still working with. Do I know their birthdays? Some of them, yep, most of them, nope. When I send new guildies tells about visiting our forum and such, I do make it a point to introduce myself, RL name, and tell them I'm from North Carolina. A lot of us are on a first-name basis. <br />
<br />
Do we use LFG when /raiding? Yep, all the time. In fact, it's getting to be an unspoken requirement to attend an SOTA raid ... no LFG tag = no invite. Why? As someone who organizes A LOT of raids, LFG is a great tool. Seeing those capital letters next to someone's name makes it REAL easy to group up and get organized.  <br />
<br />
Is it impersonal, as Kurth was trying to say? Sure, you could construe it as such. 'Course then again, one can construe nearly anything in nearly any way one wishes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">/lfg is used to let your guildmates know that you are looking for a group. It has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not a guild is tightnit. A 30 people guild use it just like a guild with 200+ members.<br />
<br />
How else are you going to let people know that you are at the raid and lfg? Spam /gu?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tribe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">see what im trying to get at ?<br />
<br />
Not really lol. You’re ranting about big guilds using LFG?<br />
<br />
why the hell would you go LFG on a raid?<br />
<br />
It’s an efficient way to find out who still needs a group. I know a lot of my guildies pretty well. 10-20 of us are on teamspeak (voice chat) during raids. I know what countries / states a lot are from, and on voice chat its obvious who’s from other countries. I can tell you what the last piece of gear a lot of them got or go even further back than that. But how is any of that going to help me know if they need a group???<br />
<br />
Even with 35-45 people I can’t imagine how your raid spontaneously materializes without some communication. Or how people could just show up at a raid, not say anything, and get invited. Some people use ‘/gu lfg’ and that works sometimes. It’s not that practical to have 60 people spamming gu at the start of every raid imo. Or realistic for someone showing up after the raid is going to expect an invite instantly every time from a simple ‘/gu lfg’ There are all kinds of reasons that they might have to hang out a few mins before getting invited, might as well put up an lfg tag. Imo at least.<br />
<br />
I've never tried to limit who can see me when I’m lfg. Might take a look at it now. Tho getting lfg tells is not a huge gripe of mine. For a while now I’ve been using the filters to block seeing LFG people from other guilds that I don’t like from showing up in searches when I’m building groups. Kinda funny when I was on vacation building a group that didn’t have those filters in place. I was like, how the hell did this guy get into my group! lol.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">my guild isn't particularily tight knit.  I mean, people come and they have gone, some have been there for freaking ever and some are brand new, but we use LFG at raids as a grouping tool.  Usually we just have healers invite folks.  Someone starts the /raid and invites all clerics as group leaders who in turn invite everyone else.  <br />
<br />
Course special raiding circumstances need special groups, but these are usually just modifications of the random groups that result from above method.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This has to be the most bizarre thing I've read in a long time. What does this have ANYTHING to do with knowing whether or not someone has a group?<br />
<br />
I don't raid anymore, but when I did, you always went LFG during formation. There's no better way to find this out. Spamming LFG! in a guild or chat channel just makes spam. Turn on LFG, raid leader picks group leaders, group leaders send invites to people LFG, once the raid is formed, you can look at the raid window and do any fine tuning to group composition that might be needed. <br />
<br />
I could tell all of my guildmates apart with names turned off just by looking at them. I could not tell you the real names of a single person in my guild, nevermind irrelevant nonsense like their birthdays.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">We use the highly complex &quot;/gu who lfg?&quot; system.<br />
<br />
I can't even begin to imagine filling an entire raid without using something a little more efficient. It takes long enough to invite the 30 we have, and most of our members are friends irl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">We usually have the healers form up groups too. But you get stragglers, 85'ers, some people are overlooked, afk, etc. Sometimes the raid leader announces groups in raid chat. I usually put lfg up anyway, after all it doesn't hurt anything. I always make sure to put &quot;raid purposes&quot; in my message so people know. I've only gotten one tell since I started doing that, it was from some guy who told me he'd been trying to get invited into a raid that way for 2 weeks, but they always turned him down. :) I can just imagine him sending tells to people waiting for invites asking if he can join the raid.<br />
On the other hand, many people use /lfg and do not give any message. If you are looking to fill an XP group that can be very annoying. I play on a pretty small server, so chances are you know the people and can tell what guild they are in and make the assumption that they are raiding. But it takes so little effort to make a message, why not just take the time to do it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">People actually use the /lfg tool? /who &lt;X class&gt; all &lt;level range&gt; lfg works fine for me.<br />
<br />
I've checked out the LFG tool window a few times, and there have never been more than 2 groups listed looking for members.<br />
<br />
People LFG for raids tend to be in raid zones. Doesn't take too much insight to realize that someone LFG in Ssra is not hoping to join an EC LDoN adventure group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">gotta interject here. LFG tag for raiding is one of my biggest pet peeves, along with using raid say to ask for buffs. <br />
<br />
For some reason, guilds on my server just love to form their raids in Plane of Tranquility. Now, if you go LFG in Plane of Tranquility, what the hell do you think is going to happen? Some people don't use the new LFG tool, so putting a 'raiding' note next to your name is going to do jack.<br />
<br />
 In the past, raid leaders in my guild would create groups and spam the raid channel with the group leaders and who they should invite. This method took a LOT of time.<br />
<br />
This is the system my guild uses now. Now I don't mean to gloat, but I lead raids regularly (or am asked to set up groups) and forming groups is just trivial. First of all, my guild uses a chat channel for all raids, i.e. &quot;aowraid&quot; for an Avatar of War raid. The group-maker does a /list 1 or whatever number that channel is. There - he has a list of all people attending the raid.<br />
<br />
Clerics and druids start all groups. Match shaman with druid preferably, put one shaman in each group for shrink. MT/ST group gets first bard, secondary and tertiary bards group with rangers rogues and wizards. There. You're done.<br />
<br />
LFG tag? what does that do? you're going to hand by hand select each of 50 lfg raiders and put them together? That seems like a far more laborious process, and even MORE laborious would be the process of rearranging and messing with groups after they are made carelessly or selfishly without any coordination, swapping paladins around for group heals or shaman for shrink or bards for DS or SK's around for recourses, confusing and a waste of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I think simply from the number of guilds and raids that use LFG to form up, that it must have some merit for getting things moving quickly and easily. Everybody has their own style for forming raids, my previous guild used LFG all the time and we can get formed and pulling in 15 minutes from raid called. <br />
<br />
Yes I often get 4 or 5 tells when LFG for a raid, a simple, &quot;sorry, raiding&quot; takes care of it. If I have to go AFK briefly it goes in my AFK message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Nice trick Weiss!<br />
<br />
I just can't sympathize with anyone who feels put off by a /lfg tag used in a raid situation when that person never did a /w all to check what frikkin zone their BoT grouping prospect was in.  People /lfg in VT, PoEb, PoA, Sky, Hate, Sleeper's, ToV, Fear, PoW, and Time probably are not looking to camp mini-bosses for Ornate at that very moment. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The group-maker does a /list 1 or whatever number that channel is. There - he has a list of all people attending the raid.<br />
<br />
This presupposes that everyone in the raid joins the channel. Maybe my old guild was just really bad at this, but getting people to do stuff like this (or /consent monks/rogues/necros for dragging after wipes, or asking for buffs, or a bunch of other things), you always end up with several people who are AFK or doing other stuff, or chatting, or whatever, and they don't get into the channel.<br />
<br />
Setting up groups with LFG just always seemed to be most efficient. It's a no-brainer for what to do...don't have a group? Turn on LFG! The raid leader picks group leaders (usually clerics), each of those forms as well balanced a group as they can from the LFGs. If you need specific requirements (say, 5 rangers and a bard), those people tend to already know it and form up their groups accordingly. Making raid groups isn't exactly rocket science. It is pretty rare that 5-6 XP-style groups formed up into a raid won't be able to handle everything perfectly.</div></div><hr />

/em pulls out rant stick...<br />
why the hell would you go LFG on a raid?<br />
is this a closed guild raid ? or an open naggy/vow type raid ?<br />
if so, doesn't your guild know you enough to invite you by name and not class/lvl ? i see this alot on drinal with uber guilds, i think its kinda gimpy.<br />
my guild isn't that uber but we can do saryn,tt, and a few other pop raid targets and such, but it always buggs me when i wanna exp grind and need a clr lfg, and i see 9+ clerics lfg in VEX THAL...<br />
my guild has somewhere near 35-45 people on during raid nights, and yet we still seem to invite/know all of our members, is the uber guild heirarchy about being &quot;nameless_leet_player_01&quot; ??<br />
The /lfg tool is useful for both closed and opened raids as well as just normal grouping, where  I use it to exclude members of a certain guild from my window using the filter.  Sorry you feel its gimpy, but you are entitled to your opinion.  Since I'm not uber, I'll just ignore the 'nameless_leet_player_01' comment.<br />
<br />
I've marked myself &quot;LFA Miragul only&quot; and I still get tells asking for me to come to BoT (ick :mad: ).  Some people use the tools, some use /who all 60 65 shaman.  The latter people won't see my /lfg message because they never used the tools.  That's life.<br />
<br />
When I'm forming a group for LDoN myself, I use /who lfg AND the tools.  I don't ask people in the EP or time to group, and people in questionable zones (like BoT, where people could either be gathering for a Tower/Agnarr raid or actually sitting in the safe room really LFG) I generally ask if they are raiding or if they might like to join my adventure group.<br />
<br />
I don't get upset when people don't use the tools &amp; filters, although the multiple group requests can be annoying at times.  If you use the tools it will reduce but not eliminate this.  I also think there are some people who think they are using the filters but use /lfg on instead of clicking the button so their filter message maybe getting lost.  /shrug. :cool: <br />
<br />
I'm a member of a very small guild (~20 active mains, another ~20 in alts) that is allied with 2 other small guilds.  We typically use /lfg flags to snag the ungrouped, even if we only have 2-3 groups total raiding out of the combination of 3 guilds.  It is a handy tool, efficient and convenient.  Some of our members are not outspoken, and would likely go through an hour or two of raiding ungrouped without complaint.  The LFG tag over their head is sort of obvious though, and it also makes group reorganization for specific purposes much easier.  The person who is moving from one group to another will put /lfg on when they are ready for the re-invite.  This reduces the /invite button spam for the second group leader (since sometimes the person moving has to leave the group and the raid, etc).<br />

Weissblau, thanks for sharing your tip.  Though I don't see it as very practical for my own situation, I could see it as handy for others.<br />

Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">This presupposes that everyone in the raid joins the channel. Maybe my old guild was just really bad at this, but getting people to do stuff like this (or /consent monks/rogues/necros for dragging after wipes, or asking for buffs, or a bunch of other things), you always end up with several people who are AFK or doing other stuff, or chatting, or whatever, and they don't get into the channel.<br />

The channel, for us, is put in the MOTD as soon as the raid is called. Everyone joins at that point. Attendance is taken from the channel as well, so if you aren't in the channel, you aren't at the raid.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I know what class/level everyone in our guild is, with the exception of perhaps a few that have joined in the past couple of weeks.  However, we always go LFG upon arriving at a raid site.   The raid leader gives a raid invite to individuals, usually healers, as raid group leaders, and those individuals are responsible for forming their own BALANCED groups out of the LFG population.  If someone is already grouped, they won't be LFG.  If we're really concerned about group balance the RL may make a few adjustments before engagement by moving individuals around, but most of the time this method produces workable groups for almost zero effort on the part of the raid leader.  <br />
<br />
When we are COH'ing from one location to another during the raid,  we drop raid and go LFG for COH invite.  On the other end, group leaders ask for raid invite to the new raid and then re-invite their groups.  The COH teams can do /who LFG to get the list of people waiting for COH.<br />
<br />
If your guild doesn't use LFG on raids, fine, but there ARE uses for them in large guilds, even when the people do know each other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">yeah, we use /lfg on too whenever we are raiding.  But, forming the raid in the zones that you are raiding in helps alot.  I mean, I have gotten the random tell for someone when I'm sitting in Time asking me if I wanted to join a PoV/BoT group, but i'm pretty nice about saying that i'm in the middle of raiding.<br />
<br />
What was said that is very true, is that when you are dealing with 60+ people at a raid, I'm not going to sit there and click on every damn person to figure out which one not grouped up if they don't have their lfg tag up, nor am I going to search over the raid grouped list figuring it out either.  If you want a group anytime soon, put /lfg up and make a proactive stance at asking someone who the group leaders are that still have room (this is a pet peeve of mine, hate having someone sit there in guild chat saying that they haven't gotten a group in 20 min when they have no clue who might be able to invite them).<br />

I've only been in my guild for approx. 6 months.  As a member of a prob 85+ guild, I can safely say that I know a good % of them, not all personally, but enough where Ihave talked to them on several occasions and I know who theyare.  Some better than others of course.  If you've played in a guild for 2 years and don't know some of the people, and they aren't either very new to the guild or someone that's returned after an extended absence, then something is wrong.</div></div><hr />
