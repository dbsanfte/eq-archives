<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If you have been on any LDoN Raids, please let me know what your experience was.  My guild is somewhat small, but I think we could field the required numbers and levels to do this; however, I'd want to make sure we have a chance to complete it successfully.  Any info on mob levels (comparison to other zones would be great), loot, ideal number of participants, etc. would be most helpful.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

There is 2 types of raids. Raids for those with post vt level gear, and post plane of time lvl gear. If you dont fall into one of those slots break out the lube</div></div><hr />

Ceno, can you point me to where Sony actually said this ?  <br />
<br />
I have searched on this board, and on the official website, and I cannot find any OFFICIAL information.<br />
<br />
My guild is a small guild, in HoT gear, but we can probably pull together enough people to fill the raid. I have read all the raid posts on this boards about Elemental/Time level guilds getting plastered, but I can't find any official info on how the difficulty of the raids varies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Youichi...SOE/Verant have never released anything having to do with difficulty of an encounter, except vague level ranges for expansions.  What Ceno reports is simply what players have reported.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually I think that VT and Time gear statement came from the live chat before LDoN was released. I know in beta only elemental and time people were being picked for raids.</div></div><hr />
