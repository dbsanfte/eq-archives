<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know theres plenty of threads on this but I'm torn after having read alot of em. I'm 62, unguilded with decent gear, 2600 hps unbuffed, 1020 ac, 3500 mana, ft3, mana pres 4, imp heal 4 yada yada yada. I've got the cash to buy Q, and already have malo and can probably get malos if I need it. I've got 1 aa, regen 1 at the moment, and no flags whatsoever. I really want canni 5, but really want Q also. SHould I just get the leveling thing done and then AA? Or should I do some aa then level?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd get Run3, then Level 65, then go for Can5. Bonus that you have cash for Q already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">levels before AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's much faster to level to 65 and then pick up the AAs once you get there.  You can hit high-xp zones like BoT and HoH.<br />
<br />
Level first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Once you get 65 and can scribe Q it will be easier to both solo and/or group your way to Canni V. I 2nd..er...4th the level to 65 first option :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">AA's are the icing on the cake. But you need the cake.<br />
<br />
Blargx (iirc) had a great write-up a few months back and basically he said with the opening of multiple zones there was no reason NOT to level to 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Levels first, 100% into regular xp.  See if you can get a few flags as you level, those are freebie AA points.   You should be able to pick up at least the PoJ trials which will give you 1 AA (put it into Run not regen). I'm not sure on the pick up raid situation on Torvo but you should be able to grab a few other flags here and there to get you a couple AA while you level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dekurgen Heyokah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree, level first. Aa's will go much faster then anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yup yup yup.<br />
<br />
Get level 65, get Quiescence.  Don't stop and get your baron title.  Get level 65 and Q.<br />
<br />
That will make a huge difference in your playing power.<br />
<br />
Only Canni 5 will make a larger difference.  Once you've got a little cushion into 65, turn on the aa, and start chasing that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">1 full yellow into 65 then its 100% aa's<br />
although I did stop at 61 and grab some of the pop aa's as well as run/regen3 I was fighting in tactics where disease root was invaluable and RC/Pet burn were well worth the time to get. Rc to cure those nasty SK dots and Pet burn to eat the 1k+ harm touch they have. <br />
basicly if it makes you more effective then get it fast, the reason I didnt get canV til 65 was because of the shear number of aa's you need to get it. <br />
you have malo, malos isnt much of an upgrade.<br />
Q is a Huge upgrade to torpor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm in the same boat, except I've got Run3 Rgen 3, and mental crapola 3, malo, and torpor. I do a lot of soloing. So I'm going for canni 5 before I go to 65. I got my Run/regen 3, in High Hold back when I was 55.<br />
<br />
I think that Canni 5 will help me level up, as at the moment I can tank mobs and get 3%-5% per kill in about 3 mins with a couple of mins of downtime between kills. So I can get a solo AA in about 3 hours of play time. I think if I level up without canni 5 I'll find it a lot slower as I'll have to go for the root rot approach, and that seems like it will take a lot longer.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm not seing the bigger picture and that there are good places to solo for a 65 shaman. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Trebaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well all the experienced folk above are RIGHT I'm sure, and you should NOT pay attention to me. Personally, however, its worth remembering that this is a VERY wide open game, to which people bring even more wide-openness by being... people. <br />
<br />
So...<br />
<br />
I play from Australia, so often on at the &quot;wrong&quot; time.. so I solo/duo a lot. I usually play in short bursts (one hour or so at a time). No raids for me, I guess. Rather than curl up and give up, I am developing my character to really be effective at each level (56 at the moment). My decision has been to judiciously get AAs (one per level since 51) and apply them where I think it matters most for my play style and the mobs i face. <br />
<br />
Strange as it may seem (and I dont offer this as some 'optimal' choice) I have got run speed 1 only (well SoW is fine, and run 1 helps if you are in a jam with no SoW and oom). I do have all my regen points... HP and regen = manna for the shammy... and you dont get your bearform regen if you want to use a horse. The rest? Actually they are in first aid. Yup.. bandages = manna too. <br />
<br />
good luck in whatever the choice... but optimal solutions are only optimal for optimal players : )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Levels &gt;&gt; AA. Easier to find groups, faster xp, access to higher level zones, less resists on slows, more resists on spells cast at you, better spell line-up. Its all good apart from some easier mobs giving less xp as they turn light blue, but that's more than balanced out by the xp from higher tiers.<br />
<br />
Canni V is a bucketfull of AA points to get from scratch. If you're like Haleice and have MC3 already then sure, go canni V first, but in your position I would run for 65. Quiessence is amazingly good, and you get new DoTs which are a big improvement for soloing.<br />
<br />
@Haleice - Root-rot might sound druidish, but to give you some idea, in tactics I get about 5-6% aa per kill, takes maybe 7 minutes (I don't have bane, which would really knock that right down) per kill. Add in a minute between each mob for pulling, rebuffing etc and you're talking 5-6% every 8 minutes. The bonus is that you're getting SPs, piglet drops and the odd ornate pattern too. If you don't have tactics access, there are a number of thread on PoV golems which suggest you can get decent xp soloing at 65 there too.<br />
<br />
Mind you, get a decent group and you're talking an AA in 45 mins to an hour with a group of 65s in BoT or better yet Tactics. Soloing is no longer the way to go, but if you can't get a group you can still solo for xp at 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Another vote for leveling above AAing.  Everything is easier at 65th including getting AA.<br />
<br />
It doesn't really matter if you solo and get 3-5% per kill solo (especially if your efficiency per kill sucks badly).  65 &gt; AAing before 65.  But hey, everyone should play the game to have fun so if taking far longer to hit 65 and start truly mowing down AA is you thing more power to ya!</div></div><hr />
