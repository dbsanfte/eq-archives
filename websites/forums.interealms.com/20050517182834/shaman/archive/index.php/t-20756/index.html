The non-supporting customer support is not even answering the telephone.<br />
<br />
I find it hard to beleive these folks have ~500000 customers with the way they treat us!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>MurojTruewolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Was on earlier this morning, getting 1001's again right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Silverbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is a work around posted in the support forum at eqlive.  It involves editing EQHOSTS.TXT.<br />
I used it and it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ailith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My problem is getting to the character selection screen, then puter locks up (no mouse, can't hit enter, nothing). Done the complete file check, checked for latest drivers.<br />
Suggestions?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Took me a nap after playing for a few hours (worked last night /yawn) and camped to char select...got up and I had been booted to login, 1001 all the way.....truely craptacular.<br />
FYI Silverbeard the work around on eqlive is a bannable offense, it logs you into the admin server/GM side....not a good way to play nice nice with the GMs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Silverbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Then I will not do it.  Was no info in post at time I read it about being bannabel.  OTOH, this has being going on for days and makes me want a months refund or to end subscription.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Good luck getting a refund...never seen it happen myself.<br />
<br />
My subscription is running out!  Few more weeks at the most...and its not looking like I want to renew it.</div></div><hr />

Uhmm,  I know they don t like it but it really doesn t matter which login server you use. It s just one of the login servers their crappy load balancing setup should send you to afaik. (can t find anything on the EQ Tech forum nm).</div></div><hr />

The fix that is posted on this thread: http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=tech&amp;message.id=19039<br />
tells you to switch the numbers around a tad, changing a 1 to a 3 in most cases (all cases maybe?). According to a few other posts on the tech forum on EQLive, people caught using those server changes in chat were told by GM admins that they should get off it ASAP or face banning.<br />
YMMV of course, but I aint jonesing that bad to go wack around in LDON that I want to risk my account.</div></div><hr />
