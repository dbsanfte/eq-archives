<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jayzan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So how exactly did we get Nerfed?  I heard something to the affect that our Slow draws more Argo now or something.  Seeing that I was offline for about 5 months, when I came back a few weeks ago it was kinda old news about us getting nerfed.  So what exactly did they do to us?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, cancel that, CHA is just as effective as it ever was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I assume they're talking about Slow Mitigation.  A number of (is it PoP only?) mobs will now be only partially effected by slow.  This is either:<br />
<br />
1. A huge nerf to shamans as it decreases the number of mobs we're fully effective against;<br />
2. A benefit to shamans, since otherwise they would have just flagged these mobs unslowable; or<br />
3. A wash since this sort of thing was going to get balanced either with or without mitigation in the game;<br />
<br />
depending on how you look at it.<br />
<br />
I take view #3 -- the encounters are going to be as tough as they want them to be, and if it wasn't racheted up by mitigation, it would've been by some other method, so it doesn't bother me.  Nobody's turning me down for HoH or BoT groups because a lot of the mobs there mitigate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was in Chardok B last night, and I believe that one of the named mobs there mitigated slow.</div></div><hr />

Every named mitigates here.  As far as i have seen all the regular mobs do not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One the first groups I had after I came back was in the Plane of Storms.  I think some of the mobs must have been Mitigated because it said:  &quot;Creature has been somewhat slowed.&quot;  or something like that.  It wasn't the normal message about it yawning.  It didn't seem to make much of a differnce though cuz we slaughtered it.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Maybe you should ask whoever told you we were &quot;nerfed&quot; what they're talking about.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Only other thing that comes to mind is the affliction item &quot;fix&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think a lot of slow aggro issues are due to tanks not holding taunt as well as they should.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">OMG did you guys hear about this new expansion they have coming out called Legacy of Ykesha?!  OMG IT LOOKS SO RAD!!!!11</div></div><hr />

<br />
The ring quest golem doesn't mitigate. As far as I know (we haven't done Kor), he's the only named that does not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I believe what you might be talking about in reference is when they changed slow over to Disease Counters and we all started makeing things really made by stacking so many counters on them.  They corrected the Hate generated by the counters and we are back to where we were before that change.  Now its much easier to cure slowed tanks of SLow with disease cure.  As well you can get rid of Tash with cure poison now too.  Hope that is what you were talking about.</div></div><hr />

The result of this is that resisted slows have way more agro than a slow that landed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">this is true, resisted slows have more hate given to the caster.  However, landed slows mean less hate than ever!  The trick is to land the slows . . . hah!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Aye, just dont get slow resisted, then you will be ok :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Another small fix I noticed to the AE focus:  when used with MP and SH. AE used to only work about half the time when a dot was cast when you had the above affects active in your gear. works now.<br />

Small point, but tash always has been curable with cure poison, not dispell. But the change to slows was nice - you can remove a slow without dispelling buffs.</div></div><hr />
