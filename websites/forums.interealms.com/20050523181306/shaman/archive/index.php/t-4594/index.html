I started out Just a little twinked.  3 pieces of Totemic and wis rings.  But thats not even a twink by today's standards i suppose.<br />
<br />
I am currently broke, thanks to the boots, but is there anything i should sell and replace?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The twink factor is a little obvious when I look at the level of the gear you have here.  This is a great set up for your current level, with a good mixture of AC/WIS and HP's.  I think you'll be able to ride this out till your late 40's before doing major upgrades  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zanaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, i got most of that  stuff by buying and selling in EC.  This is my first character.  An enchanter friend gave me 3 peices of totemic off her twink, and made me some 7 wis rings to get me started.  I spend about a month in EC buying and selling at around lvl 30 (hence my 39 days played) to get most of the stuff.  And I got really lucky in mistmore on the.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice.  Buying and selling is addictive, but a real deterrent to leveling, guess I should be satisfied and go kill stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">looks pretty good so far.<br />
<br />
go and camp yourself a totemic helm and get rid of that othmir fur one though.  it has 4 times as much ac and the same wisdom.</div></div><hr />
