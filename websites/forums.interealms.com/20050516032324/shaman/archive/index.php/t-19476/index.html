Ever seen a forum community say &quot;Yup, everything is perfect and this is how I want it!&quot;?  I sure as **** haven't.  You'll have a few rational people that can really look at a class's situation and make their own unbiased judgement on whether or not that class needs improvement, but the vast majority of people will pretty much always say things suck and their class is crap.</div></div><hr />

You can get a good idea of the status of a class by what they bitch about.  Over on the BL forums, the overall whine level is a lot lower; contrast that with median bitch level at monkly-business.com, and I think you can develop some idea of overall class satisfaction.</div></div><hr />

Beastlords have nothing to bitch about.<br />
Monks have already done all the bitching a class possibly can, so they are pretty much out of steam.  I doubt they can do anything that can phase those that were lvl 60 monks at the time of the mitigation nerf.<br />
<br />
Basically, I think people are just all worked up over GoD.  Shamans are exactly the same now as they were two months ago, but the bitch level has gone through the roof.</div></div><hr />

A lot of the fun in this game is about anticipation. Whether it's wondering what will be up on a raid night, or wondering what a mob might drop...<br />
<br />
At the moment, we as a community are anticipating what GoD will do for us. And instead of being optimistic, we are, due to a list of expansions where we have been (rightly or wrongly) overlooked and left behind, feeling pessimistic.<br />
<br />
In fact, I would go so far as to say that I am looking forward to GoD the same way as I look forward to going to the dentist. A necessary evil.<br />
<br />
But then, my consumerism kicked in, and I just thought &quot;No, I am not spending ANY amount of money, no matter how small, on something that does nothing for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then I began to seriously think about quitting. For me, the fun has gone to a large extent. At the moment, my EQ future is uncertain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">yes ours are diffinately the worst aa, but  alot of other class seem getting bad aa and spells aswell (cept druids and cleric which seem ok to me)<br />
<br />
as for the who agrees everything right, your are correct nobody sees thing as total correct but least with pop i wanted to get it and it did a good amount right. GoD is doing hardly anything right.<br />
<br />
and i think most of the talk here is the fact shaman are the same pretty much as they where in kunark and then lulcin for aa , most additions since then are just basic u/g to spells we had. and healing hasnt  changed atall. most other classes atleast got new spell lines and ablilties that where really helpful.</div></div><hr />

if you are in beta you would realize that GoD will be challengeing  no like loy was LoY was a joke expansion  GOD ISNT   just cause the **** you see mined from lucy means your not gonna buy it ??????    hahaha some of you gotta kick the **** you see off to the curb and look at the content of the expansion  i can care less about the spells /aa's im fine with what we got.  not saying that i dont agree that the spells so far are pure ass  but giveit time..... youl break down and buy it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">GOD IS NOT ABOUT SPELLS OR AA.<br />
<br />
There, I think that is the key point that sometimes gets lost.  <br />
<br />
GoD appears to be all about content.  20 new zones for higher level raiders, 10 of which are instanced and 10 of which are not.  <br />
<br />
The key for GoD will be whether the content is visually striking, fun, interesting or something else.  <br />
<br />
The second key for GoD will be itemization.  Always a tough balancing act, it's one SOE did a wretched job with in PoP.  <br />
<br />
At this point, there's not a good idea how it will play out.  This is not going to an expansion like Kunark or PoP where levels were raised and spell design was huge.  It will be more like Velious, which added significant content and a decent storyline, or Luclin which added huge content but with a lot of ugly and not terribly fun zones.  <br />
<br />
Bear in mind that while Velious is now widely hailed as the pinnacle of EQ, when it first came out I was more disappointed with Velious than any other expansion.  It had a lot of big problems, and it took a lot of patching and tinkering over the span of several months before Velious settled down into a terrific expansion.  <br />
<br />
This is not a science, although LDoN is an attempt at game design by accountants and code-monkeys, it's an art and skill.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I'd be psyched if they just fixed the dumbass character animations. Watch a barbarian warrior animation in old graphics, and compare it to the animation in the new graphics.  It's amazing how nice and fluid the old one is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Murphy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">They are charging $30 for GoD. Not $19.95. <br />
Considering EQ2 will be around $50, that $30 seems excessive to me.<br />
I don’t believe for a second that the development effort put into GoD would approach EQ2 to a 3/5 ratio.<br />
<br />
I’m willing to bet EQ2 will go into beta very shortly after GoD is released. May feel like a wasted $30 for many then.</div></div><hr />

Ok all, feel free to go back to bitching about GoD.  (Don't get me wrong, I am upset about the expansion and SONY programming, in general also.  And I will not be buying it either).</div></div><hr />

There I said it.  I'm excited about our new AAs.  I'm excited about our new slow spell (and canni if it goes live).  I've been having alot of fun in GoD beta.  Hell, I have fun in every place that I've ever been to before, because well, I wouldn't play the game if it wasn't fun for me. <br />
<br />
GoD will be fun for me.  It's not a pure raiding expansion, but at least from the beginning of it, you are going to be able to get yourself flagged for other zones in one group encounters.  I don't know how far, but at least at the beginning you will be able to.<br />
<br />
ONE MORE TIME.  GOD IS FUN.  I LOVE GOD.  I&quot;M VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO IT FINALLY GOING LIVE SO THAT I CAN GET MY NEW AAS AND START FINDOUT OUT STUFF AND EXPERIENCING NEW CONTENT.</div></div><hr />

Cuz WoW is the be all and end all of games, i've heard it will also shine your shoes and make your bed for you in the morning</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I've been having alot of fun in GoD beta. <br />
<br />
I bet this is breaking at least some part of the NDA.<br />
<br />
And Vals the point is not if EQ is fun with or without GoD for me.<br />
EQ is long past the stage I actually enjoyed the game for the game, I enjoy the friends I have made and with whom I group, I enjoy the chats and discussions while grinding, I enjoy the silly small talk during raids but no i no longer enjoy the game for the content.<br />
<br />
And to be honest I don't think EQ can ever be fun for me again, To many details are missing for that, to many bugs when new expansions are shipped, to many unfinished stuff (remember rathe,VT,ToV and VP?) when they push the expansion, No new toys only a few copy/pasted Spells and abilities.<br />
<br />
I will be around (at least as long as the friends are around) but no I do not look forward to GoD, not in a way I look forward to WoW or Warhammer online.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">thank god i didnt get into beta.. it seem SoE thoise sneaky poeple put some sort of brain washing into it to make poeple think that GoD is actually ok when it obviously isnt:) (yes i waiting till it somes out but i not holding my breath)<br />
<br />
good point stygiana, if the endless exp drag that everquest is was all there was, i would have quite long ago. if fact the main reason i still play my shaman is my guild and the stuff i do with guild, raids and chats.<br />
course cool new spells and ablilities also help:) why poeple think that alittle extra content that makes things harder by just nerfing what you can use to do various encounters baffles me. i want to see real invention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">let's be honest here .. i'd dare say that none of us play eq because we like playing eq in a vacuum.  most of us started the game because we had friends that played.  most of us buy expansions because it's more stuff to do with friends you know in game.<br />
<br />
I can't think of anyone I know that would play the game because they just liked playing it so the point you are making is pretty weak.<br />
<br />
The game continues to provide more stuff for groups of people to do together.  It's all it's been doing for the most of us for the past 5 years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I'm curious how many people are in here saying they hate GoD.. yet are not even in beta.  You really can't say that you hate something until you've seen it, or experienced it.  Unless you are mad that you didn't get your way, which it seems like that's why you may think that you dislike something without even really understanding it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kirisula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I know there are issues with the Shaman class that have been discussed heavily here, but when did expansions stop being about the content? So much is being made of the spells and AAs, and rightfully so, but I've noticed this time around that the meat of the expansion is being completely ignored. The expansion is being judged on a very small portion of it.<br />
<br />
To me isn't that what the expansion is about? Ultimately that's what I want; more interesting zones to adventure in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">well yes an no, if it is was just about new content them yheska wouldnt have been the horrible thing it was, it gave new content, but very leittle esle (yes mapping dyes etc but that shouldnt have been expansion that should have been free)  but who wanted it?<br />
<br />
you want a nice balance of content and features such as aa,spells, skills and items. getting  1/2  that badly wrong (features) means that my faith in the content isnt high either.</div></div><hr />

10 Normal zones ... ok<br />
10 Instanced zones ... /shiver<br />
<br />
If it's 10 zones instanced like LDoN... great<br />
<br />
But if these 10 zones are instanced like Time... Ouchie!!!<br />
<br />
Nobody will be able to leapfrog you, sure and that's great... but, if one instance is already active, so you aren't allowed to zone in... like Time.</div></div><hr />
