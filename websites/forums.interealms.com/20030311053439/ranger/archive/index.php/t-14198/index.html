<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gilarn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all, <br />
<br />
I desperately need an advice on this:<br />
<br />
My friend, Paladin, and me, Ranger, went to do MQ of Swirling Sphere of Color. Both were dubious, plan was that friend will give a PoA gem and I then Dwarven Smiths Hammer. Then I should have received Hammer of Ancients. <br />
<br />
Problem was, that when friend gave in PoA gem, we got the message <br />
<br />
&quot;Mairee Silentone holds the sphere and makes intricate marks and patterns on it, eventually turning the entire crystal clear.  She rolls it across the hammer, raising a ringing sound in the room.  'There.  Now take the hammer back to Kinlo.  He'll know what to do from here.  Good luck to you, Yandar.'&quot;<br />
<br />
and he got Hammer of Ancients himself.<br />
<br />
Then I turned in my Dwarwen smiths hammer, and didnt get anything. Apparently someone did give Mairee hammer and that`s why my friend received Hammer of Ancients just after handing PoA gem in.<br />
<br />
1. I did petition this, but i suppose I won`t get any help from GM`s.<br />
2. Question is, if Paladin friend can hand in Hammer to Kinlo a make Usbak the Old to spawn. If he can, he will receive mitril ore. <br />
3. If Usbak spawns, I`ll try to hand him ancient longsword. Any1 knows, if it works since he will get spawn by Paladin, not me? On the other hand, he despawns after giving me sword back, so no ranger can do this 2 times at once, so it *should* work. This would give me Swiftwind. <br />
4. If paladin friend hands mitril to Kinlo, he will got mitril blade, which, and that might work as well, might be MQ with POH gem I`ll have to personally get.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any experience with this? Looks to me that it might work, but, however, if not, I will loose Ancient Longsword when I give it to Usbak (If he spawns). <br />
Also, If MQ of POH stone will get messed as well, my friend Paladin will be probably the first paladin  ever wearing EarthCaller.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any info you can spare, We`ll do turn in tomorrow at 8 GMT. <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Gilarn</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go to Kaladim and attempt what you said. Hopefully you should be able to get the blade you need to turn in later, to Telin DF, for swifty.<br />
<br />
And as you said, you will need to loot the SEoC yourself. IMO you know what to do, and there are no other options. Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">GM's don't help with busted MQ's<br />
<br />
<br />
and i wouldn't risk losing a Shattered Emerald of corruption... it would prob be easiest to redo the forageing/hole part of your epic...<br />
<br />
you shouldn't have lost your jade reaver part in the busted MQ, if you even have it done yet, kind of stinks about losing the PoA stone but i'm sure you can find someone else with it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>hebuorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">if you really trust  the pally then  just continue your quest and MQ with him like you said ... just be sure to not screw things since you will lose much harder part to get ...<br />
if you dont whant to take the risk or dont trust the pally redo the forage and hole part much safer .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gilarn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">All, <br />
<br />
It should be noted that it worked and I`m now proud wearer of a swiftwind!!<br />
<br />
Also, my paladin friend now has mitril blade from kinlo, so hopefully, once I loot  SEoC from PoH, we`ll it MQ for earthy.<br />
<br />
Thanks all for support</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Feeldary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">really annoying when people hand only a part of a quest to a NPC, there should be a timer on these given items.<br />
<br />
i remember once buying a mq of kael armor for my druid, the seller handed the armor piece first, and he got the reward armor booh! whats a warrior doing with kael druid armor ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kirillian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This exact thing happened to a friend of mine.  Ultimately, she did what you did, ending up with Swiftwind and the friend had the Mithril Blade to MQ hopefully at at later date.  Then the friend quit EQ.  I did a little research and found that gettin the Mithril Blade again is actually very easy.  No foraging, no Jade Reaver, no VSR.   Just do the Shiny Tin Bowl and Jaeil to get the Hammer again.  You will need another SSoC from PoA though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>farmatyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would recommend redoing the hammer. You can probably get a druid who has done epic ot MQ the bowl to spawn Jaeil. My reasoning is that it's easy enough to get the hammer back, the SSOC is easy to get, so it isn't worth risking a Jade Reaver, and later, a SEOC, on MQs when you can redo that part.</div></div><hr />
