<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ppantherfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all<br />
<br />
I am spending alot of time XPing in WoS and was wondering if anyone has a link or know where i can find a concise list of the named mobs for WoS. <br />
<br />
And maybe how to spawn them and what they drop.<br />
It's asking alot i know, but i am sure it is out there somewhere.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ppantherfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Was hoping for a better list then was available at EQ Bestiary.<br />
<br />
Something along the line of these are the common named pops.<br />
And these are the Raid only mobs to be carefull of.<br />
<br />
But i'll have a scratch around EQ Bestiary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Try this link (http://www.tcr-guild.com/darkwind/).<br />
<br />
Select the expansion that you want on the top of the page, then the zone you are interested in.  List of mob names and drops.  It doesnt include spawn times, but you cant have everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mahes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I can't recall the exact names, but in regards to which are raid mobs:<br />
<br />
Cipheron is for the Enchanter 2.0.  Usually pops a chest if you have an enchanter on this step of the quest to loot the piece.  Otherwise nada.<br />
The red con Girplan on the east wall is for Wizard 1.5.  Don't think we've ever seen loot off him.<br />
<br />
Velkitoran, or whatever is a medium raid mob.<br />
The Murkglider Hivequeen is a medium raid.<br />
The Redwing lady is a medium raid.<br />
Hulcor is probably the hardest of the actual raid-loot mobs.<br />
All of the above generally drop 1 loot item and 2 runes of the 69/70 variety.<br />
<br />
And there's a named Dragorn in the NW corner that's a red con, but we've never caught him up to see if he's a raid mob or not.<br />
<br />
The rest are one group mobs, depending on how good your group is.<br />
<br />
Sorry if I butchered any names, don't go there much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sustenon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shadowhunter is a 3 group mob, and he goes down faster than a hooker on dollar day. Dragorn Champion I hear is a raid mob. Common named are easily 1 groupable and usually have a ph. I have seen them spawn 1 right after another, so it is probably random. Got Murimite Chainmail off Velk the other night, he was kinda tough but not too bad. Hope this helps some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shadowhunter usually goes down to 2 groups when I've seen him. Champion is a hard single-group or fairly easy 2-group mob if you have a solid tank and a cleric plus backup healing (we killed him with 8 last weekend) but he's not worth killing cause he doesn't drop loot--he's an epic mob. <br />
<br />
Red wing lady mentioned above is Pyrique, IIRC. She's a really interesting fight, but definitely raid material--she spawns 5 or 6 adds you have to tank or at least off-tank.<br />
<br />
The raid-level Girplan is Guardian. Taskmaster and the other XXXmasters or whatever they are called are loot mobs.<br />
<br />
Couple of other raid-level mobs there too, but I'm forgetting names at the moment.<br />
