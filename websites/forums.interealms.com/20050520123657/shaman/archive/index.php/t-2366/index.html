<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wanted to say thanks...<br />
<br />
I came into EQ and decided on Shaman. I've already met some really nice people in game, and wanted to thank them.<br />
<br />
Barax, Malaak, Krygor...You 3 helped me immensely!<br />
<br />
Their generosity has helped me understand the sense of community that exists w/in EQ, and why/how it exists. <br />
<br />
It's not just the generosity, it's the general willingness to explain a few things to a new guy out there trying to figure things out.<br />
<br />
I'm level 10 now...until level 6 it showed this:<br />
<br />
You say &quot;bow&quot;.<br />
You say &quot;smile&quot;.<br />
<br />
They took the time to explain how to put a friends list together, to put &quot;/&quot; in front of bow and smile, and the general stuff that people need in this game.<br />
<br />
Look at the guide that came with the game?<br />
I got the free DL in my email and decided to try it out...no guide, no maps.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks from the New guy...it's not much now, but one day I'll be able to repay the favor, if not to Barax, Malaak, Krygor, then to a new Shaman...Hopefully someone that is brand new to the EQ world.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wow, a real new person to the game!<br />
<br />
Enjoy this time, explore!  They did some great stuff in game...I still remember the first time I saw the sun setting over the North Karana bridge or the first looming spires of a Wizard ring, seeing the wonderful city of Kelethin, falling out of Kelethin...  Your first lev, the first time you meet a person in wolf form, the first time you GET wolf form, finding out that the bear head hat isn't a really special high level hat but just plain old leather...Finding an ancient tarnished coin in a fountain and thinking you've found something worth a lot of money!<br />
<br />
First giant.  First specter.  First time you approach the tunnel in EC and being amazed by the number of people (and the lag!)  Riding the boat!  Wondering what &quot;crack&quot; is and why people want it.  People being chased by little floating shields.<br />
<br />
Autoattacking a guard.  Autoattacking a guildmaster.  Autoattacking a vendor.  Some friendly person showing you how to remap your auto attack key, going overboard and remapping nearly all the keys (anyone else have R as the jump button? heh, didn't think so!)<br />
<br />
Hotkeys.  Chat colors.  Assist.  Using F keys to target your group mates.  Not knowing you have to put a point in med, forgetting to put a point into dodge.  The wonder of infravision.  The joy of ultravision.  Watching monks do this weird thing where they punch the air for no reason.  Watching monks fall on the ground.  Seeing a drum equipped bard zooooom by you, throwing pink sparks in every direction.<br />
<br />
Marveling at the names of the monsters.  Quillmane.  Crookstinger.  Grizzleknot.  Lockjaw. Running from Lockjaw. Seeing a gelatinous cube for the first time.  Following a faerie through Gfay just because you like the sound of the bells.<br />
<br />
I would tell you more, but it will be better when you find it for yourself.  I've been playing for 3 years, and there are still mysteries to be discovered...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hehe I noticed one thing in your post Gloriana<br />
<br />
'Forgetting to pot a point in Dodge'<br />
<br />
At level 51 i returned to Grobb to discover i had no points in Dodge, and no points in Channeling...<br />
<br />
<br />
And &lt;hugs&gt; to the new guy, a lot of great things for you out there to discover!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">LOL Urdegish !<br />
I think it only took me two levels to put a point in dodge, and I was looking forward to my first point in channeling.  of course, I learned that heere on the crucible ...<br />
<br />
so thanks from Baz to many who have posted here over time  8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Good luck with the game Twobrew, its an overwhelming experience that you can totally immerse yourself in.<br />
<br />
Good post Gloriana, brings a smile to my face remembering how the game was 'a long time ago'... back when everything was mysterious, dangerous and unknown. The first levels were perhaps the most frustrating, but also the most fun. Just having gotten used to your newbie zone and the two or three adjacent ones, and having no clue whatsoever what lay beyond them or how big the world was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was totally new to EQ 4 months ago, and was also lucky enough to hook up with a group of others that had game experience and were starting characters at the same time. Being cautious by nature, I stayed up in Everfrost until I made level 14 and got Bind Affinity, then made my way out into the world, being the last of the group to do so. To this day whenever I find myself in East Antonica, I make the time to spend a dawn to sunset just sitting and fishing with the Barbarians in the fishing village in North Ro, watching the beauty of the sunrise and that huge moon coming up in the purple darkennig sky. Until I got there, I'd never noticed the complex detail in the world we all love, and it still takes my breath away. <br />
<br />
I wish you well<br />

Wow, a real new person to the game!<br />
<br />
<br />
so true...<br />
<br />
I cant remember how long it has been since ive seen a non-twink on Saryrn...All that you see in newbie grounds nowadays is uberly twinked alts w/ lammys and fungis running around</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeh i know what you mean.... 6 lvl 16 monks in fungis with Knuckle dusters and CC handwraps pulling and killing giants from the FM fort :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">OMG...I was just thinking about this last night!<br />
<br />
I remember my first  char as a level 5 monk when I decided to see more of the world after the FP newbie garden.  I remember the sweat pouring off me as I carefully hugged the zone wall (as a high-level 15 ranger had told me) from EC..through WC, and all the way to Rivervale.  <br />
<br />
I remember looking down from the zone wall and seeing camps of orcs (all red to me), I saw my first griffin that day, and the occasionally skilled and uber person running around in that dangerous pit of evil.  I spent 7 or 8 levels in Misty as the only Monk in the area..wondering where everyone else was.  I was special..the world was magical.<br />
<br />
I remembered all this today when I came back to my computer after going AFK in WC on the zone wall for 2 hours..my pet had cleared any wandering trash..and I was just sitting there.  I wonder what kind of scary monster I must have looked to the newest newbie crawling their way across a dangerous world..</div></div><hr />
