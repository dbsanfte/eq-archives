<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The other day I won the roll on the Emerald Dragon Scale that dropped off big, bad Wuoshi (not that bad with a level 65 bard)<br />
<br />
I have the Ulthork tusks, and all I need to complete the Emerald Dragon scale tunic quest is the player made breastplate.<br />
<br />
But. I got one major question:<br />
<br />
I currently have an Iksar Regen chestplate. Once I get the Emerald Tunic, do the stats make it worthwhile to swap the iksar out? I do I just give it to my cleric?<br />
<br />
Any advice would be welcome, on this as well as getting the player made breastplate.<br />
<br />
By the way, I am nearly lvl 54.<br />
<br />
The stats on the Tunic are: Emerald Dragonscale Tunic<br />
MAGIC ITEM<br />
Slot: CHEST<br />
AC: 22   WT: 2.5<br />
CHA+10  WIS+20  SV DISEASE+10  SV MAGIC+10  <br />
Class: WAR CLR PAL RNG SHD BRD ROG SHM <br />
Race: ALL  <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">And by the way, I got a feeling what most people are gonna say<br />
<br />
Regen&gt;Wis.<br />
<br />
But does the +20 WIS that I'm getting compensate for the couple of more hp per tick that I'm gonna be losing?<br />
<br />
To me, this is a damn diffucult choice:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Low 50s clerics wear this for the Wis. The loud green color screams &quot;I need a new BP&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I rate the EDT fairly low and think that it is overpriced for the benifit it gives a shaman.  The only thing it has going for it is the 20 wis wich would be ok for trade skilling but no way would I equip this over an iksar bp.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the price is high because of the demand from clerics?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmmm if I had the EDT I would probably swap in and out depending on the situation.<br />
<br />
If I had KEI and didn't need to canni often, I'd use the EDT.<br />
<br />
If I am always low mana and need to canni often, the iksar BP is like FT3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i'd keep the regen bp. if you have the scale make the bp and sell it.<br />
really , the 20 wis isn't gonna do you as much good in the long run. It might be debatable to swap out at 54..I'd still go regen bp though, I used mine til i got my SS bp , which I will probably wear until i get a vindi bp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd give it to your cleric or sell it towards Fungi/Torpor fund.<br />
<br />
Grats on the roll though! :)</div></div><hr />

Here's my advice.  SELL it NOW.  Do not wait, do not pass go.  Go to the bazaar and put it up for sale.  I had one a few months ago, and wore it for about a month or so.  <br />
<br />
I was very happy with it as it was an upgrade over the Hate BP I had at the time.  I sold mine for cash and along with selling my Bane Warding Shield I was able to buy an OoIV and have some cash left over to buy spells.  I put the Hate BP back on for about a week or so, and then went to a Night Terror Chain Tunic.<br />
<br />
The new smithed PoP BP's are dropping in price rapidly (and the Tae Ew BP) and are much better for you anyway.<br />
<br />
Sell the Iksar Regen BP AND the Emerald Dragonscale Tunic.  Depreciation on the EDT is happening rapidly, but you can likely still find a cleric who will want it for the pure wisdom (and MR) willing to pay a good amount for it.  The Ikky is a popular BP that has held its value, and you can likely sell it for what you paid for it.<br />
<br />
I recommend you buy the Polished Tin Mail Shirt (from PoI) or even the Engraved Royal Velium Field Plate BP.  Either are decent enough for interim wear for you, and you'll likely come out with more cash for other purchases as well.<br />
<br />
SO, order a fine steel BP from a smith, make the EDT, and then sell it asap.  Sell your Iksar once you find a replacement BP.  The regen effect isn't that significant on the Ikky.  If you have enough cash, a Fungi would serve you well until you hit 60 and get Torpor, if you can find one to buy.  BUT, you won't have enough cash to do that merely from selling your Ikky and EDT alone.<br />
<br />
If you are on a mature server, you'll see the Night Terror Chain or the Tae Ewe Chain BP for sale for only a few kpp more than you can sell the EDT for.  Selling the EDT and the Ikky could put you in a 40ac (or more) BP with good stats, which is a significant upgrade for you.<br />
<br />
That's my advice.  Take it or leave it. :)<br />
<br />
Good luck,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shizbiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Make sure go get some gebs to with it if you decide to wear it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">EDT is a fine BP if you can't get one of the new PoP smithed ones or have not got a velious BP yet.<br />
<br />
As for EDT over Iksar BP...matter of taste...do you want to be glowing green...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grayskies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I won one of these at a Woushi kill and decided to replace my Iksar Regen BP with it. I looked like such a complete idiot running around glowing green that I swapped it out for a PoH BP that was going to rot.<br />
<br />
The PoH BP wasn't an upgrade, but I wanted that damn thing off my chest so bad.<br />
<br />
Don't make the same mistake I did. :)</div></div><hr />
