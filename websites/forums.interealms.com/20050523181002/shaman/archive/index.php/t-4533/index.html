<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kudamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I won't buy an item at inflated prices on principle. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Oooh, thanks for that heads up.  Them are very nice!  I'll trade 4 AC (raw) for 40 hp and 20 mana in a heartbeat!  I was just about to go buy some Artificer's Ringmail Gloves (AC 12, Dex 5, Wis 5, HP/Mana 25) to replace my Spirit Caller's Gauntlets, but those are better and cheaper.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm... coldain skin still wins in the HP category (by 7hp) at 60... even tho these have nice mana...<br />
<br />
Looks like ALL of the Shissar Scale stuff is SHM useable now. Including the BP .... which is ok for midlevel shm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hah, when I first spotted these in an auction I arranged to buy some as i already had a shissar BP which already was shaman useable, the seller kindly told me that I couldnt wear them and I remember thinking, what? these have shaman written all over them!<br />
<br />
Nice change. Now, if only there were more legs at this level, seems we got lots of gloves to choose from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Didn't realize they'd been changed recently. A druid friend of mine soloed a pair out of the grey and they made a worthy replacement for my totemic gauntlets (which have +5 int, go figure). They're a dark green color, doesn't really go with the totemic / Jaundiced color but the stats are good enough to over-rule fashion.<br />
<br />
Wisdom and AC, ah, how nice.</div></div><hr />

Thats assume you aren't sta cap when buffed out.<br />
<br />
I'll have to pick up a pair of these then. Always was one of those peices where I said great stats too bad no one who would actually wear them can wear them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">anyone remember what drops these?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Named snakes outside the temple in The Grey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Cool - 1 more ac and 5 more HP than my planar gloves ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The headband is kinda nice too, if a bit low on the AC, but again more raw HP... anyone know if it has a graphic?  Circlet of Vallon's graphic is kinda lame. :p  I would't mind putting it in the Resist bag.<br />
<br />
Shissar Scale Headband: 12ac 15agi (how much AC is this?) 15svpois 25hp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Laramil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'll have to make a trip up The Grey for a pair of these.  Would be a nice replacement for what I have now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Shissar Scale Headband has the &quot;no graphic&quot; graphic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Replaced my Kael quest gaunts last night with these, +40 hp and +20 mana.  I'm already wis capped unbuffed, so that didn't help me, but it would have before I got my shield.  Lost 6 AC (adjusted, 4 raw).  Very nice upgrade, and I paid 950 plat.  Compared to 10-15k for Artificer's Chain Gauntlets, I'm very happy.  :)</div></div><hr />
