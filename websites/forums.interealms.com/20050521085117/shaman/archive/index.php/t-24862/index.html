<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thyrm Jarlson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For roleplay purposes. I thought I had seen something on the web before giving the average lifespan for each race, but I couldn't find it again. I am curious to see how many generations each race has gone through in the 500 years separating EQ &amp; EQ2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Theres is a table in the EQ rpg book with that exact information as someone posted above. A few weeks ago someone posted the max ages on the gucomics board.<br />
<br />
Barbarians: 70-106 years<br />
Dark Elf: 375-450 years<br />
Dwarf: 250-350 years<br />
Erudite: 90-138 years<br />
Gnome: 200-350 years<br />
Halfing: 100-200 years<br />
Half Elf: 110-170 years<br />
High Elf: 350-450 years<br />
Human: 75- 105 years<br />
Iksar: 100-160 years<br />
Ogre: 60-80 years<br />
Troll: 65-89 years<br />
Vah Shir: 100-120 years<br />
Wood Elf: 300-400 years <br />
<br />
Those would be the oldest as in I think Vah Shir is something like 100 + 5d4 years for max age. Don't have the books at work though to look it up.</div></div><hr />

Why they always leave the frogs out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Can someone explain why Humans always have the next to shortest lifespan?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Can someone explain why Humans always have the next to shortest lifespan?<br />
Because of fantasy stereotypes and because some people think they need to have realism in a fantasy game.<br />
<br />
Tolkien's Elves essentially lived forever. Thus 99% of all elves in all games live much longer then humans. And after all, all fantasy games need elves, right?<br />
<br />
Humans live for 60 to 100 years in most games, because we can't have them living longer then real humans do, because that would be unrealistic (in a game where I can shoot fire out of my hands, mind). Why next to no games have humans living 30 to 50 years, which is much more realistic given the living conditions in most games, I cannot say.<br />
<br />
Then you get orcs and ogres and trolls and the likes. If someone bothered to include them at all they will have shorter lifespans. Because, you know, they are like, dumb. And Neanderthals are dumb. And Neanderthals lived for less then humans live now.<br />
<br />
It is sad but next to every game has long-lived, wise, pointy-eared bow-toting elves, grumpy, axe-wielding, smithy-loving dwarfs, middle-of-the-line humans, dumb, strong orcs that die early and sneaky, agile prankster halflings.<br />
<br />
If you want to get rid of this you will have to look for some of the more creative pen &amp; paper RPGs or else design your own campaign setting. (I love the goblin empire I set up in mine. Nothing like a highly organised goblin army to make the players go &quot;huh?&quot;.)<br />
<br />
As for seeing something different then the above in a computer game, you will probably be out of luck for years to come. Companies design for the crowd and the crowd's initial reaction to new approaches always seems to be &quot;hey, why can other races shoot a bow better then my elf?&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Maybe fantasy stereotypes are based on mythopoetic archetypes.<br />
<br />
Or maybe not. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>apocobring1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">in response to the person who pointed out they left out frogs - it is because they couldn't decide whether to include tad-pole years or not ~</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well, about 4.5 years ago, the average lifespan of a Froglok was about 2 minutes, give or take a minute.<br />
<br />
But with advances in dungeon technology, Frogloks are living much much longer!<br />
<br />
The Wood Elf Crown epidemic was a major setback in longevity in recent months though.</div></div><hr />

I think Samanaa was just looking for an excuse to use &quot;mythopoetic&quot; in a sentence...</div></div><hr />
