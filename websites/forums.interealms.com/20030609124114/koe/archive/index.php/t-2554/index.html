<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yes, I will take control of this raid!  Mainly because there are so many people signed up for it, and I need something to do tonight.  I've been playing in City of Mist for a few days and it's a pretty fun zone.  But I will need someone who knows the city well to direct us straight to the reavers.  I have a map, and know the beginning of the city, but I don't know further then the front of the building.  Despite this, I am going to try and lead this raid.  Bear with me, as it will be the largest raid yet that I have led!<br />
Who will assist me on directions?  You need to be beside me most of the time in the head of the group while travelling to the reavers.<br />
Anyone who is definitely coming again, please sign up.  I will put all the people who signed up for the &quot;cancelled&quot; raid on the possibilities list, and until you sign up here you are not a definite.  So please sign up here again so I can have definite groups formed :)<br />
Level range? I dunno.  I am a 46 mage, I guess 44+ or so.  I would also like to talk to someone before the raid about the room that the reavers are in and spawn locations, times, and rare pops and things like that in the room.  I'll have to be careful if the level 53 Neh'Ashirr spawns in the room that we are in :) But I don't know the inside of the city well.  I am trying though, and that's all that counts!<br />
Thanks again<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Amarin Crystalthorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I can be there.   We need to make sure that we have a FD puller that knows the area well.   I can show theway generally but, as a rogue, won't be a good puller.<br />
<br />
Amarin/Blaydde</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Falamil Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Boy, if this was a different night, I would come help out.  I have spent WAY too many nights in CoM. <br />
<br />
<br />
The way in isn't all that hard, I am sure Amarin can get you to Camp Two just fine.<br />

The main thing is that when those reavers start doing their phoenix imitations, rising from their own corpses, start screaming your head off that NOONE ATTACKS THE GHOST THAT IS THE FINAL SPAWN !  That is, until you can verify that the ghost is Lord Ghiosk, not Lord Rak.</div></div><hr />
