<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DrHuggybear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I took some time off to play camelot but grew tired of that so I am back to play EQ some more. <br />
<br />
However in my absense my brain has cleared of most EQ releated things :confused: .  So I have a couple questions if you could help me.<br />
<br />
1)  I never hunted in Karnors because I didnt want to screw up my DE faction.  However I have a DE Enchanter.  Is there any thing that my alt cant do for my shaman?  Meaning if I get the quest components could the enchanter turn them in?<br />
<br />
2)  I havent purchased Lucilin yet but some of the spells (Levitate and End Breath without the components) would be great.  Is there anywhere other than Lucilin that sells them?  Or do I just need to pay someone to go get them for me?<br />
<br />
3) Any tips for me after being gone for 5+ months on how to get back in the swing of things?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

The only other mildly useful item you can get with VS faction is the hammer that procs OT gate. Once you have the hammer you can go kos and dodge/outrun the mobs on your way out.<br />
<br />
- Some of the lower level luclin spells are on vendors, rest are drops. You don't need Luclin to scribe them and can send someone to buy the vendor bought spells for you. You'd be lucky to buy Lev and especially the EB - they are none too common drops.<br />
<br />
- Goodness, lots has changed. Targetgroupbuff is probably the most useful thing for us. Log on and type /tgb on, just once, and you'll be able to cast group buffs on groups other than yours.</div></div><hr />
