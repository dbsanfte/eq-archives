Soloing at 63 will be rough.  I'd so head to droga or chardokb for some nice quiet solo camps.  Not the best xp, but good loot and chardokb is almost always empty.<br />
<br />
PoHate tier1 and maybe 2 would work well for ya.  Do you have torpor?  Tanking PoP mobs will be tough without the defensive aa's, but you can root rot in a lot of tier1 zones.  Tier2+ root rot will be very risky and take a really long time without DoT's that don't break root (BoS, BoU, epic, Bane, Anathema).<br />
<br />
For PoP, your best bet might be in the hedge in PoN.  There's a couple threads on the subject here already, try searching for it.  The mobs do summon, hit hard and can tripple, but are fully slowable and you can use a horse.  Just keep bane, pox, dogdog, and any other dots you can going.  Expect to use some direct heals on youself also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>FuShnick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the info..<br />

Ah ya forgot about veksar, that's a good spot too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was working on my monk trying to get him to catch up to me, I tried velks not too bad, mobs hit like wuss's and don't have too many hp.  Only bad thing is, is if too many peoplle are there and your fighting for mobs.. it's not worth it otherwise.. one of my favorite places velium sells really nice too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't underestimate Nadox at 63. Easy xp and relatively quiet. If you haven't completed your blood of Nadox group cure you can do it while you grind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>FuShnick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yep I went back to nadox... as far as time per aa% it is far better... due to 0 down time..<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone<br />
<br />
Fushnick 5aa to go for canni</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm at 62<br />
3 AA fron Cann5 so I very much relate with this post<br />
<br />
I've been in Nurga, since it's a hot spot I can go to the 5th tier of MoBs there and solo an AA in about one and a half hours.<br />
<br />
Easy, descent pp, some named loot (sells for about 1-3K).<br />
<br />
Just get mask, girdle and weapons for pet before you go, makes it MUCH quicker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>FuShnick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">kror, thanks for the reply. Great spot, I am moving right along.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">SolC is pretty good solo spot at 63...reasonable exp, some nice drops and generally pretty quiet. Single puling can be tricky, but its all good practice ;)</div></div><hr />
