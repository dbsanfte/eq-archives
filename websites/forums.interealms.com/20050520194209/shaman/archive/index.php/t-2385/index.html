<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm the New Guy...just wanting to ask a few questions<br />
<br />
Right now I have a fantastic Weapon, and almost all banded except for the Mask, which is tattered patchwork.<br />
<br />
I am slowly beginning to get money available to me, and want to know what I should be trying to go for/upgrade first.<br />
<br />
I know, I know, I'm little. I'm still a level 10. My weapon was given to me...It's the Imbued Northman Mace, so I'm doing GREAT for a 1HB weapon. I have worked a little on piercing, but haven't foujnd anything with good dam/del ratio, and it has NOT been going up. I don't know why...yes, I do have the point in it, but it has NOT gone up.<br />
<br />
<br />
SO....What should I work on next? I have NO earrings, and the mask is garbage...I mean, I can probably get a banded mask, but that won't cost much...What would be some good upgrades for 200pp and under?<br />
<br />
Multiple upgrades would be nice...but if not, then what one thing should I look for on the auction channels?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for any input!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you're a barbarian, you can get some decent earrings for pretty cheap. They're called Golden Ivory Imbued Earrings (I think) and they're ac3 wis4. You could probably get them both for under 100pp. You can also get a Platinum Ivory Imbued Necklace for fairly cheap as well, if you're a barb shaman. I believe the stats are ac5 wis5 svCold5(?). It may run a bit more than 100pp though. I forget how much platinum bars cost. The key to getting these items cheaply is finding a friendly jeweler who'll do the combines for a donation or sell you the items to you 'at cost'. Also, you'll need a shaman of at least level 29 to imbue the ivory for you. I can't think of any other items at the moment. Banded will serve you well until your 20s (even early 30s if necessary), so I'd make sure I had cash for spells as well as concentrating on equipment, if it comes to making a choice between the two. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">First and foremost, I think you'll find that equipment upgrades won't change the game much at level 10 (at least not those upgrades you'll be able to afford at level 10.)   :)   Banded and a nice weapon is more than good enough- you're in very good shape.  If anything, I'd try to grab a piercer so you can keep both your blunt and piercing weapon skills up.  It gets harder to raise them the higher you go- so you'll kick yourself later if you don't max them out now.  Same with your Defense skill- make absolutely sure it's maxed at every level, because Defense = Free AC.<br />
<br />
This thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=500) asks and answers some &quot;new shaman&quot; questions- might be worth a look.<br />
<br />
And don't forget to put a training point into Channeling- I'm embarassed to say I just forgot until the mid 20's- ack.<br />
<br />
Good hunting!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Months ago a shaman posted here that by lvl 50 something..think it was 56, he had forgotten to put a point into channeling.<br />
<br />
Was wondering why he had been getting interrupted all the time...haha. <br />
<br />
Anyone else remember that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm, ok a few things:<br />
Your lvl 14 spells are expensive, if I remember right it was like 110 plat for the set, be ready for them.<br />
Go get some vision spells to practice Div, I use True North and Sense Animals to keep it maxed, at lvl 29 it would suck bad to have to go from 0 to 150 just to reliably cast invis. :)<br />
A nice piercer that actualy does good damage at your level and is dirt cheap is the Blood Stained Fang 9/30 ish and they go for 15-35 plat all the time.<br />
For 2HB a couple of cheap options are the Glowing Wooden Crook from Oasis, goes for ~50 plat or less 11/35 and later in life you can now have a Troll smith &quot;upgrade&quot; it for ya to a Varnished Wooden Crook 20/40 10 wis, 15 AC, 100 mana, and the imbued version should be a bit better.  <br />
Another 2HB for cheap is The Drakel Forged Sledgehammer, 22/50 and you should be able to pick one up for less than 100 plat anymore. At 36 I still use one of these as my primary solo weapon, regular hits for 60ish takes 'em down quick indeed.<br />
Good huntin'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You aren't going to find a lot of super great upgrades for about 200P, but let's look at a shopping list that you might want to try and find:<br />
<br />
Blackened iron girdle.  5ac 5sta if I remember.  Good belt.  Gives AC and HP.  I think blackened iron is only a few AC more than banded per piece, so expect to pay just a little more than that for it.  If banded armor still sells for roughly 1P per AC of the piece, expect about 2-3P per ac on banded?<br />
<br />
Shiny Brass Shield is 10ac 10mr?  Can probably get one for about 30P<br />
<br />
The coldain shields that are all over thurgadin you can probably get for almost nothing.  They are lore and super super common.  15ac and 10 cold.  Don't act like a beggar asking if someone can kill one for you to loot it, but offer some PP for someone to get you one.  They'll probably just give it to you if you don't act like a beggar.  :)<br />
<br />
Legs will be hard to upgrade for a while.  You might be able to pick up a set of gatorscale legs for 200P or so if you are lucky.<br />
<br />
Bloodstained tunic is about 50P I think.  It's got decent AC and wis and HP? on it.  Comes from unrest.<br />
<br />
Bloodstained mantle is from unrest too.  6ac 10mr is decent for about 30P or so.<br />
<br />
For your bracer, if you want to go the +wis route, try to get some polished bone bracers.  they are 2ac 3wis 3int i think, and now have a focus effect.  They used to sell for about 100P back in the day, but not sure now.  I'd guess about 70P nowadays.<br />
<br />
Earrings won't be easy to upgrade for a long time, unless you are a barb.  Get those imbued ivory ones mentioned above.  Either that, or save up for some 2ac 35hp 25mana gold black sapphire earings.  That'll probably cost you about 200P each though.<br />
<br />
Rings will be a bit expensive, but very useful if you get an enchanter to make you some gold fire opal rings.  I can't remember the name, but they are the 4ac 45hp rings.  If you can find an enchanter that will just combine the stuff for you, the fire opal will cost you 50P to get from temple of sol ro, or maybe cheaper if you buy it from a player that just came back from a dungeon where they drop.  A gold bar costs about 1p?  Definately less than 10p though.<br />
<br />
As for arms, try to find hollowed bone bracers.  they are 6ac 7mr and some +mana.  I think they have a focus effect on the now too.  I'd expect to pay about 100-200P for them though, maybe more with the effect.  They were rather rare from najena, and I barely ever have seen them for sale, and I've only gotten 2 of them in many many hours of romping around najena.<br />
<br />
Splitpaw gloves have like 4ac and 2 or 3 wis on them.  I'd personally just stick with banded for the AC, but it's an option if you need some more mana.  I'd guess about 25P for them.<br />
<br />
For your mask, you can try to get a splitpaw hide mask.  they are 3ac 5mr 5pr i think.  They'd be cheap too at about 25P i'd guess.<br />
<br />
For your necklace, try to get a chrysoberyl talisman from lower guk.  It's 5ac 25mana 3wis i think.  I used to sell them for 100P all the time, but would even give them away often considering they were lore items, when I was camping a named spawn next to the mob that dropped them.<br />
<br />
There's lots of piercing weapons out there that you should try to get.  The one that comes from lake of ill omen is the most common one, as his spawn time is only 2 hours for the mob that drops it.  It's roughly a 11/35 piercer with wis and sta on it.<br />
<br />
OH.  Try to get to cazic thule and see if you can buy one of the weapons that drops off the mobs there.  They are the common weapons that drop off the mobs there.  Their ratios are about 1:3.5 (like a 7/22 or 8/26) with +1 damage vs lizardmen and 2pr or dr or something.  You can probably get one for free if you offer someone 15 or 20P for one of them (roughly how much a vendor buys them for).<br />
<br />
Your range slot won't have anything to put in it for a long time I'm afraid, unless you can find a potter who can make something for you.  I don't know the costs nor difficulties involved in making something like that though.<br />
<br />
There's also a bunch of items that drop in the Ferrott now.  They used to drop in cazic thule before the upgrade.  There's some shoulder that has like 5ac 3wis i think.  I think there's also a mask from there.  <br />
<br />
For your helmet, try to get a blackened iron crown.  they will be a bit more costly due to their stats, but it's a good choice.  It's 5ac, 5sta and/or 5str and 5 to all resists.  I think they used to sell for about 100P, but try for something like 50P or less if you can manage that.<br />
<br />
There's probably a lot of items from Luclin that I haven't mentioned here.  Basicly, at your level, here's the importance of stats for the items you want:  HP &gt; AC &gt; mana &gt; wis &gt; resists &gt; sta &gt; agl &gt; str &gt; dex.  When you get higher in level (like 30s-40s) wis will become more important, but as it is you barely get any mana from increases wisdom.  Stamina isn't very important at lower level for the same reason, that you bare get any HPs from it.  Just make sure your stamina is over 100.  If it isn't, then when you run out of Yellow_Bar (people also call this &quot;stamina&quot;) then some of your physical stats drop by 10 until you get stamina back.  Also make sure your agility is over 75.  If it isn't, you get a LARGE AC penalty.  If your stamina is under 100, then make sure your agility is over 85, as you be working at that small penalty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Here's some good rules of thumb when deciding on equipment upgrades (they are kind of obvious but sometimes need to be said):<br />
1.  If you are dying too often to mobs you are fighting, you don't have enough HP and AC, thus pick your equip accordingly.<br />
2.  If you don't have enough mana to kill the mobs you are fighting, or run out of mana in combat healing group members, you don't have enough mana and wis, thus pick your equipment accordingly.<br />
3.  If you are taking too much damage from casters, you want equipment with more resists, thus pick your equipment accordingly.<br />
You can keep this in mind from level 10 - 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Great suggestions, Juujuu!<br />
<br />
Couple comments:  <br />
<br />
Getting to CT might be tough around level 10.  Make sure you have a high level escort if you're going.<br />
<br />
I think the Lake of Ill Omen piercer JJ is talking about is the Jade Chokidai Prod (drops from the chancellor) - since it's used for the Howling Stones key quest, the price on it is still relatively high (300-500 pp) - at least on Karana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">...and if you're on Bristlebane, I will make you Imbued Northman Armor for darn close to free.  I have a ton components except for the Essence o'Winter needed for the temper.<br />
<br />
Heck, be a young (1-20) shaman following the Tribunal, and mention that you read the Crucible message board, and I will GIVE you an Imbued Northman Ring Tunic.  AC 17, +2 Wis, +1 Sta, +2 CR.<br />
<br />
A shaman that reads this board is more likely to know what they're doing... and so, worthy of support.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Unfortunately, I'm not on Bristlebane...I'm on Tunare.<br />
How much does it cost to put together the Northman Armor?<br />
Avg cost per AC?</div></div><hr />
