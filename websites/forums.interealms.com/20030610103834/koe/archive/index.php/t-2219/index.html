<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Falamil Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wanted to drop a note and say thanks to all the KoE groups for finding room fer me this weekend.<br />
<br />
<br />
Had a blast in Kael, and the faction hits from Toramx's ramp show that I may someday be able to walk into ToV.<br />
<br />
The pit in Velks was good, steady grinding, some nice cash from down there, too.  Thanks to Aeila for the invite.<br />
<br />
And thanks to Waran and Aranuil for stopping by yesterday for a kill or two.  Aranuil, someday ya gotta show me where you put that train together from last night.  :D <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It's great to start seeing some of the higher level zones on a regular basis, and I can't say I have met a single KoE that didn't go out of their way to make me feel like one of the gang.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Now, if we can just fix that helm of Hammerstalkers. . . .   <br />
<br />
<br />
Don't worry, Hammer.  I know a good blacksmith in Kaladim.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Redtree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I to had a good time this weekend..<br />
<br />
I got to meet Xray nice isker monk grouped up with malbik in OT, although he keep looking at me like I was lunch.  ((i think he liked gnome sandwhiches)).  I was sure to keep haste cast on him.<br />
<br />
I spent a couple hours in Velks with what turned out to be a bunch of people petitioning KOE.  The lab became crowded as we near the end of our camp... &quot;We did pick up some stones for Quest armor.<br />
<br />
All in All---Fun weekend !!</div></div><hr />
