<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Durnitol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've searched a lot of forums and windows support websites to no avail.<br />
<br />
I have a P4 2.2 GHz cpu, 512 MB ram, Win98. For some reason windows only &quot;sees&quot; 224 MB of RAM. Has anyone run into this problem? Is there a quick fix, short of getting XP? Or at least a resource I haven't found yet that would answer my question?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">How many memory sticks you have in your computer?<br />
Try taking one out at a time, and see if your ram changes.<br />
Might be a bad memory stick.<br />
Could be the slot you stick the memory into that's not connecting right.<br />
You sure the RAM is all installed properly?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What Juujuu said.<br />
You may want to check, if type of RAM you use, is similar for all RAM-sticks (get a techy friend to do it, if you don't know how). With Win98 (ok,use it too :D ) there are chances, you have some old -incompatible- crap RAM in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>L33TL355</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Windows 98 chokes on anything over 256 megs of ram!!!<br />
<br />
I built a AMD 2100+ with 1.5 gigs of ram and a Gforce 4 4600 and when installing windows 98 I got to the point where you enter the product key and reboot to start installing. Ended up at a dos prompt stating not enough system ram. Had to go get windows 2000 pro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>lionheart3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">win 98 should be fine with 512 megs. can you try the ram in another computer  to test it?<br />
also search the net and find a ram testing program. if you cant find one ill try to find one i used before, not sure i still have it tho. definatly sounds like your riunning into either a bad stick of ram or an incompatability with 1 of them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">im using win98 with 512 mb of ram just fine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>koradin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Am running windows 98 with 640meg ram( 2x256 and 1 128) and have no problems at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I never managed this, well, the other half couldnt and he is no slouch when it comes to computers, mine just wouldnt see the extra memory. Tried various things that had been mentioned but no go.<br />
<br />
Upgrading to XP was the only way round it for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I searched Microsoft.com for an article but i didnt have any luck finding it so i will briefly say this. Win95,98,98SE and ME all support as much as 2 gig BUT will not actually utilize anything over 512 meg. In order for windows9x to use over 512 there is a registry change that must be done but that is what the article covers and I cant remember the changes that needs to be made.<br />
<br />
As far as your specific problem what was suggested above is your best bet. If your using RD ram remember that you must use them in pairs like the old SIMMs. If you are using 2x256 meg RIMMs then it could be a bad module. Best of luck to you, I hope ya get it resolved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">When you first turn on your PC, does it show the amount of memory you have (this is in text mode before Windows starts)?<br />
<br />
If you see around 262MB and not around 524MB, then the problem is hardware not windows.  I would do like the person above said and trying pulling one stick of ram and then the other.  Usually it does not matter which slot you put them in.<br />
<br />
I'm running 512MB on Win98 btw and it works fine.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The cap on Win98 is 512, not 256.  There's a patch to get it to use more effectively but I couldn't get it to work, so I just pulled my extra one out.<br />
<br />
Check your sticks...take one out and reboot, then try the other.  It sounds like one is bad.  Also try them in different slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Like what other folks have said ... <br />
<br />
1.   Cold boot PC ( shut down out of windows to power off and then turn back on again ).    Note the Ram Check messages during the Non-Windows bootup period.   If you have some Vendor graphic during bootup ... normally pressing the Tab or Esc key will drop the graphic showing the bootup messages.   If you still can't see any information on boot up ... you can change the Bios setting to show RAM check BUT itss a bit dangerous for the faint of heart to mess around in a PC's Bios.<br />
<br />
2.  Confirm that you have not changed the settings in Windows from Automatic to some manual setting.   Check by right clicking on &quot;my computer&quot; icon - select properties - performance options - make sure it's set to &quot;Let windows select&quot; with all other options grey'd out. <br />
<br />
3.  If your PC is a branded model (ie Compaq, Dell, Gateway, etc) then go to their web sites for troubleshooting.   Input your systems model number for advanced information on your motherboard, bios, etc.    Many vendors offer free utilities for troubleshooting which may check your Ram sticks.   Plus these programs will check other things such as drivers, bios, etc for problems.   Check the ram configuration diagram off these sites for pattern for installing your Ram sticks.   Many motherboards require that you install Ram in even sets ... ie 2x128 sticks instead of (1x128 &amp; 1x256).    Also confirm that your sticks are same BUS speed as required for your PC.   Example ... you may not be able to put a PC-133 stick in a system that only takes PC-100's ... your vendor should be able to confirm this.   Best bet is to match your older Ram Sticks other than improved RAM speed.   <br />
<br />
4.   Rather than list this under 3 ... when checking your spec's on motherboard ... confirm that your system can take 512 Ram.   I have a PC that will NOT upgrade pass 386 Ram ... so it could be  due to the motherboard rather than Win98.  If you can't confirm by PC vendor ... your motherboard shown have a code in one of the corners denoting it's type.    You will have to crack (open) the case to find this number before checking it on the web.   Do a search via search engines for motherboard makers till you find a site that offers information on either that maker or do a lookup via the code number.    Then confirm that the motherboard can take the ram, configuration, and amount being used to install.<br />
<br />
5.   Finally ... reseat all sticks.    Best bet is to do this first before anything else.  Just make sure everything is seated properly and in the correct position.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd agree first thing to check is what your bios says at boot up. Definitely could be a hardware issue and not a windows issue.<br />
<br />
If not more info would be helpful. What type of mb? What type of memory? How much memory installed where?</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but your extra 256 stick is wasted. :( Win98 can't address anything above 512.  It won't cause you problems, it just can't use it.   Upgrade to Win2k or XP and you'll see more benefit.</div></div><hr />

Squidly,  what privacy do you lose on Xp,  i'm just curious.  I've alwasy expected Shady Gates to put something in to spy on people.   Hahahaha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I had this exact same problem with an older, slower system..that I'm still using.<br />
<br />
Windows 98 has some ugly memory limitations, which are adjustable in the registry.  Your Windows installation sets your memory limit to the memory available when you install, supposedly to save search time for free memory.<br />
<br />
I adjusted my registry settings and got a bit more memory out of it.  <br />
<br />
Then I decided to take the plunge to Win2000 (NOT M.E.), and I've found it has great memory handling, is pretty darn stable, and doesn't have all the stupid extra graphics that ME makes you endure.  It's probably around 200$, but it's gotta be cheaper than rebuilding your system. (Been using it for 7 months with no EQ problems at all)<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, if you are using SIMM's in a DIMM system, or some other kind of wrong memory you will find that you will get less memory reporting, or the system simply won't start up.<br />
<br />
I recently bought two 512mg 133x64 DIMMs to upgrade my system, only to find out that my system can only take memory in multiples of 16 (without going into the math that means I can only use 256mg chips) When I loaded both chips with one of the old 256's in I got a total reported of 790mgs (not the 1028 plus 256 I expected), exactly what I got with 3 256 chips...<br />
<br />
So now I am sucking it up and buying a whole new motherboard with FOUR slots that takes all the newest memory, and my old eq machine is being sent to the office..I only hope you don't have to do this.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />
