<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Quick question about this shard... are the (2) ent guards (Pino &amp; Hava) PHs for the legionnaires of the hand that drop this shard. was told so but after few hours of monotinous, montinous killing i never did get a LotH to pop. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Take the teleporter up top.  You can work your way around the hallway, I've had many many shards drop while I was soloing up there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">agreed.. best bet is to take the teleporter up and work your way around.  I've seen a shard drop before I reached the corner every time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just run out of the entrance hallway in to the first courtyard and turn around.  You'll see two glass plates.  These are the teleporters.  Click up and start killing.  Everything up there can drop a shard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Or just go to katta and kill the centurions in the east most building :)</div></div><hr />

And to answer the origional question:<br />
The 2 guards on both entry sides to Sseru are PHs for Lego of the Hand, who drop shard. So the answer is yes.<br />

So long<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's not just Legos of the Hand that drop the shard, that is a widely spread myth.  Any named Lego upstairs or at the entrance can drop it, and in fact Legos of the Hand have a worse drop rate upstairs than other named.  <br />
<br />
Drop rate at the entrance is pretty bad, though.  You're better off upstairs for sure.  We had the best luck turning the corner from the teleporter and going on the second hallways, but that might just be coincidence.  We spent a long time farming by the porter on three different occasions, then decided to just move along the hallway, and got a shard quickly all three times after turning the corner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Helter Skelter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My experience with this is consistent with what Weissblau wrote above.  Moving down the hall away from where you teleported in will get you a shard in the minimum amount of time.</div></div><hr />
