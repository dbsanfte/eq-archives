<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>EverNewbie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I've clearly heard from just about everyone that Paudal is the best exp from 14-25 but the thing that I haven't heard is if the PP is ne good. This shaman is my first character and I will need to make money to be able to afford spells and gear as I got along. If the money is really bad here I might have to sacrifice some of the exp for money making along the way. Or is it better for me to just tuff it out and exp my way up with not the greatest gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Veon of Firiona Vie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">PALUDAL not Paudal... wonder why so many people get it wrong.  And I think the exp penalty is not broken and it will not be nerfed... one end of the zone has the bandits everyone loves to hunt in groups from 17-23 and one end has these beetles that help eachother out and aren't much better exp than Karana bugs or anything at athat level.<br />
<br />
Until you are 17 Ii'd avoid it.  At that piont, zone in from shadowhaven and hope the bandit camp has a spot for you and wants you in their group.  19 with a new heal would help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I personally found the money to be great. Most groups I was in consisted of twinks or people who just didn't care about the loot. The armor carried on the bandits can sell anywhere from 2-8 platinum, and each can carry upwards of 2 platinum.<br />
<br />
Even if you don't have that lunk with loot, you want to go to this zone ASAP. Paludal Caverns is insane experience. I was gaining more than a level per hour playing all the way from 15-25. You wont find a place like it ever after those levels. My advise is to ignore money, pick up what you can in Paludal and just race through those levels.</div></div><hr />
