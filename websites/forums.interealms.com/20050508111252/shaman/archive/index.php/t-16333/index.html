<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Badz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a 50 shaman that I 2-box with a 52 warrior (easier bot than a cleric).  I have a 30 mage/cleric duo that I have play when RL friends are on.  I have really started to like the mage and think he would be a great partner for my shaman.  Would it be better to stay with the warrior?<br />
<br />
I am a casual player that is on less than 20 hours a week and not in a guild anymore.  I like exploring new areas and playing in groups.  Right now my favorite place to hunt is LoY maps.<br />
<br />
I am not sure I have the patience left to xp grind the mage from 31 to 50.  Can a shaman power level a mage? How and what maps? Or would it be better to stay with the warrior?<br />
<br />
Looking for some pros &amp; cons that I may not have thought of or found using search.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Stay with the warrior.  Mage is a good duo partner for a while, but eventually, in PoP, the pet just can't tank or hold aggro worth a damn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I disagree with the above poster. Mage pets are awesome, great dps, and if the mobs rooted they hold agro just fine. Mages have decent utility that stacks well with shaman, mages can't root but shaman can, mages can't slow but mages can etc etc. Mage/shammy dou is very viable all the way up to 65. <br />
In order to dou your team you have to get the mage to 30 so he can group with the shammy and then xp will go up alot faster than with a straight pl. Theres quite a few kunark outdoor type zones where you can help buff the pet and also help finish the mobs off to level the mage up fast. Ot is a good spot, and in a few levels when you can be grouped dreadlands wouldn't be to bad a choice either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As a 61 shaman I PLed a mage up to 55 in about 4 weeks. I found that the mage died a lot earlier on but that this was due to adds. From 30 - 50 was spent mainly in the old Nurga and Droga and then PoJ.<br />
<br />
I thought the mage was pretty weak until 50 ish, but at 55 he is great! Sirocco is a 3 wave rain that does a lot of damage and is very mana efficient. Also being a long recast means not spending that much time on mage. Great for 2 boxing!<br />
<br />
The air pet (I forget level, early 50's) can tank the PoN maze well enough (in combination with the 61 shammy pet plus slow and CH or torpor). These are level 60 mobs! I'm certain the level 60ish mage pets would be considerably better...<br />
<br />
Not to mention at 65 the mage can charm elemental mobs...<br />
<br />
So the answer is yes, shaman can PL mages. I would stick to zones/mobs without the risk of many adds, as the adds will make a beeline for the mage and kill him. But once the mage gets closer in level to the sham he will be great!!!<br />
<br />
I am sad to say that the 55 level mage seems a better match than my 61 monk (RIP). Already higher dps and more versatile.<br />
<br />
EDIT: By nature mages are cheap to run as well. They don't need much in the way of gear... as long as you buy spells which seem pretty cheap, a badly equipped mage does almost as much DPS as a well equipped one (until you get into FT items). otoh a warrior needs decent gear to be a good warrior... just another reason to go for mage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Mages are AWESOME partners up until 60, or even past that if you are exping in the old world.  Before pop came out, mage was my favorite partner.  The reason for this was because mobs pre-pop hit so weak that the mage pet could easily tank them, and did insane damage.  All you needed was slow and the pet could handle it.  In pop, though, with mobs tripling for 544 or even harder, the pet just can't handle that.  Maybe if you stuck to poi pod pon poj the mage would be okay, but anything past that isn't going to work too well.  I am not saying that it isn't possible, it definately is, but it is really more trouble than it is worth.<br />
<br />
From your sig, I see that your highest character is 61, with most in the mid to high 50's.  In this level range, mages are EXCELLENT partners.  In pop though they just aren't as viable as they were earlier, because they just can't handle the damage.  Ditto monks.  You can still do it, but it isn't as good as duoing with a tank, imho.<br />
<br />
Either warrior or mage will work, really.  Warrior is a solid choice from 0-65.  Mage has his weak levels where it will be a struggle, and he has his strong levels where it will be a breeze.  In the end, though, warrior wins out.  That's just my opinion, though.<br />
<br />
Either way, good luck with whatever you choose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>tavaran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Personally, I 2 box a 65 Ranger and my Shaman is now 58.  I find us to be an excellent combo.  With the shamans slows and alpha dogdog and my attack buffs and snares, we do really well.  Now that I have the 58 ICHeal, it is even better than before.  I am having no problems in Tier one planes.  I have a 56 warrior I tried to do this with when warrior/shaman were both in the low to mid 50s.  I found the DPS of the warrior so slow and the lack of snare or trying to rely on a snare proc to be a pita.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Normally I just play my shaman in xp groups, but when I gotta go off on a tangent, I break out my 61 ranger on my 2nd account to duo with my 63 shaman.  The 2 classes compliment each other well, and a ranger can tank well enough once the mob is slowed.  Ranger pulls with snare, shaman malo/slow on inc, then engage with ranger and sic pet on the mob.... before the mob even reaches camp it's slowed/snared/debuffed.  Throw a Cripple on, and start applying the DoTs... a ranger can keep agro through all of this with the Taunt button and snare/nukes.  Each class has buffs that stack well with each other, ranger has tracking and harmony (outdoors), both are very good utility classes....  this combo works outdoors or indoors.  I've duo'd in PoD courtyard and PoV FC camps.<br />
<br />
And when the fit hits the shan, a ranger can /disc weaponshield for 15 secs of invulnerability while the shaman gets things worked out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">To completely disagree with some of the latest posters, I have duo'd with a mage up to and including tier 3 with zero problems.<br />
<br />
Mages are probably the best caster partner for a shammy..it's worth the plevel.</div></div><hr />

Really depends on the monks gear/aa.    The nerf isnt even really noticable once you get a some defensive aa's and 1300ac( just throwing numbers out, this seemed like the sweet spot when i hit this. )<br />
<br />
My new monk can tank pov golem's at 59 with 3aa lol.  He's not very good at it of cource. But i can see he will be fine at 65 with some aa.  Aggro of cource is a different story. :)</div></div><hr />
