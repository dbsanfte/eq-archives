<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>lemilynia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I 2 box my cleric and ranger while my husband boxes his beastlord and wizard.   We range from 46 (beastlord) to 51 (cleric).    We've been hunting CoM, but got bored.   Without an enchanter all we can do in Karnor's is the moat, which is also rather boring.   Got chased out of Fungus, so obviously not ready for that. ;p      I don't particularly enjoy fear kiting, and boxing makes that harder anyway.  So, any suggestions as to where we can take this foursome for some steady but not entirely mindless exp?</div></div><hr />

You two should be able to do all the way down to the drop off if you're careful.  Unfortunately, this is gonna be rather mindless . . .</div></div><hr />
