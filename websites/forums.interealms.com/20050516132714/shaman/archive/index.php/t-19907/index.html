<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, Interealms has been chugging along for a couple of years now on a whopping 1.7 GHz Celeron server with a gig of RAM. Thanks to you know what, I just paid for a MUCH better server that I brought online yesterday. It's my own personal server so that I can do some other things besides this (my Wedding site, etc.) as well.<br />
<br />
We now have a nice Pentium 2.8 GHz Pentium 4 (with Hyper Threading and a huge cache) with 1.5 Gigs of RAM on board. I'll *finally* be able to reinstall my Cold Fusion server and SQL so I can get the dynamic guides section up and some other things I've been planning. It should also really do away with any slow downs noticed on patch days.<br />
<br />
It was actually quite amazing that the old Celeron was able to hold up that well (running Windows even!) but it served us well :) So, over the next few days and into the weekend, I'll be moving things over and setting up shop on the new server. I'll let everyone know when I plan to make the cut as there will be a small gap in service as the DNS switches over and I transfer the message board databases.<br />
<br />
To sum it up, I finally got some horsepower to work with and things are gonna get a lot faster around here, but you may see some sporadic outages as I tinker with the new box.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sweet! How much storage will you have? Raid 1? External array? What OS you gonna be running on new box?<br />
<br />
More details!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have two 80 gig 7200 RPM drives, not sure if I'm going to Raid them... probably not. Running Windows Server 2003 SE, Cold Fusion MX, PHP, MySQL and SQL 2000.. so basically, everything ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats a sweet box can't wait :) I like it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks IGE! :D  Seriously though, nice to see you putting the ad deal money back into the site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've turned off the email server until I cut the server over this weekend. Unfortunately, with no email, no new accounts can be activated. Also, I can't receive any email sent during this time.<br />
<br />
I'm also moving over to some new email software, one with better virus protection since those things are prolific as hell nowadays.</div></div><hr />
