<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bajen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With lvl 44 spells I tried the ships in Dulak. Was fine but XP was slow even though many mobs were green.<br />
<br />
Now I want XP for my pally also since he is close to PE. I only need 40+% to ding. Once I do ding I want some zone that is not to out of the way.<br />
<br />
I have tried PoJ. I did not like it since rats run and adds will come.<br />
<br />
I have tried Veksar, which I love as zone goes. Slows stick and zone modifier is good. I recently left because I do not wish to get tired of the zone.<br />
<br />
I haven't tried HH Keep. I dont mind screwing the faction there on my pally. Troll is KOS anyways.<br />
<br />
I haven't tried spirocs since it is out of the way and my pally raids and what not often.<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions?</div></div><hr />

I must ask,  are you sure there are greens at lvl 44?  My 2 boxing monk and shammy are both 55 and wavecrasher gives me darkblues and huge aggro radiuses.  I have a hard time believing you are just 44 and getting greens in Dulak boats.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll try my wings in PoD at tse tse flies.</div></div><hr />
