<br />
I was lucky enough to loot a windsaber this week and at first glance it seems the light velium I have 30/40 is the clear choice.  However I started wondering if the speed of the windsaber 13/22 Might not make it the better option.<br />
<br />
Just curious how the TS discipline damage bonus works, would it be better to use the windsaber to get the benifit of the TS damage bonus compounded or is it still better to just use the Light velium.<br />
<br />
anyone ever tested this?<br />
<br />
My thinking is the same as why its better to use a lammy post 54 then a wurmy due to the damage bonus on the mainhand.<br />
<br />
I assume that this theory might work the same when using TS disc with the windsaber.</div></div><hr />

I recall hearing that trueshot damage takes into account the delay of the bow in its damage calculation.  A very low delay bow wont have as much damage bonus.<br />
<br />
The windsabre is an awesome bow for getting your archery skill up though, and will probably be more damaging when your not using trueshot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Toof</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This doesn't really answer the question you asked but I finally picked up a windsaber the other day and I'm using it in the range slot full time now instead of the bow of underfoot I had before that.  The reason is that I pull a lot, and sometimes what would happen is I'd hit a stationary high level monster for a lot of dmg and instead of pulling it, it would summon me! Hehehe.  Windsaber does the damage to pull it but not enough to get you summoned.  <br />
<br />
More in line with your question:  the windsaber does a LOT less damage than the underfoot...at some time I'll parse them =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Compared to my vellium it seems to do alot less dmg with disc, but with EQ and 10dmg arrows does similar dmg non-disc.  Might even go so far as to say it does better than the vellium, tho its difficult to say without doing the stat analyses.  Currently looking for a mithril champion arrow, which should increase the wind sabre even more in comparison.</div></div><hr />
