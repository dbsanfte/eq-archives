<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When I bought my equipment I focused on AC then wis, any HP on my char is purely conincidental.<br />
<br />
Is it really that imortant to a shaman? <br />
<br />
(The AC on my magelo is wrong cause im to lazy to update my naked AC)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ohh ya my sig :p<br />
<br />
Also that title should be &quot;Did I screw up&quot; To lazy to use i it seems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You still have plenty of time to get HP gear before you REALLY need it.  ie; Alt Ability Canibalization.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In my humble opinion, before level 60 the most important stats are (in this order):<br />
<br />
Regeneration<br />
AC<br />
HP / Wis<br />
<br />
HP isn't *that* important until you get AA cannibalize. Regen is totally important, more regen means more canni. AC is always good to stop you getting whacked. And Wis is good (within reason) for a reasonable mana pool and to reduce fizzles.<br />
<br />
Opinions vary but most people seem to be comfortable with a wis around 150-170, and then get as much AC as you can without dropping wis too much. But then again some shamans have wis nearer 120 and they still manage ok.<br />
<br />
Until you get near the AC cap (speculated as around 1300 but let's not get into that!) then more AC is always good, and should be a priority, except for the BP slot which you should save for a regen item.<br />
<br />
All in my opinion of course :)  Go with what works for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">HP will also help against spells.. event lure based ones - AC will not. This is important for AE mobs.<br />
<br />
At 58 I'm encountering mobs that will AE DD and DoT.. plus having Cana IV - HP will start playing a heavier role post 55. <br />
Getting hit by these AE could mean taking a 1200pt DD.. some AEs are lure based so resist gear isn't going to help.<br />
<br />
Yes AC is good ... so is HP :)<br />
<br />
For this reason I have never been a fan of Jaundiced Bone..<br />
<br />
Your equipement is good - I would move from JB to items with AC+HP+wis/mana.<br />
<br />
I would look at earrings with +AC/HP/mana on too such as twisted leaves or solstice.<br />
<br />
I took the SS route - now I want to keep the blue look, which means I have to replace items to get the additional AC/HP.. I have enough wis/mana.. self buffed I hit 998ac.. but I'm not normally slower :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Good point, I haven't yet fought many mobs like that.<br />
<br />
So level 57-58 seems to be the right time to start looking for gear with loads of extra HP.</div></div><hr />
