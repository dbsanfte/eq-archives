<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zophiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, here's a real noob question, a friend of mine (not really a friend, but he likes to think so) asked it, KEGIAN on KARANA server (u can spam him server wide, he deserves it :p )<br />
Can i rise forage by doing a macro like<br />
/attack off<br />
/doability #<br />
/attack on<br />
in order to train it in combat also<br />
Or had i to click myself on the button to train it (some ppl said that a macro can 't make a skill rise)?<br />
Thx for answering a new born ranger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sarkaukar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Aye, that would work.<br />
<br />
You could also tie the hotbutton to forage to a direction key (ie when you hit the turn left button, it activates the #10 key on the keypad inwhich you have forage key located.<br />
<br />
The only bad thing is that it will activate the 10 key spot on all the hotbutton groups and for different characters on the same account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Easiest way to raise forage is to simply forage, over and over.  Don't worry about hitting some key like that in combat, just keep hitting it over and over while between fights.  Be sure, especially if you have some stat food, to eat and drink what you forage, unless you're too full.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>magimix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The 'mapping forage to a movement' key thing is working very well for me.  Although forage is climbing very, *very* slowly (currently 55), I'm foraging stuff often enough that I don't have to buy food anymore, which is nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gaeathorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">another issue to tying it to a key in combat is that you will attempt to give your foraged item to your opponent. :-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I used to do that a lot when I was trying to raise foraging.  I'd forage something and then end up trying to give it to another group member right at the start of battle. :)<br />
<br />
I made a macro that included forage, loc, and sense heading, and tied it to a movement key.   I use a loc/sense heading macro in the same slot on all my characters, it's a good way to raise sense heading as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mjfruits</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did this with Forage, as well as Sense Heading, Tracking, and some spells.<br />
<br />
doability 3 (forage)<br />
/doability 4 (tracking)<br />
/doability 5 (sense heading)<br />
/pause 30,cast 1 (glimpse)<br />
/cast 2 (dance of the fireflies)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>SwordMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I originally had a social with forage, tracking, and sense heading tied to a movement key; however, I found that sometimes I couldn't initiate my attack sequence (another social with a /loc and /con) if I caught the timing wrong (right after a turn). I eventually placed each of the three on a separate hotkey and mapped them all to the same movement key.<br />
<br />
I anticipate that this will serve me well until I start running out of hot keys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Catwalkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I mapped Forage to both my Friends key (with a /stand command in the macro) and my INC key (since I bow-pull, I rarely have attack on when I announce an incoming mob).  I finally managed to get Forage to 197.  Druids have it better on this, since they rarely have auto attack on and can forage whenever the button refreshes.</div></div><hr />
