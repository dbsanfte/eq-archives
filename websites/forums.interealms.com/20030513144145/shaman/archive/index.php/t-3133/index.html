<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Setantha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well....I've finished up with Needlites at level 31 and am now in Marus Seru hunting Stonegrabbers. Good experience now that my spells are less resisted but half the time I keep getting adds :/  Currently I am camped on a hill quite near the Recuso camp near the Neth zone.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know of any good solo spots here, or maybe Dawnshroud, for low 30s?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">dont hunt at the recuso camp, hunt directly at the neth zone, inside the fort, the guards dont KS hoppers and grabbers, so pull those.  If you still have a hard time you can kill lightcrawlers in DS at the sanctus seru zoneline.</div></div><hr />

Mushroom Temple in Dawnshroud Peaks is *excellent*. Set up on the South East side of the temple - vic -1700, 300.<br />
<br />
10 or more static spawns, all are single pulls.  plus NO mobs that path nearby that are aggressive.  Tribals and Zelniaks wander around outside once the mushrooms green out.<br />
<br />
Just be careful getting there...parts of DPeaks are dangerous at your level.<br />
<br />
Nice loot, you can get  backpacks full of mushrooms that sell for 2 - 5 plat each.<br />
<br />
<br />
If they are still too tough for you, come back when you hit 34.</div></div><hr />

<br />
[EDIT]<br />
nm..found it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zorath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Would these be the mushrooms that have the ridiculous level range of around 26 - 45 and that are SKs?  I hear 55s have problems with them more or less some one in the low 30s.  Hopefully I'm thinking of the wrong ones because a BP full of shrooms sounds pretty good to me...for the money, of course. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Setantha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No ..I did these mushrooms last night and they are all blue to lvl 32 and despatched quite easily. I hear there are other shrooms who are SKs near the Maiden's Eye zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Setantha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Dinged 34 and prolly moving on from here now. Have to say that although mushrooms in Dawnshroud are good experience, I found the zone very laggy. I ended up doing 32-34 along the southern zone wall of Marus Seru killing Stonegrabbers. There's a multitude of these...especially near the Sanctus Seru zone. Also you can charm Greyhoppers if you like though I found charm very fickle and didnt really need them anyway. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Stragam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">To Sethanha: In order to alleviate the lagginess in certain zones, you will need to completely log out and log back in. Sometimes even rebooting the computer. I know it's a pain, but VI has not figured out that it's a memory leak in these zones with tons of trees. They flat out refuse to believe the trees cause lagginess. It happens in DL, too or any place where there is a lot of trees.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Canabull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Feerott...<br />
<br />
I ALWAYS have to log after zoning into/out of Feerott.<br />
<br />
I HATE that zone.  You can't see anything for the trees, and they are ugly as hell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xelot Bloodseer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The guards are pretty good XP as well. They should con blue to maybe yellow (for me at 31). Inside MS there are ~6... If you have problems there, inside NL there are 2 door guards at the MS zone and a wanderer that patrols from the door to the pillar.<br />
<br />
The only thing you have to watch out for is once in a while, one of the guards will be a paladin, not a warrior. LoH is a pain and they will chain heal themselves with a near endless supply of mana...<br />
<br />
They are good XP though... Plus they increase your Katta faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kolte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you need your faction back for killing the guards, you can kill the Rescuo's.  Something I found nifty in this zone is if you're still dubious to the Rescuo's, I killed tonnes and was still dubious, they wont attack you, so if you get a lightcrawler or zelniak, just train them to the rescuo's houses and they take 'em out for ya .. save yer precious mana.  :)<br />
<br />
*EDIT* Also quick note here, if you need cash, Rescuo's drop 2-4pp sometimes, as well as weapons and a Zelniak Hide Vest.</div></div><hr />

Warsilik Woods is the absolute worst lag I have ever experienced in the game. (besides the bazaar at busy time)</div></div><hr />
