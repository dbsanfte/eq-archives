I thought only runes were tradeable - once they are actually turned in for spells, are the results tradeable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jratkins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">once you turn in the rune the spell is no drop, hence you not seeing any shaman specific spells for sale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gumurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">there will be no oow spells in bazaar ever, the cool thing about the spell turn in, is there is a sequence for it, some of you probably already know this. The sequence gives you spells, so that you do not get duplicates, one reason the spells themselves not droppable probably.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Anybody who pays over 5k for a 66-68 rune must be on crack - if PoP is anything to go by in a few months they will be all over the place. <br />
<br />
If not, they will still be a LOT cheaper than just after the expansion has been released and then you can decide if you want to pay 20k+ or whatever for your runes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Setanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Lesser on AB going for 130K to 140K. Why anyone would want to buy them I don't know. They're the OoW equivalent of EPs. You can't give away EPs. Runes have an advantage in that they can be traded, but still couple of months and prices will bottom out. The really important ones anyway (69 and 70) are no drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Lvl 66 rune - 200k, only one for sale so far in Tribunal's bazaar.  There's also a kick ass item (forgot what it was, had like 4 regen, 4 mana regen from OoW) for 750k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Muramite rune(68) 800k(nobody touched it)<br />
Lesser(67) has been up in the 100k-300k range -- the former went fast the latter sat.<br />
Minor(66) 100k-250k -- again people are more than willing to pay 100k but not 250k<br />
<br />
As for that shield, I got mine for 80k...  Prices are already dropping a lot... Low enough that I bought a shield and that ac 10 +3 FT range item(140k).  I mean if those stupid ft3 boots go for 80k I cant see the range item ever going below that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I am still feedbacking that the level 66 runes drop from any mob, not just named....I know LOTS of level 67, 68 people that have yet to see a rune drop let alone get a rune to turn in for a spell.</div></div><hr />

Yep we've got a wonderful economy on BB :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">today and yesterday i saw atleast 3 people auctioning that they want to buy level 66 runes for 90k+! just insane.. some people have way too much money to throw around :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It's gonna take a month or two before the runes are reasonably priced, I hope.  I still do not have and lvl 66 runes (I have 2 lvl 67 and 2 lvl 68).  Of course, the @sshat crowd could keep the prices way high for a long time.  Best bet is to go and farm the runes yourself.  That's what I'm doing.  No way I'm paying 100k for anything, even epic 2.0 (if it could be sold).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Setanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">At least this expansion we have something to do while we wait for runes to start dropping more (whether in prices or from mobs) - plenty of time to gather up xp and loads of decent AA to spend it on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/shrug.  Its all perception.  I used to think 100k was a lot until I regularly had over a million plat.   There really is nothing to buy at that point when you have your twinks, that are rarely played, twinked out better than most mains, and you still have 1Mpp.   Would I pay 100k for a level 68 rune?<br />
<br />
Muramite Rune (68)<br />
1. Talisman of Sense<br />
2. Yoppa's Rain of Venom<br />
3. Pained Memory<br />
4. Spirit of Fortitude<br />
5. Yoppa's Mending<br />
6. Wunshi's Focusing<br />
<br />
Yep.  Considering I sold the level 65 spells from PoP at 100k each, I don't have a problem buying them for that.  Wouldn't be surprised if I end up buying them from the people I sold the PoP runes to.  Hell, the trash drops I'm getting out of GoD are selling for 40-50k.  Would I trade two of those drops I don't want when farming spells for a spell rune?  Hell yeah.<br />
<br />
Now, if you don't have that much plat, then sure, wait for them or get them yourself (Dranik's Hollow is easy).  But I'm tempted to just buy them.  Next rune gets me Yoppa's Rain of Venom, after that, yeah I'll pay 100k to get Pained Memory, Yoppa's Mending, and Wunshi's Focusing.</div></div><hr />

Problem is it doesnt seem to be Ebayers who buy them on BB.<br />
Only people I see offering extortianate pp for them on auc channel are from the 3 uber guilds who have rushed to level to 70 not trying to farm their spells on the way.<br />

We have a winner. People with millions of PP in their bank, nothing to buy, and pl'd to 70 in fire. They want their spells and don't want to wait. Law of supply and demand really. The supply right now is rather pathetic compared to number of 66+ casters and the demand is through the roof. It'll definately die down a bit over the next few weeks as those people with the hordes of cash buy all their required spells, but it'll be a long time before they are a few k because so many people need them. First they'll drop from the 100k+ range to the 10k+ range which will put them in reach of a lot more people like myself and they'll stay there a while until those people are all filled up and then it will continue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">BTW, that item for 750k is not the shield (and yes, it IS nice, I have it), it was a range slot item Stone of Tainted Health (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=71182)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">So far I have gotten 4 runes in the last 3 days: 2x66, 1x67, 1x68. All in single group stuff in either Nobles Causway or Walls of Slaughter. Someone was auctioning that they would buy runes for 100k. I sold one level 66 rune for 100k (which is 5 times more than I have ever had in my life...if people are stupid or lazy enough to pay for stuff that any 2 competent 65s could duo (named in NC are *****), I don't mind taking their plat. I'm thinking I might keep the others - the drop rate will be nerfed pretty soon.<br />
<br />
Just out of interest, In WoS last night we got 9 named in 12 pulls, for a total of 6 various runes...haha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I don't know how they could possibly nerf the drop rates on runes with how many are needed. I've spent most of my playing time since omens when live in the new zones and seen a grand total of two drop. I think you've just gotten lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Lucky, maybe, but also maybe not....<br />
<br />
We were chain pulling last night and once we got the various spawns broken, we were getting named like every 10 minutes tops, and in a hectic 2 hours, we all got at least 2 runes and some cash loot... We were getting up to 3 named at a time! When we stopped, there were still named up, but sleep got the better of us.<br />
<br />
Send me a PM if you want to know the spot we were pulling (and it was not an uber group - we had an EP tank, but apart from that nothing particularly special)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Heh, guess thats my probably. Torvo usually has about 150 people in wos, 10 trains a minute, rampanat KS'n and camp stealin. I've been avoiding it like the plague and sticking to lost city of dranik. They just need to spread out the loving some to other zones.</div></div><hr />
