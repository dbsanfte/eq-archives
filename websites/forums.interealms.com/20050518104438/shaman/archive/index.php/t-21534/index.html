<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night I had some RL to deal with so I set up my trader as usual, switched off my monitor and went out.<br />
<br />
When I came back about 5 hours later I was at the server selection screen with a message saying I had been inactive too long and had been booted!!<br />
<br />
This has made the bazaar almost laughable, when everyone realises this new timer they will stop setting up a trader.......the bazaar will become another EC traders tunnel with people sitting at their PC shouting auctions at one another. /rant off :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shamad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hehe, I can see where the confusion is coming from, but fret not! The message you saw was only the message you usualy see when you're at server slect screen (ONLY) for an extended period of time (read: 20 seconds).<br />
<br />
You most likely LD'd to server select, then sever select booted you due to inactivity. <br />
<br />
If you dont believe me, log into server select, then go afk for a short while. you'll get the same message. ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ah thx m8. That would make sence.<br />
<br />
Will give it a try tonight :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Same thing has happened to me last 2 nights in a row.  I'll watch it over the next few days to see if it is the usual LD, or a new timer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actualy, i think making the bazaar more EC like would be good. I mean the best of both worlds. You have people around to haggle with, but you dont have people going /auction WTS a bag of &quot;stuff&quot;.<br />
<br />
You can check the stuff they have then decide to haggle without searching them down. That was the one thing i never liked about the bazaar and it make it too easy and i dunno, inorganic ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The bazaar on Terris is full of a lot of /auc spam selling stuff...some from traders, some from regular people.  Many people like to advertise.  So I guess ours is like a combo of EC and bazaar a bit.  Not sure how much haggling goes on though.  Prices are already &quot;pre-haggled&quot; anyway, when you get someone that just wants to sell and undercuts the hell out of everyone else ;).<br />
<br />
On topic, my trader was up all night last night, no problems.  Agree with other posts.  If I go LD, I am never ever at the char select screen in the morning, I am always at the login screen.  It times out eventually.<br />
<br />
Mach the Grump</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Heh the bazaar on Karana is never, ever quiet. Would you believe that some folks put their trader up, and instead of walking away from the computer, actually sit there and /ooc stuff? It's amazing. I can walk into our bazaar on almost any night and have a chance of seeing class balance discussions, /ooc duel challenges (this was really great one night when one guy /ooc'ed that he smacked another across the face with plate gloves, lol, the whole bazaar was cheering them on), auctions, haggling, etc. etc. It's a nutty place, it is. I kind of miss the days of EC, though.<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Xev's 'Bizaare' runs the gamut from the noobs / lazy &quot;Does anybody have anything for a {Class-Race}&quot;? to the political discussions to the people running scams - er casinos.  I haven't seen odds like that since NC State won the NCAA's back in 1983.<br />
<br />
The numbers in our bazaar are back up too. <br />
<br />
And it gets REALLY wierd around 0300 in the a.m. (EST).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Rodcet's baz is pretty noisy, too, but I turn all that off on my second computer.<br />
<br />
I don't like haggling, but if you want to deal in trades sometimes you have to.  I just sell the stuff for cash and deal in cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Angilia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Its do to LD<br />
been happening more and more often to people in POK and Bazaar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">All sorts of chatter in Bristlebane Bazaar.<br />
<br />
Used to be third of it was people hawking wares in OOC and Shout, and two thirds telling them to go to auction channel.<br />
<br />
Now it's pretty much 1/3 hawking, 1/3 conversation, and 1/3 gambling spam.<br />
<br />
Place gets MUCH quieter when you /ignore the gamblers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Haven't managed to stay online for any significant amount of time in the bazaar since the dx9 changes... My vendor is about to explode if I add anything but unless I stay beside it and watch he's no online long enough to sell anything.</div></div><hr />

Kinda sounds like your talking about an in game auction system. I didnt read the other posts, but I like this idea alot. I played EQOA Frontiers (yes, omg, i played ps2 version and had some fun actually) and experienced first hand the auction system on there. I think it it much better then bazaar. They also have it in wow, or just put it in (although im not in beta).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sladeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I know and it's been confirmed by others that sometimes your trader is taken off the block if you leave it online for a long enough time.  Several times I've logged in after having my trader online all night and did a new search but not found any of his goods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Torv's bazaar is either really quiet or really noisy. Sometimes when I just want to log in and chat I'll hang out on my trader and participate in the spam and send friends tells etc. Sometimes I'll be on for a while looking for upgrades or trying to buy low sell high and participate etc. The bazaar is still sort of a social center on torv, along with pok and pot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Angilia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">FYI for those having those repeated booting issues in pok and bazaar try the following.<br />
<br />
Add HardwareTnL=FALSE to the eqclient Default section.<br />
I used to crash every 5 minutes in pok and bazaar and on occasion zoning. Made this change based on EQwebsite info and no more issues.<br />
<br />
My setup is AMD 2600 with a geforce 5200 card and 512 memory. So not a shabby system.<br />
<br />
HardwareTnL=TRUE/FALSE - This will force Hardware Texture and Lighting either on or off.  This is a line you would manually input into your eqclient.ini, and only for troubleshooting purposes.<br />
<br />
They also suggest<br />
VSYNC=1<br />
<br />
VSync=0/1 - This either tells EverQuest to wait for the vertical syncing of the monitor before updating the display or no.  This can prevent visual tearing (if set to 1).  Recommended default is 1.  This line is something that would need to be manually inputted into the eqclient.ini, as the game does not provide it by default.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;WTS a bag of stuff at T1&quot; was one of the most common auctions in EC, as I recall, at least on TM.  It drove me nuts too, because it piqued my curiosity, but it was always junk.  I still had to go look at every single one, though, in case I found a bargain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Aramous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Not sure if this was brought up or not but there is a limit to how many sellers are in the bazaar. Therefore, Mages will cast MGB Mod Rod in the bazaar to make room. For some reason some will go LD because of this and then they will get your spot so they can sell.  Happend to me only once but many times I would wake up and my seller has a rod.</div></div><hr />
