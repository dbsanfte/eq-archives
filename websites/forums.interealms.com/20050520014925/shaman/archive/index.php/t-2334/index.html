P.S.  I read on another board that Gob's inb Droga were dropping a new kind of ore after the last patch...any chance thse gobs in Nurga dropping ore?  There is a mine there.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This was the long-awaiting re-vamp of nurga.  It seems to have been overlooked with the focus items in the last patch.  Pretty much everything except goblins are gone now.  The goblins are higher level now, however, half blue and half light blue at 48.<br />
<br />
(edit)  Didn't see any new ore, just stone keys.</div></div><hr />
