<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anybody have good locations and techniques for powerleveling caster types?   Where should I take a lvl 19 cleric for best PL?  Where should I take a 28 druid?  What about a 16 chanter?<br />
<br />
I've been treating them like tanks through about 19 or 20, but the damage output starts to really suck and I have to start nuking, which means med time.<br />
<br />
I've had them both in LOIO all this time because of the wide level range.  The druid has just recently moved on to FM.  Are there better locations?  On the moon, perhaps?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well...<br />
<br />
are you able to make damage shield potions?<br />
<br />
I know when I pl'ed my necro, I was using a druid to do it.<br />
<br />
I took him to swamp of no hope...the skele ruins.<br />
<br />
Would buff him up, damage shield then let him pull 3 of the skeles there.  Would melee em down(think the ds did more damage..haha) and keep him healed.  Since they don't run, you don't have to worry about finishing them off with your shaman.<br />
<br />
Try to find anything that's undead...that is if you can keep him stocked with the ds pots.<br />
<br />
It's hard as hell to PL a caster from my experience.  It certainly can be done, but it's sooo much easier to pl a melee.  Good luck to ya!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, I could make DS potions, but it's damned expensive, and I had some weirdness when I tried using a combination of the druid's DS and my shaman pet to PL a character on my wife's account - seems that if I was using a DS, I couldn't sic the pet at halfway without stealing the kill from the lowbie.  Half the advantage that I have right now is that I can sic my pet at halfway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">DS potions are drinker's level based, either level/4 or level /2  - not really worth it for Pling.  <br />
<br />
Only thing I have done that worked is to solo and cripple a mob that cons red to the PLee until it runs and camp out and let them finish it with melee.  I affectionately call this method &quot;Ghetto Mem-blur.&quot;  It seemed to  work, but I am not a big PLer, so It may have been kinda slow. <br />
<br />
PLing casters is just hard.  Druids are better equipped for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Paludal Caves.  End of Story.  You will get more xp there without PLing than anywhere else WITH PLing.  Good into your high 20s.<br />
<br />
I would suggest getting a hunting partner and PLing both of them with your shaman.  Its so easy.  Hell, just have the caster stand there while your Shaman heals/hastes/buffs the tank.<br />
<br />
DS potions suck since they are based on the level of the drinker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lorace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Paludal Caverns is far and away the best place for up to level 23 or so.  Almost nothing runs when low on health, and there are endless pulls.  The zone is broken into several level ranges, and the xp modifier seems to be massive.<br />
<br />
I have no idea how you are doing it, but I was using a 51 druid with the 24-point damage shield/SLN/chloro to PL a shaman after switching servers, and found you could get from 1 to 20+ in a single night there.  It was easy to always have 3 critters on me at a time taking damage from the shield.<br />
<br />
After that, I moved to Marus Seru and found it great up to level 30 or so.  The south end near the zone to Sanctus is best.   You will have to throw a root on the critters here when they run so that they stay and keep beating on the damage shields (really hope you are using Damage shields, or it will be very slow going with a caster)  I definitely agree with Nazgruul that it is WAY harder to PL a caster than a melee type.  Takes a lot more time, and much more effort.  There are other ways to do it besides damage shields, such as beating stuff down, using memory blur/atone, and finishing off with the caster.  <br />
<br />
As has been mentioned above, your best bet with a high level shaman is to recruit a melee class to join your little group, and keep them buffed/hasted/healed while your lower character sits there.<br />
<br />
Not that you asked, but I don't recommend powerleveling a class that you haven't played to a high level before or otherwise know well.  You learn a lot more than you think about a class at the lower levels.  (I'm only doing it now because I already played a shaman to level 57 on my original server)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Netherbian Lair would be good at 19. Let your Cleric beat/nuke them down to half, then you cast your JBB (if you have one) on the target. I am doing this with my warrior alt. Obviously, we are ungrouped or it wouldn't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree with Paludal Caverns.  Single pull targets for the caster, MalXXX the target, root, cripple, heal the caster.  I did this to help get a caster friend to 45 in OOT on spec isle.  Finish off the casters mob at 33% health.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I actually more or less agree with you.   I don't plan to inflict a group of strangers with them.<br />
<br />
I do plan to start playing the cleric for real when he catches up to some RL friends who are around 35 now.  Hopefully my knowledge of the class will catch up in the 40's somewhere.  <br />
<br />
The druid will probably never gain another level after he gets his first Velious port (34, I think).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kappy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">With a high level druid and a little help, powerleveling casters becomes easy. Things that help: Fungi Tunic (for druid), Velious BP (no mana regrowth), lvl 60 helps even more, as does good AC.<br />
<br />
Lets say the caster is 20, and the druid is 55+ with fungi tunic\regrowth on them. They are in SolA. The druid pulls three mobs, around the casters level. The druid has a 32+6pt damage shield for 38 damage per hit. The druid doesn't attack the mobs at all, but since he pulled with snare they stay on him. The caster attacks each of the mobs until he does 1pt of damage to each of them, more if you want. The mobs will kill themselves on the druids DS. The last mob of the 3 will want to run away so either the caster has to do 10 damage to it so the druid can root it , or just have the caster root the mob so it attacks the druid again. 3 exp kills for the caster and the druid should be nearly full mana and just 1 heal or so. Works good up to level 50, try lower guk once solA goes green.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>XmaX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The reason youre lowbie wasnt getting xp while using DS and the pet technique is because the pet was doiing more damage...<br />
<br />
<br />
If you use a DS all the caster has to do is hit the mob once and he will get the xp... but he has to do it himself till the end.<br />
<br />
If you use a DS and it does the majority of the damage and then sick a pet at halfway the pet will still do more damage so you have to pick one or the other.<br />
<br />
As far as locations undead is good for DS and if you using a pet to finnish em off then youre locations loio and fm are fine places.</div></div><hr />

Paludal Caves.  End of Story.  You will get more xp there without PLing than anywhere else WITH PLing.  Good into your high 20s.<br />
<br />
<br />
I leveled my Var Shir Shaman in the Paludal Caves. It's simply the most incredible XP earning spot that found in the game so far. In my low 20s, a partner and me were able to gain a level a night. Once we were done with the caves, we moved on to the Netherbian Lair and beyond. I'm still soloing a bit a Dawnshroud Peaks. At lv43 there are still a ton of dark blue mobs which earn anywhere from 1/4-1/3 of a blue bar per kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>ludgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I completely agree with snapdragon.  When i PL my chanter or cleric, i just shout, &quot; Shaman L59 looking for random melee L___ to powerlevel. &quot;  They come running. Shaman powers melee, and caster tosses in nukes, buffs, heals etc to keep skills up.<br />
<br />
I have also Jbb's the mob till it walks, then memblured/logged/zoned, etc, but I found that is actually slower than just buffing, speeding and regening a monk (hell even a ranger), and sending in the dog at half life.  <br />
<br />
I do occasionally use the damage shield method though, just to get ac up by letting the caster get hit for defense points. Important to do this while he can survive it more than 3 hits.<br />
<br />
as for locations, I pl'd alot in King Xorbb's lair, perma, f vie drovarg camps, lower guk.  along with site mentioned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Doh...I didn't know ds potions were dependent on the drinker.<br />
<br />
Guess that idea's out the window :)<br />
<br />
I do agree with the others about Paludal Caverns.  THE best experience I've ever seen for mid teens to mid 20's.<br />
<br />
My troll shaman is still there at lvl 25 solo'ing the bandits and getting good exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lorace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Only problem with the bandits in Paludal is that (at least on Ayonae Ro) they are ALWAYS camped and not available for powerleveling.  For that reason, depending on server and the hours you play, that zone may cap out around 23 when the shik'nar start to turn light blue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">A few stratgies I've found for powerleveling....<br />
<br />
1) Frontier mountains for late 20's/30's<br />
<br />
Go into the fort and find 5 meles (or 4 meles and a cleric if your twink is a mele/int caster)<br />
Buff the hell out of them.<br />
Pull with the JBB, and hit each giant twice with a JBB, craigs 3 times (i think)<br />
Have up to 2 giants pounding on you while your group pulls 1/2 dead giants off of you to finish.<br />
<br />
Help with heals as required<br />
<br />
Could get a level in 3 hours no problem.   May not be the most efficient way, but it is probably the most fun I've ever had p-lvl'n....  5 ppl think you are god, and you power level random people that don't have that pleasure normally...  Definitley a fun evening of powerleveling.  Also a good chance go hand out 'Junk' weapons that I collect from various zones.  Adjust and apply to other zones as appropriate.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) DS potion<br />
Mem up that l33t lvl 1 DD spell...<br />
Take a swig off of a DS potion, and pull as many<br />
mobs as you can tank at once...  Topor as required.  When the mobs start running away or<br />
is very low on health, Stand your caster and DD it<br />
to death....<br />
<br />
<br />
Stratagy one is a blast, and I'd highly recommend it.  Hell even if you're just walking through the giant fort and bored try it out without a twink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">There are two ways I know of to give a noob caster unlimited mana for nuking. <br />
<br />
1) Modrod2 mage + cleric or Torpor-casting-shaman.  Mage uses modrods to make mana to make more modrods for the noob caster to use.  Each mod rod has a potential 600 mana in it for the noob.  All you need to do is heal the damage it causes them.  <br />
This process is kinda resource intensive, as it requires two specific classes to PL one.<br />
<br />
2) Necrolicious twitching.  This works for quite a while as the necro can actually aid in dmging the mob and then FD.  Also snares make it easy for the noob caster to deal with and avoid the mob.  Necros have mad mana regen anyway, so that should be all you need for good PLing.  Necros can heal over time as well, provided there are mobs about to lifetap.  <br />
<br />
The last method is to invite an enchanter of the same level into the group.  The chanter mem blurs the mob after it has started to run, then your noob caster nukes it dead easily.  Breeze/clarity keeps your noob in plenty of mana for this small task.  <br />
<br />
However you do it, PLing is not much fun after the first hour or so.  It gets old fast, and IMHO it's stupid to play a game if yer not having fun.</div></div><hr />
