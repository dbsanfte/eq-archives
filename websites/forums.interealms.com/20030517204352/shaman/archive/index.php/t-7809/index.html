<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Errun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hard choice here.<br />
<br />
Belt of Mithaniel<br />
<br />
+8 AC +12 Str +10 Sta +10 Wis +10 Int +55 HP +45 Mana +3.00 Wt  <br />
<br />
Or<br />
<br />
Artificer's Ringmail Skirt<br />
<br />
15 AC 5 Wis 40 HP 40 Mana</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hp + mana &gt; ac in my book. This is a no brainer for me, i would choose belt of mithaniel:<br />
<br />
essentially its:<br />
<br />
10STA, 10WIS, 55HP, 45MANA<br />
<br />
vs<br />
<br />
5WIS, 40HP, 40MANA<br />
<br />
7 ac isnt gonna make that much of a diff, and those hp and mana will prove extremely useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Andal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hard call.  PoP mobs hit very hard, so in my mind AC is still a big factor.<br />
<br />
7 AC is quite a lot to give up, althought the STA of the Mithaniel is very nice.<br />
<br />
I think if I could wear the Mithaniel and keep my AC at 1000 or better I would.   Otherwise I'd stay with the Artificers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
7 Ac is a lot? 7 AC in PoP is like holding paper up as a shield. With my shield on and buffs i can have 1400 AC, I get hit as hard at 1400 as i do totally buffless and with my Staff of Lost Rites in hand giving me an AC of 1226. Having 1012ac (just a rough number) then adding 12 ac (7 ac plus ac bonus) wont make a damn bit of difference when factoring the hit damage.<br />
<br />
Go for the Mith belt, it gives 10 stamina (30 hit points thiere alone) then more raw Hps, Mana. Its a decent belt and way nice than that other one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Omakay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">throw one more into the mix...<br />
<br />
Bone Clasped Girdle<br />
<br />
AC4 Str7 Sta7 Dex7 hp 75 mana 75 and Extendend Affliction III <br />
<br />
thoughts? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">option 1, go with belt of Mith<br />
option 2, go with BCG<br />
<br />
EDIT: on option 2, if AC &lt;1k and especially if wis&gt;200</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you can get the bone clapsed girdle go with that, but its expensive if you are buying.  All my affliction spells that I am using are 60 or below so they work with the focus, no POP dots/debuffs here.  If you just want the effect its easy enough to get that off the coldain military wristguard.<br />
<br />
Otherwise Girdle of Mithaniel is a nice belt, I wear it over my belt from Cazic Thule.<br />
<br />
10 sta and 10 wis is still very beneficial for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Errun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">FYI,<br />
<br />
With BoA &amp; C3 buffs<br />
<br />
AC is at 1100 and Wisdom is 257.  Almost to level 62 so max wisdom will be 265 at that time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Andal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would give up AC for Extended Affliction 3.<br />
<br />
As to the AC is nothing, your example could as easily be used to say 30 hp is nothing.<br />
<br />
AC is still a factor to be considered, though each of us might give it differing weight in our personal calculations.  You choose to dismiss it as a consideration, that's fine.<br />
<br />
I don't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ac after you hit the soft cap wont do much for you but till then its nice to have.</div></div><hr />
