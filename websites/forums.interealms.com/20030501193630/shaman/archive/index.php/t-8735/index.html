<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Santero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Have you seen the last thread in the mobhunter web page?<br />
<br />
Is something like this:<br />
<br />
&quot;Bohoo, the nasty and evil European players are killing all my ubber mobs and I cannot prevent this. Boohoo&quot;<br />
<br />
Ok, bro. For years the US ubberguilds have been monopolizing all the big bosses in the game without any complains from the European players. Now is the time for US players to taste your own medicine!!! I think it is fair.</div></div><hr />

If your attitude is representative of the types the game would lose, then yes. <br />
<br />
Although I usually don't even take into consideration where someone is from or which side of the ocean they live on. I make decisions about a persons individual character, not their nationality.<br />
<br />
But again...re-read my first statement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I dont think it'd be better without Euro/Aisian players. For one you'd lose me! I'm on AB, and we have an all american guild on our server that does what the all-european guilds do on your servers, I dont dislike them (I dislike the way they started, but thats a different matter, poaching half the members from my old guild which lead ultimatly to its demise) and they are nice people. Fair play to them if they want to kill things when noone else is awake</div></div><hr />

Don't like my country? Get the hell out of it.<br />
<br />
Don't like my country? Don't play our games.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think this attitude helps either.  Americans have a rep worldwide  for being arrogant and this feeds the fire.  Exactly what makes this an &quot;American Game?&quot;  The fact that it was stated in America?  I'm sure Sony wouldn't agree that it's exclusively American.  Don't make us all look like asses.<br />
<br />
I'm in a Euroguild, which sutes my playtimes better than a 'Merican one does.  I certainly feel for the PST guilds, because people in front of them tend to take the mobs they need too.  If it weren't for the Euroguilds taking the mobs, it'd be the EST guilds doing it though.  On my server, we had a couple of strong Asian guilds (Sanctuary and Eastern Faith) that would clear every named every time the server came back up, so I feel your pain.<br />

<br />
For the record, that post was in response to another post by the originator. His post was deleted, therefore I just deleted mine.<br />
<br />
But I still hold my ground. Don't like my country...you (general term) figure it out.<br />
<br />
Why would I question your patriotism? I never served, but my younger brother did as well as a few friends during my lifes journey. I'd never question the patriotism of our enlisted (active or otherwise) men and women.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fumeden Ex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">/agree FinalJustice.  that attitude is just not acceptable. In my 10 years (so far) in the military Ive been to 12 different countries, and they all think were a bunch of arrogant PoS because of statements like that.   And a reminder, Sony is a JAPANESE corporation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes, SONY is a Japanese company, but the company that originally developed Everquest was 100% based in America. 989 Studios, and later Verant Interactive were the founders. SONY simply bought 'em out.<br />
<br />
Let's not lose focus of the original posters intent which was nothing more than to bash Americans. If you (again, general term) are spineless enough to sit back and take it, well...that's your choice. But I won't let crap like that slide without at least voicing my opinion. If you don't like my opinion, big friggin deal. Trust me, I won't lose sleep over you not liking it. Just as I'm sure Euro-undie-wadded-wanker_00 (original poster) won't lose any sleep over my opinion of him, and I'm perfectly ok with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The problem I have is with the grouping.  You refer to him as a Euro, which is one step away from saying all Europeans have this attitude.  The opposite is exactly the same case.  I don't want to be lumped with anyone else's opinion just because I happen to be American.  Was his attitude pretty crappy?  Yes, but it's HIS attitude, not something handed to people born in Europe with their birth certificates.<br />
<br />
And whether or not 988 is an American company is beside the picture.  When Sony bought the program, they bought it with a business plan that included worldwide access to the servers (which is why the software's available overseas and doesn't need to be smuggled or anything).  And what was 988's business plan?  Did they intend it to be only American or did they have the same idea?<br />
<br />
Sony's been adding a random factor to make it easier for guilds on the western end of the time zones to get the choice mob, and that's a good way of handling an international logistics problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Finaljustice...please note in my original response above that I qualified my statement by relating it specifically to HIS attitude. I simply said if that's the type of attitude it would eliminate, then  yes...EQ would be a better game. There was no global statement or accusation that all European players actually posessed that attitude, but rather IF they did...<br />
<br />
You don't see the distinction?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Being a so called piece of Eurotrash (a name used on the webpage from the copeting US guilds) I can only say 1 thing to any US player whining about time zone advantage.<br />
<br />
Thank your brothers that made KB a non transfer server. My guild was ready to move (as where a lot of euro guilds) when the demand (from US players) for a fresh server made the KB server a fresh one.<br />
<br />
After that we (as in my guild) get a lot of crap about having a time zone advantage while in reality the Asian guys get more mobs to kill(they often fail but that is not the point), the euro time zone has no reall advantage at this point in time. Patches are simply to short for us to have that advantage.<br />
<br />
And Mobhunter lost me as a reader after his posts about the shamans (remember the &quot;stinking shamans&quot;remark he made).<br />
<br />
If you are from the US and want the euro players to leave your server? <br />
Write SoE and ask them to make new euro servers with transfer options, I bet you soon will find yourself all alone with your fellow US players.<br />
<br />
Nuff said</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">eh, all sides get their turns.  euros dominate some spawns for a while, then americans get them, then asians, then it starts all over.  <br />
<br />
as far as what this thread has degenerated into, i dunno, but i do think such arguments are silly (see my first sentence).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">So make sure more mobs are on random timers.<br />
<br />
Lower the amount of time on the spawns that are critical for advancement into certain parts of the game and the ones that you can blow for other people. Faster spawning mobs with smaller loot tables perhaps (I feel dirty for even saying that)<br />
<br />
Stagger the patch times (yeah like this is gonna happen)<br />
<br />
I get both the good and the bad of the patches since I do most of my exping at around noon gmt. Which means that ón patch day I can pretty much kiss any exp bye bye but get more targets to raid instead.<br />
<br />
I can understand how people feel this is unfair but would it truly be better to make sure all these &quot;on server up mobs&quot; spawn in the us prime time instead? Two wrongs doesnt make a right, so if soe decides to take a look at the situation I truly hope they figure out how to find a middleground that doesnt involve screwing one side over until they beg for mercy<br />
<br />
But if they made a system that forced spawns to pop during us prime time, where would that leave the people on ab and kb? Would we get our own code for the timers or would we be screwed using the old zek principal &quot;you are so few so why should the rest of us give a flying ****?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Make a detailed quest that forces the spawn on completion.  Your group/guild could only kill it on completion of the quest.  The mob would be there every time upon completion.  That's really the only way to go about this.<br />
<br />
Time delayed rare spawns based on server reboot  or death of the last spawn- stupidest idea ever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Actually the reason they Patch at the times they do is to affect as little customers as possible.<br />
And with the Uber raiding players being less then 10% of the customers I guess you can see why they patch during the hours little or no US customers are online.<br />

Regular camps can't be gotten by the time I get home, so who gets what boss doesn't matter a whole lot to me.  Change the spawn times?

What Moogard wrote on his webpage is an insult to all non-us player. I quite sure that most non-us player are aware of the problem, but what do you expect us to do? Let mobs live so that the poor PST player can kill them too? The US playerbase gets the advantage of no patches in their prime time and suffer from server-up spawns. Either make those spawns on a timer or triggered. Can't be too difficult.<br />

I work odd hours on call and on a rotating shift, so things may or may not be up when I play.  Makes for merry hell guilding, though, since I can't really plan things out.  Ergo, I'm that &quot;casual player&quot; that never sees these darn things alive in any event.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind randomizing the spawn times some.  Say Dru Sathir repops every 72 hrs.  Shouldn't be hard to add something that can add or subtract up to 12 hrs to the time.<br />

It'll still go to the folks that can mobilize in time to get the goods.<br />

I guess I was making too much of a joke and wasn't clear enough on my post.    I understand the reason's why a data center patchs on the time frames they patch ... and agree with it in principle.    <br />
<br />
But I believe that from a customer perspective spawns of Major mobs should NOT pop or start timing off a reboots.    Spawns should be random ... and non responsive to reboot or patching or whatnot's on server worlds.   That would solve most of these problems.   <br />
 <br />
I don't think there is a perfect time to restart a server that is used by players across world time zones ... but at least from a efficence side of things ... you patch based on least load and longest time frame for the outage.   AM hours are normal ... and since most of the servers are in the States ... it just falls into place that it's going to happen during the US AM hours.   I'm sure those tech folks would MUCH later being doing these reboots between 1PM and 5PM ... along with a good donut break in the middle.</div></div><hr />
