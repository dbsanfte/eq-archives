<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moonmist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wow.. This blows. I have no idea where to go. I am an Iksar Shaman, so no blowing away mobs with JBB. <br />
Right now I'm sitting in OT, i just got half a blue in 2 kills. So 4 kills = 1 blue. 5x4 = 20 kills to get a yellow. I'm sure thats good, but ya know I'm looking for some old dungeons that people don't go to. I tried Nurga, but i got lost so quick. Should I head back there after I buy the summon pet to loc spell?.. <br />
<br />
Okay getting offtopic.. Where the hell should I go? I don't have SoL or a JBB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">City of Mist got me through Levels 44-47, though I understand there is a new, random Necromancer spawn that might cause trouble for you. It's a good dungeon as melees can bind inside.<br />
<br />
Spirocs in Timorous Deep are also a possibility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nurga is great at your level, awesome experience and its very easy to get to the spiders, you can level here to 48.<br />
<br />
Cast Sow and Levitate before entering the mines.   Now Cast Shrink twice and Cast invisable then run up the waterfall.  <br />
<br />
From their pretty much follow the hall, you will come to an open area with railroad tracks, just keep going straight, the opening is slightly left.<br />
<br />
From their follow the pathway again and then you will come to another large open area, if you look straight and slightly left again you will see another opening, at this opening you MIGHT see a spider their, becareful passing it as some spiders can see invisable, once you get thru the opening you will see 2 spawns on your left then go a few steps further you will see 2 spawns on your right.  <br />
<br />
If you go alittle further you will see a sleeping ogre which is a monk quest npc, if he agros kill it, not your fault, just blame on the imaginary guy who was their before you. ;)<br />
<br />
Pass the sleeping ogre to your right lies 8 more spawns (2 spawn, 3 spawn and 3 spawn), this one can be alittle tricky as you might pull 3 so you have to becareful.<br />
<br />
Best way to break the spawns is to enstill one, use it to pull the other(s), keep it enstill to the first is killed.  Once you kill one then enstill the it again the camp out to kill agro and break the spawn.  <br />
<br />
If you have to many and cant handle it just enstill them all and camp out to kill agro or bind outside and gate.  <br />
<br />
Try to get the 4 spawn at your level, when you get alittle higher you can single pull some, then you can go to the other spawns.  With no JBB and at your level I was doing the 4 spawns steady and the other spawns at 47 I can do the 5 out of the 8 spawn easy till 48, you can probaly stay to 49 but the exp starts to slow down a bit, this is when I went to Spiroc island in TD but thats another threade. :)<br />
<br />
Good Luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>serendipede</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok I'm level 45 and I've been doing sol B in the named or bats in bugs groups great exp there and DL if you get into a chain pulling group exp can be great i got 2 yellows in just under 3 hours the other day at 45 in dl and exp is even better in solb bcs of exp bonus or you can solo orcs in crystal caverns too. Just my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Squints</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am 45 right now, I have been trying to look for a good place to solo to 50 myself.. Spirocs seem like a good place. How would I get there though?  Being a troll with Cazic as my worship makes it difficult to get into the Freeport docs, I would think ide be KOS there, but maybe not, or could I just invis myself and head there and see if I could get away with it that way?  Unless there is another way to get to that island.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Squints,<br />
<br />
Yes, you can just invisable your self to go through freeport BUT the Spirocs you are referring to are in TD (Timorus Deep).<br />
<br />
To get to the Spirocs, go to Oasis and catch the barge at the docks.  When you get off the Barge go to the other side of the beach, make a left and follow shore. Soon you will see 1 little bird house with 1 or 2 spawns, cant remember, go pass that and you will see a Large bird house with multiple spawns.<br />
<br />
Refer to #2 on the map<br />

Easiest to toughest mobs<br />
<br />
Spiroc Lightfoot<br />
Spiroc Watcher<br />
Spiroc Procax? something like that<br />
Spiroc Warrior<br />
Spiroc Lighthealer? I think thats the name<br />
<br />
The Warrior's and Lighthealers are up on the mountain, dont bother with them, they not worth it and you probaly die.  Just fight the ones in the big bird house and becareful when you pull as they mob and you have 2-3 wanderers.  One more things, dont turn your back on the procax, they back stab hard, bastards killed me once as I was meddin.<br />
<br />
Just for your info I leveled here 47-51 in about 20 hours by rooting and using JBB, I was taking up 3 pulls at a time doing this.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Spiroc Procax = Spiroc Proven (rogue)<br />
Spiroc Lighthealer = Spiroc Lightbringer (paladin)<br />
<br />
It's true that the Warriors (who are actually shamans) and, even moreso, Lightbringers are tougher than the other Spirocs, but with a Shadowknight or Necromancer in my group we had no trouble with these guys, even at Level 45. The Warriors are somewhere around Level 40-45, and the Lightbringers are always Level 50. Just fear the Lightbringers and you'll be okay. They drop Level 51+ Kunark spells and Level 49 spell research components.<br />
<br />
Solo it's another matter: I didn't start soloing the Warriors until around Level 48, and, though I was able to solo the Lightbringers at Level 50 with pet kiting, it would take about 10 minutes and really wasn't worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Recently got a C3 and went to kill spirocs. The exp was pretty bad at lvl 45, but at 46 the exp was much better ;)<br />
<br />
If I had a jbb it would be so much easier. Also want a REIF but there's no chance of me getting either :( <br />
<br />
Only tough thing about them is their hp. They have lots of hp and can hit me for up to 97 dmg. If you can land slow they're nothing. :p <br />
<br />
I was also killing oowomp while waiting. Got 2 batskull earrings in 3 kills :D</div></div><hr />

JBB: jaundiced bone bracer, a non-iksar-shaman only bracer with right-click 8-second 263-pt cold-based DD, widely (but not universally, ask any iksar) regarded as the most game-changing shaman item short of the epic. rare drop off arch-duke iatol in the sebilis crypt, prices range from 12,000 to 25,000+ pp depending on your server and degree of desperation.</div></div><hr />
