<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So the other day I decided I would buy a lvl 19 spell which I had previously deleted, much to the amusement of my guild shaman for the fact I got lost in Shar Vahl several times(used to buy spells in Grobb pff) and that I was intent on buying this lvl 19 spell called Malaise.<br />
<br />
The thing is with Malaise its negative 20pr/cr/fr and mr. And its the quickest casting Malosini line we have. For me it takes 2.2 seconds with Blessing of reverence. What I can afford to do it knock 20 resists off a ldon mob who maybe just off ninja slowable, and then  be able to cast slow again by the time the recast time has popped back up.<br />
So for me I am using it a fair bit which you may think is odd but its very useful rediscovered tool for me.<br />
I am curious then whether anyone else uses this method and has used it a while or has recently rediscovered this spell as a valuable addition to the spellset.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cepheusRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is a silly question, but HTF do you delete a spell from your spellbook?  I spent about 1 minute looking into doing this the other day (I hate clutter) and I couldn't seem to figure it out.  Any help?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You delete one much like you swap one.  Right click it and you get some text about swapping and deleting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Do NOT delete spells!<br />
<br />
I made that mistake when I was 53 or so, and I still regret it to this day.  If you don't use them, just move them to pages 40-50.  You may need them some day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bleh, I don't agree on that one, you can only delete vendor purchased ones, so if you REALLY need it later you can get it.   If you delete all the old buffs you ahve a real quick and easy (and truthful) excuse when begged by newbs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>snatzie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">LOL!  Too bad no one is responding to the actual posted topic.  <br />
<br />
I think this is a good idea and will give it a try.  Just because a spell is lower level doesn't mean it is not useful.<br />
<br />
I think using the lowest level malo that gets the job done is the way to go.  Its only common sense to conserve mana.<br />
<br />
In fact, I sometimes conserve mana by buffing non-MTers with one drop down in buffs.  Don't tell them they usually don't notice as long as the icon is the correct one, hehe...<br />
<br />
Ok... now back to the spellbook... ;)<br />
<br />
Which is more anal:<br />
1) Deleting spells when you get new ones to avoid clutter.<br />
2) Moving old spells back into the back of your book, having 1 page per type of spell, and sorting each type of spell by level.<br />
<br />
Sadly, my spellbook has the latter.  I can't imagine deleting something... I'm too much of a pack rat... but I can't stand clutter either... sigh!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I used to move old spells to the back and organize them by lines. After 4 years and reinstalling EQ on 2 new computers, I got tired of that and now I just toss them back to any open spot out of the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>papiraul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I see no reason even to organize your spellbook now that all spells are selectable in a menusystem if you just right click a spellgem slot..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Slow is disease based, how does this help us cast slow?<br />
Slow ADDS disease counters but is magic based for the resistance check. <br />

<br />
I personally wouldn't bother with Malaise, but I have a  Rod of Malisement  (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=10374)  from Phinney in inventory just in case of emergencies for similar reasons.  Insta-cast debuff can come in handy on occasion, though I doubt I'll fetch another one once the one I have runs out of charges.<br />
<br />
Interesting strategy though, thanks for sharing it.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">ACK!!<br />
<br />
Slow adds DISEASE COUNTERS, but it still checks on MR.  Ask your buddy Lucy!! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Looking at Lucy, Malaise is 3 second cast, 6 second recast, -20 to FR, CR, PR, MR, 60 mana.<br />
<br />
Malosinia is 3.25 second cast, 2.25 second recast, -70 to the same resists, 300 mana.<br />
<br />
The only reason to case malaise would be the lower mana cost.<br />
<br />
It's an interesting idea, and I might try it out in a dungeon to see what it feels like in use, but I don't typically get many resists without any debuffs anyway, and since Malaise only lowers resists by 20, I wouldn't think this would be enough of an edge to warrant using it at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sancha Delnocha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks for the heads up.  I guess I was misinformed because I've never found MaloXXX any help when slow has been resisted for me.<br />
  It may be because I've always had my shaman in areas way above her level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I still use the lower spells in the Cripple line for aggro when I need to.  Cheap as hell and seems to have the same aggro as Cripple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Dont worry, Sancha, you're not alone. Seems a lot of newer shamans (and some older, I think) got confused by the whole disease counter thing and slow. I've heard shamans say things like that on my server too, and even had some non-shamans try to tell me to 'lower it's disease resist slow will land easier'. /snicker<br />
<br />
Drowsy through Turgur's Insect spell line = MAGIC resist (adds disease counters so you can cure)<br />
<br />
Plague of Insects/Cloud of Grummus = DISEASE resist</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hmm duh you are right Kianor, I been using pendant of malosini for so long I forgot how long the actual spell takes to cast and recover. The time on pendant is 5 secs, realized my malosini the spell is actually 2.7 secs hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Remember, the point of using any Mal* spell besides Malo(s) isn't really to get slow on faster -- the point is for you NOT to bounce a slow, which will lead to you having a very angry unslowed mob in your face.  As many others have pointed out on various threads, if Malosinia (or replace with other spell here) sticks, Turgur would have stuck too; they have the same resist check.<br />
<br />
It's still a good usage -- I often go Malos -&gt; Malosinia -&gt; Turgur on boss mobs, not to get Turgur on in fewer casts, but so that I don't bounce a Turgur, and if I do, the main tank's had more time to build aggro, since Mal* is such low aggro.  Heck, occasionally I'll go Malos -&gt; Malosinia -&gt; Cripple -&gt; Turgur for the same reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ok, here is my question....<br />
<br />
What check do MoBs use to see if MoB resists the Mal* line of spells?  It seems like my debuffs (Mal*) gets resisted as much as the slow itself does.  If it uses a magic resist check (the same as the slow) why not spam cast the slow untill it sticks?  Aren't the odds of either landing the same?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're right, they both have the same chance to resist, until you get the unresistable ones of course (Malo, Malos).<br />
<br />
However, and this is the big difference, a resisted slow is high agro, and an unslowed mob pounding on your head hurts. A resisted mal* is low agro, and is unlikely to take agro from the tank.<br />
<br />
So if you mal* first, then when you do slow, you're less likely to resist and to have an unslowed mob hitting you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ahhh...its a hate counter deal. Thanks for the info!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Malxxx draws minimal aggro compared to slow. Wanna spam slow a NtoV dragon or Tactic named you will die very, very fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">In Ldon, I prefer to mem malosini spell instead of Malos, I want a quick slow so I can get more of the damage of the bane on top of that. I can control aggro np.</div></div><hr />
