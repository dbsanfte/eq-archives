<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya: I'm not mad, just curious,<br />
Why was my post (about grouping with Rangers) moved to &quot;The Grey&quot;?<br />
As I understand it, &quot;The Grey&quot; is about non-EQ related stuff.  Isn't grouping considered part of EQ?  I realise that people can read it there, but the move strikes me as strange, heck it was still active.  Anyone have any ideas??</div></div><hr />

I see no reason for that post to be moved, even the board owner posted on it, and had no comment about it not being in the propper forum...</div></div><hr />

It more of a place where you can relax and spew your own special brand of vitriol against pretty much anything. Perhaps there where some people in that thread who decided to attack the poster rather then the post or something to that effect.<br />

Well the melee classes would like us to think so but in honesty it really isnt. In fact I consider it an exploit, banding together with other players in order to share exp? Please, thats almost obscene and bordering on blasphemy :)</div></div><hr />
