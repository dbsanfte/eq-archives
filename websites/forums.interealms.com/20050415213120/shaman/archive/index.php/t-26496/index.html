<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I was going to post this on the EQ shaman boards, but for some reason it keeps yanking out the first sentance of every paragraph.  So I manually typed em in . . . and it did it again.  Yay, wasted time!   =/<br />
<br />
Can some kind person post this for me at the SoE forums.  (and/or tell me why I couldn't post this there).<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
I can’t promise that this is a definitive list, Kyth, but I can at least try to help you by summarizing a few of the more (in my opinion) cogent and telling arguments.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, the DoT model is fundamentally flawed.  There are a lot of factors going into that, and I’ll name a few, but to avoid getting totally off track, please just accept the fact that a DoT model is flawed.  Some of the known issues relate to relative efficiencies.  The larger, faster DoTs used to be more efficient than nukes.  No longer.  (Unless you count shaman nukes!)  The larger, faster DoTs used to do more damage in total than nukes.  No longer.  Nukes can be partially resisted.  DoTs either land, or they don’t.  (Usually, they don’t.)  DoTs don’t work well on low hp mobs, or high hp groups.  You can mem a smaller nuke, but you can’t mem a smaller DoT—because it still takes the same time to run, just does less total damage.  By the time you stack DoTs, you have a dead mob.  Nukes work with spell casting subtlety.  DoTs are hosed agro (change coming, but I’m not holding my breath).  Basically, DoTs suck as a damage model in current game play, and have since GoD came out.<br />
<br />
Whether or not intended, the Panther line was a replacement for DoTs.  For similar mana costs, it allowed us to do comparable (perhaps slightly higher) dps on a direct 1 to 1 comparison.  It was an efficient DoT with no agro (for once).  <br />
<br />
It can’t be overwhelming, because it has several built in limitations.  First, it already has a prohibitively high mana cost.  Even assuming 640 mana could be reduced to 500 with various AAs and/or focus items, there are not many shaman with 10k mana pools.  10,000/500 = 20 casts which takes about a minute or so.  As I recall, the reason wizards do insane dps is because they are limited by their mana pool.  Well, so are we.  Even if you add in 2 more casts for canna V, that’s still 22 casts in around 1 minute from full to dry for an uber shaman.  Most will be substantially less casts before running dry—and that would be in a raid situation where they didn’t need to heal (ie, uncommon).  Further, given the duration, that would be about 1.5 minutes of high damage with the best extension focus items.<br />
<br />
The next built-in limitation is simply the fact that we need bodies to cast it on—pets, or PCs.  We cannot go out and unload on a mob without people or pets to buff.  We’re inherently capped on damage to number of people.  All we’re doing is increasing THEIR dps.<br />
<br />
I don’t think any of the reasonable or rational shaman expected the pets to stay the same—after all, they’re proccing something like 200% too much, right?  We fully expected that to be changed.  Not everyone was happy about it, of course, but we understood it.  Thanks to Rytan’s tireless efforts on our behalf, we’ve been thoroughly marginalized for several years now.  (Frankly, I’m surprised he hasn’t replaced Panther with a new 7 minute DoT that does 100 damage a tic for only 2300 mana per cast.)<br />
<br />
I, and quite a few other shaman, originally expected more of the same with Panther.  Rytan is clearly aware that essentially NONE of the shaman like the Avatar line.  The recast makes it exceptionally irritating to use.  Further, everyone hates the duration.  If, by some awesome stretch of the imagination, Rytan is not aware of our feelings about the Avatar line, that should tell you something about how well he understands the class.  We’ve had it in more threads, lists, and commentary than almost anything (mostly because mitigation has only been around for a couple of years compared to avatar).<br />
<br />
So, along comes Panther.  Most of us figured it was probably just another Rytan special—a 1 minute buff instead of avatar’s 6.5 so he could give us something to really complain about.  Refreshing stuff with low durations is just damn irritating.  Does anyone else remember our commentary on mana regen and canna?  We’ve had years of mindless clicking as shaman.  Clerics and Yaulp have nothing on us.  We’ve mashed the canna button every 6 seconds since level 24.  Been there, done that.<br />
<br />
To our surprise however, (and apparently Rytan’s as well) Panther was useful.  It had cleric hammer proc-rates, with a larger damage.  It was fun to cast on casters to let them do melee.  Priests, casters, and melee all liked it.  The fact that the buff was player specific, and not mob specific made overages (ie, unused DoT damage) a non-issue.  As long as mobs were in camp, it was an efficient spell.  It was fast casting, so could be used when a shaman was under attack.  It didn’t tie up a spell gem if we had to mem buffs because there was no recast on it.  It allowed us to move away from the flawed DoT model.  <br />
<br />
So, we suddenly have reason to be cautiously optimistic about the spell.  SoE then announces that they plan to extend the spell lines downwards, which is usually an indication that they like the spell.  They also announce that pets are proccing far more than intended—okay, we could understand that they shouldn’t proc much more than players.  Fine.<br />
<br />
So let’s examine the changes that are purportedly going in with this next patch.  Paladin’s healing is increased.  Enchanters and BLs are getting significant resist checks on their slows.  Dps on most classes is being increased by reducing cast times, mana costs, and increasing damage on nukes.  Shaman are getting the Panther line nerfed and are being forced back into the broken DoT model.  Yeah, we’re just ecstatic.  Ya think?<br />
<br />
Further, please don’t try to sell us on the fact that this change is too much dps.  Just out of curiosity, how much dps do you think haste adds to a raid when cast by an enchanter (compare with no haste).  Or VoQ or other mana regen spells that increase the ability to nuke more.  Those increase dps too, right?<br />
<br />
So forget for a moment that you’re nerfing a spell that’s popular with ALL of the classes.  Forget that the shaman have point blank told you folks that with a 30 sec recast, it’s not worth memorizing.  Forget that they’ve told you they don’t even mem/cast the FA line for the most part.  Let’s forget that you’re upgrading healing on our closest healing competitor and you’re not changing shaman healing yet.  Forget that you’re upgrading dps in nukes and not changing the DoT damage, thus moving shaman even futher down the dps list (as if we weren’t already sucking hind tit there).  Forget that we don’t have time to stack a bunch of DoTs on mobs before they die.  Forget all that—let’s just look at the timing, shall we?<br />
<br />
With a patch scheduled to go live in less than 12 hours, this change to a fairly fundamental spell line gets put in.  Shaman have been warned that pets will proc less for a couple of weeks.  However, it just somehow slipped your minds that instead of being able to cast panther 22 times in a minute and drain our mana to the dregs (if we needed/wanted to), or instead of being able to keep it on a group including pets for short periods when we have a lot of adds and need dps, we’re going to at MOST be able to cast it on 3 targets, and probably 2.  And you felt it was okay to just slip that in, 12 hours before a scheduled patch?  Warn us about the pets and then screw us on the cast time?  Don’t even try to tell us that isn’t a bait and switch ploy.<br />
<br />
Completely outside of the insulting and underhanded way you tried to sneak it in, the Panther line should be left alone completely.  Change the pets—we understand the need for that.  Our pets went from 50dps to 300dps. That’s insane.  But leave the rest of the Panther line alone.  Everyone likes it.  It actually fixes our dps model since you broke DoTs in GoD.  Stop letting Rytan gut our class.  The curbs are already in place with mana costs and the need for platforms (bodies) on which to cast the spell.  It’s dispellable.  It won’t land on people with too many buffs.  It HAS limitations.<br />
<br />
This is not a negotiating tactic to get the recast to 15 or 10.  It doesn’t need agro put on the proc and directed to shaman.  We’ve had plenty of agro for years.  Try listening to your gaming population for once and leave the freaking spell alone.  If it works, and it does, STOP BREAKING IT.  You are surprised at the response you guys got?  Why?  What in the heck made you think people would LIKE this change?!?<br />
<br />
That is what we want to hear from the devs—what were you thinking?!?  For god’s sake, put someone else besides Rytan on shaman spells.  If this latest ploy doesn’t convince you he’s either (a) totally clueless about the class, or (b) harboring a grudge, I don’t know what will.<br />

If you want to refute that panther is &quot;too much DPS&quot;, you can not argue that &quot;it is fine if the shaman also needs to heal&quot;. If the shaman does too much damage per mana or per time he does too much damage, period. Some other shaman doing less because he is doing something he deems more important then doing damage actually strengthens the argument you are trying to refute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Cut and pasted it into the &quot;constructive feedback&quot; thread.  <br />
Your format was in RTF, I just copied it into wordpad and had it save it as a text file.  That solved your issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kheera</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I disagree: if it's so overwhelmingly powerful dps, then casting it would take priority over healing, shifting more healing/curing to other classes... and Chutoi is noting that indeed it is still lower priority.  If it changed the class totally and made shaman replace a dps class in groups and in raids, then it might be too overwhelming a change.  But no, it just gives us some effective dps added to a raid or group between Malos, slow, and heals and cures... instead of the one nuke we can sometimes get off on critters other than bosses (in my last group... literally half the mobs died to a nice wizard crit nuke while my little slow 1200 nuke was aaaaaalmost finished casting).  Not to mention that there's not many DoTs even that stick on many highend bosses that live long enough to even try to cast DoTs.</div></div><hr />

Actually, no it doesn't.  What he's stating is that if Shaman have to do other stuff on a raid than Panther, Panther won't be used to maximum capacity because of the restrictions (ungodly mana cost) already in place.  Which is true.<br />
<br />
Edit:  I wanted to make clear that normally on raids, I personally have other duties that would prevent me from going wild on casting Panther.  The way a lot of the AEs work these days make Shaman valuable as curers alone, not to mention the extra healing they can toss out, pitiful as that healing may be.  I can usually squeeze off 2 or 3 Panthers in a row at some point in the fight, but that's about it.  If the spell gets a recast of any sort, it won't be worth memming it for those opportunities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Outside of the rare case where you have a plehtora of shaman we will be busy with other responsibilities. Healing, Curing debuffing etc. Sure if you've got 7 shaman on a raid regularly you can dedicate 2 or 3 to doing panther but then the limiting factor just becomes the number of people meleeing. Either way it never ends up being as over done as people say it theoretically could be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is quite easy to verify.  I agree totally that the DoT model is broken, but disagree with the conclusions about panther.<br />
<br />
Assume that clerics got an 85% slow with a -100 modifier.  Would you accept as a justification for clerics having it that clerics are too busy to heal to slow, and as such it is not balanced?<br />
<br />
The argument is that the amount of DPS provided by panther is not more useful than the amount of utility that must be given up for panther.  That means that utility is &gt; than the DPS, since the raid would suffer if you went all out panthering, therefore if you could assign a 'DPS value' to your utiliity, it is even more powerful than that of panther.<br />
<br />
See Murtak's argument better now?</div></div><hr />

That is exactly my point. If you are doing other stuff before you are doing panther that other stuff is even more valuable then panthering people.<br />
<br />
If chaincasting panther is x power, then you doing other stuff in preference of panthering is at least x power too. Having extra options never results in a loss of power.</div></div><hr />

Personal attack aside, are you saying that SoE did not test the product before releasing it?  I think I am getting a case of the vapors.   :eek:   I am shocked, I am astounded.   :eek:  OK I am not.  But I still think they should leave the pet proc alone.  Has it really unbalanced anything?<br />

Even if you wanted to say the level of DPS panther produces on pets is fine, would you, as a shaman, ever want to be told &quot;no buffs for you, I would rather cast them on the cleric hammer&quot;?</div></div><hr />
