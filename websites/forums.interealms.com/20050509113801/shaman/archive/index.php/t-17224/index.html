<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello friends. I hear alot of people talking about optimizing windows for eq. What are some of the tricks/tips that people use? Currently im running on a pretty sorry machine :( (intel 500 256 ram which is maxed and a 32 bit vid card) I built a machine earlier this year but gave it away<br />
and I wont be building another till janurary. So what can I do to run eq better? Im currently running win xp home. thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

runs an excelent website detailing how to tweak windows xp and 2K showing how to reconfigure the background services; which ones are necessary and which ones are not. Windows XP itself is a memory hog and the 256 meg of ram you have is what I would consider minimunm for just runing the operating system. EQ has become quite the memory hog also, and will use everything it can grab for itself. You might be able to get that system to run EQ with everything that can be disabled, particle effects turned off, basicly everything in eqclient.ini having to do with advanced modeling or rendering set to false, but you'd probably be stuck with playing in only the old zones from the original EQ. Honestly I believe you'd do better runing Windows 98 second edition on the machine. It would free up a lot of resources for the game to use. DirectX 8.1 still supports Win 98 SE and is sufficient to run EQ (for now). You're on the hairy edge of not being able to run EQ on that machine, all I can tell you is good luck geting it to work and come back and let us know how it went. Best of luck.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If he doesn't know how to configure XP what makes you think he'd want to install the piece of junk known as linux?   :D<br />
<br />
Look for a program called TweakXP woon.</div></div><hr />

Always one of these in every crowd. Silly reply and of-topic. And dont try telling me how you use Wine to run EQ on a linux box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">true that  I dont know how to tweak xp but I never really thought  about it or had to before. Once I ck out the sites you guys gave me it shouldnt be that hard to do im not computer illiterate hehe. Gonna look for tweak xp and ck out black viper now, but will these sites have sections on optimizing windows for games? guess ill find out. And last I looked you couldnt run eq on a machine with linux running. Has someone found out how to make it stable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Khalle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">www.tweakxp.com is a good site, also, and they do have a few things there about optimizing for gamers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">No no, please, tell us how you can use wine to run EQ on a Linux box.  I wish to know so that I can 2-box without having to put Winxp back on my second PC :)<br />
The last time I tried, my Linux box laughed at me...</div></div><hr />

Transgaming says EQ is well supported.  Enjoy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">That's nice... if you want to join their collective.<br />
No thanks, I pay enough just to play EQ on Windows. :)</div></div><hr />

In my opinion, no thanks, I'll just reinstall the copy of Windows that came with the PC in the first place. :)</div></div><hr />

Kind of FUBAR's the idea of open source, doesn't it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Tweak XP has a lot of nice little things that can help you a lot on a box like that, believe it or not. <br />
<br />
Also, I looked at the site linked right after your post... good advice there on disbaling services you don't need and such. <br />
<br />
I would recommend more memory either way. It's not too expensive these days. <br />
<br />
As for Linux, all I can say is that you get what you pay for.</div></div><hr />
