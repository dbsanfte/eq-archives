<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xalbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok I must not be using the right search terms. I have scoured the forum for a link I saw when the new UI first came out that had a page with all sorts of mods for the UI from compact spell bars to new target windows etc. I cannot for the life of me remember the name of the thread so I am either not using the right terms or I am an idiot, and my ogre hard headedness wont allow me to admit to the later :D.  Does anyone have a list of pages that have a variety of mods (or even just 1 page) I DLed the spell book skins off Spellbooks (http://pub37.ezboard.com/fmaximus94788frm10.showMessage?topicID=74.topic)  and they are absolutely amazing. <br />
<br />
When the link comes back up (was down last night) I am gonna try and see if the maps mod works for me cause that would absolutely rock my world. no more running blindly off in a direction hoping I find something other than angry mobs (EJ *shudder* I still have nightmares of the train!!!) but I am looking for more utilitarian ones. I think I saw one somewhere that has a timer on the buffs window that shows how long till your buffs wear off. That kinda stuff, anything that may make me a more effective shaman and not always OOM cause buffs wear off when I least expect em to (yes I am a fly by the seat of my pants shammy no timers for me!! besides people look at me funny when I got a timer running at my desk lol girlfriend thinks I am crazy enough as it is.<br />
<br />
 Any help will be appreciated. In the mean time I will use my EQ exploring techniques and run off blindly into the threads searching (hopefully I wont get a train or trak raptors this time ;) )[</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xalbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yes I see a lot of pages listed here with DLs and I am going over those individually but I am looking for a site with a variety of mods instead of 1 specific mod. I couldnt get into the eqtoolbox last night so its probably the one I am looking for but I though I would at least ask if anyone knows of any sites with really useful shammy oriented UI mods.</div></div><hr />
