Acts somewhat like fading memories, except when activated you cant move. Would be great in cojunction with the talk of shammies getting a rez. But would just be nice in general. Maybe a 1 hour re-use timer. Once active does not break until you move or cancel the spell. Be in the spirit theme of shammies, and wouldnt be overpowering with a 1 hour re-use.</div></div><hr />

I posted an idea for that when SOE was polling for AA abilities in OOW on their message boards... needless to say, it didn't get noticed except by 1 or 2 other shaman who thought it was a good/neat idea.<br />
