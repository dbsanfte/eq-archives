<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just thought I would offer some of my notes from the encounter (5 failed attempts):<br />
<br />
Is NOT flagged un-slowable.<br />
<br />
After Malo &amp; Tash:<br />
     65 mage was unable to Malosinia in 5 attempts<br />
     63 Shaman was unable to Turgur's Insects in 4 attempts<br />
<br />
After Insidious Decay:<br />
     63 Shaman landed Cloud of Grummus First Cast EVERY attempt (Message: Your spell was partially successful.)<br />
<br />
Every time I landed the slow I was promptly summoned and dispatched with extreme prejudice. Didn't matter that I let the tank work him to 80pct the last time either.<br />
<br />
He hit me about one time out of 5 for max melee (1280) with my crappy AC. Was told he quads by the MT but I only ever saw strings of 3 hits at a time.<br />
<br />
Guy does some super nasty burst damage. Defensive tanks held him fine with 3 clerics in wheel, soon as defensive fell so did the tank.<br />
<br />
He seems agro-linked to the two Fire Giants near him. The tactic we finally settled on was offtanking them. I'd say one shaman to slow them and a paladin that can hold agro on two mobs at the same time and cleric to heal the above would be your best bet on them. Just hold them off till the main raid force dispatches the King. They are charmable but our chanter said he got alot of resists and fast breaks.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps the next shaman to see the bottom of this guy's boot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe the Fabled guys will be gone after the patch on the 14th (tomorrow). I think they were just part of the anniversary celebration and it was stated that all the things they put in for that would be gone by the 15th.<br />
<br />
Correct me if i am wrong????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Talked to a GM friend of mine today and he said they have no idea when the fabled are gonna be gone, or even if theya re gonna be gone. They might keep em in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just killed him on Tuesday (4/13).  F.King Tranix and F.Warlord Skarlon both.<br />
<br />
Both slowed with Turgurs.<br />
<br />
King...Malos, Slow, mitigated, but no resist.<br />
Skarlon...Malos, 1 slow resist, slowed 2nd attempt, also mitigated.<br />
(( NOTE!)) These are old world giants.  You NEED to be up in thier face to land spells.  This perhaps answers the 5 resists for previous poster.<br />
<br />
<br />
King...rampages (I was on it FUN!)...yes he quads.  &lt;3 combat agility..trying for LR5 next!  2 clerics on tank, 1 cleric backing me up ansd spot heal on tank.  King came with 1 add.  After slowing King, Dog and I kept add busy.  Slow+sick Ubu+Bane.  Cleric that was spot healing me pulled aggro from the add, I pissed him off again and OT'd him.  Light blue/barely blue hit for about 60-90, fully slowable.<br />
<br />
Skarlon...no ramp, did flurry.  all clerics on tank, after slow/cripple (huge difference made on # of flurries), helped spot heal between banes.<br />
Skarlon was on 2nd attempt.  1st try was unplanned pull, got him to about 75% with no one being ready, flurried ALOT.  On second attempt we fought him up in the throne room rather than pull to bottom like rest.  Adds were cleared 1st, so he was solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was belly casting and I did malo (don't have malos yet as I'm not 65).... maybe my level has something to do with the resist rates. That doesn't explain why a 65 mage couldn't malosinia though. Question... if he's mitigating slow anyways, what is the percent advantage of using magic (with a higher resist rate) versus disease (with an almost guaranteed hit)? Need a smarter than the average bear to answer that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I never even considered that he may be resistant to magic, unless I have previous knowledge of mobs slowing habits, I have a tendancy to forget about Grummus all together.  <br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Cloud of Grummus is only 40% (unmitigated) whereas Turgur's is 75%.  Assume Partial means that the slow is cut in half, that means Grummus is only a 20% slow while Turgur's is 37.5%.  That's a big difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I guess what I'm wondering is, if I can slow something to 20pct on demand and very early in the fight, or bounce Turgur's three times before I can get him slowed to 37.5pct. How much damage to the tank am I really saving by using Turgur's versus Grummus?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well the answer is impossible to say without knowing the expected time to land turgurs and the expected duration of the fight.<br />
<br />
In more general terms though, any moderate-long duration fight with a high dps, highly MR mob is generally best opened up with MD+Grummus, then malos, then sinia/turgurs alternated until one or both stick. If mob is very very MR then forget turgurs and help heal or deal dps if healing is covered.<br />
<br />
Its not always a choice of one or the other, using grummus or turgurs is not mutually exclusive :)</div></div><hr />
