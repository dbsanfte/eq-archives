<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Xev this morning had<br />
1 ornate chain pant pattern - 110000p<br />
1 leather pant<br />
4 leather gloves, and <br />
1 silk glove - 90kp (up from 30kp earlier in the weekend *snort*)<br />
<br />
for sale in the bazaar.  I think these people are insane, and I hope everybody realizes that the drop rates were drastically increased and not to pay moronic prices for these things.<br />
<br />
But I was curious about what other servers are seeing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bah, this was already posted in the *cough* correct forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Last week there would be typically 0-2 ornate patterns (usually silk robes) in the bazaar, in the 100-120k range.<br />
<br />
Last night before I went to bed, there were 15, covering all 4 types, from a wide variety of worn locations. Prices were from 80-100k. Last night there were 50 people in SolRo, with no raid taking place. In a week, I expect 30-50 patterns for sale, in the 20-40k range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Most ornate is under 40k now on solusek ro, due to SRT being farmed completely and constantly.  However, it really does seem, that chain is the rarest of all types =\  We got 9 drops today in the xuxl room.  5 silk 3 plate 1 leather 0 chain.  In the auction channel, there are about 20 pieces for sale, none of which are chain.  There are currently 7 people WTBing chain bracer alone, and a few more that want other pieces.<br />
<br />
Just like tov all over again =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Diashan Malkier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ornate prices will plummet very soon, its dropping like crazy in Solro at the moment.<br />
Though dont be suprised if chain remains relativly higher than the rest, as its still quite rare compared to the others, least thats what ive seen.<br />
Ive heard different areas yeild different ratios of chain, if thats the case stay away from Xuz caves where ive been living since the patch, silk and leather are the most common drops, only seen one pair of chain gloves so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">spent several hours in srt yesterday got a piece evrry 20-30 kills.  I sold a plate bracer for 60k about 5 minutes after i stuck it on my trader.  So someone is buying them  for those prices, i wouldnt personally.  Today there are about 50 molds and patterns for sale, all in the 60-100k range, i would imagine with the numbers coming out those pieces will be 1/3 of that atleast in a couple weeks if not sooner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Saturday morning Tangbrand in BoT was dropping an ornate bracer mold on every pop.  In 2 h 3 molds dropped.  The wing boss we got naturally dropped nothing but the ring :(.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In 3 hours in xuzl area we got 1 plate boot 1 plate gloves and 1 plate leggings.<br />
<br />
Im glad the prices are starting to come down now becuase that armor wasnt that awesome to be paying that much and  it barely dropped for the first 8 months of PoP.<br />
<br />
I hate seeing people complain about it being too common becuase if you look how often HoT and n tov quest armor dropped youd see this armor barely drops still and its not much better than tov either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>reaper23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">About this morning est their were about 5 piece's for sell mostly silk yay for them and trader # was maxxed in bazzar =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">10 hours in Sol Ro this weekend.  2 chain drops by another guild group.  None for me.  Lots of leather and silk though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">SRT is dropping it like Mad.... I have a regular crew I XP/Farm with... over 2 days...  roughly 10-12 hours of Farming.. we had over 20 Ornate drops.   Most of it went to Twinks and people in the crew for Upgrades...    Ornate is not an Upgrade for me.. so all Chain went to a Rogue Alt there.... she got, if I recall...   Gloves, Boots, Bracer, Legs and Hat.   We also got a lot of Plate... Plate is dropping the most.  A Fair bit of Leather, but we got very little silk.     Like I said, we average a drop about every 30 minutes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">ornate drops are alittle too high .. but then again most chardokB items blow it out of the water<br />
<br />
farm chardokB if you can</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I imagine Chain bracers will be the most expensive.  Vengence2 for rangers/rogus and FT2 for shamans is quite nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>msatchmo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">not sure my guild snagged at least 2 chain pants, 1 gloves, and at least 1 bracer in 2 nights... but then again we are ****ing uber. ;-&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Starting to see a bunch for sale on Prexus, mostly from 30-60k for each piece except for breasplates which were 100k, havent seen one for sale recently.  Prices are already steadily dropping.</div></div><hr />
