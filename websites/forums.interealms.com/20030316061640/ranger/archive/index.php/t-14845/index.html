<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Trueshotz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Where can i level at 40-46........SOlb is great exp but zone has a max of 7people in it at a time......no more DSP for me i heard DL was good any other ideas or comments</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">DL is Kunark group zone (and I mean Kunark, like LOIO)<br />
<br />
EW, GD, or Iceclad all support solo fear-kiting in velious<br />
<br />
Crystal Caverns is a solo place for 30-52 (at 40 I *also 40* hunt Stlag terrors, some orc, spiders, and geos (being at the harder end) *note: make sure you can Sup. Cameo (indoors) or have a porter out before you kill Geos, you lower faction with em and they ahve the only way out* however the geos *gem collectors actually* can yeild 500-1kpp/hour in loot (gems you sell to venduhs)<br />
<br />
Also to Consider is going LFG in LowerGuk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Morgani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">DSP wolves and Yelinaks are great from 40 to 46ish .  Then once you get to 46+ you can do rockhoppers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nahhhhhh!!! DSP is the same as every other mid 40's fear-kiting zone now!!! only 1% per kill on dblues, regardless what others say it is only 1%, been fighting there recently</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dirus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">SolB worked for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Daareon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I wouldnt recommend velious for fear kiting - simply because the mobs have lots of HPs and hit hard. Unless your timing is absolutely perfect 100% of the time there is an appreciable downtime to soloing in most velious locations.<br />
<br />
DL is good if you dont mind pickup groups. You can get a group almost any time of the day and it's usually non-stop fighting. I found the XP wasnt really good though. Passable, but not great.<br />
<br />
DSP is better for soloing (mobs have low HPs, dont hit hard - unless you do hoppers). CRs are easy too which may be a plus. No cash to speak of unless you do hoppers - but again hoppers hit hard and have a ton of HPs for that level.<br />
<br />
SolB is sadly hard to get a group in. It's a shame because you can level all the way to 55 here and the cash is good. I solo'd off and on from 40-50 here. <br />
<br />
Lower guk hasnt been mentioned. XP/loot is as good as SolB but sadly these days the zone is empty. Last time I was there we had our necro pulling Frenzy... from the Lord room. For three hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Quick question, can a 30 druid and a 40 ranger solo SolB effectively? druid has a 350pt heal and ranger has 1500hp + Fungi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was doing hoppers last night and i'm lvl52.  XP was 3 kills to 2% avg.</div></div><hr />
