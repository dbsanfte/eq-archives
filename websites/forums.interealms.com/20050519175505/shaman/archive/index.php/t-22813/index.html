<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OoW is due in about a month (at least that's the plan according to SOE, with a scheduled August 31 release date). It seems like things have been really quiet with regard to expansion info and beta testing. There's all kinds of new stuff that's supposed to be included - new spells, new AA, new zones, the task system, epic 2.0, etc. We haven't gotten a look at any of the new AA yet, and most of the spells are just cut-and-paste from PoP.<br />
<br />
I'm really hoping they release more information soon, so we can at least have a chance at some (likely ineffectual) feedback. Anyone know what's going on? Is there even a beta test running right now? Yes, I know that the true beta test will start on the release date... but I'd like to have at least some clue about what's going on.<br />
<br />
Sudedor, anything you can share with us? Inquiring minds want to know.   :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm, allow me to alleviate some of your concerns:<br />
<br />
1) What you see on Test is what you get.<br />
<br />
2) Shaman will fall further and further behind in healing, burst healing, DPS.<br />
<br />
3) OTOH Shaman will get better stat buffs. (PWN)<br />
<br />
4) After much consternation and teeth gnashing, Sony will announce they are &quot;looking into&quot; Shaman issues.<br />
<br />
5) Alchemy will be modified with a 1% across the board reduction on Alchemy component prices.<br />
<br />
6) At this point Brenlo will announce that Shaman are &quot;balanced&quot; and that the Dev team is looking at other classes with more pressing concerns.<br />
<br />
7) Oh and he'll announce that his Shaman is now a mighty 55th level. (POWAH)<br />
<br />
8) Much parsing, posts and other information will be posted here detailing in length and  ad naseum  that Shaman are holding firm at the bottom of the class totem pole.<br />
<br />
9) Random posters will detail how they function just fine in PoP and LoY with a Cleric bot for buffs.<br />
<br />
10) After 3-4 months Brenlo will announce that Sony is looking at Shaman.  He will ask for information.  Which will be provided in abundance.<br />
<br />
11) This will immediately be followed by Rytan's comment of &quot;no.&quot;<br />
<br />
12) Sony will announce the upcoming expansion &quot;Towers of Pandemonium,&quot; and solicit ideas from the community.<br />
<br />
13) Various opinions will be opined and since there is &quot;no clear consensus,&quot; Alchemy prices will be further reduced 1% and newer and better stat buffs will be placed on Test.<br />
<br />
14) Go to 1).</div></div><hr />

The only part that is incorrect is that Shadow Knights are firmly at the bottom having been totally shafted when all their abilities went to the warriors when they did their sit in.

WOW, warriors can solo in PoP? They can snare and FD? They can up their AC? They can cast debuffs on monsters? DAMN no wonder SK's feel so left out, I mean the best they can solo is plane of fire, and the best they can tank is 99% of GoD. Poor bastards, I guess my monk can wait for a role untill SK's get everything they want!</div></div><hr />

I vote for &quot;Age of Plush&quot;.<br />
<br />
Just when you thought the developers had stopped with the cute furry animals... They'll upgrade our Bearforms, just like we asked, to be the Plane of Storm bears... <br />
<br />
But to show their artistic independence they will make them color specific to race again...  <br />
<br />
Barabarians will be Pastel Blue, <br />
Ogres will be Violet,<br />
Trolls will be Beigh, <br />
Frogloks will be Seafoam Green,  <br />
Iksar will be Sunshine Yellow, <br />
and the Kitty-Cats will all be Pastal Pink.<br />
<br />
Everybody shout, &quot;CAREBEAR STARE!&quot;</div></div><hr />

Get the right gear and yeah Warriors can solo in PoP. in certain places.<br />
<br />
They can debuff Through Procs with certain items. They can get great Ac. They get more hitpoints. They do more damage. They get alot of nifty Discs. <br />
<br />
Oh and they are by far the best tanks in the game. Defensive makes it no contest. Along with everything else they have. <br />
<br />
Shadowknights need 2 things. a 12 second Riposete Disc. And the ability to fear2 Mobs to help mitagate a certain amount of incoming damage while pretty much snap aggroing due to extreme hate buildup. (Think of them as similer to Stun spells. But with no damage component.)<br />
<br />
Paladins need 12 second riposte disc. And a bit more to effectivly spend mana on.<br />

That one is my favorite.  Not just green... Seafoam Green.  It's almost as good as &quot;coral&quot; or maybe even &quot;berry&quot; (manly way of saying violet).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">(manly way of saying violet) No, that'd be &quot;purple&quot; :)<br />
Of course, the love of my life and her little girl would probably go nuts over a pastel blue Tigran...</div></div><hr />

Where I'm from purple is NOT considered manly...  Just regional differences I guess.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I say purple because it's simple and one of the basic colors that you learn when you're young.  Unless you're a pro at designing webpages or decorating or painting (or hundreds of other things using in-depth colors) it's all purple. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Shadowknights solo in PoF?<br />

Wow, that's pretty strong. And yet... Nobody wants them in groups.<br />

By the way, did you know Shaman can solo DRAGONS?! :eek:</div></div><hr />

Where I'm from, callin' a man's truck &quot;berry&quot; would probably get you shot ... tho I don't know too many men around here who'd drive a damn purple truck to start with. ;)<br />

<br />
I must admit I'm wondering what happened with OOW, been a while since we heard anything and no sign of a beta. I'm thinking they might have either pinched the developers to try and get EQ2 out the door or they'll delay it till WoW releases and try and staunch any losses that way.<br />
<br />
It'll certainly be a crucial expansion for a lot of people. If they don't have something pretty special to offer, and blizzard doesn't screw up WoW, I can't see me sticking around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">In early expansions we heard straight from Verant what was being offered, and when it finally arrived, we were generally happy about it.  The insane prematurity of the initial announcement of Omens of War was so incredibly untimely and sickening to me that... well, it was a bad first impression.  Suffice to say that instead of hearing the majority of reliable information from SoE, we are forced to read the everchanging chain of practical jokes that is Lucy.<br />
<br />
700/tick DoT, PSYCHE!!!  <br />
<br />
/tell SoE hey, why'd you change the spell?  <br />
<br />
SoE tells you: The expansion isn't completed yet, and data is subject to change.<br />
<br />
/tell SoE:  How will Focus IV's operate after Omens is Released?<br />
<br />
SoE tells you:  The expansion isn't completed yet, and data is subject to change.<br />
<br />
/tell SoE:  I see.  So how many months are you setting aside to complete the expansion?<br />
<br />
SoE tells you:  (re)-announcing Omens of War launch... Tomorrow!  Order your copy today!!!<br />
<br />
/tell SoE:  #*&amp;(*&amp;^@#$^*(^@!#@!#@(<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
One Month Later, SoE announces the &quot;We will be re-tuning Omens mob DPS and spell drop rates.  We accidentally balanced the entire expansion for level 100's, our bad!  But fear not, we're releasing an expansion next week that will increase the level cap to 100!  However, no information concerning this expansion is available because it isn't completed yet, and data is subject to change.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I really wish they would tell us some basic things about this upcoming expansion that is only 4 weeks away.<br />
<br />
1. How many zones? Even approximately.<br />
2. How many zones that pre-elemental folks can realistically group in?<br />
3. What system will be used for players getting their spells?<br />
<br />
My hope is it is more like Luclin, which despite it's problems such as lack of itemization, was a pretty fair egalitarian something for everyone expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Gunderson,<br />
<br />
You've never hunted Hollowshade as a Vah Shir newbie at the intended level, have ya? :) Ever done anything in Mons Letalis? <br />
<br />
A better model to use would be Kunark. In OoW, it would be nice to take a step back from BIGGERFASTERHARDER! and play EQ again. Mobs that hit for a reasonable amount for the intended level, don't have crazy procs or AC, that at the very least drop money. Save the overinflated crap for the raid zone(s) and nameds in higher-end zones. Make it so that a group can exp in one zone while another group raids in the same zone again (Remember someone camping Crypt, another doing the Jail, while a third group cleared out the shrooms to help make way for a Trak raid?)<br />
<br />
But, since I doubt OoW will have 1 - 70 content, a better model would be Velious. Tough stuff, but still reasonable, with some juicy quests even if you don't raid, and plenty of mouth-watering stuff for the raiders, and some nice stuff for singe-groupers and small guilds as well (One big guild does NToV, another guild is doing HoT, and the single group is killing off WW dragons)<br />
<br />
Some very basic things OoW will need...<br />
<br />
1) Good solid quests. GoD has exactly one quest, BiC. There's a few smaller ones, yes, but tell me, does anyone wear their hynidskin boots? Velious and Kunark both had tons of productive quests. Even Luclin and LoY do!<br />
<br />
2) Sane mobs. I don't want to take my group into a zone and need a Shaman, two clerics, a defensive tank, and a DC'er just to do single pulls, Sony. Nor do I want a mob to last so long that I start wondering if my account will expire before its dead.<br />
<br />
3) Loot all around. Even if it's just cash drops or quest / tradeskill items. If no loot, at least give us some insane exp to make up for it (Paludal Caverns and PoP, for instance, little loot, great exp) Have some random gear drops (ala Ry'Gorr or Obulus Death Shroud) in addition to named &quot;real gear&quot; mobs.<br />
<br />
4) Make raid content that gives everyone on the raid something to do, instead of just the guild's MT and the Cleric chain. Spawned adds are a good touch. Wierd spell effects (Such as that procced charm that gives itself as a proc to whoever it charms...) are good, too. Perhaps interactive quests, where one part of the raid keeps the main boss busy while another part goes around the zone and destroys mobs that are giving it power.<br />
<br />
5) Give us some AA variety, and give them costs that make sense. i'm not going to spend 20 AA just so I can have a window where my pet can catch BSS, got me?</div></div><hr />
