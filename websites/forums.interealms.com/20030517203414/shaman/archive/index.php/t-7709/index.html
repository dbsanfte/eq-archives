Try a good group in PoN and hunt anything. I got a yellow in just over 2 hrs in 59. Plus spiders can drop parchments you can use for spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A yellow in regular exp?<br />
I love the spider camp, too - we got 5 parchments in 5 hours, mostly from the two named.  Exp was quite good for me - over a blue an hour, but nowhere near a yellow in two hours.<br />
<br />
exp and parchmets, great combination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I too got 2 yellows in about 3 hours doing the PoN hobgoblin cave and mephit cave.  Good stuff!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wampaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We started off doing spiders then moved to the big ass undead guys. Cant remember their name, but they are level 65, giant sized, and we were fighting near zone out and pulling them. And yes, i got almost a full yellow in 2 hrs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jebuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just wondering, but is solo/duoing xp in PoP&gt;full group xp?  I've only done full groups, and that already is amazing xp (about 1 yellow/2 hours), just wondering if it can be done faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks Wampaa -<br />
I have seen one of those giant guys, knew he was dark red to me at 60.<br />
<br />
I guess I need ot try for a gobbies group.   8)'</div></div><hr />

You have to let your Tanks get pounded on before you try to slow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wampaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">aye, same thing happend to me on slow. after first one killed me quick, we decided to have mt take a pounding and a cheal, then tash, then slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've had some pretty safe soloing so far in PoN.  If I have an aego on, it's really hard to die, and cann5-ing during the fight isn't a big deal.<br />
<br />
Ravens, spiders and treants give 2% AA per kill, but the treants leave me at 20m or so (using horse), while with spiders and ravens I can end up at 40 or 70.  I've had mixed results with cripple there - partnering with a monk friend it seemed to help a lot with the annoying erratic damage they take now.  Careful, tho.  Had him die .5 seconds after my kragg's landed (we both saw it land)... he said that's the second time that's happened to him in that plane.<br />
<br />
Anyway, this is just the yard trash I kill while waiting for someone to put together a good big spider group.  It's probably about the same exp/hour as FG and a lot less safe, but whole boatloads more fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">How are the resists against normal exp mobs in the first tier planes vs. a 55 shammy like myself?<br />
<br />
Should i wait for awhile, or head on up there w/ a guild group now :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">XP in PoD/PoP is great. This is true, but it would be the same anywhere you can find 55+mobs that you can SOLO or group with I would imagine.<br />
<br />
59th and 61rst level = 1% per kill (I get 2 kills per 15 minutes easy including buff time) so that is 2 blue per hour.<br />
<br />
AA XP = 5% per kill so that is 2 yellow AA XP per hour.<br />
<br />
and this is without pushing it at all! Just root and rot the no summoning 55+ mobs!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Kalamani, are you really getting 1% with each kill? At 58 I was getting that, then I dinged 59. I killed a gnarled treant and still at 0% exp. Went to HS and got to 3% then went back to a gnarled treant in PoN, killed it and exp was still at 3%. I am sure it is close to 1 per kill but on the first two I killed after leveling, I got no percent increase. So I went to katta and was getting 6-7% an hour conservatively. I don't think I could do better SOLO in PoP but you can correct me if I am wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Flea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">well i have only hunted in PoI and PoD .. PoI was nice but a lil to chaotic for me ... PoD was easy! .. in about 2 hours i had 6 blue and 1 blue AA (10% going into AA) ... and am lvl 55 only pita was the spiders we hunted could not be stunned and would CH themselves (one did it 7 times before we got it killed) .. course we were using a ranger as the MT with a rogue ... then the rest was casters... a druid that didnt fight at all a cleric that melee'd and healed ... a mage with pet and me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I've spent pretty much the last few days in PoN and thought I'd share my experience.  I'm 55 and have had little problem slowing the treants, ravens, spiders, and crocs.  The regular hobgoblins and nightstalkers were easy to slow after malosi.  Two mobs I will avoid for a while yet are the scourge hobgoblins and the gloom nightmares.  Both resisted everything and made me (and my whole group) dead pretty quick.  <br />
<br />
Yes, a shaman could probably solo here, but with how hard the mobs hit I'd go the root rot method.  All in all I think this is a great zone, the experience is great and it's very easy for a shaman to get a group here.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">the big undead things are &quot;forboading guardians&quot;.  <br />
<br />
I was there with my necro one night and was told to slow them.<br />
<br />
Necro slow at 60 is 70% vs undead and is resisted less.<br />
<br />
and FD is a great thing after slowing a mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">PoJ is also really good if you can avoid trains.  <br />
Enforcers and Sentries of Justice give around 2% AAexp each and the enforcers drop parchments and BD's and well as some nice VT loot.  <br />
Guardians of Justice are tankable at 60 with torpor and probably root/rotable if you dont have torpor.  I have only found one spawn of the Guardian so far in my short stay but they give around 6% AAexp per kill.  Guardians hit for 350 max but their damage varies wildly. Im guessing they are around lvl 56-58.<br />
The High Gaurdians of Justice are level 60 and hit for around 450 but their MR sucks and can be slowed rooted and DoTed easily without malo (malosini helps root duration so use that).  I just cleared the area of any gaolers of justice and pulled the single one right before the enforcer room.  They have a LOT of hp so torpor is required if only for the mana regen.  Just keep 3 or 4 DoTs up on him and keep him rooted. Watch out for gaolers as they will assist.  I do not know how much exp they give since each time I have tried them I hae either been trained or had a gaoler add.  Im guessing it should be in the range of 8 to 10% solo.  It is definitly doable, i just had some bad luck.</div></div><hr />
