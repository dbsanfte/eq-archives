<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I believe that I have been VERY lucky with my rune turn ins. 3 Runes have yielded Focus of the 7th, Quiescence, and Ferine Avatar. In my opinion, these 3 spells seem significantly better than the 2 that I now lack -- Blood of Saryrn and Malos.<br />
<br />
I am tempted to pass on Runes for a while and let my friends and guildees have them. My only question is for those of you with Malos - do you think you can notice a real difference in resists when using Malos versus Malo? Per Lucy, Malos only debuffs 10 more MR. Blood of Saryrn would be nice, but unless soloing I usually use Tears of Saryrn and love it.<br />
<br />
I am thinking about fights like the wing bosses in BoT (other than Laef). I have had a heck of a hard time landing Turgur's or Malosinia on these guys, especially when not grouped with an enchanter. In fact, I usually just disease slow and then help heal -- rather than wasting half of the fight and all of my mana trying to land Turgur's. Does Malos make a noticable difference here (over Malo)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Malos was the first lvl 65 spell I had. The first thing you might notice is your ODS or mana pres III items is now not saving you anything so you pay full price for malos. I regularly end up in XP grinds in BoT and using malos I would say 1 in 15 mobs resists turgur after that....<br />
<br />
I dont know what your wis is, but a long time ago there was something going around that Wis score contributes directly to your fizzle rate and your resist rate (note this goes all the way back to when the Kunark expansion first came out) That being possibly part of the issue I will say that I have unbuffed max wis at this time of 305. Havent done AAs to go higher yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">IMO Malos isn't as effective compared to BoS.<br />
<br />
On any mob on which you can land Malo, but not Malosinia, you don't need an extra -10 vs all but desease to win. Also, off the top of my head I can't think of a single mob of consequence that fits into the above catagory.<br />
<br />
BoS on the other hand, is a fire and forget DoT. Don't let all the horror stories about agro affect you--it's not nearly as bad as some people try to make it out. You can safely stack 3 DoTs and rain on any raid mob without fear of agro as long as your MT doesn't have autoattack off. Of course, it's easier if you just stick with BoS (which is ~52 dps by itself) and use your two rains or nuke for dps. Reaching 200 dps as a shaman is not unheard of, and maintaining 150 dps isn't that difficult.<br />
<br />
For exp groups, BoS have above average agro so wars with sub par equipment will have issues keeping agro. That is what root is for. If any hybrid has issues gaining agro over BoS, then they need to learn how to use their spells. Again, root solves most agro issues you are likely to encounter in an exp group. If not, you always have LR5 to fall back on.<br />
<br />
The following is the way I would rate our 65 spells in the order from most useful to lead useful for the shaman, then another order for a raid:<br />
<br />
Q &gt; BoS &gt; Fo7 &gt; Malos &gt; FA <br />
<br />
Fo7 &gt; Q &gt; Malos &gt; BoS &gt; FA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">XP groups i use malo for less mana use. Malos is better ofcourse , but its just not needed. No if its a Boss mob or on a raid , its malos all the way. But the best way to deal with not having extra debuffing power is to just grab a tash stick/orb. They arent that expensive these days and consistenly use them. SoD/VoTB/FoS = 265 dex for me, it doesnt take long to proc usualy. PLus its just fun to go /g ( %t ) is TASHED !!  adn watch everyone  /boggle over it ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The question wasnt which spell of 65 was more useful, the question posed was Should a shaman bother to use MaloS if they already have malo. BoS isnt an MR debuff (unfortunatly) so Im having issue seeing the relevance of how BoS effects your ability to slow in BoT.<br />
<br />
I got all my spells by turning in runes or from the guild I only put up there that Malos was my first 65 spell cuase I have been using it that long.<br />
<br />
Ximix I dont have trouble slowing in BoT if I use Malos. I havent ever used Malo there really so I havent a clue if its the 10 extra MR or not that makes the diff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My example was BoT wing bosses. You responded with &quot;I regularly end up in XP grinds in BoT and using malos I would say 1 in 15 mobs resists turgur after that....&quot;. I don't have any problems slowing regular exp mobs in BoT either, using Malo.<br />
<br />
The BoT wing bosses are a different story. I am talking about Gaukr Sandstorm, Hriedar L, and Oreen Wavecrasher here. They have very High MR, but can be slowed with Turgur's (although I think using Grummus is the smarter call - unless Malos changes that). If you have not experienced this then you have not fought many of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Boinshar, I can't see why you put FA below BoS in either raids or exp groups. Ferine Avatar allows me to add 140 ATK to up to 9 melee or pets. That is a significantly better DPS contribution than a poison DoT spell (even a great one like Blood of Saryrn).<br />
<br />
Getting one shaman Ferine Avatar saves you needing to equip 9 melees in your guild with Primal / Prismatic weapons. It also adds 40 ATK over and above primal / prismatic for those that already have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As a lvl62 shaman with neither Malo or Malos, i'd take either in a heartbeat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Over all, FA would add more pure DPS to melees over 9 min than if you used the same amount of mana on BoS. However, adding in the PITA factor, ranger buffs, SK self buffs, and primals, the advantage becomes much less. Also, as a shaman who also has PA and AFA, FA means far less to me than to a shaman who does not have those spells.<br />
<br />
Pet buffing is where the Avatar series shine, but with one drawback. On charmed pets, PA (or better) boosts their ATK enough to make defensive skills almost useless. Nothing kills an enchanter/necro faster than a PAed (or AFA/FA) pet, regardless of their defensive AAs. I duo with a necro (200+ aas) in CoD a lot, I only buff the pet when I want to kill him.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: Most of the melees in my guild banked their primals, or are too lazy to switch out, so my perception may be different.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
Vanier,<br />
<br />
I was addressing:<br />
<br />
In my opinion, these 3 spells seem significantly better than the 2 that I now lack -- Blood of Saryrn and Malos.<br />
<br />
As it turned out, I also misread that quote.<br />
<br />
As for the original question, Malos doesn't make much of a difference if you have Malo. By the same token, FA makes little difference if you have PA/AFA, which makes BoS more useful (just for the resist factor and no DD component if nothing else) than Malos and FA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I might have somethng to offer.  When I first started fighting in BoT, I had only Malo.  I encountered a fairly low number of resists, but certainly higher than I encountered in other zones.  I also noticed quite a few full resists on damage or partial resists on damage.  I eventually got a rune (woot) and turned it in -- and got Malos.  At first I was indifferent; it seemed like a good result, but not the best result I could have gotten.  After using it for a week though, I'm very pleased with it.  I get significantly fewer resists (the difference is VERY noticeable to me) on slow and less resists on direct damage spells.  That being said, I've lost th benefit of my spell casting mastery 3 item (sigh) and Malos costs more mana as well.  <br />
<br />
Regarding boss mobs, my experience has been:<br />
<br />
east/west = slowable with disease, not worth even trying magic<br />
<br />
south = not slowable by me yet (normally I try one time, then switch to a pure healing role on this mob).  I've never slowed him successfully, or spoken with a shaman who has.<br />
<br />
north = DEATH FESTIVAL just trying to get to this guy.  Never managed to get to him.  :)<br />
<br />
Does Malos affect slowing of these miniboss mobs?  Not that I've seen.  I tend to use it effectively in group situations, but not as effectively agaisnt the minibosses.  I did hear from two druids that I've grouped with that they found a noticeable difference in their ability to land their debuffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As Ximix pointed out, all are slowable by turgurs (except Laef who is immune to attack speed changes) its just pretty difficult. I am in the same boat as Ximix. I have malo, and have been able to slow them with turgurs, however i typically take the same approach. I slow with disease instead, its much easier. Then i will follow up with a Turgurs or 2 to try to get him as slowed as possible. <br />
<br />
The normal mobs in the zone really arent in question, they are all pretty easy to slow. As Ximix pointed out tho, the bosses are a different story. I am just as curious, Ximix. However, i can only confirm that what you have experienced concurs with what i have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have yet to fight the East mini, but after Malos, Occlusion, and tash stick proc, I've slowed the other three (South being the most resistant in my experience).  I tend the annul the mob at the start since they are all casters and may selfbuff themselves.  Maybe it helps, maybe not.<br />
<br />
For 50 mana more (which is less than one Can IV wince) there's no reason not to use Malos over Malo if you have both IMO.<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, here's a helpful tip for the North:<br />
Have an invis'd person go up the portals ahead of everybody.  That person targets nearby mobs while a harmony/lull/pacify caster stands right next to the electric field below, assists, and casts.  Once all the close ones are lulled, everybody goes up and fights the nearest while keeping the others lulled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">your gonna want malos, and bos .. they both kick ass<br />
<br />
heres why .. your on a raid and shmA casts malos on mob ... but doesnt call it .. so you decide to cast malo .. now you get the &quot;your spell wont take hold message&quot; along with some awkward argo .. <br />
<br />
i got beat down a bunch from malo bounceing off, was really annoying</div></div><hr />

<br />
To answer you question directly on BoT bosses. Yes , malos is best , the  10 might not sound like alot , but everything counts. You are indeed correct on going for grummus , but only as first step , if you can land grummus in 2 tries them move to malos/tash stick/turg. Its a gamble in south , alot of times it works , but sometimes it wont. iN east and west you have more of a shot and will 9 times out of 10 land it even without a tash stick, though i advise tashing. North is pointless , its unslowable. in any case if its not slowed by 50% ish your better of going for DPS , in the south we can land rain spells really nice , in east and west PR/DR lands , its been a while but im sure east ( ocean ) is low to DR and west is low to PR , though might wanna try DR on bolth  if west is high PR. In all of the wings but north you can land your Velium Strike and help DPS that way once slowed ofcourse.<br />
<br />
Hope i helped in some way , peace</div></div><hr />

Wow you got agro from malo bouncing? seems kinda strange.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ceno has ungodly aggro. Just the other day I watched him train zone in nexuse. After he pulled newbi aggro by casting a buff :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">man, FA is underrate, Q+FA is our most useful spell, you will cast these 2 spell most of time<br />
<br />
Fo7 - is best raid spell but ok for exp group since it easy to FoSoul 5 people and have to buff single focus after rez<br />
<br />
Q = Q_Q<br />
<br />
Malos - don't have, don't really need it since malo+Malosinia is good enough <br />
<br />
BoS - don't have yet, I don't like dotting anyway, I go nuking all time (with my +23% focus), which have same mana effeciency as casting Bane of Nife<br />
<br />
FA - this is one of most useful spell if you aren't lazy; I cast it all time, exp or raid; most melee don't like use their primal those day</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You wanna know the true beatuy of malo and malos ?<br />
<br />
Meming them bolth and chain debuffing  on a fast paced raid and not having to wait for a gem refresh.<br />
