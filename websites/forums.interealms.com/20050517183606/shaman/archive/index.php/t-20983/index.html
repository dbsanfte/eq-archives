<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>siden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
Getting a little tired of my shammy/monk combo and fancy a re-roll from scratch with both my accounts.  I love that 'ding' sound :)<br />
<br />
I don't have much decent twink gear, but I do have a CoCW (36% haste) and a Windblade - plus around 120k once I've liquidated a bit of stuff from my monk.<br />
<br />
What would folks suggest for a fun effective duo nowadays, excluding monk and shammy?<br />
<br />
I was going to level up an SK to go with Shammy, but really think I need a complete change.<br />
<br />
Goal is to get to 65 and be able to do some farming or AAing, and possibly group and LDoN depending on time and my sociability at the time.  (my wizzy main is in a raiding guild which takes a fair bit of my time).<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Siden.<br />

<br />
<br />
Seriously, pick a class that has heals, and pick a class that does damage, and mix the two.  Preferable have one of those two classes be able to tank or slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">BST/CLR works pretty well... but no snare<br />
BST/DRU works good too... but no lull indoors</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Chanter Cleric all the way. The higher end would be sick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I had some friends a number of years ago that did a rogue/druid combo, the druid would snare and aggro kite/dot the mob while the rogue backstabed it....granted this was before some aggro issues were changed and I am not really sure that would work now. (In fact I am pretty certain it wouldnt, but a nice druid/beast/mage/necro combo would work in similar fasion)<br />
I also have a few RL friends that did a Paladin/Cleric combo all the way to 65...did CB-&gt;Unrest-&gt;Mistmore-&gt;CoM-&gt;UP-&gt;Veksar and occasionally ventured out to the real world for raids, gear ups etc, but they have basically Duoed till 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Duid/paladin is a combo that works pretty well.  Healing is thin between 20ish and 44ish, but with 2 classes that can heal you should be ok.  <br />
<br />
Cleric/Paladin is a great idea, as are the zone suggestions.  Im thinking that would be one of the more interesting duo possibilities.  <br />
<br />
Douing 2 caster classes is a little harder, but druid/necro is a fine combination and one that will be able to rake in the exp.<br />
<br />
Im currently playing with a Wizard/necro combo on test.  Ive got a 43 wizard on one of my accounts, and was looking for a partner for him so he doesnt always have to go it alone or sit /lfg forever.  So far it works remarkably well.  Necro sets up the fear kite and the wizard burns it down.  Only thing that really lacks is consistant heals, but with evacs and ports a click away it has not yet been a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Chanter/Drood for my money: not too pretty in the lower levels, but as both classes grow they will  compliment each other very well. <br />
Clarity/kei makes a huge difference to a druid , and root/snare/heal:mez/debuff/slow is a big asset with your double charmed pets later on.<br />
Other utilities at your disposal include evac, port, sow, ds, ae capability.<br />
<br />
Pick your zones well and you won't be sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Make a ranger to go with your shaman, by the time you get to the top end it will be a totally different world with the ranger just sitting back and doing dmg and your shaman tanking.... make an enchanter to go with the ranger.. ranger = same as monk account, so you can clarity yourself and work as a fear kiting team. If you want you can buff your ranger still with the shaman, then log onto the enchanter...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">didnt think of dual charmed pets and snare and stuff.<br />
<br />
Maybe druid enchanter is the ultimite team.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">magician + necro<br />
<br />
2 pet classes should be a relatively easy 2-box.  This particular duo seems to have the best flexibility.  Though I wouldn't argue with necro + necro, necro + beastlord, or even beastlord+beastlord or magician + magician.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Druid + Enchanter. <br />
<br />
Track + Heal + Snare + Get there Now from Druid<br />
<br />
Slow + Haste + Mana Regen + DPS from Enchanter<br />
<br />
If all you want to do is hear 'ding' then not sure your problem is the Shaman. You very well could be back here asking the same question when the novelty of Charm wears off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>armagedon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hya,<br />
<br />
I am playing a druid / necro duo. This duo is quite fun in outdoor but very limited indoor and quite hard to play.<br />
<br />
The 14 min snare is invaluable with a necro. But you need ton of space and ton of skill to dual box using Agro kiting in end game. Fear kiting is easier but fear is limited after 60.<br />
Mana regen on druid is a problem until 55+ if you cant afford or find a KEI. After 55, the lack of slow vs living mob start to hurt. But you can live without it using agro kiting method or Charm.<br />
Druid Teleportation is really nice and i use it all the time.<br />
Plus, Necro still the best farmer of the game.<br />
<br />
If i would reroll i would probably choose a Necro/Shaman instead of my actual necro/druid. With Pok you can live without Teleportation but you cant live without slow.<br />
<br />
In my opinion Necro/Shaman is the best duo in EQ. High DPS, 2 pets, Mana regen on both, Summon corpse, 93% Rez, Ton of buffs, Haste, Slow, Ton of dots and DD, Resists debuffs, Fear, Snare, Some tanking abilities with the shaman + 2 pets. You cant find better.<br />
<br />
Followed by SK / Shaman in a close second with less DPS but better tanking abilities.<br />
<br />
But if you really want to try something different on both account then i suggest :<br />
1) BST/CLERIC (easy to multi box and always in demand in group. Cleric hp buffs on both PET + BST help a lot)<br />
2) BST/Druid (better DPS but less defensive)<br />
3) Necro/Druid (A challenge to play but fun and powerfull. Less powerfull than necro/Shaman)<br />
<br />
Chanty/Druid is a mistake in my opinion. To wait 60 lvls to shine is way to long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>scowls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">its hard to pull off but a Bard/Druid combo can really tear down mobs.  The bard kinda needs alot of attention with twisting songs, or make some hotkeys to twist for you/ bu you cant beat the regen/selos/focus that a high end bard delivers.  bard can pull with HoS,snare, and slow.  the druid snares/roots. next bard sings call of the muse while the druid dots the bejesus out of A_soontobedeadmob_1, and the bard can add in 600 or so a tick dmg with dots and regen the druid at teh same time.  and if all else fails, theres exodus or bard speed to get out FAST</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Depends a bit what you want to do, but to be capable of fighting in a variety of places you would want<br />
<br />
My favoured classes excluding the monk/shaman are probably beastlord, druid, necro, SK.<br />
<br />
Beastlord brings slows+dps, and paragon at high levels is great. <br />
Druid brings healing, porting, buffs, charm, and respectable dps<br />
Necro is just extremely versatile, and against undead can slow/cc. At high levels their health and mana taps are significant. <br />
SK is imo the bset choice of the tanking classes. Summon corpse, snare, FD, taps, HT... all good.<br />
<br />
Which combo of those to take is tricky. <br />
<br />
Beast/Necro could be real fun but limited in some areas. Massive DPS, slows, rez, fd, snare, mana regen... lacks big heals and tanking ability<br />
<br />
SK/Druid probably gives the most flexibility but you miss any slowing abilty. Druid charm is a big factor later on.<br />
<br />
SK/Beast has some healing (bst gives paragon + small heals, SK lifetaps, and bst pet heals too), slow, tanking ability and good dps. Drawback is lack of decent heals for tough mobs or oh crap! situations.<br />
<br />
I quite like the druid + enchanter combo but if they nerf charm further then you're a bit stuck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I recently inherited a retiring friend's shadowknight... and the absolute fun and ownage level renewed my flagging interest.<br />
<br />
There isn't much a shadowknight and shaman cannot duo.<br />
<br />
[edit]  I guess I was lacking a point there.  My point is that even if you think you need to take a break from the shaman, shadowknights are more badass than you might at first think.  Lifetaps are uber and compliment our heals well.  Aggro is never a problem and snare is wicked nice.<br />
<br />
Seriously though I can't recommend SK enough.  I never realized how kickass they were.  Had I, I wouldn't have twinked out my 53 monk but done a Shadowknight instead.<br />
<br />
One caveat, this particular SK is pretty uber, so quite a few hitpoints and decent mana.  But I can't imagine him being any less fun as a normal &quot;bazaar&quot; shadowknight.  The fun level isn't from playing in &quot;God&quot; mode, it's from the raw synergy of the duo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>horaxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My preference for duo has always been SK/Shm<br />
<br />
 Especially if you have a Wingblad, CoCW, and some PP You're almost there :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Crash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Druid/chanter would be incredible at hi lvl but that is predicated upon having two charm pets going at once which I would imagine is difficult and extremley risky for a 2-boxer to pull off.  My 65 chanter friend finds charming plenty of work while one boxing and he only likes to do it when there is cleric in group for rez :)<br />
<br />
I agree with the SK/SHM combo for lots of fun and versatility.<br />
<br />
Considering he already played monk/shm and wants all new start I think necro/mage or would be awesome combo and easiest to 2-box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>ShaitynAB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Beast/Necro could be real fun but limited in some areas. Massive DPS, slows, rez, fd, snare, mana regen... lacks big heals and tanking ability<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
65 beastlord here.  I duo with my wife's 64 necro constantly.  No, we're not gonna kill raid type mobs together, but aside from that there's very little we can't do.  Between her mana and health taps I stay relatively healthy and happy most of the time and if I get low, I can just back out and let the pets do some work.<br />
<br />
Having said that, I'm looking for a new duo for us as well.  I'm making a new shaman (played one for 58 levels then quit eq) and she's wants a pure melee.  Any thoughts on which of monk, warrior, or berserker would be the most well rounded dps/tanking wise?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>armagedon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">To play one class is easy but to play two class same time is really hard ! You ll lose about 30 to 50% of eatch class efficiency when you dual box.<br />
<br />
Bard or chanty need too much attention in my opinion to be viable in a multi box configuration.<br />
To use charm in a multi box configuration is just a suicide unless it's Dire Charm. And Dire charm is limited to lvl 46 at max, it's why i dont like much the duo Chanty/Dru.<br />
<br />
Necro/Mage is not a valuable duo in my opinion too. Cause after lvl 60 you lack of slow vs living mobs.<br />
<br />
Slow is invaluable after 55. Mobs hit too hard even with two pets. Using agro kiting method using 2 accounts is just a pain. So take a slower in your duo.<br />
<br />
For these reasons i would stay with one slower in my duo. Only 4 class are good slower in EQ : Shaman, Chanty, Bst and Bard. I would skipped chanty and bard cause they need too much attention. So only shaman and BST stay in the mele. BST is a very fun class to play but BST got slow too late in game in my opinion.<br />
<br />
It's why i would stay with :<br />
SK-SHAMAN<br />
MONK-SHAMAN<br />
NECRO-SHAMAN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Badz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Duos I have enjoyed the most playing as a 2-boxer:<br />
<br />
Warrior-Shaman (main)<br />
Mage-Cleric (no snare but clerics root works great)<br />
Ranger-wizard (challenging but really fun)<br />
BST-druid (getting to the 50's almost too easy)</div></div><hr />
