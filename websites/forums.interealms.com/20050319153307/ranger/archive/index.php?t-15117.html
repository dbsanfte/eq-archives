I hear BoT is awful, nearly as bad as HoH.  We get the rare spectral off various boss or mini-boss encounters, but really not enough to hope to get lucky.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?<br />
<br />
Could be Tactics is the place to be, we haven't had a shot at Behemoth yet.<br />
<br />
Love to hear your thoughts !<br />

<br />
PoN spiders were good till they nerfed drop rate. seem as though everywhere i have been now they are either super rare or drop off named mobs.....eventually they will trickle down so that not as many will need. but thats a few months down the road. just be glad we arnt shaman or chanters or another class that has a TON of spells to get. but gettign earthern roots over and over sucks</div></div><hr />

<br />
The one that was killed right next to us while we were farming BoT key stuffs had 3 spectrals on it.  There are 5/6 named and they respawn every 4 hours or so, so not a terrible way to go if you have the people available.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The ones that are a 4(6? i think really) hour spawn rarely drop a single parchment, and most of the time it is an ethereal from my experience. They can rarely drop a spectral though.  If you did see a named giant with 3 spectrals on it my guess is its the big named that take an AoW type raid force to kill, not he mini-bosses who take 2-3 groups.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As previously said, the boss Giants are not little fuzzy animals, they are tough mofos. They melee like a bitch, each has a unique &quot;ability&quot; (best word I could think of), and are now unslowable.</div></div><hr />

Going to suck if you have to kill Rallos Zek before you get to a point that regular mobs can drop em.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Viken</div><div class="date">12-09-2002, 11:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The mini boss giants in PoS drop parchments *often* and I would say 50% of them are spectral and 50% are ethereal. Sometimes they have none and sometimes they have one of each. Crashing Wave Earring and some 16 / 22 Katar also drops from them.</div></div><hr />

saw an improved dmg 4 ring, hybrid classes only drop too...<br />

beware the Stampedes!<br />

p.s. getting sp on raids for rangers = icky ... and rightfully so , so opt for the exp group</div></div><hr />

Anyway you slice it from items to parchments itemization in this expansion is just as retarded as any other. You'd think after 3 dam years they'd catch a clue and stop this ****.</div></div><hr />

Take  down the 4 65 level bosses and they drop them sometimes, as well as PoP quest legs which arent bad.<br />
<br />
Also, blue con named here can drop them as well....just got to learn the zone and now how to pull it  )</div></div><hr />
