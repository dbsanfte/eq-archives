<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Had an EQ LAN party at my house last weekend and did some normal LDONs with three VP-enabled shaman.  Wow, that was a blast!<br />
<br />
Typically we didn't worry too much about pulling singles (this was only a normal, after all) and we VP-parked all the adds.  Usually we played &quot;mob hockey&quot; and tried to knock them onto each other (or the enchanter).  Once every few minutes we'd call DOGPILE! and send 13 AA pets on a mob.  Drove the chanter crazy, though, because we'd dot all the parked adds while she tried to mez them.<br />
<br />
The warrior would turn from tanking a mob down to grab one of the parked adds, and discover that it was at 10% health due to dots and dogs.  All in all if we kept 2-3 parked at all times our kill rate was pretty good - DOT damage stacks great when spread out over multiple simultaneous mobs.<br />
<br />
It was a very fun set of runs, and we didn't have any problems finishing on time.  If I recall correctly, we did it with<br />
<br />
SHM SHM SHM WAR WIZ CLR - ~45 minutes<br />
SHM SHM SHM WAR WAR CLR - ~75 minutes<br />
SHM SHM SHM WAR WAR ENC - ~80 minutes<br />
<br />
And we weren't particularly rushed on any of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't like doing normal with an enchanter, it takes my efficiency and pets out of the game.  Sometimes I want to tell the enchanter, stop mezzing and nuke or charm or something instead!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I find it amusing that a wizard cut 35 minutes off your time....just one wizard. Of course I have no idea what adventures you picked so it could have been an easy collect and the others were assassinate or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless it's their first LDON, any Enchanter worth their salt is charming in a normal. Sure, they could chain cast their top two nukes (snicker), but why?<br />
<br />
A typical LDON normal MOB max hits 392 or so. He can be WOM'ed (Word of Morrelled), Pally stunned or even temp mezzed to help regain aggro.<br />
<br />
But beware the unwritten LDON code:<br />
<br />
If pull =4+ MOBs then Charm = break.<br />
<br />

<br />
Sick, sick DPS.  And they always, and I mean ALWAYS seem to have mana.  I did a normal with two Time - Level wizzies.  Think we were finishing in about 26 minutes. Most time was spent running to find MOBs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">LDoN's are fun, i seem to have the most fun while pulling.  But i normally only do them with guildies/friends that can survive my pulling.  <br />
<br />
It normally goes like this first 2-3 pulls are warm up, i only bring 2-4 mobs.  After that i don't come back to the camp with fewer than 5 mobs.  Doing this seems to keep people busy killing, and it's more fun than single/double pull city.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I haven't played EQ with a bunch of friends on a LAN in a long time, but it is a blast for sure!  With three Shaman, in the same house, you shoulda done the LDoN with just you three :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">if you have a chanter he should be pulling, premez/tashing the next target while the group is killing and feeding the shaman info on what needs to be slowed. I have done a ton of ldons with my chanter and only a bard pulls better than I do. (even then it takes a good bard to out pull me) I dont charm in most ldons the extra dps is usless if the pulls arent fast enough, with my usual crew we can burn your average ldon in under 40 minutes with a lame group, under 25 with a high dps one. <br />
<br />
if your chanter aint pulling he sucks :( (just my opinion)<br />
<br />
oh yeah and 3 vp shaman in an ldon would rock, esp with voice chat/same room comunication.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Interesting you say this.  I noticed this when me and my chanter buddy were taking our 3 man group through to work up our zerker twink.<br />
<br />
65 Shaman and Enchater and a 58 Zerker.<br />
<br />
We charmed a dog and everytime I pulled more then 3 mobs charm would break and we would wipe heh.<br />
<br />
It was easier to deal with once we stopped alpha'ing the charmed pet.<br />
<br />
Even the times where we didnt wipe, charm broke 2-3 times during the 4 pull fight where we could go 7-10 single pulls and never have charm break at all.  /shrug.</div></div><hr />

I think what made the adventures so easy was the communication.  There was no need to type out what was going on, adds were called and handled easily.  <br />
<br />
3 VP shaman did play a major role tho.  Not to mention the crapload of dogs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">in a good LDoN group, the enchater shouldnt be pulling, the monk (or ranger) should be Chain Pulling, the enchanter should have a pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Not true. Monk or Ranger = DPS. You want a non-DPS class (like a cleric or yourself) to be pulling to maximize DPS.</div></div><hr />

in a high dps group I can do an ldon in 25minutes or less with me as puller and a good tank/shaman combo to handle slows and the mobs in camp, explain to me how you can speed up the process with a charmed pet and slower pulls? with a good shaman on slows I can line up 4 mobs at a time and do this the entire time...explain again how a charmed pet helps at all? cause at 700 mana per cast CoD will run me oom with a few early breaks, if I am medding then we arent pulling, if we arent pulling then we arent killing and that means time wasted. <br />
<br />
so please enlighten me, as a chanter who knows full well how much dps a pet can crank out and uses charmed pets a hell of a lot how I can work in pet charming to my ldons when I can already blow them out in 30 minutes or less with an average group make up of tank/healer/slower/2 random dps and myself? if you cant pull better than I can (and that means 2 mobs or more in camp at virtualy all times, slowed and ready to gank) then I suggest you do like everyone else does, sit back and kill what I tell you to...and enjoy the fast safe points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">2 random dps in a grp  = high dps group?<br />
<br />
Maybe if you are left out and a 3rd dps joins. :D</div></div><hr />

First off - DPS is like sex - you can never have enough.<br />
<br />
Second, my Enchanter pulls all normals unless someone has a Jones for it or the group makeup (I do a lot of pickups) is weak.  Define &quot;weak&quot; : SK's who can't hold aggro, Clerics asleep at the switch, yadda, yadda.<br />
<br />
Until I get a pet I am stuck nuking and pulling. Once I get a pet I have the pet attack current MOB that I have already tashed, slowed, rooted and or mezzed.<br />
<br />
That's right, it's locked and c0cked for the group to kill.<br />
<br />
Third, log into Xev, do an 'Alt-V' and look up Mystyqe. Currently I'm 315-6 in LDONs with those being a mix of hards and normals.<br />
<br />
This ain't rocket science folks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gegen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">haven't done a normal LDoN with an enchanter in about 2 months, and in those two months I've only been grouping with people from my guild, who are all time geared,  all adventures finished in under 30minutes unless our group makeup just flat out sucked.. most finished around 20mins, no way an enchanter could make it go much faster, clearing out areas so fast forced us to move a lot cutting down on killing time and the puller generally can't pull fast enough (without training 6-8 mobs on us which could cause problems) to keep up with our kill rate.</div></div><hr />

Dogpile, mob hockey...!<br />
<br />
Priceless! Laughing very much IRL from reading this :D</div></div><hr />

OLIDUS!!!!1!!!!!<br />
<br />
Dang lurker.<br />
<br />
I don't remember which one the wiz was on, whether it was a collect or what... we had two collects and a slaughter, IIRC.  We weren't that uptight on time, though, just enjoying ourselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I am so sick and tired of when you get 4 mobs or more and at first its not going good until each mob is slowed.  Once they are all slowed the group starts focusing on parking and taking out a couple at a time.  Shaman starts helping cleric heal when needed and parks with VP.  Fight starts turning in your favor when some nervous bastard clicks the evac spell.  Pisses me off.  I am starting to hate grouping with people who have Evac because they are all too ready to use it when not needed.  Mostly afte a situation like this they are ready to start using again on a double pull.  Very agrivating.</div></div><hr />

So true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Heh.. when we get a big pull on my wiz.. u get sort of nervous.. becuz u dunno if u can handle them.. and if i dont do it right i get bitched at.. and if i do it early i get bitched at.. its hard to tell whats the right time imo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Just finished a normal LDOn with a BL and Ranger healing.  You heard me.<br />
<br />
BL and Ranger.<br />
<br />
(Cleric couldn't zone in, apparently he didn't have the LDON files on his new computer.  How he was able to get the adventure in the first place I dunno)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Once when my computer wasn't working, I used my brother's computer to play EQ...but he didn't have the LDoN expansion. Well I didn't even think of this until my group zoned in without me. I believe I switched to my other brother's computer to get in, while the first computer was downloading files for LDoN. =P<br />
<br />
So maybe the cleric had the ldon expansion for his/her account but just forgot to download files?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Yeah, that happened to my wife.  When LDON first came out she bought the expansion via the web page but never clicked the button to download LDON files.  So she was LDON flagged and it gave her an adventure, but wouldn't let her zone in.<br />
<br />
She was Not Happy with a loss to start the expansion with.</div></div><hr />
