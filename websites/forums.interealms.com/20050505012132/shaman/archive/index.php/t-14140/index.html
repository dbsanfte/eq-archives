<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Catbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello there.  I have played EQ since it went public but recently quit the game 4+ weeks ago thinking Star Wars: Galaxies was due out &amp; now I am thinking of just returning to EQ instead.   <br />
<br />
For the most part, I wont have the time needed to group except for on the weekends so am looking for the best soloist class available so I can play as soon as I log on rather than spend an hour+ LFG.<br />
<br />
NOTE:  I hate playing a pure castor so they are out.  Pure casters are just too wimpy for me.<br />
<br />
So of the following classes, which is the best soloist?:<br />
1. Shaman<br />
2. Bard<br />
3. Beastlord<br />
<br />
I no longer have my 65 Enchanter account so will be starting over gearless &amp; coinless but if I recall.....Shaman &amp; Beastlords do ok that way at first.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the input.  Feel free to send your input to me at lagbeast@earthlink.net or post it here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shaman (outside of PoP) have allways been masters of taking down tough mobs (for the level).  If you like a challenge you're probably best of with a shaman.<br />
Beastlords get very good at higher levels in taking down a lot of mobs, same with bards.  So you probably get a lot of experience faster then a shaman at the end.<br />
On the other hand, shaman are basically self sufficient (but for rez) throughout their whole career, while I found the lack of decent healing for the BL hindering at the beginning as pure solo class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Of those three, BL is by far the best soloist.  We're good at soloing big mobs, but not soloing as the fastest way to level.  BL's are good melees, have great pets and their spells are nice too.  They're not as 00bear as Shammy's are in high-end groups and raids, but not bad there either....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Apothian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I myself am real picky about classes.  I have 2 characters,  my Shaman of course and a beastlord.  Both are great classes but when it comes to raw power the Bst takes the cake.  The shaman wins in overall usefulness, he can slow, dot, nuke, cripple, sick pet,  and heal(better than the Bst).  The choice is yours friend, I cant lean either way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Are they good soloists ? They are one of the best int he game. with the charm abilities with pop things have changes a lil but id say we are still the top 3. we arent fast but we can outlast anything indenfinatly that isnt hitting over 300ish a hit. extremly self reliant, frankly i cant think of a better suited to solo. the necro is damn good but has to rely lifetaps and have to worry about resists, we do not. same with wizzies and enchanters, they cant heal themselves and one of them has atleast resists to worry about.<br />
<br />
Utility we own all classes so gorups are probably easier to our class then any class in the game, except clerics.<br />
<br />
yes yes we are great soloers, but certainly not the best int he game</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zyphun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I can only speak from personal experience, but I would say that shaman's are an incredible soloing class. Are we the best? Depends on how much work you want to put into it. You ruled out playing a cure caster so I'll leave out a necro, but I really think you should look into a bard. Not only are they incredible soloers (not so much at first but as they get higher they become more powerful), but when you reach the high end game, you can look forward to being in high demand.  Your soloing is mostly spent in long bouts of intense situations while you're charm kiting followed by long periods of recovery while you're regening mana. Bard charm takes mana, mana for bards is hard to regen (easily taking an hour to go from being out of mana to being full mana). There are of course other methods of soloing as a bard, but this one is I think considered the most efficient. I personally played a bard up to 54, I couldn't take the song weaving I was required to do. I like to chat to much on occasion and not getting to answer tells bothered me. If you want a better idea of playing a bard, go to the Concert Hall (http://www.attcanada.net/~reaper) and EQDiva (http://www.eqdiva.com).<br />
<br />
Personally, I soloed all the way up until I was 54 and leveled quickly doing it (level 1 to 52 in a month, no powerleveling). I occasionally still do solo, but I am more comfortable and see better XP in a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm in the same boat as you.  Work and family limit my play time to 2 or 3 hours a week.  Quit EQ around Luclin for about a year, came back PoP.<br />
<br />
Old friends with whom I fought desperate battles on the Elite ledge in BB twinked me up, as they are now in their 60's.  See if you can call in some old favors  :cool: <br />
<br />
Played several classes (not BST) to 30's and Shaman are the best, for me.  Very self-sufficient, especially with stoicism.<br />
<br />
Bards are out for me 'cause I hate to twist.  I can pet-kite as a Shaman, albeit not as well as a bard of course, if that's you're thing.<br />
<br />
BST and Shaman can go in teh face, and thats about as un-caster as you can get.<br />
<br />
Another thought- BST gear is expensive relative to Shammy stuff.<br />
If you're starting from scratch expense may be an issue.<br />
<br />
Of course 33 levels without a pet is an issue too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You have picked three excellent solo classes... and have posed a very difficult question.<br />
<br />
Shaman - can kill damn near anything solo (within reason) - but not necessarily quickly.  We can keep ourselves healed, MOBs debuffed, and deal enough damage to eventually kill it.<br />
<br />
Beastlords - short in the healing department, but tough and resilient and great DPS with their pets.  They can kill a steady stream of medium dark blues - but I wouldn't take on a white or higher.<br />
<br />
Bards - if you like INTENSE soloing... pulling 10+ MOBs and swarm kiting has been confirmed to be the FASTEST possible exp in the game (there was one particular situation in HoH where bards were bringing in 6-7 AA points per pull in about 45minutes time).  This is the most labor intensive type of solo and probably only good for an adrenaline junky.  You will fail often and die or cause others to die while doing it - but your net exp gain is still good.<br />
<br />
Which is better?  Depends on your play style.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bards can kill pretty much anything that doesn't summon.  And there's a lot of that in PoP.  Very little downtime (charm eats a little bit of mana each time, but with FT1+, it's not too fast), but, as another poster mentioned, it is very intense, both mentally and physically.  They are the most physically taxing class, with twisting, in a manner that no other, not even shaman canni dancing, comes close to.  I stopped playing my 47 bard because it annoyed me.<br />
<br />
Sub-PoP, shaman can kill damn near anything, summoning or not, it may just take a long time.  In PoP, you'll rely more on root-rotting (rooting a mob then DOTing it to death), so summoning mobs are your targets of choice.<br />
<br />
Beastlord:  Insanely damaging, and can slow and tank decently.  Up to 60, they're awesome soloers.  I dunno how that changes for them 61+, but I'd imagine they'd be as unable to tank a mob w/out a backup healer as I am as a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>bremadle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Taken from another topic but yes shaman are good soloests. I can get 5 aa in a day if i work it not as fast as maybe a chanter or a bard... but IMO they cant kill red cons like we can<br />
<br />
 VP is actually usefull for soloing, but you have to have VP3.. it refreshs about 5 seconds before it wears off on a mob.<br />
<br />
It allows you to solo gurdians in fire, the first set in the first castle give about 10% aa exp solo every 4 to 5 minutes, the second set, I do the ones outside of FR's ring about 19% aa every 6 to 7 minutes. This is before the upcoming solo exp nerf. the only time its ever wore off early is when a ranger that tagged along wouldn't stop useing his proc bow.<br />
Btw if you try this keep in mind these mobs hit for 900+ and fast ( i dont bother slowing them when I solo) though i have never died doing it I have been yacking while killing these and missed the refresh on VP and gotten smacked a few times.. LR5 and VP's knock back are the only things that saved me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Bards simply obliterate every class in the &quot;soloing for xp 1-65&quot; category.  They can do with extremely poor gear.  It is no accident that the levelling race on Stromm has been dominated by bards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have to agree, the ability of bards to rack up experience at high levels is truly obscene.<br />
<br />
That said, shamans offer an amazing combination of solo ability, group desirability, and are probably the best small-group class in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ohaern Halveric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Speaking from personal expierience, we are  great. My definition of great being based on soloing from 1-60 +73 aa points (no horse, no epic, still).  The shaman makes a great soloist for a few other reasons, that seem to work nicely with your situation.  1- we can solo for xp no porblem, and when we do have the time for a group, they tend to snap us up rather quickly, not alot of lost time.  2- We can support ourselves at lower levels fairly easily, and as we progress it gets easier and easier to keep supporting yourself ( tho having made it to 65 once  already you can always hit up your old friends for some seed money )<br />
<br />
   I went back to the shaman with the advent of druid  ch going live. Having spent the previous 4 years as a cleric I was extremely annoyed with EQ and  verant, but  didnt want to  lose the friends made over the time spent gaming. Wasn't about to make a  druid either!<br />
<br />
    Shaman dont kill as fast as some of the other soloists, but you  did not care for necro anyway, so that likely wont be an issue. Keep this in mind too, slow and steady wins the race. Point proved by the Tortoise and the Hare fable. If anything - we shaman are the masters of slow and steady !<br />
<br />
   Good luck no matter what route you decide to go.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Personal experience:<br />
<br />
As a shaman I *CAN* solo... but its not great.  If I want to I can always find mobs that I can solo, but progress may be very slow if the right camps arent available.  I am more valuable in a group than solo.  Shaman can solo the toughest mobs -we are masters of the long fight: in a war of attrition, the shaman wins.<br />
<br />
I played a bard.  They are unreal.  There is very little they cant do.  They dont add to the power of a group, they multiply it.  They can solo, mostly by kiting.  They can take anywhere from one to dozens of mobs at a time, and dont usualy need to stop and med/heal after a fight.  On the other hand, they are WAY too much work to play. This is true from level 1 to 65.<br />
<br />
I have never tried a beastlord.</div></div><hr />

<br />
...so will be starting over gearless &amp; coinless but if I recall.....Shaman &amp; Beastlords do ok that way at first.<br />
<br />
If you are just looking for any class at all to play, given your situation, a Druid would actually make much more sense.  They can solo far better than Shamans and possibly Bards if you dont have the plat to spend on some nice gear.  Also, if you will be solo most of the time, you will have easy transport as well.<br />
<br />
Shamans really aren't very good soloers (this is *without* c3 mind you, a monkey could solo with any class + c3) until pretty high level, 49 would be my mark and even then, without toys / gear, it's still lousy compared to some other good solo classes.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, when you reach higher level with a shaman (particularly 65 with Blood of Saryn, Breath of Ulthor, epic and horse) then shamans are not only very good soloers, but are probably by far the *safest*.  Slow mob, root mob, dot and watch tv...heal when needed.  At 65 with those two dots and epic we can easily solo without any other classes buffs, a feat I believe fairly difficult to do by any other class except necros?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Depends on what ure definition of best is.  As far as taking down the most difficult mobs, then yes shm are the best.  However as far as gettin xp the fastest we are not.  We still are pretty good thou at gettin xp solo, and certainly great in grps, so overall we come out pretty good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Athenae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Taken from another topic but yes shaman are good soloests. I can get 5 aa in a day if i work it not as fast as maybe a chanter or a bard... but IMO they cant kill red cons like we can <br />
<br />
Sorry but good enchanters and necros can and indeed do kill red cons that shamans wouldn't even think once about soloing.  Thats not to say shamans are not good soloers though.  Necros, Shammies, Druids, Chanters, Wixxors, and Beastlords are all great soloers.  Even some rangers are decent at soloing :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">there used to be clear cut top soloers.  In the past it was really the shaman class that was the king of trophy soloing, and necros, wizards, druids the kings of exp soloing.  Bards were pretty much overlooked, but in many cases they could solo better than anyone, trophy or exp.<br />
<br />
The shaman class isnt the king of anything soloing anymore.  If you are looking for soloing at the high end, go for a class that can charm or kill multiple non-summoners at once, efficiently.  We can solo but not as fast as other classes, nor the big ticket targets that other classes can.  <br />
<br />
Bards can ae kite, swarm with charms... Druids and Wizards can quad.   Enchanters, Necro, Mage and Druids can charm.   So since you ruled out pure casters, that leaves Bards and Druids. <br />
<br />
Druids aren't on your list, so I would choose bard.  Druids would probably be my vote as the strongest soloer, since they have the most tools.  But I think bard is the fastest soloer.  The only piece of equipment a bard really needs is epic, and they can use instruments until then... which you can buy at a vendor.<br />
<br />
Good luck with your new char.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Eilderts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Honestly I would start a halfling druid if I were you. Solo game is great exp, and if you don't like it too much, you will be lvling so fast that you will soon be high enough to farm some decent stuff for a new main. <br />
<br />
Anything halfling would be good to restart. But druids are very good, and very easy. Thats why a lot of dr00ds are lil pricks. They haven't toiled to reach the levels they have like the rest of us. Thats why the pansy dr00d always dies in the group for some dumbass reason. Like pulling the entire WR and RR in HHK comes to mind (note we were a 4 person GR group).<br />
<br />
Anyways, solo you have a few cut and dry choices. With crap equipment to start, these are basically your only choices, as any other class would have to rely on grouping at least for a little while cuz they're gimp.<br />
<br />
Mage<br />
Necro<br />
Wiz<br />
Dr00d<br />
Bard* <br />
Shm*<br />
<br />
*These classes might have difficulties pre-30s or so. A bard with suck equipment will take a while to kill something, while a shm with crap equipment probably can't kill without some crack on him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">There's a really simple answer to that question.  <br />
But it eludes me.  Beastlords are not better soloists, unless the mobs are trivial as hell that is.  If the mobs are wimpy hitters, sure they can outsolo us, they have more steady DPS potential = more mobs per hour.  However, TierII+ PoP mobs aren't known for hitting like girls, so I think a beastlord would be best grouping for exp rather than trying to gimp out a few mobs before another extended med break.  <br />
<br />
Bards are great soloers . . . but they use nontraditional methods as do chanters and druids.  All of those classes, including necros with lvl 65 undead charm and CoD access, outsolo a shaman at least 2 to 1 in PoP.<br />
<br />
But don't count us out.  You know the dragons around TOV in Western Wastes?  The ones in the valley, the nesting ones.  I took out all three of them on the right side (Drazaak, Derisinal, Ayillish), one after another, solo, self buffed only, and had no accidents doing it.  Not too many other classes that could do such a thing.  Necros could solo Yeldema easily, as I remember, but she's only like lvl 52, as compared to the lvl 56 and 58 dragons I am referring to (Fear don't work past 55 folks, and Fear was their strategy for winning vs. a summoning dragon).  Bards used to be able to exploit solo there, but I think that has been nerfed, so maybe . . if they got lucky . . . maybe. <br />
Beastlords?  Hah, don't make me laff buuuuddeee.  It won't be done by a beastlord.  Enchanter could do it with luck and the right pet.  If luck failed tho, a summoning dragon isn't the best when you also have a hasted pet on yer butt.  I think it'd be quite risky for a chanter.  <br />
<br />
I've also soloed my way to fungi king camp and held it solo.  A 65 beastlord in my guild tried it, and didn't make it past illis jail.  Nope, he was asking for a SC2.  Said having a little spell like &quot;Root&quot; woulda made it possible.  Also having a decent heal might have done it too.<br />
<br />
Edit: typos</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I think you have to break soloing up into various stages, the game changes at various stages. Although like some of the other posters said, a druid with KEI is immensely powerful in the hands of a skilled player.<br />
<br />
At low levels shaman spells are distinctly underpowered, I think the bard songs have time efficiency issues. However the beastlord pet is an easily accessible monster. Unless you are well twinked the beastlord is an extremely impressive soloist.<br />
<br />
Endgame soloing is undoubtably bard. The essence of PoP soloing is to not get hit due to the monstrous mob DPS. In olden days Torpor could keep up with the DPS of a slowed mob, but the ratio has been smashed in PoP (no healing upgrade and huge increase in mob DPS). So shaman are reduced to root rotting, albeit with high mana regen. <br />
<br />
Druids still outsolo shaman though. That werewolf camp in PoN, and frogs in PoS I believe, are insane XP for a druid with fairly minimal risk. Root rot is more widely applicable of course.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know there are mobs I can take down that an enchanter would have problems with, not so sure of necro though. I'd pretty much put the Shaman vs. enchanter/necro issue as being equalized. It goes both ways as far as who can or cannot take down a mob solo.<br />
<br />
I have personally fought two red cons at once at 65 and won and still had 65 percent mana left. Not like I enjoyed that, but I know I can do it. I might even try to do 3 someday if I am bored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>msatchmo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Catbert,  perhaps you should just buy a lvl 65 with the money you got from ebaying your enchanter?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">what has been said is true - but applies only to the low end game. I have done an assessment of soloing in planes of power, and really its quite sad when you begin to understand it.<br />
<br />
Mobs hit too hard. What this results in is mobs are only soloable if<br />
1. The mob does not summon, and therefor can be rooted/snared to evade damage while you kill the mob<br />
2. the damage from that mob is absorbed by something with a massive pile of hitpoints (aka charming)<br />
<br />
Hybrids cannot root rot (weak DoTs), kite, nuke kite or charm (in any effective manner) therefore are unable to solo in planes of power. The only exception to this is the ranger, who can snare/bow kite. Pure melees? you must be joking, they couldn't last 5 seconds in a solo confrontation. Why? because they are forced to take 100% of the mob DPS.<br />
<br />
So this leaves us with int/wis casters<br />
<br />
Mage<br />
Wizard<br />
Necro<br />
Enchanter<br />
Druid<br />
Shaman<br />
Cleric<br />
<br />
I'll get rid of the easy ones first. Mage is gone. Why? pet must tank, due to lack of snare and. 4k hps just doesn't cut it against a PoP mob. thats like 4 rounds of damage, and 4 rounds goes damn fast when the mob is unslowed. This is the category that your beastlord fits into. NPCs are programmed to target PCs first regardless of who has more aggro, if the PC is within melee range. That means that either you or your BL pet will be taking the damage. Pet dies in seconds to a PoP mob, and even slowed its incredibly mana inefficient for you to tank for the encounters. Again, because you must face all the DPS the mob is capable of.<br />
<br />
Cleric gone, simply cant put out the DPS to make killing mobs with over 20k hitpoints lucrative xp wise.<br />
<br />
What you're left with are the only classes that can solo the high end game.<br />
<br />
Wizard<br />
Necro<br />
Enchanter<br />
Druid<br />
Shaman<br />
<br />
notice all of them do it by making sure neither they or their class summoned pets take damage, only by root rotting, kiting, or using a charmed NPC.<br />
<br />
<br />
You notice this &quot;wall of soloability&quot; for the classes I eliminated earlier around level 55, and by 61 almost nothing that yields exp for the eliminated classes is soloable.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Uber&quot; level 65 beastlords report being able to tank certain mobs in PoP solo quite well, but that's with 6K HP/1400AC. Non-ubers just pet kite with FoL and/or DOTs. Gets the job done either way, although it's situational.<br />

<br />
Worked so well I can now tell you it works at 62 too.  Heh.  THAT is something shamans can do a lot better solo -- take on summoning mobs.  Our damage mitigation is good enough to make tanking stuff that hits for 500 even doable.</div></div><hr />

He hates playing pure casters and I doubt he will be seeing 61+ solo any time soon.  He had a 65 chanter so may have just a little bit of experience with how to solo a charm class.<br />

I disagree, as do plenty others.  Mobs in PoP hit hard, not too hard.  Snakes in SSRA that are light blue and even green to a 65 hit for 300+.  Mobs in The Deep double for 250, I would expect that a level 63 or 64 experience mob should hit pretty damn hard and fast.  I have pretty old equipment and have no problem tanking any mob up to and including t3 planes (some mitigating tactics mobs are very difficult to do though).  Try it some time.  I think the only slowed mobs that are borderline are PoStorms frogs because some of them can max for close to 700.<br />
<br />
What this results in is mobs are only soloable if<br />
1. The mob does not summon, and therefor can be rooted/snared to evade damage while you kill the mob<br />
2. the damage from that mob is absorbed by something with a massive pile of hitpoints (aka charming)<br />
<br />
1. Just about every single non-summoning mob is going to be soloable by any class that can a) affect npc movement, b) do ranged damage above the mobs regen, c) a combination of the above.  A mob needs not be snared or rooted to evade the damage.<br />
<br />
2. Absorbing the damage of a mob is one way of dealing with the damage.  The reason a charmed mob is good for absorbing damage is because it will most likely have a huge amount of hitpoints.  There are many other ways of damage mitigation.<br />
<br />
Hybrids cannot root rot (weak DoTs), kite, nuke kite or charm (in any effective manner) therefore are unable to solo in planes of power. The only exception to this is the ranger, who can snare/bow kite. Pure melees? you must be joking, they couldn't last 5 seconds in a solo confrontation. Why? because they are forced to take 100% of the mob DPS.<br />
<br />
Correct.  You made this &quot;assessment&quot; on your own?<br />
<br />
Hybrids *ever* used root rot, nuke kite, and charm to solo?  Pally's straight up tanked and sk's usually fear kited.  Keep in mind, even before PoP, a level 60 hybrid was probably not soloing (for xp) anything much into the 50's.  There were exceptions of course, but for the most part, the &quot;lowest of the lowest blues&quot; worked best, just like most other classes.<br />
<br />
The game mechanics could not have remained the same with such a drastic jump in mob targets.  An SK can't fear a 62 mob, a pally can't keep up healing himself vs that mob either.  Rangers at least have the option, however slow.<br />
<br />
So this leaves us with int/wis casters<br />
<br />
Forgot bards and beastlords, both of which did and do solo very well, bards especially.<br />
<br />
I'll get rid of the easy ones first. Mage is gone. Why? pet must tank, due to lack of snare and. 4k hps just doesn't cut it against a PoP mob. thats like 4 rounds of damage, and 4 rounds goes damn fast when the mob is unslowed.<br />
<br />
Mage pets don't like to tank PoP mobs without plenty of healing, however it might help you to know that mage pets can tank unslowed mobs just fine with proper healing.  You apparently underestimate how good they are.  Mages do have that option though, as their pets won't be tanking for long.  Mages burst DPS is probably the highest of any class and when that is applied vs the correct target...splut!  Caster mobs come to mind here...<br />
<br />
This is the category that your beastlord fits into.<br />
<br />
Other than pets...umm, they are slightly different ;)<br />
<br />
NPCs are programmed to target PCs first regardless of who has more aggro, if the PC is within melee range. That means that either you or your BL pet will be taking the damage. Pet dies in seconds to a PoP mob, and even slowed its incredibly mana inefficient for you to tank for the encounters. Again, because you must face all the DPS the mob is capable of.<br />
<br />
Ask a 61+ beastlord, or preferrably a 64+ with his 64 warder, how he soloes.  You may be surprised at just how good his slows, buffs, pets and heals are.<br />
<br />
Cleric gone, simply cant put out the DPS to make killing mobs with over 20k hitpoints lucrative xp wise.<br />
<br />
I have never understood cleric soloing.  It's the same to me as warrior soloing, just more of a &quot;hey I can actually do this...kinda...well...maybe...err...ya this sucks, dammit no group, nothing on tv, but hey I can do it!&quot; mindset.  A cleric really shouldn't be able to solo, just as the warrior shouldn't.  However, clerics and warriors have their own other problems and soloing should be the *least* of their worries (ie: give them both more utility, such as self invis, sow, and for sure improve what the are actually supposed to be good at).  /backs away from that last statement very slowly, smiling, nodding, praising...run!<br />
<br />
What you're left with are the only classes that can solo the high end game.<br />
<br />
Wizard<br />
Necro<br />
Enchanter<br />
Druid<br />
Shaman<br />
<br />
+Bard, ranger, beastlord, mage<br />
<br />
notice all of them do it by making sure neither they or their class summoned pets take damage, only by root rotting, kiting, or using a charmed NPC.<br />
<br />
You could have simply just said that your listed classes solo by making sure their person doesn't die, no?  You listed ways of mitigating damage.  You forgot slow.  Come to think of it, you list a lot of ways casters are going to do damage as well, such as: summoned pets, root rot, fear / pet / aggro kiting, charmed pets.  The correlation seems to imply that you are talking mainly about casters.  Imagine that, casters doing damage in ways other than melee?  Oh ya, beastlords and rangers do melee damage too :)<br />
<br />
...and by 61 almost nothing that yields exp for the eliminated classes is soloable.<br />
<br />
Mages, bards, beastlords, rangers can all solo above 61.  Also, I wouldn't exactly rank shaman with the solo capabilities as your other listed classes.  We can and regularly do solo, extremely safely, but not all that fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Mobs very much do hit too hard.  The ones that dont arent very good xp, and ure better off killing the stuff that hits harder, but can be rooted and doesnt summon, cuz the xp on them is simply that much better.<br />
<br />
About the most Dps a shaman can absorb is 700 max hit Fully slowable, above that while the mob might be killable its just not time effective to kill because ure spending too much mana and time healing that it takes too long to kill to be worth it.  This varies on ure gear and AA of course but I think its pretty accurate for the top end.<br />
<br />
The only place ure gunna find mobs like this is in Tiers 1 - 3.  Xp in elementals is just far better cant really compare them.  Once ure in elementals more or less everything is 700+ max hit Mostly Slowable or higher Dps.  These mobs are not tankable, perhaps its actually possible if ure uber enuff, but its certainly isnt worth it to tank them, xpwise.  So u have to root/dot.<br />
<br />
Beastlords have worse heals, ac and slows then shaman the only tank aspect they beat us in is Hps.  If we cant tank Mob X they cant either.<br />
Ill admit I dont know much about Beastlords, but know alot about tanking while soloing, so I find it hard to belive that Beastlord get good xp soloing while tanking, cuz theres no way they do it in Tier 4 uber or not.  Not saying Beastlords cant get good xp or maybe even better then shamans, just that they dont do it by tanking.<br />
<br />
If someone knows a source of Fully slowable mobs that hit for &lt;800 or so max hit in Tier 4, let me know and Ill see how they fare up to root/dotting xpwise, but so far so I know there is no readily available source of them.  The key really is readily available, I mean u can tank solo doomfire wizards that are partially slowable and hit for over 700 in Fire for example, but u cant guarntee that ull only have wizards spawn.<br />
<br />
In my experience Bards are decent soloers, but without 'tricks' like swarm kiting or some other method they cant keep up enuff Dps to xp as fast as shaman.<br />
<br />
Think PennyAntics summed it up pretty well other then that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">so I find it hard to belive that Beastlord get good xp soloing while tanking, cuz theres no way they do it in Tier 4 uber or not<br />
<br />
<br />
  There is PLENTY of good exp outside of Tier 4.   Often speed of kill can outweigh the exp per kill.   And just because you aren't getting the BEST exp in the game, doesn't mean you aren't gettting GOOD exp.   So a BL can't really kill in T4... don't mean that he is going to be sitting on his arse while waiting on a group, plenty of places he can kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Not really, cuz it doesnt take that much longer to kill xp mobs in Tier4 then in lower tiers, the Hps on mobs do not vary as greatly as the amount of xp they give.<br />
<br />
I dont claim I know everything about lower Tier xp spots if someone knows where u can get better xp solo then in Castles 1 or 2 in PoF lemme know.<br />
<br />
And Im not saying Beastlords cant xp in Tier 4 or that they cant solo even there, Im just saying they dont do it by tanking.</div></div><hr />
