<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Muidem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hey, i was wondering if anyone knew the spawn time of the pxet elites in ferubi. Also a general location would rock!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Anjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They have placeholders, so the's no set respawn time on them.  You just have to go in and keep the area clean in order to get them to spawn.  As to spawn locations, I have no maps immediately handy in front of me, but there's a room outside of the hidden door to Smith Rondo's area that contains one of the placeholders, there's another in a room midway north to south on the western side, a third I've been told looks like a set of stables on the east side (camped that one for three hours with no pop), and I don't know the fourth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The 4th is in the Theatre looking area north of Votal's spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have no independent confirmation of this, but our guild has been operating under the information that getting any of the 4 &quot;broken weapon piece&quot; droppers to spawn requires that 100 mobs be killed in their &quot;section&quot; of the zone. I've farmed all of the parts several times now with single groups in preparation for a Smith run, and it seems to hold true--we fight to their spawn site, and then just start clearing up and down the hallways. We also keep their rooms clear, which of course means if anything in there is a PH, we are killing it. But it always takes roughly 100 mobs before the named spawn.<br />
<br />
I don't know where they got this info, but I've seen it appear to work.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nope.  100 spawns isnt it.  I'm going with 100% completely random but I might be wrong :)<br />
<br />
We have worked our way through a room killing the named only to turn around and work back because he popped again.  So that is twice in a row.  Just last thursday we killed 1 of the named and the other 3 just popped also.  I'm going with 100% random :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I had one once pop on my group (the one closest to the Qinimi zone) while were killing mobs in the area. It could have been that it just coincidentally spawned at that momment while we were there, but I'm led to believe it's possible that killing any mob in the general area can trigger it to spawn.<br />
<br />
I use Assidious Vision to scout the zone all the time for named (You can view the entire zone with line of sight, little tricky in some spots, but possible ;)) When the GoD first went live it was very common to find 3-4 of the Pixxt guys up at a time. Since the zone was new and people were exploring it much more frequently I think the reason may be because mobs were routinely being killed in there.<br />
<br />
But now I rarely find any up when I go and I'm very often the only one in the zone when I go there.<br />
<br />
I've looked up for any info on these guys spawns as I could. Talked to a few friends and there quite a bit of a mystery. though then again Gorgos may be right and perhaps they're nothing more than random spawns.</div></div><hr />

We got a Yiktu stone in refubi off a random named when we were farming rondo parts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">We've also had Yiktu drop off Ferubi named while clearing for Smith.  Don't think it was an Elite Pixxt, but one of the random ones.</div></div><hr />
