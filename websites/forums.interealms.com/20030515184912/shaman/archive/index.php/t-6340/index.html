<br />
Earring of Twisted Leaves and a Crystal Spider Eyes (face), with luck you may be able to pick both up for that price tho the pair may end up closer to 1.8-2k.</div></div><hr />

The Coldain Military Wristguard would be an excellent upgrade. It's very easy to get especially with the aid of a friend or second account (for the zek troll). There is an excellent Coldain Military Wristguard (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4007) guide in the quests forum.<br />
<br />
The post by Nytmare on the second page is spot on.<br />
<br />
I'm going to help a friend get his tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Epic shield would also be a nice upgrade</div></div><hr />

Depends on a few things, but my advice:<br />
Go with what Glori said, OR a Sarnak Battle Shield to replace your current shield. Pay less than 1kpp for this or don't buy it.  The AC + hp improvement would be significant for you.<br />
<br />
Look for the most bang for the buck with what you are already wearing when it comes to upgrades when money is tight.<br />
<br />
The new rings would add 12 raw ac and130hp at a loss of 12wisdom (no big loss really).  Heck, even PLATINUM fire opal rings would be much better (5ac 55hp, much cheaper than velium to buy).<br />
<br />
You really should have a better ac headpiece.  Keep the othmir fur one for tradeskills if you need wis gear (and your wis rings), but otherwise sell it asap &amp; replace it with something with more hp/ac.  I'm not up on lizard wearable headgear.  Use the search feature in the bazaar &amp; check often on prices for at least a week before making a purchase.  Use your guild and higher level friends for trustworthy pc's.<br />
<br />
Goranga Idol would be a better range item, &amp; you should be able to pick that up relatively cheap or hunt one on your own with some friends.<br />
<br />
I'd see about trying to get an even trade on the acrylia studded cloak for an arctic wyvern one.  You get more ac at a minor loss of wisdom, but you gain decent stamina (more hp) too.<br />
<br />
I'm not up on lizard equipment, so sorry I couldn't be of more help.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
