<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grill0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As I have stated in my previous post, I am a newbie Shaman - so this may, once again, seem like a stupid question, but here goes:<br />
<br />
I just hit 24 last night and have been reading up the dance. Why do you sit between casting Cannibalize?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kaloog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So you pick up a tic of seated regen, as oopposed to standing regen rate. Over time it adds up. I used cani-dance for a looong time!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you are sitting at the current tick, and the previous tick, it counts you as medding.  So if you happened to stand up and cast canni in between the tick checks, you are medding while casting canni... <br />
<br />
You can also attempt to move, but it's very slow as you can only move like 3 steps a tick as insurance you are sitting for all tick checks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">put your mouse over the mana bar so you see the % as it tics up, after it tics you stand, cast canni then sit until the next tic. this way you gain full mana from meditation AND cani.<br />
<br />
the macro is as follows.<br />
line1 /stand<br />
line2 /cast # whatever spell gem cani is<br />
line3 /cast # same as line 2, several lines of casting the same spell helps with fizzles<br />
line4 /pause 45, /cast #<br />
line5 /sit<br />
<br />
now you leave the mouse over the mana bar, when you see it tic hit your hotkey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Standing mana regen is extremely slow--something like 1 mana per tic (six seconds) absent some kind of mana regeneration buff or flowing thought items (which you probably don't have at your level).<br />
<br />
Previously, until level 34, players had to 'meditate' with their spell book open and blocking all view to recover mana faster.  Now, sitting does exactly the same thing as 'medding' or meditating.  I forget the mana regeneration formula, but it's a bit under half of your meditate skill.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the game reads stuff ever six seconds, or a tic.  I think that's due to the packet size of information sent between your computer and SoE--but I'm digressing already!  If you are sitting at the time the current tic ends, the game gives you your seated mana regen amount.  Then you have six seconds to do whatever you like--stand up, run around, cast canna, etc.  As long as you are sitting before that six seconds is actually up, the game thinks you are still sitting and gives you another full tic of seated mana regen.<br />
<br />
As someone above noted, the net effect is to be able to gain the mana regen from your meditation, and the mana regen for your cannibalization all at the same time.  This increases your overall rate of mana regeneration and reduces downtime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, watch for the 6-second update on you mana bar when you sit and med. Right when you see the update, you stand, canni and sit quickly. Then after 6 secons you repeat the process.<br />
<br />
The pay-off is that you cannibalize once every 6-seconds and add that mana to what you get for medding, since you sit during each tick, the game believes you have been sitting all the time and thus you gain a full med-bouns on top of canni bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">one added benifit for the low lvl shaman is you also gain the full sitting hp regen as well, us 65's forget what Cani is like pre torpor (well Stoicism nowadays). with out a heal that has a hp/mana ratio of better than double you are relying on regen as your sole means to counter the effects of Cani.</div></div><hr />
