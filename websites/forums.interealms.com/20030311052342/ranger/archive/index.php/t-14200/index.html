<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cryithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ummm, maybe go on a Hate Raid and get your own?<br />
<br />
I know its just easier to buy and MQ one. But from the time on your posts you could have attended several Hate raids. Yeah you might get pissy at my post but you will be more thrilled and excited by achieving the stone on a raid.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kysran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">For your information Cry<br />
<br />
I have done a butt load of Hate raids, AND are still doing raids.<br />
<br />
Not getting pissy, but sometimes folks do burn the candle at both sides ya know</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cryithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well hang in there then. I have to say I got very luck on the PoA drop. But did attend about 20 Hate raids and saw many stones drop but my number never came up. And given that Hate raids take anywhere from 4-8 hours it can get very frustrating. But then there was that day when there were just two Rangers on the Hate raid and TWO stones dropped. Both of us were very happy.<br />
<br />
So I wish you well in your attemps. Be encouraged a Stone is out there with your name on it.</div></div><hr />
