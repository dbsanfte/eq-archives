<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone seen the lord of the rings movie? I just watched it and I thought it was awesome. What do you guys think? :D <br />
<br />
My favorite was Aragorn and Gandalf btw ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At first I thought you were talking about some incredible super preview of the next one. :p<br />
<br />
I really liked it.  I'm actually quite glad that I was never able to get into the LotR books when I was younger (tried each of the 4 times after re-reading The Hobbit), because, as usual, the movie was superb, but the book was far more engrossing.  Just finished the first book (waiting to watch the 2nd movie before going on again), and I'm even more impressed with how well the movie was done and edited.  Incredible directing.<br />
<br />
Legolas was my favorite in the movie...walking on snow just can't be beat. :p  Aragorn my char of choice from the novel.</div></div><hr />

Ok who besides the entire movie theatre jumped when Bilbo &quot;asked for the ring&quot;<br />
<br />
DAMN!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Lol, I get jumped pretty easily but that didn't really surprise me when he did that :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Borgax, I totally agree with you...I thought they stayed pretty true to the book. I mean at least from my imaginations perspective. I have one thing Ive been speculating on though and if you haven't read the book and dont want to know what happens...QUIT READING NOW...once the ring is destroyed...will they put the hobbits returning to the shire in the last scene? I hope they do, but the destruction of the ring is sure to be such an incredibly exciting scene, they may just leave it for the finale...When Sauron realizes whats about to happen is my favorite moment of the entire series. Its for sure the a rewarding climax to their adventure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">amazing film, great cast etc :D. Much Better than that pants so called flim &quot;harry potter and the philosphors stone&quot; ir saucerers stone in america.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm sure they will Evel as more happens after that bit. Which I wont explain because I don't want to spoil it for anyone who has not read the books.<br />
<br />
I'm annoyed that they are not realeasing the better version with the extra half hour, until the 4th of November. I'm sure it's just a ploy by the film company to get people to buy both versions.</div></div><hr />

I saw it twice.  The second time was much better, since I didn't have such high expectations of the movie.<br />
<br />
My biggest complaint:<br />
<br />
1) Boromir got the shaft.  In the book, he's much more a 'good guy', which makes his fall to the ring much more powerful, and his death scene more meaningful.  In the movie he was like one of those red-shirt guys on StarTrek.  Sure, they may have had a few lines but you knew he was gonna die by the end.    <br />
When he fought the orcs at the end, it should have been his moment to shine, to show that even though he succumbed to the ring he was still a valiant, noble man.  Instead, it was almost as if the director said 'Ok, lets hurry up and kill Boromir so we can show more of Aragorn and Legolas kicking ass'.  What a waste.<br />
<br />
There were a few more little things that I didn't care for, but once I stopped trying to 'force' the book onto the movie, it was much more enjoyable.   And I did enjoy it, quite a bit, in fact.<br />
<br />
I'll be getting all 3 on DVD, thats for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I bought the DVD yesterday!  Last night I watched the special preview for the boxed DVD set that will be released in Nov of this year.  Peter Jackson (the director) talks happily about getting to do a &quot;Director's Cut&quot; of the FotR.  The preview shows bits of scenes that will be included in the special edition (Galadriel's gifts is the one that really stood out).<br />
<br />
There's also a 10 minute preview of The Two Towers!  It's very cool, and really makes you wish December were already here just so you can go see it!<br />
<br />
Wal-Mart had them on sale for under $16!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Canabull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">For me, Dec. 13th marks the end of finals week...  So I have a BRIGHT light at the end of my tunnel.<br />
<br />
As for the first movie, well, after 2 and a half hours, when it ended, the entire packed theater /sigh'd that it was over.<br />
<br />
Sounded like someone missed a field goal that would have won the Super Bowl and the only fans in the stands were rooting for the kicking team...<br />
<br />
Love it, absolutely love it.</div></div><hr />
