<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">first thing first.<br />
press alt+m in game, and open your menu window. place this window near your hotkeybank and or spell bank. trust me you will never close this window again. now click the socials tab on it. you are on page 1 and it contains 12 premade socials that are 100% garbage. you will be writing over these because its much easier than changing pages in the menu all the time since you have to use the mouse to change pages here.<br />
<br />
now place some macros here that you want but never have room for on your hotkey bank. I will give some examples from my shaman and rogue but all can be adapted to any class.<br />
<br />
Note x is a number that you put here to create the apporpriate pause, a pause of 10 is approxamatly 1 second, you will have to play with your macros to work out the correct pauses to place.<br />
# is the number of the ability you wish to place on this line for more info on this just read on, I explain how to find these #'s just before I list all the different aa #'s<br />
<br />
my shamans favorite macro<br />
Line1 pause (x), /cast 2  (2 is the spell gem with canabilise)<br />
repeat for the first 4 lines<br />
line5 /cast 2   no pause on the last line as the pause takes place AFTER the comand even though you put if before. i.e. line 1 will cast cani THEN pause for x before moving to line2<br />
<br />
now with one click I can cast cani 5 times and as a shaman thats a godsend. now I hear you saying &quot;But Diab you cant do that, what if you get an add or need to heal or something? you are stuck until the macro runs its course&quot; wrong.<br />
<br />
STOPPING MACROS THAT ARE IN PROGRESS !!!!!<br />
yes its possible, I do it all the time.<br />
so my wonderful canix5 macro is doing its thing when I spot an add wander up and start pounding on the warrior from behind. what to do? <br />
one of the macros you have made in your SOCIALS part of the MENU window is going to be called &quot;Clear&quot; and it will consist of a single comand, I use the /ti comand.<br />
click this macro to interrupt any macro in progress.<br />
it MUST be a macro in the socials menu, not one on your hotkey bank.<br />
it MUST be one with a comand you place there, if you leave the macros on page one blank they revert to the premade comands, thus the renaming and single line that tells me the time.<br />
<br />
wow can you say freedom? I sure can.<br />
my Malos macro looks a bit like this.<br />
line1-2 /cast # (malos)<br />
line3 /pause (x) (where x is approx cast time of malos), /cast # malos<br />
line4 /g %t is malos'd<br />
line5 /rs I put teh Malos on you %t (this line doesnt work when you are not in a raid but works fine when you are, so its a nice Duel purpose key)<br />
you can do this with unresistable spells because they always land unless there are outside factors. and you put several lines of the same /cast instruction to be sure and get the spell off inspite of fizzles.<br />
<br />
I have a macro for my pet burn aa that looks a bit like this<br />
Line1 /pause (x), /alt activate (#) <br />
Line2 /em Cries HAVOC and unleashes the Dogs of Zerg<br />
Line3 /rs I pity da FOO that makes me unleash the Dogs of Zerg on his Ass!<br />
the pause in line 1 is about the cast time of pet burn so the emote and the first dog appear at about the same time<br />
<br />
for my rogue one of my favorites is <br />
Line1 /do (#) Backstab<br />
Line2 /attack<br />
Line3 /do (#) disarm<br />
Line4 /do (#) Pick pockets<br />
<br />
<br />
this one key does the work of 4 separate buttons,  granted that the things on it are all on different timers but you can spam the key if you want or make any changes you need to.<br />
<br />
one of my (now partly defunct) macros that all my toons had was tying then 10th hotkey to my left turn arrow as well as its keyboard key. so every time I turn left I <br />
Line1 /do (#) sense headding (yay no more of this retarded crap)<br />
Line2 /loc (good to have for newer players or for peeps who just get lost and die)<br />
Line3 /do (#) sense traps (rogue)<br />
Line4 /do (#) disarm traps (more rogue)<br />
Line5 this one varies alot from toon to toon and even on the same toon. I have had forage here, Instil doubt (haha yeah til you kick the banker) and often its blank. This KEY RULES because it works the skills without ANY effort from you at all.<br />
<br />
for forageing classes who like to beg food and drink from players cause you are sick to hitting the key and putting stuff away theres this beauty<br />
Line1 /do (#) forage<br />
Line2 /autoinventory<br />
merry xmas, foraged items now appear when you turn left. hang on your courser for .5 seconds then POOF they are dropped into your bags. and you are working your forage skill without any effort at all.<br />
<br />
for the truly new player here are some really important macros<br />
<br />
the basic assist macro<br />
line1 /assist<br />
with the puller or main tank targeted you press this key, your target will switch to the monster that THEY have targeted, very very useful when there are more than one mob and critical when there are several with the same name, this macro is possibly the most important one in the game.<br />
advanced assist macro<br />
line1/pause 5, /target (name of MT or puller here)<br />
line2 /assist<br />
this key can be used without targeting the mt or puller before you press it, as long as they are fairly close to you you will target the named person, pause a second to make sure you have them targeted and then assist them and you now have the mob they are targeting as your target.<br />
<br />
the really complex rogue assist key<br />
target the puller/mt<br />
line1 /pause 5, /g I got yer back %t...<br />
line2 /pause 5, /assist<br />
line3 /g er make that %t's back<br />
line4 /attack<br />
Note the /attack comand turns on your auto attack. it isnt needed if you have your attack on assist option turned on but personally I much prefered to turn it off so my auto attack comand was under my control. <br />
<br />
message macros<br />
line1 /g %t is slowed <br />
this will tell the group that your target (%t) is slowed and will return the Name of your target, so if you are slowing the priest of dischord and you press this key your group will see <br />
Diabalein tells the group'Priest of Dischord is slowed'<br />
%r returns race<br />
%s returns sex<br />
there are alot use /help in game to take a look at them all.<br />
<br />
the basic Incoming message<br />
when you are the &quot;puller&quot; its your job to go out and bring monsters back the the group to kill, an &quot;inc&quot; message is important<br />
the basic inc message<br />
line1 /g Inc %t<br />
this tells the group the name of the mob you have targeted and that you are pulling it to them.<br />
<br />
the more advanced inc macro<br />
line1 /g Inc one per message %t is my target<br />
with this key you can then click it multiple times to let the group know if you have more than one mob coming.<br />
<br />
now some handy comands you should know. for skills that you can use they are numbered from 1-6, things like bind wounds, forage, track, hide, sneak. for COMBAT abilities, and this is very important, Combat abilities are numbered 7-10. its been awile since I made a macro for combat abilities but I remember how confusing this was to new players because it was very poorly marked.<br />
disciplines are activated useing the /disc (name of disc here) comand<br />
i.e. /disc Fearless will fire off your fearless disclipline<br />
aa's are activated with the <br />
/alt activate (#) comand <br />
here is a list of aa's and the #'s that go with them, it doesnt include the noew GoD aa's<br />
Usage: /alt activate # <br />

are you a small race/class without slam? grab an illusion potion of barbarian/troll/ogre and make yourself all huge, now make an attack hotkey, right click it and whats this? slam is one of your abilities? SWEET!   you will have to remake the macro every time you camp out but its a nice little addition.<br />
<br />
multi line macros for comunicating<br />
these dont work well, for instance you cant make a 5 line macro for auctions, you will see all 5 lines but everyone else only sees the first line.<br />
my malos macro for raids is the best I can think of, it has 3 casts of malos, one /g to tell the group I malos'd the mob and one /rs to tell the raid I malosd the mob. <br />
the /g comand seems to be the only one you can use to create 5 line macros. well that and when you are in a channel you can also make 5 line macros for that channel. so while you cant make a 5 line auction key you can make a 5 line key for your servers trade channel.<br />
<br />
one more little macro thats handy<br />
line1 /shout CHUGGA CHUGGA WOO WOO!!!! theres a TRAIN headed for the zone<br />
line2 /g Get your ass to the zone line NOW and dont stop and look at the pretty train when you get there.<br />
line3 OMG ZONE OUT NOW FOO!<br />
its hard to miss the sudden wall of spam and since your train macro is there for those times you really need to zone out fast this is a nice key to have.<br />
<br />
its late, I cant think of anything I missed, save this you your harddrive and sticky this thing where it belongs so when the server crashes the info isn't lost.<br />
<br />
enjoy :)<br />
<br />
ok I lied, I did think of one more thing<br />
<br />
<br />
the hokey pokey<br />
<br />
line1 /pause 25, /blush SAY puts (his/her) left foot in<br />
line2 /pause 25, /blush SAY puts (his/her) left foot out<br />
line3 /pause 25, /blush SAY puts (his/her) left foot in<br />
line4 /pause 20, /shiver SAY Shakes it all about<br />
line5 /say Cause thats what its all About!<br />
<br />
make the macro exactly like you see it, change camera veiw so you can see yourself and give it a try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nice info, but all of this was already put up in the Medicine Cabinet.<br />
Your final dance macro is pretty cool though. :D<br />
<br />
my malos macro for raids is the best I can think of, it has 3 casts of malos, one /g to tell the group I malos'd the mob and one /rs to tell the raid I malosd the mob.<br />
We call all our debuffs and slows for each class in their own respective channels and only call them in /rsay for the named.  When you have those nights where 4+ shaman are present and each is spamming &quot;blah blah has been slowed&quot; regardless of whether or not someone else already did it, the spam is too intense.  If a shaman is doing their job, they shouldn't have to call slows to the rest of the raid on trash, only to other shamans.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">wow.  You get the board award for post height.  Just cause I was curious, I printed that post out.  I was just shy of 6.5 feet.<br />

Other than that I have nothing to add to this discussion, just that it was long.</div></div><hr />

Spouse and I died in Droga (how embarassing) last night while fighting on a walkway (pets pushed mob off bridge &amp; so we trained ourselves).  There was a cleric at the Raster camp thankfully who was willing to rez if we dragged to her.  Thinking this would be much easier than bringing in a guild cleric, moving her to Droga, &amp; all the account shuffling, I went to drag both bodies (I had bound outside) at once.<br />
<br />
My doublebody drag hotkey didn't seem to work right all the time.  Sometimes it would, sometimes it wouldn't.  Frequently I'd only get one body dragged and not the other.  It was very frustrating.<br />
<br />
My hotkey was:<br />
/target Soandso's corpse<br />
/corpse<br />
/target Frekkels's corpse<br />
/corpse<br />
<br />
I tried inserting a pause in line 3, but it didn't seem to help.  Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Reysa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I found that /target needs some time to work. How much of a pause did you use? You might try:<br />
<br />
/pause 6, /target X<br />
<br />
for both /target lines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok, I have heard you don't need the target line, but rather you can just put the name after corpse.  Not 1000% sure on this as I haven't used it (thought I have made it) but give it a try and see if it helps<br />
<br />
/pause 2 /corpse rookz<br />
/pause 2 /corpse someotherdeadschmo<br />
/pause 2 /corpse deadschmo_003<br />
/pause 2 /corpse deadschmo_004<br />
/corpse deadschmo_5<br />
<br />
If this does in fact work, you can drag 5 corpses in one hotkey.  My guildleader told me this one, and indeed I have seen her training full boatloads of corpses to zone after a raid wipe.  you could make like 10 of these buttons and drag the whole raid, though you have to move REALLY slowly.  just moving 5 bodies apparently requires you to go a little slower than normal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You can drag by name, instead of doing /target &amp; /corpse.<br />
<br />
However, /corpse takes a sec, so you have to hop - run up, hit the hotkey, don't move for a second or three, then repeat.  It's pretty easy to tell if you miss one, because you get the &quot;corpse out of range&quot; message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">alot of people experience problems with the target comand because it often takes time to work, this the Very slight pause to give it the time to aquire your new target. <br />
<br />
I posted this on 2 boards, didnt think to check the medicine cabnet, do they actually have breaking a macro in progress there? I will have to look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I don't recall ever seeing how to interrupt a macro.  Anywhere.  It's good to know it can be done, and how.</div></div><hr />
