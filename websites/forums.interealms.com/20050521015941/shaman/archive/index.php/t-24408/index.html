<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Worlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings fellow shamans,<br />
<br />
I quit playing back in early '04 for a multitude of reasons.  I know find myself with more free time than I'm used to, and was thinking about getting back into the game.  What I'm trying to decide, however, is whether or not I want to play my 65 shaman, or switch to a different server and start fresh with a new shaman.<br />
<br />
I would like to try it again from the start, correcting all the mistakes I made 2 years ago when I did the early levels, but I also know it would take a lot of time to get back to where I was when I quit.<br />
<br />
So, what I'm asking, is it worth it to jump right back in to level 65+ stuff or would it be rewarding to go back from the beginning?<br />
<br />
Any input would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would keep your current shaman. Spend a week farming, upgrade your gear a bit, and then hang out and exp in all the new OoW zones. Nice loot, nice exp, and something new to do. If you do want to restart though, I would pick a different class. There are less lower level people arround these days, which means less groups, so spending a ton of time leveling up the same thing doesn't sound like all that much fun.<br />
<br />
Personally, I have been having alot of fun in OoW... getting 70 is not the most pleasant grind, but the new content is good and groups are happy to pick up a slower in all of the OoW zones I have been to.</div></div><hr />
