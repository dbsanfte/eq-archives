<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How do you know if a zone has an experience bonus in it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sepisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Very carefully.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kervin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Bonus Table (http://eq.jeuxonline.info/guides/experience/bonus.html)<br />
<br />
Here is a table, not sure if it missing other/newer zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">All zones have an experience modifier.  They are not posted anywhere.  The closest we have is a patch message from over a year ago which talked about the percent increases for certain under-utilized zones (*EDIT* The post above this one is a french translation of that patch message).<br />
<br />
Generally speaking, dungeons have a higher modifier than outdoor zones, due to the higher risk.  If you are fighting underwater you typically get more experience.  If the risk is high, you usually get better rewards.  Some zones have good loot, some have good exp, some balance it out, some just suck.  And your experience rate in some zones may not match another class's experience, because they may not match up against the mobs the same as you.  =)<br />
<br />
How's that for a non-answer?  Go out and try a few places, you'll find your own favorites soon enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There's that list and EQAtlas has the modifiers listed as well.<br />
<br />
Remeber that all under level 30 dungeons got an even bigger bonus when they removed hell levels and added all of that other stuff to make people level faster. At least, I think that's what one of those huge patch messages said :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not all zones in EQ Atlas have the ZEM listed, only the few that VI confirmed.  VI never said which mobs got their ZEM increased, what exactly is a &quot;under 30&quot; dungeon?   Split Paw?   Runnyeye?  Befallen?  Mistmoore?  If there's a couple mobs up to 35 or so is it &quot;under 30&quot;?<br />
<br />
Heh, imagine if Permafrost got a ZEM increase :)<br />
<br />
Taladaen (btw - ZEM = Zone Experience Modifier)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grromp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The zones where I have seen the biggest difference with ZEMs, and where I can solo as a shaman, are...<br />
<br />
City of Mist<br />
Chardok<br />
Hole<br />
<br />
And to a lesser degree...<br />
<br />
Paw (You should probably be duoing while this is still dark blue)<br />
Kedge Keep<br />
<br />
You will level significantly faster if you are alone in any of the above zones. (Especially CoM since we can ues ponies there)  Kedge Keep takes a lot of mana and an EB Item to do well, so I'd only recommend it for the bravest or craziest souls.<br />
<br />
Grromp &lt;Clan of Unity&gt; <br />
57 Troll Shaman, Karana</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Permafrost does have a ZEM.  The Perma pits are a great place to hunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tawnay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yall forgot Howling Stones (need the Charasis key to get in).  I flew threw 56 to almost half way through 59 in about a month and a half in HS.  If you like to dungeon crawl, then this is the place for ya.  The loot isn't that great but, the named in each wing can drop some pretty nice stuff.<br />
<br />
I finished off 59 in Chardok.<br />
<br />
The key for HS is super easy to get and well worth the time it takes to get it.  That zone rocks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">so paludal caverns doesn't have any sort of xp bonus??? this can't be!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">ZEM - Zone Experience Modifier<br />
<br />
Every zone has a ZEM. The ZEM is a multiplier that adjust the amount of XP that a mob gives for that zone. <br />
<br />
In general, dungeon zone have a higher ZEM than outdoor zones. Underwater zones have a higher ZEM. The ZEM is supposed to account for the difficulty of the zone so that more XP is given in more difficult zones. I have no doubt that CT has probably one of the top ZEMs in the game. That's why a group of high-levels can kill a relatively low number of MOBs and still rack in a ton of XP. Without a ZEM, all mobs of a given level would return the exact same amount of XP.<br />
<br />
When they announced that certain zones were being given a bonus of such and such percent, this meant that they increased the ZEM by that percentage. Example:<br />
<br />
Permafrost old ZEM : 0.60 (I'm making up this value)<br />
Permafrost bonus : 25% (I'm making up this value)<br />
Permafrost new ZEM : 0.60 * 1.25 = 0.75<br />
<br />
So the percent bonuses that were listed are generally useless in knowing the ZEM for those zones, because we don't know the old ZEMs for those zones.<br />
<br />
The only way to find out the ZEM for a zone is to either be a developer who has access to the ZEM tables or to use ShowEQ to kill MOBs of varying levels and noting the XP given while creating a huge table, then corrolating the data to calculate ZEMs for all zones, using a single zone as the baseline (1.0 ZEM) zone :)<br />
<br />
That's what I know...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I sold a HS key last night for 2k.<br />
Wasn't hard . . i might do it again.  Sold easily too.  <br />
<br />
Specially now that I'm strapped for cash to complete this damn POTC earring quest.  Needum more hps and FT!  The resists too!  Wis even!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Kedge used to have the highest ZEM. (As per VI employees - not the best source I know).<br />
<br />
PL'ed my 40 Ranger to 45 there in a few hours using a Cleric.  <br />
<br />
When you see your exp bar move after a kill in 44 you know there's a hefty ZEM.<br />
<br />
EB devices aren't that hard to come by. Sheit cast EB. I know Shaman can channel better than a Elven Ranger. :)=</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Echo Caverns also has a nice ZEM I'm sure.  I levelled there from 45-50 soloing and every kill netteda move in the xp bar.  1 yellow an hour not bad I think for soloing.  Getting to 50 from 49 took just a tad longer as mobs (underbulk side) started to aqua quite a bit at 49.  Planning on taking my chanter there to PL once I get around high-30's.  C3 addict here and 100pp a shot tends to wear on you, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Urgh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I was amazed by the xp in Kedge...<br />
<br />
I needed the lancer swordfish fin for my totemic bp, and at lvl 38 I was getting half a blue or more per kill... easy kills too, they don't even run.<br />
<br />
If you get adds, root one by the entrance, zone out, zone back in.... hey presto...<br />
