<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wampaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I need to find out the low down on Skyshrine quest armor. Im wearing all JB and Rune Etced atm. There is a guild friendly to ours who have several pieces of SS armor they are selling to be mq. I was wondering how to find out if your COV faction is ally. Ive never been to Skyshrine or TOV. I have printed out the list of velious armor and what gems are needed, but I need to find out more about the quest and such. I was also wondering if plate armor like my JB and RE is better ac than chain armor like our quest armor. Someone told me plate armor is better ac than chain even if its the same AC. Any info would be helpful.<br />

Only because plate is dead sexy.  Other than the look, there is no affect.  15 AC is still 15 AC.  +3 Cha is still +3 Cha.</div></div><hr />

Con any cov mob, there is one in wl named rolondal or something like that.  Also pretty much any mob in skyshrine (espically the *cough* questgiver mob)<br />

Ac is Ac, skyshrine quest will have more ac than re or jb</div></div><hr />
