<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Quinner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Having recently placed my shaman on Quellious into semi-retirement, I've taken up residence on Stromm. It is a fascinating place with no real uber-twinks running around. Banded is being sold in the bazaar and forging weapons is a viable trade.<br />
<br />
On the server, there is a certain guild that is racing to the top with all possible speed. It is quiet possible that by the end of the summer, all of their members will be 65. They will most likely be the first guild on the server to make it into the Plane of Time.<br />
<br />
It made me start thinking about the way people play the game. What is their motivation? Is it to reach the top and have all of the right numbers pop up on their screen? How much of the game will they miss in their race to the top? Their webpage states that the guild will not be helping members with their epics since the majority of them are outdated. Is that the only reason to pursue the epic? Because it adds certain numbers?<br />
<br />
SOE has stated that they will be adding new content to EQ. New dungeons are the focus of the next expansion. I have to wonder, however, how many players will experience the wonders of them? What will become of those zones that don't offer the most efficient experience or &quot;phat l3wt?&quot; <br />
<br />
I'm having fun experimenting with some new classes on Stromm (One of which certain Shamans would disapprove) and have decided to make it a personal goal to visit every unkeyed/unflagged zone in the game before hitting level 60. Not just to pop in and pop out but to explore and hunt.  <br />
<br />
All the discussion makes me reflect on my Paper &amp; Pencil RPG experiences. Sure we went through a phase when we had to have the super high-level characters but the most fun came when we got over that and just enjoyed playing our characters at all levels. (Levels 5 - 9 seemed to be the most fun for all classes in AD&amp;D.) Can this same thing be true in EQ? Should I be worried about how fast I level or shoudl I just enjoy playing the game?<br />
<br />
So I have to ask the rest of my Shaman Brethren - What type of player are you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Casual. I want the good stuff and I get annoyed when we hunt where no loot or money drops, but not to the point where I would leave me friends to get more.  I do like seeing my numbers increase though, I have to admitt that!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>herkybevo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I personally like to hunt with friends.  The experience I get along the way is just a bonus. I am barely lvl 62 with about 200 days played.  So, I guess that would make me a casual gamer.  Although, I avgerage about 30+ hrs a week on EQ.</div></div><hr />

Ebaying probably.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you asking us to define &quot;fun&quot; for you?  Are you asking us to give you a ruler so you can see if you &quot;beat the game?&quot;  I tend to be a goal-oriented player.  As I approach that goal, another one or six goals occur to me and I decide where to go next.  But that doesn't mean that MY way is better than YOUR way.  If you want to play levels 1 - 10 (the honeymoon period), go for it.  You'll never kill a dragon or see a planar zone, but if you enjoy chars at that leve, who's to say this is wrong?  I have a buddy who loves to Tradeskill.  I hate it.  Does that make it wrong?  I don't think so!<br />
<br />
It's your time, it's your experience.  Do what YOU enjoy, and screw the rest of us   ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Side note, I'm almost 52, but Shan was born in early July, so that should give you some idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm just as goal based as anyone else, but my goals are all over the place.  I do get that thrill from a Ding! (new spells!!) or AA point or sweet new piece of gear as much as anyone else.  But I also love raising my tradeskills, maxxing factions, completing quests (however little I need the rewards), exploring a new zone, making something I've never before made, etc.<br />
<br />
So all of that, plus RL commitments, means I'm not uber by high level standards.  After almost four years of play on the same character I'm 61 with 7 AAs.  But I sometimes went weeks or even months between levels while I was doing things that that gave little or no exp.  I am seeing some upper level raid content, though.  Not Vex Thal, but ToV and tier 2 and some of the easier dragons.  And my guild is going strong, slow but steady, close to taking on harder dragons and tier 3 and VP, etc.  From talking to my friends in uber guilds, I know I enjoy my guild's easygoing raids more than they usually enjoy their zillionth attempt at Rallos, so I don't regret my situation.<br />
<br />
So my advice always is to just do what's fun.  For some people, exp grinding and power raiding are truly fun, and that's great.  But if you're not in the mood for that, try other things until you find something fun.  You're playing the game for your own enjoyment, so it's pointless to force yourself to the exp grind if that's not keeping your interest. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Frankly, these people probably are racing for the top because when they get there, there will be little to no competition. It's a chance to raid without dealing with 5 other guilds competing for the spawns you want. It's a chance to actually learn encounters without the worry of failing and coming back to summon corpses, only to find your competition standing there with the mob you just tried dead at their feet.<br />
<br />
I don't like the low end game. Endless medding (not for us, but nonetheless), endless killing of the same thing over and over, endless buff requests on a shorter time period than higher end buffs, etc. That's not fun to me. Roleplaying isn't fun to me. Mediocrity isn't fun to me.<br />
<br />
I find my own fun in teamwork. In taking 30-40 people, combining our efforts, working as a team, and killing the unkillable. In standing over the corpse for our guild screenshot. I find that extremely fun. Looting a new upgrade is not exactly a drag either ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&lt; -- lazy.  I play for fun.  More a grouping shaman than a soloing one (I find soloing boring, though very rewarding xp and cash).  I ain't racing nowheres.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zyphun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I agree with FinalJustice, everyone plays differently and if people don't conform to the way you think the game is played then ignore them. If you're wondering what you're missing then give their style a try, the way someone plays isn't for everyone. I don't mean this as an attack on anyone's views. I just get tired of hearing the people that enjoy the lower level of the game frowning on the high (uber) people and telling the high level people just how they are missing out and ruining the game for everyone else. On the other hand I am tired of attitude that people that raise to uber status can get against people of lower level. The wonder of Everquest is that it allows everyone to play their own game, Sony has done a incredible job making to the game is playable and enjoyable and just as addicting now matter how you play. They got stuff wrong, but they also got a lot right. <br />

Personally, I've been playing for a LONG time, a long long time. Baring the elemental planes and Time I think I've seen all there is to see in EQ. When Kunark came out I was part of a three person group that was the first to find Kaesora, it's probably one of my greatest memories and I count it as being one of my biggest achievements in the game. I remember going through Dalnir before more people knew it existed, spending days digging up and finding clues to the history and mystery of the zone. Figures the entire zone wide quest would be for a necro dagger we couldn't use, but it didn't matter, we found out what happened to a lost expedition, pieced together the pieces of a really cool story. For me Kunark marked the beginning and end to the Age of Discovery in Everquest. It's sad because really that's what was most fun for me. Now any real exploring (not just scouting and seeing what everything looks like) has to be done in mass and with a guild. Ykesha might have had some of that but personally it's just to small. So now I am just pushing very hard to get to the high end game, the rush of exploring has gone to the rush of reaching goal after goal. My first love in EQ will always be it's old lore, but I am more then happy to settle for pushing those numbers higher and higher. ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Spookem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have to say i love grouping with friends that understand how to work as a team.  If a camp or mob is done easily with a raid next time try with a group then part of a group till ether you find a way of duoing or soloing it.  For me nothing beats the rush of haveing a hard fight single or with multiple adds that you (or your group ) wins and everyone is out of mana and low on life, where the pet keeping agro on the last mob is the all thats keeping you from wipeing.</div></div><hr />
