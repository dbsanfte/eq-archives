<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kervin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Casual player here, rarely get a chance to group because of random play time and duration. I tend to tank the MOB while applying a DoT or 2 depending on con. Once MOB runs I usually finish with DD. This way I keep most of skills up. Usually I'll end up between 20% and 40% Mana. Got Canni-Dance Hotkey set. I try not to Canni past 1 life bubble, being cautious of trains and such.<br />
<br />
If the idea of Canni-dancing is to top of Hps and Mana at the same time, I am not seeing much improvement. I have regen up while dancing. Does the improvement in downtime get better with levels(Does Canni's ratio improve)?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<br />
I usually canni down to 50/60% hp this still leaves me with enough HP if I get jumped. <br />
<br />
The spell gets better as you get older, but I'm not sure on the figures.</div></div><hr />
