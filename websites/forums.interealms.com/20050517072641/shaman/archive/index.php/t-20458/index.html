<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Indalecio Galronte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all,<br />
<br />
     A few nights ago a warrior asked me to chain zing him after blowing all of his endurance on a boss mob fight. I told him that the Extinguish Fatigue line and Acumen line does not help regenerate endurance but he insisted, claiming that it does help him regen endurance.<br />
<br />
So, my question to you all is: Has anyone else tested the zing spells for any beneficial endurance regen effects? Anyone else had a similar experience?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Your warrior hasn't played in awhile.  Stamina bar was changed to endurance.  Extinugish Fatigue and Acumen don't do much if anything for it any longer.  Acumen is good for ultravision and see invis, still, however.  Not a bad crap buff ahead of more important ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shoendesae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You know..... IF extinguish fatigue and all other ZING spells actually acted like breeze, clarity, KEI..and such... wouldn't that make us Melee crack dealers, along with haste and actually give us a purpose at the high end game again and make us groupable?<br />
<br />
<br />
Nah, Sony couldn't let that happen...it'd be too cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would delete any ZING spell before I would stand around on raids chain casting on tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Dont they need to implement a real use for endurance first? Endurance pools are huge, and refresh on death. Its virtually impossible to run out, I ahve tried on my roommate's warrior. They need to hurry up with the melee revamp already, and put in the combat moves. Not that I wanna refresh or heal endurance, just melees need something fun. Oh, and before anyone spazzes that we need healing, or nukes, or whatever, I am more than aware. The two dont necessarily have to be mutually exclusive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Like mana, endurance refreshes upon death, but is sucked dry upon being rezzed.<br />
<br />
Endurance is important, it's what determines how long a warrior can maintain disciplines - some discs use a lot of endurance, so have to be used carefully.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">On a slightly related topic did our Ward ever get changed to endurance regen like it is supposed to be?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">No, the description is being changed (has been changed?) to reflect that it's HP regen, because that's apparently what it's supposed to be. :\<br />
