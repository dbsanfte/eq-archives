<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Youichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have recently reached my mid thirties, and have a couple of questions, which have been puzzling/bugging me, hopefully soneone can help.  (I have tried searching, and couldn't find the answers)<br />
<br />
Firstly, having just got my DogDog, I find myself driven mad by the fact that pressing F1 targets the dog. I have been playing for about 18 months, firstly a Paladin and now a Shaman, and before I cast a Buff on myself I always press F1, to make sure I'm targeted, after this long, it's instinctive, but since I have a pet, the function of F1 has changed, and I keep wasting my mana bufffing my pet.(don't go off topic on petbuffing, I do buff him)  but I keep buffing him with buffs meant for me, and it's driving me loopy.  I've looked in the keyboard options section and it just says F1 target's self, it says nothing about targeting pet !<br />
<br />
So how can I stop F1 from targeting my pet ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Secondly, I have been thinking about getting an Iksar Cerimonial BP, but am confused about how the regen effect works.  Does the regen effect work exactly the same as the spell, i.e. works better when sat down, lesser effect when stood up ?  Does it stack with the cast spell ? When soloing, am I better off wearing my Totemic BP, with extended enhancement 2, as this will make my buffs last longer, will this save me more mana than the not casting regen with the Iksar BP would ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">How about use the tab key to target yourself and F1 to target your pet?  (this really won't be a big deal, eventually you'll break the habit of hitting F1 and just casting a buff before doublechecking that you are targeted, not the pet)<br />
<br />
As far as the iksar regen bp vs. totemic, you could put on the totemic when casting your buffs, and then switch to iksar.</div></div><hr />

Wish I knew - I still cast stuff on my pet at times - pees me off when I do it with torpor or focus.<br />

<br />
<br />
You get 5hp per tick more permanently, no matter what you are doing.  This increase also stacks with absolutely everything, so make sure you still cast your regen spells on you for extra regen.  As for the totemic, this only needs to be worn whilst you cast the buffs in order to get the effect to work, so put it on, cast buffs, swap back out with your regen tunic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">F1 toggles between yourself and your pet.  If you are on a mob, F1 targets you.  hit it again, and it targets your pet.  hit it yet again, and it's back to you.  Just keep mashing F1 until you get who you want.<br />
<br />
Iksar BP works exactly the same as the spell.  It gives you 5pts of regen per tick.  This stacks with everything, more or less.<br />
<br />
So if you are standing up, you get 1 (standing) + 5 (Breastplate) = 6 plus 5 more if you cast Regen on yourself total = 11.<br />
If you are sitting down its 2 (sitting) + 5 (Breastplate) = 7 plus 5 more if you cast Regen on yourself total = 12.<br />
<br />
It's a huge increase at your level.  When soloing, wear your Totemic BP, cast all your buffs, then wear the Iksar BP all the time (and also cast regen on yourself at all times).  <br />
<br />
If you're gonna wear just one, wear the Iksar BP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fudin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The ikky bp works the same wether you are sitting or standing.  I wear mine all the time and have banked my Totemic for good.  If you are concerned about the buff durations then just carry the totemic in a bag with you and put it on when you cast your buffs then put the ikky back on when you are done.   <br />
<br />
I'm not sure how to stop you from targetting yourself other than paying attention to what you are doing.  You'll eventually get used to hitting it twice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">F1 will target yourself the first time you hit it, then will target your pet the next time and keep alternating back &amp; forth.  Just the joy of having a pet, you need to pay attention to what target you have set up.  I suppose you could fiddle with your keymap &amp; try to set up a different key to target pet.<br />
<br />
Ikky BP:   Works much like bard mana songs do for mana in that every tick you get the +hp regenned, standing or sitting you'll get the same bonus.  You get (amount of regen for your race) + (modifier for sitting if any) + (amount from regen item).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zenyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">well just use &quot;TAB&quot; to target yourself...  I use this everytime before buffing, as I like to buff myself first to keep track of the buffing rotation...<br />
<br />
Use F1 to target the pet of course, and then TAB to target yourself if you are more of a keyboard oriented person...  I use the 3rd person view so sometimes I just click on myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I fuond out about tab before i knew about f1, so i seldom buff my pet.<br />
<br />
TAB works great, use it</div></div><hr />
