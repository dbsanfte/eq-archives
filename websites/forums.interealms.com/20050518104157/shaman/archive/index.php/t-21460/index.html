<br />
Has anyone else noticed that mobs hit a lot faster now?  I'm going to go out on a limb and guess like 25% or so.  The net result is that even though they are fully 'slowed' according to the mitigation model, they're hitting at least as fast as the previously mitigating mobs.  Heck, on some fully slowed mobs, I kept having Breath of Trushar interrupted, and I have the AAs to make that a 3 second spell--I can guarantee that didn't used to happen on the same mobs pre-retuning.<br />
<br />
Can anyone parse and confirm, if they have old numbers to compare to?<br />
<br />
One chage I have noticed is that mobs seem to have about double the hp that they used to have.  Killing takes longer, and DoTs actually run.  However, in spite of making stuff take longer, vexd still requires 100 mobs (ie, it REALLY sucks now--takes several hours).<br />
<br />
One other thing--I dunno what the deal is, but all of a sudden (in spite of how badly we still suck in GoD), I'm just having fun again.  I played for about 15 hours this week outside of raids instead of playing City of Heroes.  Maybe burn-out was setting in, but damn, I'm even enjoying GoD.  Totally unnatural, I tell you!  I think Glorianna slipped me a mickey so she could play with my tail . . .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What zones and mobs are you talking about?<br />
<br />
Have they made changes to how much mobs mitigate slow I am not aware of?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Most of GoD really, Giac.  If you want good examples, go try soloing some stuff in Quinimi, Riwwi, and Barindu.  I didn't spend much time tanking in the sewers, kodtaz, yxxta, or vexd this week, though I was in all of them.<br />
<br />
Specifically, I thought there were differences in the ukun, nocs, kyvs, ra'tuks, and whatever the red-colored guys with the mohawks are called.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Most of the mobs in those zones were fully slowable before the patch...<br />
<br />
I have been hunting in ferubi and other than the named NPCs nothing has been mitigating Slow, but trash mobs definitely have a lower DI now. <br />
I never cared to parse so I honestly can't tell you whether they lowered their innate delay to make up for the lower DI.<br />
<br />
The only real change I have noticed, other than the lower DI mentioned, is that the Level 65 nameds in Ferubi seem to have a higher DI actually. So they basically made those harder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This is just going from what it felt like but Kod'taz MOBs seemed to be a lot easier, plus much better slowable plus more HPs - which is pretty much what we asked for. I would still like to a see some MOB variety but this looks like the right direction to me.<br />
<br />
Chutoi - you say we have been fed a placebo. How so? If all you noticed is true, how is that a bad thing for shaman?</div></div><hr />

I think you have just completed the cycle is all. You found something wrong. You complained, you banged your head against the wall tryingt o fix it, then you accepted it and moved on. Ive done that before myself. <br />
<br />
Enjoy it while it lasts brother, somethings dont need analyzing.</div></div><hr />
