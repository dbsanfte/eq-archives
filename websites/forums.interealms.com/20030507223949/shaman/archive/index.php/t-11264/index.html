<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm not familiar with the past 60 set but I can see three areas that you could easily upgrade that wouldn't take all that much<br />
<br />
Shoulders - Elder Wolf Hide - solo campable in a couple of hours at most<br />
<br />
Back - Coterie Generals Cape - buyable in the bazaar for about 100pp has better AC and +40hp or<br />
assuming you're a kitty by the Agnostic deity get a few friends together and finish your Dar Khura Officer's Cloak<br />
<br />
Feet - Polished Tin Mail or Dusty Soriz Boots - both buyable in the bazaar for under 2kpp.  The Black Fur Boots are clickable from inventory so you don't actually have to wear them.<br />
<br />
I'm sure other's in the post 60 set can give you better suggestions though.</div></div><hr />
