<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since they removed mitigation from a lot of the mobs in OoW ive noticed a lot of BSTs LFG but people preffering Chanters or Shaman ?.<br />
As ive been told a couple of times with these mobs Shaman DPS is not to be laughed at and their slow is a lot better plus our utilitly.<br />
Also rangers,wizzes,mages,rogues,monks all seem to be preffered to BSTs for a DPS slot.<br />
True or just that theres so many bsts about ?.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The only Shaman's revenge is the 'end billing' button. Aside from that they finally gave us a little more of old utility back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its good to hear if its true. Anyone else seeing this trend ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>iso2202</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually I must say that since OoW came out I have indeed been getting MUCH more group invites, Yesterday 1 min after i logged on I got 3 different group invites, and I wasnt LFG; Good times for me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">On the contrary, I spent most of the weekend LFG playing SSX3 on my PS2. Saturday was about 6 hours, Sunday was 2 hours (then got an invite, cable went out for 2 hours), then another 4 hours go by and got another. I did manage to make it to peak 2 though ;)<br />
<br />
Spent 2 hours this morning working on school work while LFG before finally getting one.  Those who say it's easier, I beg to differ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, beyond the LFG subjectivity, I notice that even in a fast killing group, bane and blood can either run their full course or very close to it.  Plus, it's easy as pie to slow out there.<br />
<br />
Good times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Exeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Since OoW launched, I haven't needed to go LFG once.  There's only 3 active shaman in my guild and everyone seems to love to have one along no matter what they are doing in OoW zones.  Mobs don't seem to hit overly hard in most of the zones we've been working in (mostly WoS and Dranik's Hollows) and they live long enough for me to drop a DoT on them and see it actually run it's full course.<br />
<br />
At 66, I'm making some mad aaxp and will hopefully have my must have aa abilities done soon.  Overall, I'm happy so far.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Unfortunately, I don't have OoW yet. But when I log on and put up lfg , I get 3 or 4 tells asking to come to OoW. It seems we are wanted again  :-)<br />
It is a welcome feeling :-)<br />
<br />
edit: In beta, I could solo the murkgliders in Nobles causeway. Don't know about the other zones cause I didn't get that far while I was level 64...I helped in an event and got my main beta buffed to 70.<br />
Mobs don't hit as hard and are slowable (even when they mitigated some, they were fairly easy) ...root rot with 3 or 4 dots and at the last , mele with puppy backup :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yup, been getting groups all over on OoW. The want for Shaman on Saryrn is so strong that a group from one of our time geared guilds called me (not even the 1.0 epic or any ornate) in to City of Dranik a few days back.<br />
<br />
And yes, I'm seeing some damage come out of my Shaman. It's been so long since a mob lived all the way through anything I put on it... Brings a tear to my eye.<br />
<br />
Still 100% reliant on the presence of a druid or cleric to have a successful group, though. But at least i'm savely squared away as &quot;slower&quot; now... And hey, so long as i'm being summoned twice a fight, i'm happy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">OoW has been a pretty good expansion thus far for shaman.  We'll see how it is when the keyed zone is unlocked, but I have not had much problems in getting groups.  Problem has been in resists.  Since the last patch, I'm getting resisted much more than before.  Hell, even some greenies in Dranik's Scar are resisting slow on first cast (running around 10-15% of mobs now, never had a resist prior to the patch).  PoE was a pain in the arse last raid due to this resist thing, and it wasn't just my bad RNG going too, rest of the shamans noticed it too (in my guild, those using the non-GoD slow).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Awesome. bout time we got some love. I mean i dont want the BST to not have anything, but the got serious DPS to offer a group. I think we should be able to slow considerably better then them. The chanter will still be our close class for othat role, but thats not a big deal, its always been that way, besides i think chanters a more taken for their CC and KEI then their slow.<br />
<br />
<br />
With all the positive things being said about OoW im almost regreting quiting. Too bad the task system is fubarded, i might be swayed over with that working.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Everytime mitigation is reduced or removed from another monster, a shaman earns their wings.  This is good news and cudos to SoE if it's intentional.  I'm still not regretting quitting by a longshot, but I'm very happy for shaman who still play.  It's the content that broke the class and any step to fix that is a step in the right direction (I still think the shaman class needs some minor tuning up in the buffs, DoTs, DDs and heals though).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Did my first instance yesterday. One of the Dranik's Hollows ones and I was able to be main healer with a Beastie tank. Slow bounced rarely, though when it did it seemed to happen when doubles were pulled. Seemed fun and was able to keep my mana up without much FT stuff and only beastie crack. Didn't manage to find any named but XP wasn't too bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I am having fun in OoW.<br />
<br />
But the killing for spells is driving me nuts.<br />
<br />
Have to get a named for a chance. And that just sucks. Cause Then you have to hope for the right rune. <br />
<br />
So last three days I have been in Dranik's hollows to avoid the cluster blank that is Walls of slaughter.<br />
<br />
But while the xp is okay and the fights are doable. The bar or rat is driving me nuts. Once again they had a decent idea with the instanced non timed zones. But completly dropped the ball and made it a campfest. Only two named spots. 2 rooms apart. (Snore)<br />
<br />
Why couldnt they have had 8 10 different named Spread all over the zone. With the 14 minute repop and a few see invisables around it could have been a fun little wanderfest.<br />
<br />
Though I have heard that Once I get level 68 I will get a harder instance with different named and loot so that is cool. And I admit I have been less than exploratory with the other two instances. But I don't want to kill Dragorn if I can avoid it. Not to mention I am sure the nerfs will come so I want to be one of the lucky ones that actually exploit the hell out of things so I don;t have to spend the next 6 months playing catchup... (And I hate SoE for that. I just don't trust them)<br />
<br />
Been all over the zones though. Still want to try the instances in Ruined city and the other places... Ahh nice to have something to do again.!<br />
<br />
Oh and yeah. the longer fights and missing slow mitagation are helping shaman considerably. Not to mention lack of Lull working so that there are some 2 mob pulls and things. (We don't have a bard in guild so no fading memories and Plus I like 2-3 mobs around me it makes me feel loved...)<br />
<br />
Overall Good Job on Omens SoE. Just hope you can tweak the things that need it and not screw people over while doing so.<br />

Have to disagree on this one, I'm a VT geared shaman, 5.5k mana, FT14 + 5 clicky, 225 AA and no GoD spells, I can main heal WoS to the left of the zone in.  If I had Trushar and Balance, I'd prolly be able to handle elites and the like.</div></div><hr />

But so far my usefullness in OoW has been great. I can slow without a hitch in the Instance zones, I can solo in Dranik's hollow. I'm hoping in another week once I get to level 62-63 I'll be able to land a group or two out in WoS.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that with everyone out in WoS I'm getting PoV group offers left and right. I even got a BoT group offer (even though I am not 62 and Not Flagged for the zone)</div></div><hr />

I am with Kilgaroz here. I can easily be sole healer and slower in a group in WoS. Even pulling nameds. Add a 2nd shaman, or Paladin, and the group is VERY efficient. Lets face it, even though secondary healers arent necessarily &quot;a requirement&quot;, very very few groups don't have some form of back-up healing. <br />
<br />
The other day, I zoned into WoS, an SK was at the ZI LFG. I invited him, and off we went. We killed a couple, then a necro showed up LFG, then a Rogue, then a Mage, and we went to the north wall (Kyv Assasain/Noc bonecleaver area). A druid shouted LFG while we were clearing the PHs and we were off to the races. This is failry typical. <br />
<br />
If there is one thing that really bugs me its the whole &quot;I sat there LFG for 27 hours and NO ONE sent me a tell!&quot;. I really have no use for that kind of player. The world inst gonna come to you. You need to go get it sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bigcatt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Without sounding redundant (although I have been called Redundancy Lad Boy in the past) OOW has lured me back to my old friend, Bigcatt. I was merrily playing my little Beastlord on Morden Rasp, when my daughter talked me into buying the OOW expansion for our two accounts. She wanted to try the task system, so I gave in. With all the positive stuff being posted, I hopped back to Xegony and logged in my shaman. Wowsers is all I can say. I got a group in WOS very early in my return, even though I am not known much anymore. I survived being hit. (not an experience I was familiar with for a while now). I was able to slow stuff. Slowing stuff made a difference. I was able to drop my dots and get a 'your dot has expired message'. For a non raiding player like myself, some of the loot that we were able to take with one group is really nice upgrades. I had to turn on AA experience long enough to get the 9th spell gem, and that  seems to relieve a lot of pressure on my spell swapping. Natch, I have turned AA off and back to lvl grinding full on. :)<br />
While we still have a ways to go till we are 'balanced' I personally think we are finally getting some much needed reintegration of the Shaman class into the game. Of course, as Eddie Murphy said in one of his stand up routines. If you're starving and someone gives you a cracker, it will seem like the best thing you ever ate!<br />

Bazaar/LDoN geared and even i can be main healer there.<br />
Get further in and i can do it but only if tank is extremely well equipped.<br />
If mob slows 1st time then i can handle it but if not then spam healing time.But thats probably how it should be.<br />

Ditto. I am not even VT geared, let alone EP or anyhting - I am your typical ghetto shaman. LDoN gear and assorted junk. But I have no problem being both main healer and slower in WoS left wall (some of the other camps really need a proper healer, but not left wall).</div></div><hr />

The cleric (who had very ghetto gear) ended up sitting and medding through most fights while I would cover healing.  He'd maybe toss one heal while I was getting slow in, then I took over and he'd med.  Was a thing of beauty!</div></div><hr />

Hah, good quote! I have to say from everything I've read (which has been VERY encouraging, aside from the rune issues), OOW seems more like a seriously good ham-and-cheese sandwich with all the fixin's than a cracker. I'm curious and excited enough to go try some zones tonight. <br />

I'm sorry you dislike beastlords so much. However I dont' see blaming them for all the problems. They are only using the ability's that they were given. Beastlords are not shaman. However they do get a few buffs that are far from as good as a shaman. They get a slow but not as good as the enchanter.<br />
<br />
It's not just the slow that gets bsts a group it's many things. After all the midigation on slow effects everyone that has a slow.<br />
<br />
I have both a 65 Shaman, and a 70 bst. I love them both. They both work great in a group together or without eather one.<br />
<br />
Midigation did in fact hurt Shaman thats not in dispute. Groups are now starting to choose people that can fill a varity of rolls.  And thats what has hurt the shaman class more than anything. Over the years the heals havn't kept up, Slows got midigated, and the dps for a shaman (which can be a lot) takes way to long for it to be useful. These are issues that SOE needs to address.<br />
<br />
Blaming beastlords for the problems only causes class problems. Put the blame where it needs to be. On Sony.<br />
<br />
Beastlords and Shaman are needed in groups. So is every class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Groups are now starting to choose people that can fill a varity of rolls.  And thats what has hurt the shaman class more than anything.<br />
<br />
Shaman benefit from groups wanting classes with diverse abilities.  We were hurt when groups started choosing classes looking for specialized abilities.  OoW changed what groups are looking for, as they no longer need the specialized classes *nearly* as often, so we are desireable again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I take back everything ive said in this thread so far.<br />

Just another day in eq I guess - so much hate for them teasing us like that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't let the mitigation BS get to you, I haven't noticed any less need for shaman in OoW since they screwed us again... Mitigation or not... we're still needed<br />
<br />
As far as healing in OoW... I'm not VT/EP flagged/geared and even with mitigation I kept up an 8k warrior consistantly even through one or two of the singet droppers(masterminds?) in WoS<br />
<br />
I'm loveing this new expansion, the drops have been major upgrades for me.... if you check my magelo in the last 2 weeks I've gotten a new piece for face(aug is OoW too), ear, arm, gloves and shoulders...<br />
<br />
This expansion is awesome, don't focus on the mitigation issues because they are not that big a deal... work through it and wish a big FU to SOE everytime you see a partial slow!</div></div><hr />
