<br />
they sure did not make this simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is a Gnome standing on the outskirts of the BB camp, between the porting Magus and the Birdbath. He's wearing a cream - colored robe (ROWF graphic).<br />
<br />
To determine which distiller you need right click on an augment and scroll down. There will be a text.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Mimzit Furnov is the malignant, little Yoda-clones name. He is located at NEG 1080, NEG 2410.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thanks, was looking at the distiller, not the augment</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just a side note I found out last night after spending more plat than I should have...<br />
<br />
If you're selling LDoN gear back to the merchant, and you have merchant-bought LDoN augs on it that you dun wanna keep, you can just shove the whole mess at the merchant.  You don't have to remove everything before selling it. They will NOT take back the dropped augs (+6 stats, +12hp/mana ones etc), so if they won't take the gear back, that's likely why.<br />
<br />
Example: I had chain gloves from EF, with all three slots full of merchant goodies.  Since I don't have any more LDoN gear to use the slot 2 &amp; 3 items on, and the slot 1 was an obsolete sta aug, I just clicked on the gloves and sold the whole kit-and-kaboodle to the merchant in one swipe.<br />
<br />
I discovered this after removing all three augs from my EF arms and selling all 4 bits seperately &gt;&lt;  Save your plat people!</div></div><hr />

Luckily the distiller to remove these is only like 25 pp (75 for the +12 mana ones). <br />
<br />
Great tip though, removing an 1150 aug is about 750 pp in most cases I think.</div></div><hr />
