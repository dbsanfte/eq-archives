<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vadmir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all;<br />
<br />
I have heard a rumor that VI is going to stop MQ's.  Anyone hear anything about this?  A pally friend of mine tried to mq one of the dragon books (not sure if naggy or vox) and it did not work.  He had checked with many pally's who had MQ'd that part of the epic.  When he petitioned they basically told him tough.  Now I have a offer to MQ some of the Thurg armor and would like to know if I can even do this (have to get more gems to do it first anyways).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Heimdall Azureguardian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Chances are he just screwed up his MQ somehow.  Verant has been &quot;Getting rid of MQ's&quot; for quite some time now, wihout ever doing anything.  I just did some Thurg Armor MQ's the other day.</div></div><hr />

in case you weren't joking, MQ means Multi-Quest. the deal is person A has some no-drop items for a quest that needs multiple items turned in, and person B wants to get the quest, and has everything EXCEPT what person A has. So person a gives the quest NPC his items first, then person B finishes up. The way quests, work, the person who turns in the LAST item to the npc gets the quest reward.<br />
<br />
for example: as soon as my thurg faction is high enough (at amiably now =\), i'm going to get my Thurg gloves, because my housemate has the necessary piece of chain from Kael and i have the gems. He gives the garbage chain to the appropriate dorf, then i give the gems to the dorf and collect my pretty little hand warmers.<br />
<br />
and as has been hinted, NONE of this stuff is actually happening. some of these people are joking; the others are paranoid.</div></div><hr />

Ok, 1 person fails on an MQ, for whatever reason.  They post on the boards saying &quot;is MQ getting nerfed, I just failed on mine&quot;.  So then others start to think &quot;you know, I heard that my buddy failed on one last week&quot; or whatever.  Pretty soon you've got 10 people who claim it's failed in the last week, and it's a stealth nerf.  This happens with so many items, every few months.  Just ignore these posts, or post an intelligent answer.  Here's one:<br />
<br />
MQ has been around forever.  It is a large part of the economy, and a HUGE part of EQ in general.  VI won't EVER EVER remove this, simply because it'll change the game so drastically that they will lose a large percentage of customers. <br />
<br />
A valid argument to allow MQ's?  What if you're at a raid with your guild, and quest_piece01 drops.  Well guild_member01 who's been waiting for that piece for 1 year couldn't make the raid, and the piece is no drop.  No one else needs this piece.  What do you do?  Without MQ's, the game wouldn't be playable, trust me on this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">In a way, they are getting rid of MQ'ing.  If you look at the more recent quests, the majority require a container in which you have to combine the items.  Having to hand in a combined container means that you can't do a MQ because you are only handing in 1 thing--the container (assuming that the components for the container are no-drop, of course).  Watch for more of this type of quest.<br />
<br />
The quests that do not have containers are probably expected to be MQ'd by VI.<br />

<br />
That's cool, as long as the effect on my White Ceramic Band (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12137) is changed to Winter's Roar to compensate.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Voodiveus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">a gm once told me that the common cause of failed MQ is that previous quester did it wrong. Example of this is giving wrong gems(Velious Armor but should apply to any MQ). So the person next to submit will be F*k'd up.<br />
<br />
He just advised me to put 4 crap item on the trade window of  the quest NPC to reset the NPC Queue. Im not sure it really works but if feel much better about it, and i havent failed any MQ.</div></div><hr />
