<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pebles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off I am not sure this is the correct section to post this, but here we go:<br />
I am a 54 shammy I have been living in PoN. Ihave have been able to slow the nettling wraiths, wraiths, and vex banshees, with little to no problems, until yesturday's patch.<br />
I log in yesturday get a group head over the river, we pull a nettling wraith it resists slow 5 times in a row, eats me and the main tank. <br />
We pulled 5 more times and the same thing happens. Anybody else notice this or was this a case of really bad luck? <br />
No we did not have a chanter to tash, and my lvl of Malosi would not stick either.<br />
Can anyone confirm the same problem? did the mobs resists get upped?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't have anything to compare it to as last night was my frist dock group but.... some nettling wraiths would resist my 54th shaman as many as 4 times... till it stuck... no tash... and malo## was just as bad...<br />
<br />
I will tell you that I made 3 yellow bubbles in a little more than 4 hours... docks and waterfall.... that is insane for me... but hey... I'm old school... and just newly returned... so it could be the norm now....<br />
<br />
I will be 55th tonight easy...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shyrial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No hard data to provide however, I did notice an increase in SLOW resists on LB and DB mobs yesterday after patch. I would dare to say 20 to 30 percent resist increase. Maybe coincidence /shrug but other Shaman in my guild made similar statements. I will have to do some more testing.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Doing Guardians in PoN we usually pull alot of Wraiths and Banshee's, I did notice I had about 1 resist in 5. Before the patch it was closer to 1 in 10. Could have just been a bad night for me though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I didnt do pon but I did notice some weird streats on resists.  there was one set of pulls that just resisted everything several times.  cleared up after a bit.  I still want to see EQ random number code.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Slowing things in Planes takes work at 54 -- need to stick Malosi or Tash first. Not really sure why you might have managed it easily before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Dunno what to say, I was slowing yellows/reds in PoJ basement (mainly enforcers, I believe) before the patch, at level 48.  I really didn't notice any irregular resists, in fact I was pleasantly surprised to see that slow stuck 80% of the time on the first cast, without malo or tash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was working on my Lucid Shard for scarlet desert last night (took 45 minutes or so)...<br />
<br />
Those damn Sun revenants (Easily green at level 65) resisted up to 3 slows in a row, before I gave up and nuked them.  I've no idea how MR they may have been before, but they had significant MR yesterday, and/or I got significant resists for some other reason.<br />
<br />
Maybe they've always been a bitch to slow, I've never killed em before.  It did seem like they had very abnormal resists for greenies though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I just did the SD shard a few hours ago, only got like 2 resists in the 20 or so I killed for my shard.  Now if only the grey would drop my shard for me, up to like 5 hours here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I always Maloxx first then slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Xahra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I avoid PoN when I can, but I've done the camp you're talking about.  Even at 56 I got a ton of resists, but mostly it was on the things that were even or higher.  DB stuff (banshees I think) would resist once sometimes, usually not though.<br />
<br />
I also always Malo first.  If Malo doesn't stick I'll usually try to toss a slow on just for the hell of it.  A lot of the time it seems to work.  Almost never with the hedge camp though.  Stuff there just seems like it has higher MR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Since I've started fighting in the planes I've just got into the habit of always malising the mobs first...it's so much more safer...the aggro from a resisted malise is nothing compared to the aggro from a resisted slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Netling wraith often resist on first try to slow at lvl 61 now...at 54 it has to be a real job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">&lt;~ 54 shaman, and I've been living in PoI....<br />
<br />
I noticed tonight that malosi was being resisted a ton more than usual.<br />
<br />
On the trash mobs, it would often take 3-4 casts to stick malosi, and sometimes after it would take 2-3 tries to get slow to stick.<br />
<br />
I rarely go to PoN though.. may have to go back and see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">a little hijacking, sorry.. <br />
Anyone else noticed that the guards at sol ro (inside tower) didnt mitigate slow after patch? But it sure as #### didnt looked like they were slowed tho  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Something is indeed screwy with slows in PoN. Im a 56 shammy. Was doing wall trash by zone in last night. All DB mobs, none even or yellow/red.<br />
<br />
The first 10 or 15 mobs the usualy most stick on first shot, sometimes need a second try. Then on like the 16th pull one spider literally would not slow. I dumped my whole bar of mana.. 10+ slows. I tried malosi it. I tried everything. Nothing would stick to it. Other casters were reported that nukes were almost totally resisted on it.<br />
<br />
What the hell is up? I think something funny is going on with MR on some (random?) mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Baldrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Did the zek twins in drunder last night and I seemed to land slows alot easier than I normally did.  More than likely just a good night for me and bad night for you guys though.  But hey test it out and see if they did make some drastic changes to slows.  Its always nice to catch SOE on stuff like this hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Narcleus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">aye noticed the same thing myself in PoN last night.  I am usually called upon to pull glooms due to the fact I could always pull them with slow.  First shot, no resists. been pullin em like this for past 2months.  Hunting last night and they resisted 4 times before slow would land.  Every single time they were pulled.  This was over the course of about 18 glooms.  Same thing for wriaths and banshees, slow and malise started to be resisted alot.  Lvl 60 here btw.  but aye seems mobs had their resists up'd since last patch.  had to wait for tash since malisini was being resisted as well. (malo still going for about 65k on my damn server /sigh)  <br />
<br />
not sure about other zones thou.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Reave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I absolutely noticed a huge difference in the 'right courtyard' area of Plane of Disease last night.  I am level 60, and spend a lot of time there, and resists were either changed or I had the most unlucky 3 hour streak in my EQ career.  I had Turgur's resisted 13 of the first 15 times i cast it, before I stopped keeping track.  Before the patch it was about opposite of this, more like 2 of 15 casts would be resisted there.  It then got a little better, but I was still only landing slow on roughly half the casts.  Sure made things a lot more difficult, and to be quite honest totally nerfed my contributions to the group.  If that is going to keep up, and they for some reason did it across the PoP zones, we are going to start to have real problems getting groups.  I hope and pray I was just unlucky, but, seeing this post makes me doubt it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I have noticed that the light crawlers that you typically pull in the right courtyard have pretty high magic resists compared to other mobs in the zone.  The underbulks seem much easier to land malosini and slow.  As far as PoI, I was there for a bit last night and didn't need to malosini the yard trash before slow.   I haven't done PoN since the patch, but I would assume its pretty close to the same.  At level 54-57 I generally always had to cast malosini a few times before it would actually land.  At 54 you can have lucky streaks and unlucky streaks with it.  If I do recall at that level they should be either even or yellow, perhaps a high blue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>dams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">isn't it obvious?<br />
<br />
CHARISMA!<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Reave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Bhum, central courtyard was open and we were pulling equal numbers of lightcrawlers and underbulks.  The resists were through the roof on both types, not just the lightcrawlers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Our sham was also complaining of much higher resists rates on the golem in the factory in PoI post patch.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Alyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">My fungi is now no drop too.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I think the resists actually went down. Had no problem in my DPS group in PoN being only person who could heal/haste/slow. Resists were very very rare.<br />
<br />
Shaman, rogue, bst, mnk, pali, ranger(all but myself were under 60)...stuff died fast enough sometimes I didn't even have to heal anyone at all between pulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Pebles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Thanks for all the input, as always casting malo(insert your version here) is the key, It was just before the patch I did not need to do that as slow would stick. <br />
I was just trying to save a few seconds casting slow first.<br />
<br />
Pebles taking time to debuff first</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">It could possibly be a level issue. Hunting with fellow Druids a few levels lower than me I find that they seem to have more trouble Ensnaring, Rooting and DOTing than I do. I seen this happen with various levels and the ones higher up seem to have less issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>silverlynx_silentfist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Well, I went back to PoN last night after a two week break and I went from 1 resist in 10 on Malosini to about 2 resists out of 3.  I was getting slow resists more too...but the difference was more noticeable on Malosini.  Not sure what is up, but it persisted all night (5 hour session).  Im 61st by the way and was doing yard trash type stuff (little spiders, trees, and ravens).  In my view there has definitely been some kind of change.<br />
<br />
Just another reason to wish I had Malo I guess.  *sigh*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Drizan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">At 55 I was slowing deep red horsies and yellow hobgoblins with malosi then tugurs all night long.  The only thing really odd was the crocodile which was very mr.  That took about 5 shots before Malosi would land, odd for a blue con.  I was averaging 3 shots of malosi on the horsies which I'm told are level 65.<br />
<br />
The &quot;yard trash&quot; wraiths and banshees I slow without malosi and get maybe 1 resist in 5.</div></div><hr />
