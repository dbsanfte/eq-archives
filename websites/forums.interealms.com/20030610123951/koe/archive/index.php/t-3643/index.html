All you need to do to get your key is hang out in Traks Teeth for a bit.  There are always groups there killing the hunter and forager to force the rares to spawn, and the medallions rot all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Amarin Crystalthorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Fal is absolutely correct.   The Hunter is usually being farmed for the rares on his cycle at the EJ/TT zone in TT, and the Forager is usually being farmed (for his rares) at the EJ tunnel to the Swamp or where the stream dumos into the lake.  Just zone into TT and ask if anyone is hunting Hunters/Foragers.   When you get the predictable &quot;yes&quot;, just find out where they are and ask to loot the medallions.<br />
<br />
Having said that, I am game for a Hunter Forager hunt for you and anyone else in KoS that either 1) needs keys, or 2) would like some of the rare loot.  I have mastered pulling those suckers, having done so for literally dozens of hours to outfir Blaydde and Amarin and old LoA friends.<br />
