<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cenkala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My husband and I spent almost 3 hours in the Mines of Nurga last night and only saw 1 Goblin Rockchanter who of course dropped a blue chant stone :( .<br />
<br />
We ran all over the mines trying to find more of them but no such luck - is there a particular area where they spawn or could they spawn in place of any Goblin ie. you just keep killing any goblin you see and voila.<br />
<br />
Any advice would be appreciated :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I invis'd and jumped DOWN the waterfall, made pet and just started pulling my way into the dungeon.<br />
<br />
These mobs are NOT rare..just the tan stone isn't a common drop.<br />
<br />
If I had a hubby..I'd invis you both..and run thru until you found a rockchanter, back up into a safe hall and clean house, rinse and repeat.<br />
<br />
This is not like Kurns..it's actually quite reasonable as far as difficulty.  Keep in mind that this part is meant to make you bring groups to this underutilized dungeon..so a bit of wiping and respawning is probably programmed in.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">when i got my chantrock i used the shrink/run up the water fall route. killed a chanter at the 2 spawn...blue rock (<br />
went all the way down the hallway to the next room....1 chanter and 4 whipcrackers, so i pull the chanter (got 2 adds) nuke him down, then kill the 2 adds. <br />
dropped the rock )<br />
this btw was the first time i had ever seen it, out of many green, and many (many!) blue rocks thru all my nurga career.<br />
good luck all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">have gotten 3 following this pattern:<br />
jump down the waterfall when you come in.  Straight in front of you is a room with 4 or 5 goblins.  the next room past it has another 6 or 8 in a few spawns.  Clear out these 2 rooms and you can get one pretty easily there.  I've killed hundreds of goblins in the rest of the mines, and never seen one drop elsewhere yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I killed many rockchanters in the Dlubish area with no luck. I killed fewer than 6 in the two rooms just below the waterfall and got a tan rock. That seems to be the sweet spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Okie..just FYI..this quest is full of time wasters, so here's what I learned last night and today.<br />
<br />
The coerced channeler is on Cabilis faction, so he's KoS to just about everything in Dalnir.  Hence he's only up briefly, and doesn't always respawn each cycle.<br />
<br />
Opposite the area where the indifferent Iksar Prisoner is (greenmist quest?), is another hallway.  At the far back of that hallway is a room with chains on the wall like the prisoner's, and a broken table. This is where the channeler spawns.<br />
<br />
I went LD over lunch in this room..when I logged back on the room was full of mobs.  As I was gating out I saw the channeler standing in the corner near the door.  Mind you, I had spent all last night clearing the whole floor hall by hall and never saw him.<br />
<br />
Kicking myself for gating when I could have finished the quest right there..I ran back across WW to Dalnir, and made my way back down to that room...and he wasn't THERE!<br />
<br />
In a rage I nuked and dotted everything in the room, and then worked my way back out to the 'main ' room to camp the lumpy goo a while so I could figure this out.  After a few minutes of no lumpy I decided that I was going to camp the broken table room and see what happens...perhaps he had simply despawned like the prisoner in Droga?<br />
<br />
I got back to the room, and to my HORROR I found the channeler in a fight for his life against a smouldering goo.  I dotted it, and it turned on me..which is great since channeler had perhaps 1 bub of life left.  Once the threat was dead, I finished the hand-in and gated..as Vagnar was kind enough to cause a small train again as he ran off into the hallway.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!</div></div><hr />
