<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mutkuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have some alts, druid, Ranger, Monk but i was thinking about making a Shaman alt i think it would be kinda fun, not give him much money (like 1k) and start playing anybody else got this goin on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">kinda like a restarting type thing?<br />
<br />
Im not really high lvl enough to start a shammy alt, still have about half my life ahead of me.  I do have a BL alt i dont play much, but i havent really played him for an extended period of time, mostly playing my shammy.<br />
<br />
I think it would be fun to restart again, but i suggest changing location.  Since your a 'Shaman of Justice', your prob a barb, so i suggest you trying a troll/ikky.  That should keep it pretty entertaining)</div></div><hr />
