<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Played with my Obulus Death Shroud in Cazic Thule lots today. The ODS saves me 10 percent on EVERY spell I cast. Let's take one sample fight... (edited just to get to the point):<br />
<br />
<br />
[Tue Jun 25 15:39:05 2002] Boond tells the group, 'INC a Tae Ew defender'<br />
[Tue Jun 25 15:39:25 2002] You begin casting Malo.<br />
[[Tue Jun 25 15:39:33 2002] You begin casting Turgur's Insects.<br />
[Tue Jun 25 15:39:51 2002] You begin casting Bane of Nife.<br />
[Tue Jun 25 15:39:56 2002] Your target resisted the Bane of Nife spell.<br />
[Tue Jun 25 15:39:59 2002] You begin casting Bane of Nife.<br />
[Tue Jun 25 15:40:07 2002] You begin casting Ice Strike.<br />
[Tue Jun 25 15:41:09 2002] You tell your party, '_____ grief-healing Vova _____'<br />
[Tue Jun 25 15:41:10 2002] You begin casting Torpor.<br />
<br />
<br />
I saved 189 mana during this fight, which lasted about 125 seconds! In FT terms, that's FT9.5... not shabby. Here's the break-down:<br />
<br />
35 - Malo<br />
25 - Turgur's<br />
42 - Bane1 (resisted, but I get the savings)<br />
42 - Bane2<br />
25 - Ice Strike<br />
20 - Torpor<br />
<br />
By contrast, C3 brought in 300 mana during that same time period.<br />
<br />
<br />
In an 11-hour log sample (also from CT) I saw the following savings: <br />
<br />
82 - 11 Successful casts of Acumen<br />
1148 - 27 Successful casts of BoN<br />
685 - 37 Successful casts of Celerity<br />
260 - 13 Successful casts of Chloroblast<br />
400 - 08 Successful casts of Focus<br />
84 - 06 Successful casts of Bear Form<br />
14 - 02 Successful casts of Gate (shameful)<br />
175 - 07 Successful casts of Ice Strike<br />
99 - 33 Successful casts of Invis<br />
1125 - 09 Successful casts of Group Focus<br />
12 - 02 Successful casts of Levitation<br />
8855 - 253 Successful casts of Malo<br />
60 - 03 Successful casts of Malosini<br />
1740 - 29 Successful casts of Group Regrowth<br />
245 - 49 Successful casts of Shrink<br />
180 - 15 Successful casts of Spirit of Billy<br />
195 - 03 Successful casts of my Dogdog<br />
280 - 07 Successful casts of Epuration<br />
120 - 08 Successful casts of Shadoo<br />
455 - 13 Successful casts of Brute<br />
385 - 11 Successful casts of Cat<br />
2260 - 113 Successful casts of Torpor<br />
6975 - 279 Successful casts of Turgur's<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------<br />
25834 mana SAVED 11 hours.<br />
<br />
or 39 mana per minute, average (FT 3.9).<br />
<br />
And that was certainly not 11 hours of solid fighting. Spent a lot of time shuttling groupmates from zone-in to camp, etc.<br />
<br />
Well anyways, I'm obviously an insomniac. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
..... <br />
<br />
Get the shroud, it's pretty rockin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I agree that it is a very nice item, but you're forgetting to factor in your specialization skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, I have no idea how often specialization kicked in... so just assumed 10 percent off of the unmodified spell cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nice bit of mana saved there.<br />
<br />
How much is this going for on other servers now?  Was 1.5K on Xeg before patch and seems to hoover around 7.5K now.  Course you gotta weed thru the peeps who are trying to sell it for 25K :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The question I have is what's better? I had heavy dragon shoulders, 13 ac 45 hp 45 mana, and I lost 30 HP and 3 raw AC, which seems like a no brainer. The 3 wis and 25 mana is a wash, casting wsie.<br />
<br />
But, is the ODS better than strength of the elements (15 ac 100 hp 15 sv cold fire?), which I've decided I want to finish? 5 more raw AC, 85 more HP and solid general purpose saves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I paid 2500 for mine on Stormhammer... but I've seen it go for 10k and 15k lately too.<br />
<br />
Mormegil -- I don't really have an answer for you on that... The strength of the elements is certainly better resist gear ... but unless you have Can5, I don't know that the HP are as immediately useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No Canni 5, but I'd still rather have the AC and HP, as I'm not one of the 1300 ac 3000 hp shaman. :)<br />
<br />
As for resists, I swear I barely care. I have hardened bone spaulders I wear for resists, but my view is that they are situational - if your fighting in an AE situation, use em. If you aren't going to be the target of magic attacks, I'd rather have the HP/AC/mana etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Boraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I wonder how it stacks up to shawl8 with FT2 and the +15% buff duration...<br />
<br />
Still I am temped to /auc for one til I get the 8th shawl (only have 6th right now)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tolfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I wonder if Soupy is selling ODS's lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Nope -- haven't sold it yet. I'm still loving my ODS. Even turned down a barbed rubi coif...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wampaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Has anyone noticed an increase in fizzles since they started using this item? I got one about 3 weeks ago and I love the mana saving. But i seem to fizzle all the time now when I cast spells. My wisdom is like 210 and all my magic skills are maxed out. Maybe its just me, but I seem to fizzle alot when I wear mine.<br />
<br />
Wampaa<br />
57 Shaman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Yathandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Nope, I haven't noticed a fizzle change when wearing mine.  I love my ODS!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've have not noticed a fizzle change since getting an ODS either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Frahnz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I would like to suggest an alternative mana conservation III item to the ODS, a Chrystaline Torque (AC12  neck slot).  This is especially good for those who have gone through the arduous task of the Coldain Shawl Quests.  I used an ODS, and immediately tossed my 7th shawl in the bank, cursing Verant for all my wasted hours.  I found out about the Torque, bought one, and am now ready to do my 8th shawl turn in again.<br />
     I know, I know.....where does it drop, how do I get one?  It drops off a named gargoyle behind the upper dogs camp in Velks.  I believe it can spawn rarely and randomly at any spawn point.  I bought one from a friend who won the roll on it, and it is one of the best items I now own, IMHO.  Brells prices seem to be around the 15k range for this item, but with a high range (10 to 25K) if that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I got an ODS last week.. I think shammies get some serious milage out of this as cana is more efficient and I found I can heal, buff and slow for a full group of tanks in velks. I know some of this is due to the removal of the 10% heal penalty.. (I don't have a regen bp - just one point in aa..).<br />
<br />
This items just makes a shammy 10% better... and it's noticable :)<br />
<br />
Yes I would get an IGS too.. but for resists rather than AC.</div></div><hr />
