<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>EverNewbie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering what a shaman soloing in Paudaul should use as a tactic. I'm currently a lvl 14 Barb Shaman with some ok gear. I've got SCH in my prim slot and Darksea Harpoon in my range. Prolly should go buy a chared but have a resist shield on right now. I've only got 122 wis but I do have quite a bit of other mana gear. Got some nice focus effects such as Mana Pres, Improved Healing, and some other ones. Right now I'm root/roting till 25% and meleeing then. I nuke if I have to. This is an ok tactic I can usually pull it off with 2 bubs mana and 2.5 bubs or more life. It depends on how effectively my roots work. I'm fighting the shooms and phalgs in a cavern on the Shadowweaver's side. I'm wondering if I'm using the right tactic. I'll go group for recondite bandits at lvl 16 or 17. Any help will be appeciated. Thanks lots<br />

If you start at the Hollowshade zone and work down to the Fiend pond, that's great XP until 15-18. Then move down and start on Fiends. <br />
<br />
When the fiends go light blue, move around the pool counter-clockwise from the HSM tunnel to the next one over. There are Mature/Elder mushrooms and Outcast Shiknar down there. Get a map and find the &quot;loops&quot;. If you have a partner, you can do the Shiknar loops with only stopping to med.<br />
<br />
Also, after moving around the Fiend pool and in to the next tunnel (to the right comming from HSM) you'll see that this tunnel splits. To the left are Patog Phlarg Fiends (higher level then the Plergs) to the right are the Shiknar. <br />
<br />
Shiknar should be great XP to 22 or 23, Patogs up to 25 or 26, maybe higher. Once the Patogs went Lt Blue, we left PC. The backside of Shadeweavers is excelent XP up to near 30.<br />
<br />
We spent a long time there and only seen people that were lost. Never ran in to anyone there to XP. Same with Shadeweavers.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also, as far as tactics, get it slowed and DoT'd with one or 2 DoTs and tank it at ~70-80%, but we were pretty well geared. I found a Rock Studded Smasher for a steal in the Bazaar (&gt;1k for it!). It's an excelent beatin' stick. Best bet though, find a partner. Monk, rogue, paladin or SK would be my choices.</div></div><hr />
