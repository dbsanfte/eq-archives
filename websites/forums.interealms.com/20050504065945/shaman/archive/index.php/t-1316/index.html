<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kronah Klump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Level 35, want to do some soloing, but am finding it difficult without snare because of adds etc. <br />
<br />
I would like to hear some of your guys' Shaman soloing strategies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Im not quite that level, but from what i have heard:<br />
<br />
you have a few options<br />
<br />
1) root rotting.  Root the mob, dot, maybe slow just incase.  jus keep rooted and dotted.  takes awhile but amazingly simple.<br />
<br />
2)buff yourself up, get out a pet.  Pull a mob w/ mal___(whatever version), and tank it to death w/ your pet hammering.  <br />
cast: slow, and scourge(your disease dot at 34), and debuffs as you like, whatever you feel helps.  this is mainly for the ac/hp shammy, and is very popular on this board, or so i gather.<br />
<br />
real shamans tank =)<br />
<br />
This way is great for impressing people cause its pretty rare to see a caster out melee a mob.<br />
<br />
A few other strategies are <br />
pet kiting: stick a dot or two on the mob, enough to keep aggro and let your pet hit it from behind as you run aroound the countryside<br />
FoL: poor mans fear kiting) again pet works well here.<br />
<br />
and just pretty much anything you can come up w/.<br />
<br />
Shamans rule cause we can solo almost anything, and with the most options on how to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Adds are certainly a hassle... <br />
<br />
The most obvious solution is to find a good camp spot- one that doesn't have a lot of wanderers going by.<br />
<br />
Park your pet at that camp spot (don't bring him with you to pull, as he might aggro additional baddies.)  If you get more than one, root it far enough away from the campsite so that when root breaks, it won't come back.  Sometimes this might even mean running away from the camp before casting root.<br />
<br />
If you have more than one at the campsite (ack!), peeling one off to root-park it can be a chore.  If your pet can handle taking a beating for a little while, just grab the one he's not beating on- get its attention, then run to where you want to root it, root it, and come back.<br />
<br />
A handy trick I've been forced to use a few times... if something is beating on your pet and you need to get it off, cast Flash of Light on the monster, then hit my &quot;/pet back off&quot; hotkey (just keep mashing the button until dogdog listens.)  The monster should go running once he's out of melee range.  Follow and root it once it's far enough away.  Of course, you need to be careful with this one... don't train other people with your running adds.  :)<br />
<br />
Also, just face the fact that you will lose a pet every now and then to adds.  In spite of everything, it happens.  It sucks, but usually you can sacrifice dogdog and at least make it out of there yourself.  An expensive get out of jail free card... but better than the alternative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Best way I have found with adds in NON old world zones is root and run like heck till your out of range.  Though I ussually keep Flash of Light up as well.  Most places I solo there are not any others near to help or get trained so I just root rot one while root flash of lighting the other.  With your lowest lvl root you can easily keep one or even two mobs locked down with Flash of light while you remed your mana back to full.  Root the mob wait till about the time root should break and hit it with a flash of light.  It'll run out and then you'll be able to reroot it out near max range when it returns with you taking no damage.  Have had use this when down to the 100 HP point to get enough mana ro heal or nuke the mob dead due to being too low for the mob to go into run mode.</div></div><hr />
