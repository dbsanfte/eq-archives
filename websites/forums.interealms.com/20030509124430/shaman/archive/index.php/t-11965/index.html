He believes that Shaman are the most uber soloing class, more so even that Necros and Mages. I don't want to debate this point, but I would like to know what are the toughest mobs that a Shaman can solo. I read that Galiel and the Tranquil Treant in PoG can be done, and the Cliff Golem. Now, pre-PoP and sub-best in game equipment speaking, Galiel and TT are fairly easy for small groups of 4-6. I have never done the Golem before, so no idea. But how about some other stuff that has been solod now, but used to be very difficult. Specifically I am thinking of stuff like Phinigel, Dain, or Lodi?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Phini, DAIN, or Lodi? Phini and Lodi should be easy. I dunno about dain...the fact that he hits for 425(350) unslowable, ramps, banishes, has a ton of HP would make him quite the challenging solo for a shaman! Good luck sir!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">theres no way any class will ever  be able to solo dain.<br />
<br />
phinny and lodi are easily soloable.. also heard about some shaman here soloing Ragefire, thats a pretty good feat if you ask me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Talthos_</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ive solo'd cliff golems in OT for a while now.<br />
ive seen Lodi solo'd by a 61 shaman, and i am almost positive i could solo him if i had torper.<br />
dain is for a raid. too many hp and unslowable by normal slow.<br />
phinny could be done, just as long as you got him away from the seaswirls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Old shaman boards (pre this board) had a 65 shaman who solo'd Phinny without trouble.<br />
<br />
Last I saw, a 65ish shaman solo'd RF down to about 20%, but something like missing a slow, or interuppt on a torpor made it hard for him to complete the kill.<br />
<br />
Cliff golems aren't too hard, other than MR. Torpor would help tons, add Canni 5 and no contest IMO.<br />
<br />
Also heard of a 65ish Prophet soloing Guardian Wurms in SF. When he posted, he made it sound like he wasn't 65 when he did that.<br />
<br />
Lodi, could be solo'd by 60+ shaman, but hardest part would be doing enough DPS to not get KS'd.<br />
<br />
Others solo their way into The Deep to get their levatation spell from the Derranged Underbulk, not an easy thing to do.<br />
<br />
Some solo the Emperor in Seb, hard part being positioning and not getting the Emp to run/gate/summon into several guards, etc.<br />
<br />
I know their are more, but this are some of the ones I recall seeing more recently (within last 4 months or so).<br />
<br />
Doesn't include the nest dragons in WW, most should have heard about those. Also Troopers in Kael Arena area. I'm sure their are more, but this is a quick, very basic list, lest I err.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Timog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">if you want something very challenging to do, do the deep. at level 65 with torpor and most of my spells(magelo is HERE (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=28928)), i soloed all the way to the deranged underbulk and held the camp until I got the spell to drop for me. <br />
<br />
you can single pull the green mobs, but if there are light blues, they will add. single mobs are cake, but i almost died breaking in a 3-light blue spawn.. getting them all slowed was rough. once slowed it was fairly easy to stay alive (i think they double for up to 223), and they have low hp for their difficulty.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Phinny was soloable in kunark era, (level 60 no AA)<br />
Lodizal was done at level 60, pre-pop.<br />
Dain is not possible.<br />
<br />
It's hard to find a good challenge anymore, most things that use to be fun are trivial post PoP or way to hard to be considered. 5 extra levels have made THAT much of a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Solo'd from the begining of caves to Twaro and then Twaro and spirit himself awhile ago... Took me little over and hour.<br />
<br />
Solo'd summoning named in Hoh pretty easily...<br />
<br />
Lately I've been looking for a challange to solo, either something is rediculously easy (quiecense + the occasional Kraggs dot fest) or near impossible (chain tnargs and Quiescnese barely keeping up witha  slow mitigation mobs dps). Anyone have some fun really hard mobs to try out?<br />
<br />
I have :all my spells, Pre-elemental geared up guild(ft 15 + 3300ish hp unbuffed), and 198aa :P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Shaman are the king of solo at 60.  At 65 3 classes beat us out.  Charm is so insanely overpowered ... it will be interesting to see if tonights patch fixes it or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i heard the bees in pos are tough solo kills.  maybe a temple named in hoh could be hard.  you could try your hand at some of the slow midigated pop mobs or even start out with the fully slowable yet unrootable mobs.  maybe try doing some mobs unbuffed..your unbuffed hp is close to my self buffed hp =p<br />
personally i find that multiple mobs are harder than just one &quot;big&quot; mob.  It is to hard to find tough soloable mobs in pop so when i feel dangerous i do 2 or 3 mobs at a time.  no way we are going to be able to outsolo enchanters/druids/necros/mages, their charm is just to powerfull =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Only bee I played with was a chief, and it was flagged unrootable and unslowable, so those are out if all of them are like that.<br />
<br />
  Cliff Golems, Ragefire, Talendor, Guardian Wurms, tons of WW dragons, the entry mobs of ST and Bristblebane.   That is my list of big solo kills I can think of.<br />
<br />
  I haven't ever caught Lodi up (never even SEEN the guy), no desire to try Phinny, and can't think of too many other things to try.<br />
<br />
<br />
  I heard of someone soloing Innoruuk.   So he is my next goal for now, but since I need a wizzie to even reach him I don't consider that a TRUE solo.   I like to reach all kills alone, and do it with only my buffs.  THEN I call it a solo kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">well the question is do you want to solo a named mob or just solo a hard challanging mob?<br />
even soloing some of the bot giants can be fun...<br />
<br />
btw caanus someone was saying they solo the bees for fun and they are hard as hell...i wouldn't do it, but it sounded possable for the hi end shaman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dunno why a wizzy porting you to Hate is not solo I mean if you go solo ragefire, don't u need the cleric to spawn it, or even if u want to solo lodi don't u need a wizzy or druid to port to iceclad.  I guess u can run from PoK stone or take boat, but nothing wrong with a wizzy just porting you up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Nothing wrong with it, but for me doing something solo means I can do it on a whim, did rage back when he spawned on his own, and I rarely ask for ports.    I know the whole &quot;this game is a social game&quot; deal, but when you are an officer for a raiding guild, dealing with the people gets on you after a while, and it is nice to log on at odd times when you know NOBODY around and do stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Even after getting a port to hate, I'd be amazed if anyone could get to Inny, pull him and kill him solo. Would love to see it if someone did though!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Aye, my guild went up after ranger stones (well, we HOPED for some) and I must say that it was quite the thrill :)    I was looking closely at all aspects thinking about soloing, came up with a few wonderments.<br />
<br />
<br />
   First off is the largest threat...  Adds.   At 65, I was able to deal with most all the first floor 2 or 3 at a time without too many problems.    Slows would wear out before I could finish them all solo, but I could handle it easily.   Most everything is rootable, and very little casters.<br />
<br />
<br />
   Next is named.   Most every named was pulled, so i still have no clue where they all spawn at.   But I am pretty sure that you could dodge around most of them if you did know where they were.   But still, nothing in here was harder than anything I handled before, so I would think that adds are again your big problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Second Dilema...  Spell slots.   Need to have up Tnargs, and Q and canni, so that leave 5 slots.   Assume you have up slow and root if you want to live.   Down to 3 slots.   I would personally want gate up at all times as well, so 2 slots left for DPS.    I don't think that you can easily predict every time that you will pull a golem, so that means leaving up Grummus....  1 slot left, and I don't have malo/sinia in there at all.    So that means if I want to play things safe I have NO DPS spells.   Now, I can bring up a horse in hate, so that means swapping spells midfight is quite feasible, and I could be re-scribing malosinia for Haste, DOTs and rebuffs as needed midfight, but again that leaves me vulnerable to adds.<br />
<br />
<br />
   My decision so far is to use my Tash stick as the only form of debuff if I get adds, and to keep up malosinia at all times, scribing and refreshing haste between each set of fights and using melee and pet as the only form of DPS unless I am CERTAIN I won't get any adds (not often that happens).<br />
<br />
<br />
   Another problem is runners, so that means bringing a bag or 2 of twine, or some time in FG getting 10 charge snares.   I think I'll just try to have 2 in camp at all times, or to root the last one alive till it dies.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
   Second floor, this is where is becomes easy :)<br />
<br />
   Pathing is still screwey as Hecuba.    If you get too much aggro (very easy if you try pulling things)  just step through a doorway and the mobs path away and forget you long enough to camp the aggro out.<br />
<br />
   If you don't want to fight, you dont' have to.    Almost nothing sees invis.    But when you do fight, you can be in a world of pain, cause everything is VERY resistant.<br />
<br />
<br />
   Large problem that I recall hearing of is that if you leave up too many cleric mobs on first floor, then you encounter problems where they are healing your fights on second floor.   So you pretty much have to clear all the clerics on first, or at least all of them in the area you are going to fight Inny at.     Then of course you need to clear enough room on second floor to do your Inny fight in.<br />
<br />
<br />
   Inny himself isn't too hard if you get him slowed, then he is barely more than a WW dragon with an annoying AE.   Would be a VERY long fight however.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
   I would think that having Spiritcall, and suspend minion, possibly even Paralyzing earth would be definate necessities up here, just so you can have an easy sense of confidence.  Canni5/Torpor or Q is also needed if you want to finish this in any reasonable amount of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">How did you solo Talendor?  Get extremely lucky with a slow landing or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Pretty much.   Saw him up, decided to play around and managed to slow him, so I layed out all the damage I could and got him near dead before slow broke, then I just let pet finish the job for me while I healed like mad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Tantor was a challange of stamina for me. Go check him out, and make sure he is the yellow con ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The right gear can help out a bit on spell slots. Pendant of malosini takes care of that slot. Ring of immoblization and or Ornate pants for root with VP is sufficient for most things. A circle of smoke can cover gate for another spell slot back or potion. A ct gate potion would be good since I think those are still instant clicks.</div></div><hr />

VS is insanely MR so I doubt he could be soloed. I guess its like Talendor, if you can get slow to stick it would be interesting.<br />
<br />
   Speaking of Talendor.... someone mentioned kiting Talendor until slow stuck. I have always been under the impression that in order to land spells on Tal one must be in melee range. Comments??<br />

<br />
<br />
         They are all very resistant to magic, even after malo. Problem I see with Sev is that since he is a poison/disease type mob he may well be inherently very resistant to our dots. Whereas Talendor is fire based, which has no bearing on our spell casting... well unless you like using burst of fire....<br />
