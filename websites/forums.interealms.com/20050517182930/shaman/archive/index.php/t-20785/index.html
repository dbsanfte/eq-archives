<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kinrab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">k here is every1s favorite question =). im lookin for a high end duo not just a exp duo. im talkin bout like old world boss mobs/some PoP mobs. i realy like having a DPS char. i currently duo a shaman/paladin but i am so lacking on the dmg? is there any melee(ranger/monk) that are able to tank old world(classic-luclin) boss mobs? or am is the tank classes the only way to go for this kind of duo? pls dont say search cause i did and read alot of threads and guess what... it was filled mostly of people telling the poster to use search =/ so hard to find some good info heh.<br />
<br />

If you dont want to read all that crap simple question is: for high end boss mob duo with a shaman, is a tank class only way to go or can melee(ranger/monk) handle summoning boss mobs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Depends on which boss mobs I'm sure.  I know for a fact that talendor can be solo'd by an elemental geared shaman (he had raid buffs, but I'm sure it's possible without).  Gorenaire is soloable too I'm sure, her DPS isn't very good.  Not too sure about the rest of the kunark dragons, haven't really tried them since it took our guild 50 people and we still lost.  <br />
<br />
Whichever golem doesn't DT in fear is probably solo/duoable too. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure shamans could keep up with the DPS of velious/luclin bosses (va dyn or the acrylia worm perhaps??)  but you could certainly try.<br />
<br />
Also, if you can keep up with their DPS long enough to kill them, it probably doesn't matter what class you use as a tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Va'Dyn should be duoable or soloable by a high end shaman.  Would take for freakin ever, but now more than ever with Q healing 360/tic, it would easily be possible.  His DPS is pathetic.  <br />
<br />
I've done Ragefire solo, was kinda fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hard part about VD is getting enough cleared to pull him out single.   Could probably pull a trick or 2 outta your hat if you worked at it though.<br />
<br />
  Duo you should be able to take out Zlandicar and any Kunark dragons (excluding possibly Trak).  Everything pre-Kunark you can EASILY duo except vox/naggy due to level and all.   As for planes...  Not sure on that, never spent much time in Hate and it was revamped anyway.  Fear.... not sure if you could actually pull off the non DT golem.  First problem is you can't pull him to north wall if CT is up due to pathing.  And I dont' remember ever landing a slow on the bugger.  It may be possible though.  Never spent any time in Growth, and new PoM I refuse to enter cause I am still mourning the old one.<br />
<br />
  Velious...  could probably duo ZLandi as stated... can't think of much else that I consider a boss which you could duo.  Maybe Lord Bob... but he's hardly a boss.<br />
<br />
  Luclin...  Hrm.  You can tackle most all names in Grieg, but not Grieg himself, and he's the only boss per-se.  You could do the Spire Lord... but who'd want to?  Might be able to duo Rhag1... but again, not quite a boss.   Would be intersting to see someone try Lcea duo, but I doubt that could happen unless one was a bard so that charm never hit.  Could take out any of the wars on Luclin with 2 people, except maybe Grim forest, never played with it.<br />
<br />
  RC.  There is one that would be a true challenge duo, but I think you could do it.  Once i get Time/GoD gear for most slots I intend to try solo on him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kinrab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">k thanks for all the great info =) i plan to try all these things but my question wasnt what could i duo but it was: in a shaman/??? duo for high end encounters like ones you guys are listing is it a must to have a plate-tank as the partner for a shaman? or are monks or even a ranger still viable duo partner for these kinds of encounters?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nothing is going to beat a tank if you're going to get summoned.  I wouldn't worry that much about DPS of your shaman partner if I were you; the main thing is whether you can slow mobs so THEIR DPS is manageable compared to your healing, mostly with quiessence/torpor.  Shamans can last almost forever, so it's about outlasting the mobs, is how I see it.<br />
<br />
I gave up the DPS of my monk for first a warrior then a SK.  I found the monk DPS was nice, but far more important was survivability.  A paladin is really not bad at all on that count, and their stuns can save you mana by not making you need to heal as much, since a stunned mob does no DPS.  The aggro on a hybrid tank will let the shaman DOT and DD at will, too.<br />
<br />
The only problem is  -- no defensive discipline.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you take RC off the list, I know a ranger can do em with you.   If he is well geared he can probably help on that one as well.<br />
<br />
  Monks... not sure how well they do on the aggro and all for allowing you to contribute.<br />
<br />
   Also, remember on RC he rampages, and has a pretty nice range for it, so you are tanking too.  Cripple is your friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I duo with a ranger.  We do well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I hate to knock melees, but honestly, in many of these situations I'd think that an Ench would be your best bet.  Charm a pet, snare (from a clicky item), haste/buff/equip him just before engaging.  Pull with malos, engage pet, back the ench way off after tash to allow re-charming if it breaks (remember, mob's snared), let the shaman try to debuff/dot/nuke/heal if needed.  Then just sit and watch the pet destroy the boss.<br />
<br />
This is, of course, situational, as there won't always be mobs tough enough around to charm and send in.  But, in the case of many of the mobs, this would probably work just fine, assuming things went well.<br />
<br />
Assuming things DON'T go well, well, then this is a nasty combo, since a pet can be a lot to handle for some enchies, especially in a small combo.<br />
<br />
For situations where this isn't viable, I would say that a plate tank is probably your best bet.  Pallies have stun, heals, and LoH for survivability, Sks have dots, taps, nukes and HT for extra dps and a little added health regen.  Warriors have nice discs, more hp/mitigation, and decent taunt/dps with the right weapons.  Really it just depends on who you have with you :)<br />
<br />
Anywho...have fun :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I also did plane of air(sky? the old one) duo with a chanter, got as far as the pegasus isle to get ..... whatever item drops for his ranger twink</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I can easily pull aggro off my monk with a slow.  Same can't be said for my SK, of course.   That's one of the really nice things I like about him.<br />
<br />
Snare and FD are two of the others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've done Zlandicar a couple of times solo, but it's a rather long and annoying fight since you have to rely on velium strike for dps (very high mr, close to immune to poison/disease).<br />
<br />
He's pretty easy as a duo though, you can even do him unslowed with any melee tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bedalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">do you know the names of his AE's?<br />
and do u know his DPS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I would think that ranger would be doable, rangers have pretty good agro generation and alot of those mobs don't hit all that hard. And its not like rangers can't get to high levels in ac or hps, and thier dps is awesome. Could also do the shaman tank ranger use trueshot method as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Qatrixaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Tank class?  Why take a tank class when a Shaman can pretty much tank most high end old world mobs that are slowable.<br />
<br />
Take a damage dealer with you.  Ranger with the right AA's + Auto attack(Gravis gamepad for those who still don't have a clue) is lots of damage with minimal effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You could do the Spire Lord... <br />
<br />
Do you mean the Spiroc Lord in sky by this?  And if so - doesn't he still death touch?<br />
<br />
In my opinion, your best bet for duo's would be a high level necro or mage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Monk.  They can Stonestance every 3 minutes, Mend every 6 minutes iirc, FD, and better DPS than all the tanks (cept ranger in Trueshot).  Damage is spikier than other tanks but overall they take alot less damage because of their defensive skills.  Add unresistable lull to help pull.  Getting aggro is usually the only concern but adding a stun proc aug works wonders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">By spire lord I mean the guy in Mons Letalis (whichever one that is between the Grey and Seru).  He's on top of the large spire in the middle with a bunch of other robe fellows.    When thinking of mobs I completely forgot about plane of Sky as I have only been there occasionally, and DTs are pretty rampant on anything worthwhile (and anything worthwhile is REALLY rare... seen any FD rings lately?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Going Cleric route myself.  I'm sure the Ubah Shammies could slaughter most of the Old World mobs with one, but it's going to be a challenge still for me since I don't raid on my current server.  My best armor is coming from LDoN, and so are my Foci (Minus AAs of course).<br />
