<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ytsejam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can someone help me with a question?<br />
<br />
Does a shaman who has been transferred to another server (who had his epic on the original server), have to do the entire epic quest again on the new server?<br />
<br />
For example, I have done the first steps on the new server to get the epic again, but when I did the turn-ins, it told me that my true spirit faction could not get any higher, i.e. I am ally with the true spirits because I already did the epic quest on my original server.<br />
<br />
So do I have to go through the ENTIRE quest AGAIN?  Can I just get the tear and do the final turn-in for the battle with Rak, turn in the scales and get the Spear of Fate since I am already an ally with the true spirits?  Can I even do the epic quest again at all?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
