<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kreil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been playing my shaman since 99. I am currently level 64 just 5% from 65. I am in a young guild. Probably average level of 56. We have been trying to beat the PoJ exe trial recently and it seems pretty difficult. I was wondering if some of you had advice? When we do trials we have been changing a few of the dps classes but the last time we tried we had: 64 Sham(me), 65 Mage, 63 Cleric, 65 Monk, 63 Pally, 64 War. Is there some special class make up that makes it easy? Perhaps we need an Enc? Seems to me we should of been able to complete the trials but we were not even close. Our best effort only got us 3 mobs through the 2nd wave. <br />
<br />
Just thought I would see if some of you had some ideas. Our goal was to get 5 people that can do it and rotate the 6th position to get the others in the guild flagged.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>zyzygy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">here's how i do it, i've only failed once due to my own stupidity.<br />
<br />
group make up:<br />
a nice tank.  this is pretty important from what i see.  i've only tried it with quality tanks, and even then he came close to dying (with only me healing).  recommended 8khp+(buffed) w/ full tanking AA's.<br />
dps<br />
dps<br />
dps<br />
dps<br />
cleric w/ supernal elixir OR if u have a nice tank, a shaman with quiescence.<br />
<br />
basically what i do, when we zone into the room, everyone runs to the front right corner out of aggro range of the mobs except for the tank.  he stays within aggro range when the mobs pop.  <br />
<br />
when the mobs all pop, they all aggro the tank.  everyone assists the tank and kills the mobs one by one, concentrating ur DPS only on one mob at a time so u can kill them quickly and reset the walking guy.  healers heal ONLY with heal over times.  any kind of normal heal, CH, fast heal, whatever, will drag ALL the other mobs that the tank isn't beating onto u, and healer dead = game over.  <br />
<br />
for this reason, you need a nice tank.  you gotta make sure the heal over time will be enough healing for him to stay up while 5-6 mobs are hitting him.  of course it's easier with a cleric since supernal elixir is 500hp/tick i think, but i was able to do it with Q (300hp/tick).  the reason why i failed (like i stated above), is because my tank was reaching 25% hp, and i was scared because Q wasn't healing fast enough, so i used tnargs, and that promptly got ALL the mobs on me and i died and game over.  i had lost faith in Q.  but from then on, i used ONLY Q, and while it came to the tank with 25% hp, it has ALWAYS held out till all the mobs were dead.  have faith in quiescence/supernal elixir.<br />
<br />
if u can do this, it should be no problem.  i never bother slowing either.  the key part is just using the heal over time so the other mobs won't aggro onto the healer.  you guys will ONLY be touching 1 mob at a time (for faster kills, and reset the walking guy), so that one non-HoT heal will be enough to drag the other mobs onto u since nothing else has touched them.<br />
<br />
since Quiescence uses so little mana, i was also able to nuke between the Q's fading, which i'm sure helped some.<br />
<br />
good luck</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Farrdaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">there are many ways todo this - one good way if you have a good enc and a couple of wizards - AE it - tank/cleric/enc/wiz/wiz + any other class - enc holds aggro with chain stunning - wizards ae it - all 3 need horses - need tank for final mob - can kite him around if your low on mana - cleric only has to heal the enc.<br />
<br />
if you have a dru/mage they can banish the rock mobs with the 60 spell.  you should be able to do it with tank/cler/enc/dps/dps + any other class.  enc is nice because they an mez the non-rock mobs.  those you just root. <br />
<br />
as for a shammy - don't worry about slowing the mobs unless there are more than one rock - just nuke+spot heal+cureing slow/tash.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>VXThis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did Exe trial with a 65 druid, 65 Paladin, 64 Beastlord, 65 Ranger, 65 Bard and myself, a 61 Shaman...<br />
<br />
First time we didnt kill fast enough, I nuked all day but it still wasnt enough...  <br />
<br />
The second time, I took over heals.  I let the druid go for DPS instead... worked much better, won the trial just fine.  Even messed up when final named popped, I had aggro so I was kiting, then someone attacked it and of course, it started summoning.  Still won though, even with very lom.  <br />
<br />
If you have a good tank, forget slow.. these guys dont hit hard, I was tanking them alright when I got aggro with no slow on them... max hit was under 300 iirc.  I am sure now that at 62 it would have been easier with the faster 1300 point heal, but did it just fine with our measly 1950.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Your group should be fine with those classes and levels. Just make sure you and the mage are nuking(use spear, make sure the mage is banishing too), mana classes use the mod rod after first wave so it is available by 4th, and get a dd bracer/earring from the mage. <br />
<br />
If you're still having problems..just keep practicing. Until you get the routine down it can seem pretty hard. My guild is just a tad bit better off than yours from the sound of things(level and classwise) and we pushed a 52 rogue through last weekend(with war/druid/mage/mage/myself). <br />
<br />
It can be done, hang in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, I have a different perspective on how to do this. I usually play a bard, and haven't gotten my L 58 shaman through the trial yet. So with that word of caution, here's my advice. First of all, that group should be able to do it. <br />
<br />
1) If you're struggling, get DS potions for everyone. The extra damage WILL help. When you get to the later mobs in each wave, they've taken a little damage, and will die quicker. This is helpful if your nukers are getting low mana. DS up everyone with your mage or druid. <br />
<br />
2) The mage can banish the rock guys with a single cast. This counts as killing one. If you can, leave a rock guy up each wave, and if you get down close to the wire, the mage can banish a virtually unhurt mob. This virtually guarantees beating that wave, as long as you don't have a death. Druids can do the same thing. Take both classes as your nukers and any wave with a rock guy in it should be nearly trivial. <br />
<br />
3) Fundamental change in tactics. I disagree with some of the other posters about how to do this. Mez? Totally unnecessary. ONLY the main tank getting aggro? Totally unnecessary, and counterproductive, if you're using the DS strategy I mentioned above. You have a cleric, a shaman, AND a paladin. You have backup healing up the wazoo. This means that it should NOT matter if you or the cleric get aggro. If you have a big DS, this is good! And if there's an emergency, you have a paladin to lay hands. Back at L 61/62 when PoP had just come out, my bard and my wife's cleric got a LOT of people through this trial. We did it over and over back when very few people were winning. We were generally averaging L 61.5, with an average of 40-50 AA's, some people less (like the cleric).  The key was that my wife's cleric wasn't afraid of aggro. She'd heal, she'd end up with a couple mobs beating on her, she'd live until we got to them. She could keep herself alive even if she was the only healer, usually. I'd mez at most one mob, as that could be done quickly. But even with 4 unmezzables she'd make it. So it isn't THAT hard to keep a healer alive. If it is, get some AC on that cleric. As the cleric, I'd suggest a self-HOT as soon as the mobs spawn, then a heal on the shaman after the Tigir's. Then spam heal of self if needed. I'm not sure it will be needed much, if the Tigir's did well. <br />
<br />
Anyway... this weakens the DS strategy, but I'd use Tigir's Insects as your only CC for each wave. 4 Spawn. Arrange positioning so they all rush the tank. You Tigir's. Typically you'll affect 3, making keeping the healers alive pretty damn easy at that point. The tank will have aggro from one, and you and the cleric can bounce aggro around from the others with heals as needed. The Tank will need basically no healing, since he'll likely have one slowed mob on him. The 3 melees can all beat on one target, plus the mage pet. The mage can banish if needed. Finally... since you've AE slowed, and you and/or the cleric have signiificant aggro from heals... the mage can AE. They have some NASTY PB AE and targetted AE spells. The use of AE nukes in this trial is INVALUABLE. If the mage can drop a couple AE's while you're killing the first mob, the others are all down SIGNIFICANT HPs when you get to them. And the melees and two pets can down them fast enough even without nukes, if mana is low. As a shaman, you can try AE rains if you have time/mana, depending on how much you or the cleric is getting pounded. <br />
<br />
The last time I did this trial, with my bard, I just AE slowed constantly, along with the group DS/resist song. I didn't mez at all. We did it easily, but our group was higher powered than yours will be. <br />
<br />
It's hard to know WHY you're losing, since you didn't say anything about what's going wrong.  But, some more random bits of advice: keep MR as high as possible on everyone. Melees getting slowed will hurt you badly. Someone (probably you, maybe the cleric) has to be ready to cure slows as fast as possible. If someone gets slowed, they have to announce it immediately, and you have to cure it as quickly as possible. This is the area my bard makes a group shine, as his resist song means no one is ever slowed, unless I let the song drop from my twist. <br />
<br />
Ok, that's a good tip too: Get a bard if you can. If he twists Psalm of Veeshan, Melody of Mischief, and wind of Marr he's gonna make things a LOT easier. His low-resist AE slow means he'll have a fair amount of aggro, and even if he doesn't the healers will be only getting hit by 45% slowed mobs. Makes it easy for the druid/magician/wizard to AE nuke. DON'T get a bard who's going to waste his time mez'ing.<br />
<br />
One final caveat: Mezzing can work perfectly well if you have a good mez'r, and the rest of the group is high DPS. But I really don't like that style here. If you have a chanter, AE stunlock and bring a couple AE nukers. If you have a bard, have him AE slow/dot, group resist buff, and suck up the hits. If you don't have either, you AE slow and backup heal. So at least 4 of the other characters can focus purely on damage dealing. <br />
<br />
Well, I guess that's enough without some more specific questions. Guess I got going on this one. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Onte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes on Tigir's - do not bother slowing anything with Turgur's except maybe the final mob.  It's all going to mitigate slow anyway.  All mobs in the trial except for the final mob have very, very low hp.  Lay down the damage.  Mage Banishment = happy.  Do not sit at any time, especially between waves.  <br />
<br />
I did this at 60, in a full group of 60s.  It's 100% doable by your group, man.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Meogurr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Another thing to try is have someone bring in a DC pet for added DPS.  Dru's can bring in rats, ench's can use sentrys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Another great way to use the DS strategy and is very sound and I always found with a good bard it was pretty easy.  I never used any type of slow (slow hurts the ability for the DS to do more damage) in the trial when my group was successful (except the boss mob), just let the bard slow and get agro on all but the one the group is beating on, let the cleric keep the main tank up and you help keep the bard up.  Make sure the bard and main tank have DS potions + any DS they can get otherwise.  Nuke when getting close or if you have the mana, each mob.<br />
<br />
As each mob dies the next will have less hp since he was being beat down by the DS, typically the last mob we fought had just above half hp which makes them extremlely fast kills.  The bard also has the option of charming a mob to help with dps then releasing once the other 3 mobs are dead.<br />
<br />
If you want to keep your current group, figure out what isnt working and why you failed (not killing fast enough, people dying, etc) and adjust, maybe you could nuke more?  You using your pet?  Help the cleric heal better?, etc.  I dont think adding an enchanter to the group will be helpful unless you remove yourself.  War Pal Mnk Mag certainly looks like enough dps to me but if its close maybe swap out one of the non dps out (war/pal) for another dps.  Once you find a sucessful group you can swap out 2 people at a time usually and pass them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i managed to wing the exe the first time with a 65 shm (firsttime), 65 pally, 62 wiz, 63clr, a monk and 1 other(i forget what but wasnt mage/dru/bst).<br />
<br />
we stood in a corner, let pally take aggro ..drop in an ae slow, all mobs moved to me except one, I tanked all 3-5 on me while they focused on the other one.  kept Q on myself and I was dandy.  Cleric would try to heal me, and i'd lose aggro and hafta heal the clr and then regain aggro (used Spear of torment with 1.5-2 sec shaved from cast time to regain aggro on each mob).<br />
<br />
We finished with plenty of mana left over, and no deaths...went smoothly and quickly.  Pally would pluck mobs from me when he finished each previous.  had plenty of time between waves for minor med breaks for the wiz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's just a minor point, but twice now someone has referred to a possibility of having up to 6 mobs at once (eg the previous poster referring to having 5 on him due to healing, so assuming one is on the tank that's 6). <br />
<br />
Those people probably just haven't done it in a long time, so don't remember. But it's not 5 or 6. It's 4. Just four per wave, so at most 3 to go after the healers, assuming the tank hold aggro on one. Still something to deal with, but not really as hard as 5 would be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Mmm...tis been awhile since I did exe and I thought I saw 5 or 6...could have easily been mistaken.  /shrug<br />
<br />
Thanks for the correction though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Get a good pally tank.  Group heals are nice aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">1. Make some damage shield potions, apply to all.<br />
2. Get the mage to make you a nuke focus bracer and DS you all.<br />
3. Cleric uses elixir heals only to avoid aggro.<br />
4. Nuke like hell and assist healing if vital.<br />
5. Only slow the end mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Get a pally for tank.  Cleric or Druid to heal.  2 level 65 Wizards.  You and another dps class, mage or wizard prefered.  Dont waste time on a chanter to mez.  Rogues are horrible dps in the trials, takes too long to get behind the mobs and they dont live long enough.  Most monks I have seen cant assist fast enough, I dont know if they just dont pay attention or what.  Dont waste time on a warrior, they typically dont have a good dps weapon.  Rangers are usually fair, but spend too much time thinking while using their crappy bow from a distance makes a difference, rather than using a big 2h weapon up close.  And the majority of rangers dont have 2 really really good 1h weapons. <br />
<br />
Get a set of people to fully buff out the team.  Get a druid or mage to toss on a good DS, and use a DS potion too.<br />
<br />
Set up dogdog with some good mage stuff, and load up some rains or DD spells, and manage your mana.  Have a nice DD spell ready in case its getting close in a round, or use them on named.  Get dogdog assisting MA fast as you can.<br />
<br />
The reason I chose a pally over an SK for tank, is for stuns.  The stuns are very nice.  And the fact they can heal themselves some, can save some healing aggro off your main healer.<br />
<br />
Also, dont waste time banishing mobs.  Waste time, mana and plat.<br />
<br />
We have flagged shaman, or any class down to level 56 or so no problem.  Even flagged a 58 mage, with only a 65 druid, pally, wiz, wiz.  There was a ranger there to help, but couldnt pay attention well enough to get on the platform and got left behind.  Even with 5, it was never close to a failure.<br />
<br />
And very very important.  When you get to the PE, your healer will usually be low on mana and the PE will need to be kited.  He has an AE that will aggro pets, you gotta back them off over and over, so they dont put him into summon mode while kiting.  If you cant do that, dump the pet when you get to the PE.<br />
<br />
When I passed, my shaman was 61, druid was main healer and died at end of last wave.  Shaman was healer for the PE, which was very exciting.  It was my first trial ever, but I didnt waste time trying trials with pickup groups either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Rogues are horrible dps in the trials<br />
<br />
:rolleyes:  um what??<br />
<br />
Rogues fill the dps spots pretty well actually, usually dont need to heal them and they have no mana issues, in many trials I have been behind the mobs and mashing the assist key for the next mob long before the main assist even has a target, even the fast ones and rogues do pretty decent dps, even if they are still using thier epic main hand compared to other melee classes equivalently equipped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I reiterate, rogues are horrible dps in trials.  They have to assist the MA, they then have to figure out which mob is targeted.  Then they usually move around behind the mob.  Easily 10 seconds of dps lot.  When the mob must die in 40 seconds or you fail, that is very significant.  Especially if its an average equipped rogue, who only does about 100 dps in the first place.  That is why being caster heavy has higher success rates, compared to mostly melee in the trials.  You can lose 10 seconds on every mob, just trying to get into position to start doing good dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I don't believe that argument. If someone plays badly then your scenario is likely accurate, but a good Trial team will have a tank who immediately targets the nearest mob and starts swinging, each time a new target is required. Everyone else, immediately assists the tank and looks right in front of him. They're not hitting the mob, without ever having to figure out which is it. THEN a competent rogue will sidestep around behind the mob. He might not be backstabing for the first few seconds, but he IS hitting it as fast as any other melee class would be. <br />
<br />
And in my experience melee'rs are the best DPS for the trials, if you don't use AE nukers. Of course, I've always done the trials with a bard, which means the mobs virtually never slow anyone. If your melees are getting slowed, THEN they're bad dps and you'll likely lose the trial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Hehehe I played a Rog to 65, and pushed peeps through the trials a few times.  If thats the case with the Rogs you group with Mardark, then they suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Agreed, my rogue was one of the first called every time trials were being attempted and we were a lot more successful than not and now that Im 65 I have yet to fail, rogues make excellent trail dps and if you choose not to use them you are shooting yourslef in the foot and at the time I was using my epic main hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Ditto about my rog with Epic in main hand, /shrug.  I guess even sucky Rogs are ok Dps, hehehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Also, if you are going heavy on melees in the group, make sure to get +atk buffs.  This means your haste should be speed of vallon, and you should have spirit of the predator and strength of tunare on the melees, regardless of whether or not you have an enchanter or a ranger actually in the group; get them from someone else.<br />
<br />
Summon your pet, give him mage toys, buff him up, etc., outside the trial room.  When you enter the trial, cast summon companion to bring him over to you.  Or, if you have suspended minion 2, then you really don't need me to tell you what to do.<br />
<br />
Assuming you have a cleric for healing, try to keep the mobs off of them, unless they are well equipped.  Poorly equipped clerics go down really fast.<br />
<br />
Trials can be tough for shamans, because slow isn't very useful, and their dps is rather low.  Your best bet is just to keep yourself torpored and keep mobs off the cleric / main healer with slow (one situation where slow IS useful). <br />
<br />
The trials were designed for an &quot;average&quot; group of level 62s.  They are not hard.  Just keep plugging away and you'll get them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Unfortunately there's no magic formula for the trials.  When I passed I was the only healer.  My group was (all others 65 except me at 60):<br />
<br />
war<br />
bard<br />
mage<br />
rog<br />
wiz<br />
shm (me)<br />
<br />
We had a ton of dps and smart players for quick targeting which probably was the key.  I would torpor myself and the bard, try and slow one or two of the mobs, and use kraggs on the war when he needed it.  The last fight was pretty rough because we decided not to kite.  The mag and wiz ended up burning towards the end.<br />
<br />
I had tried before while using tigirs and that really doesn't work well at all.  Basically you just need lots of damage, a good tank, and somebody to cc quickly.</div></div><hr />
