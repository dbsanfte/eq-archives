<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sunsetgirl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone experienced issues going into a dungeon?  I've had many successful trips into dungeons before but for some reason when our grp got our adventure when we went to enter we got a message similiar to this: A strange magicial power exisists and it is to dangerous to enter at this time.  So we tried leaving that adventure and starting a new one some where else.  The same thing happened again.  Then we started disbanding each other one at a time thinking it was us and still the same thing.  We were all in the range of 56-61 and each of us had been to a dungeon before.   Just wondering if any of you have had this problem and what was said to you.  GM told me I was bugged and I don't believe that because that would have meant the whole grp was too.  Any ideas??? <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
