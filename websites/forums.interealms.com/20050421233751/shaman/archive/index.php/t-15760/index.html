<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Amphybius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hya folks...any suggestions for this duo?  (2-boxing that is)<br />
<br />
I have had a blast as of late going with this combo and my warrior is pretty tastefully dressed.  <br />
<br />
That said, where should I head to now that my shaman is 49?<br />
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Duneons that are well grouped are Karnors, Droga/nurgra, and on to some of the lower level planes. just a few starters for ya.</div></div><hr />

Is Droga/Nurga doable these days with this combo?  I haven't been since the upgraded, but heard it could be nasty.</div></div><hr />

Think of revamped Droga mobs like this: They hit like wussies ( 250ish from the level 60 mobs ) but they have the hps of planes mobs. I would estimate most mobs here have 15k+ hps. I could stick a slow on most of the reds even at 48, but that's kind of pointless if it takes your warrior 15 minutes to kill one. I 2-boxed my shammy here with a 55 warrior in a group ( 60 chanter, 65 cleric, 60 rogue, 65 rogue ) and mobs still took over a minute each to kill. If you can get your friends to come down, I would suggest it. On a better note, Droga exp is KILLER...55 war got 3 gold in about 3 hours and shaman went from no noticeable color in 48 to ding 49. Also, the split between 6 people ( with chanter ML ) was 543pp each. Hope this info helps.</div></div><hr />
