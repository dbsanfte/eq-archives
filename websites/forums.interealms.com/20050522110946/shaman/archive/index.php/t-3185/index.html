<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I saw this picture on innoruuk.com, not sure if its real, but looks it...<br />
<br />

<br />
Is where its posted.<br />
<br />
Is it real? I don't know but it looks like the guy is either faking itcause of the green armor, or its some troll w/ the 1 charge halfling mask.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If it is real, it was MQ'ed and had faction parts repeated (obviously)<br />
<br />
Wouldn't really toss a &quot;grats&quot; out for that, but the creativity of having a level 20 assling shaman with an epic...<br />
I don't know whether to flame him or chuckle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When using the halfling mask, do you show up as a halfling under race?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes, you do. But if you do a &quot;/w all&quot; you would show as your real race.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">can a barbarian do the halfling quest ? i got the head .. maxed the 3 factions with wine <br />
<br />
the quest giver is on 4 factions ... 2 i cant raise .. 1 is maxed .. and the other i need to kill a 3000 mobs in mistmore to get ally<br />
also using the haven necklace(doubt the pos helps but cant hurt) <br />
he cons threating atm .. hope to do it at dubious w/ new invis trick<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
well im off to kill 3000 green mobs .. probly still wont work .. but hey it will keep me busy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sepisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Cant use the mask.  Only DE Human Troll.  Must equip to use the effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've maintained for a long, long time, that I could get a level 1 shaman their epic (although with the xp for turn-ins, they would finish higher than first level). The only MQ you would need to do would be the fear Tear. You wouldn't even have to do much faction, since it is only the turn-in of the Tear that the L1 could not do themself.<br />
<br />
Verant really needs to fix the hole in the dropped items between Neh'Ashiir, and the child. If you had to get something from her to turn in to the child to respawn it, people would not longer be able to shortcut the quest (at least, not as easily as is done now).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">VI should just make Rak return a ND item that needs to be combined with the scale and then turned into the lake spirit to prevent a MQ.  This way you won't get anyone under 47 with a spear because of the PoF level limit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Great, now Verant is going to nerf this quest before I even have a chance to complete it ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm not sure how fixing the gaping hole in the quest that allows level 20s to walk around with the shaman epic counts as a &quot;nerf.&quot;  Kinda cheapens the epic if a level 20 can get it, don't you think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">hahah, thats some funny shnitz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Heck the quest used to be even EASIER.<br />
<br />
Remember when the Child was an insta-spawn in Fear? Sure you do. You were the first Shaman to get their Spear then moan and complain about how &quot; easy &quot; the Epic has become.<br />
<br />
If a level 1 has his Epic, more power to him. <br />
<br />
Getting your panties in a wad over someone else's pixels in a game is counter-productive and downright perverse.<br />
<br />
If you are affected in any way, shape, or form by someone else's pointer to a database you have bigger problems than a concern over the Epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">And getting your panties in a wad about my panties in a wad? <br />
<br />
You think cheating the shaman epic is fine, and I don't, that's all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Probably was a level one but the xp made him level 20 :)<br />
<br />
Dont think you can use the epic till 45 though (not sure on this)m still an excellent weapon and stat enchancer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Epics don't work until level 50.<br />
<br />
People under level 50 getting epics doesn't bother me in the least.  It's their right to do the MQ's, it's no one's right to complain about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I dont even have my booties yet :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It's definitely real for those doubting.  That's just Swall's twink.  <br />
<br />
I'm sitting on a Tear, and I could do the same for any level 1 shaman on Innoruuk who bothered to faction up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hey Gart, I'm on inny ;) <br />
<br />
Yah, the tear is the only hard part, so its not that hard to belivie.</div></div><hr />
