<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The Odulus Death Shroud is doing a fine job of saving me mana on spells I cast ... but I am getting more and more paranoid watching it flicker while I Cannibalize.<br />
<br />
Cannibalize doesn't take mana - it makes mana.  Is the ODS making less mana when I Cann?  The hp message is a steady 74 hp of damage ...<br />
<br />
Can someone suggest a test procedure, to see if I /we get more/same/less mana with Canni with a mana preservation item flickering on us?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Boogaba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Agree with Baz.<br />
<br />
Just how the game is coded, it is trying to save you a percentage of mana of that zero mana cost.  That is how I interpreted it anyway.  It should have no effect on how much mana you gain per canni.<br />

What he's saying is that Cannibalize is the only type of spell we have where the outcome and result of casting the spell is a gain of mana.  Every other spell (the heals and buffs you mentioned, for instance) produce some type of effect at the cost of a certain amount of mana.<br />
<br />
The point of it is: if Cannibalize 3 is a zero mana cost spell, there's no reason to believe the ODS should be triggered when casting it.  He's suggesting that perhaps it's having the reverse effect - who knows, maybe it is, there aren't any other spells we have that are zero mana cost (that I know of, anyway) so it could be an anamoly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Having the ODS trigger when casting Canny to try to reduce the mana cost (even though it is zero) makes far more sense than having it NOT trigger. Making it not trigger would require an extra check every single time someone with a Mana Preservation item cast a spell. That adds up. Having it trigger does nothing harmful so there is absolutely NO reason to put in a check and waste processing cycles for it.</div></div><hr />
