<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>xoxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm level 41 and I just found out about the 33% exp bonus in Paludal Caverns. This is exciting. I created a rogue, pushed him through to lvl 8 and then brought him up. It only took me a few days of casual play to get him to 18 and I'm sure that 25 is not far off. <br />
<br />
My question: Where are other zones that have excellent exp bonuses for level 41? <br />
<br />
(I used the search function but couldn't find anything recent that included Luclin and POP zones). <br />
<br />
Even though I'm not high enough to enter Planes, I'd still like to know about recent experience bonus changes. <br />
<br />
Any known info would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Crystal Caverns in Velious , Kaesora in kunark , i dunno there is quite a few actualy<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This is from memory:<br />
<br />
At 41 - Kedge (25% +)<br />
At 45 - LoIo (13%)<br />
At 50 - CoM (13%)<br />
At 51 - Hole (25%)<br />
At 53 - Howling Stones (17%)<br />
<br />
IIRC all dungeons have some sort of modifier, but I do seem to remember both LoIO and HS were nerfed. Sebilis probably does have a modifier too - but at 53 you can head to PoI / PoN / PoD and the modifiers there are outrageous. (Read 150% for PoN)</div></div><hr />
