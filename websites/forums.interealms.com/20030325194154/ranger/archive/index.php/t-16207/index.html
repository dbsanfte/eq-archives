<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MeeChuSUh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">in Everfrost Peak,   the mammoths drop mammoth tusks that sell for 9pp at vendors, i dont see many mammoths so i kill baby mammoths, do you know how much the baby mammoth tusks sell for? thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Baby Mammoth tusks only for about 6-8 gold.  Keep killing the big Mammoths.  They're out there, just a fair amount of competition for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blythar Jones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Begin your hunt in the y formed by the river.  <br />
pos 1200 neg 4800 or so is a good place to set up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Azareal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They spawn near the Ramp near the river (South side ?). The Ramp basically look likes a broken down temple. This is not to be confused with the temple that has the orcs (Redwind ?).<br />
<br />
Be careful when you pull on pop though. I once pulled 2 when they both popped on the same spot and I couldn't tell that there were 2 on the same spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hendrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you see no Mammoth's up, start killing them spiders (forget name) as they are the Mammoth PH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samanthie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yes hon.  If no mamies kill the big spiders.  Collect the silks and wait for your mamies to pop.  Kill the wandering polarbear cub/liittle goblin that spawns by Permafrost.<br />
<br />
If you are level 30, consider getting a partner and camping Quillimane in SK forst and get a peg cloak.  I still use mine (pre level 65 :-( -- millions of bat wings saved and you never take all that little damage running along the uneven terrain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Levotas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What is a good lvl to start killing the big mammoths?  I am currently at lvl 18 but can get some more lvls all though im trying to save enough for SCHW right now.....:mad: so far only 1400pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Doubt you could do the big Mammoths on your own before 22 - the key is Panic Animal. And even the, you'll want only white or maybe yellow cons - a few of the latter chewed me up when I got a resist or two.  Best is in your mid-20s, probably, although some folks seem to suggest late 20s/early 30s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Levotas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thx for help  :(  too bad i got tired of saving for SCHW.... i dont have very food patience (spelling?) just bought a lammy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tathagata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Umm actually I dont believe the mammoths have any PH's at all.<br />
I have farmed many mammoths many many times. I still do it at times (level 50 now).<br />
Mammoths dont all spawn in any one spot, there seems to be about 6 spawn points ranging from near permafrost, near Megans tower, near the decrepit ramp and behing the large hill  at the very end of the river.<br />
Mammoths dont have any placeholders, and while Ive never timed them I would say about 20 min timers on them. Ive been the only one in zone on a few occaisons and killed nothing but mammoths and still had them keep spawning regularly.<br />
Kill the cub/goblin near perma to make Matar or his brother spawn, but dont try to take them until you are about 30 (from memory).<br />
<br />
The lowest char I have seen killing mammoths was a 15 shaman, it took him about 20 minutes each mammoth, but he did it, about 4 times that I saw with no deaths. Ranger should be able to do them when you get Panic Animal but they will be tough, be careful. Probably best to begin there at about 24/25.<br />
I have seen a group of 4 (ranger, druid, wiz and maybe warrior? not real sure now) all of level 18 try to do mammoths and had a VERY hard time of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>magimix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The only problem I found with the Mammoths in EF (to echo a previous comment) is that they are mobs that become fully exploited very quickly.  Basically, a single L30 Ranger (for example) could very easily hog all the Mammoths in the zone - they don't spawn very quickly.  Therefore, if you go into a zone and there is already a tracking class hunting them, it may be hard to get a look in.<br />
<br />
They spawn all over the class, and trackers 'own' them :-)<br />
<br />
However, the loot is great.  I levelled from 30-32 in EF, and made about 1000PP in the process - all from Tusks.  Also, even at L30 odd, the XP was *very* good indeed for the degree of risk involved (basically zero risk, assuming you know how to manage any adds to stumble across you when fighting).</div></div><hr />
