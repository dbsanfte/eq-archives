<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Katla SZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there exp to be found in Shar Vahl somewhere?<br />
<br />
The most obvious guards are not worth it for exp, I guess they count as newbie guards and take forever to kill... but in most cities there are at least some guards (or others) that can be killed for exp. Anyone found that spot in Shar Vahl yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Katla SZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ack... so many views and no replys, I guess that means noone has found any nice exp-spot in Shar Vahl. Alas, I haven't either yet...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">many folk find it to be very laggy(erm slow framerate)  thats one factor in putting folks off.<br />
<br />
i guess neg faction would be offset with kiling grimplings ???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've had a hard time max allying with shar vahl. And I'm vah shir, and I killed loda kai soldiers (the only true enemies of the vah shir) in the hundreds. And did several quests. <br />
<br />
I'm ally, but not max.<br />
<br />
So I'd be wary of trashing shar vahl unless you truely never ever want to shop there again. And it's the only place on the moon you can get a complete set of shaman newbie spells.<br />
<br />
I think another problem is there aren't many secluded spots. Most of the soldiers come in 2's, and there are many soldiers inside rooms up above you, so you could get aggro and a hell of a train if you're kos.<br />
<br />
I've never seen anyone soloing there, and that's my main tradeskill city. But let me know how it goes :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goredan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You know, I've been wondering about this for along time. People kill in Katta and in Seru, but nobody has killed in Shar Vahl that I know of. I think once I hit 58 I'll go and try it out a bit with some friends and see how it goes. Maybe we'll get lucky.</div></div><hr />
