<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How do I find out what all PoP zones I've completed? It's been  a while, and at 64, almost 65, I'm being invited to the higher teirs and want to find out more information on doing the flagging. I've done a few, PoN, PoD, the one that I have to zone into CoD to finish... no PoJ's yet *sighs*.. PoI is done to.  Now I just need to find out what I need to do to finish and be able to progress up to the higher planes.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Click my sig. It's under 'Flags'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm.. That works..but I know I'm flagged for more than just the 2 I had checked.  *shrugs* Thank ya Samanna.  Will just have to keep tryin for more flags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Patzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">To to the seer in PoK (Near PoT stone) hail her and say Guided Meditation, she will tell you what you have already ... go from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just attending boss mob kills and hailing the projection does not always flag you. There is often before and after hails and chats that need to be done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks! will check tonight and see what I have, and what I have to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I haven't used this in a while, but I still have http://samanna.net/general/popflagparser.exe - you'll want to save it somewhere, rename your EQ log, turn logging on, hail the seer, window or log out, and run the parser against that log. <br />
<br />
I just ran it again on an old log, and it works for me. I need to chat up the seer again. Guess I should link and credit that... anyone remember where it came from?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Still works:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Oohh that is nice, would love to have that! I did a search and nothing came up that looked like that.  <br />
<br />
I found out last night I need to go hail a couple NPC's and that will add 2 more flags to my list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Um, right-click the link in my post above and download it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Youichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Samanna, it was originally posted on the Safehouse, by Eqsunil.<br />
<br />
See THIS THREAD (http://p208.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=14240.topic) <br />
<br />
And it seems there is a version 1.04 also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Woot, thanks - I'll update stuff tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">LOL, How bad is it when someone has to write a 3rd party program to tell you what you have done and what you havent for pop flags? I knew it was insanly complex trying to remember everything you had done and all of the 50000000 npcs you have to talk to and  follow 57 text [hints] to get your pre/post flags. <br />
(not adding anything I just think thats funny as hell)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well, yeah. It is pretty bad. But remember, none of this was provided by Sony, we (as a community) were supposed to figure it out. Just like the new Epic quests.<br />
<br />
ps, update made, eqsunil is credited, thanks.</div></div><hr />
