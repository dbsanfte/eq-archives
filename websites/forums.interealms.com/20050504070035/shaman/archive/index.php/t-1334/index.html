<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I heard from a bird...(but I ate the bird)...<br />
<br />
there was a way to make money off of bone chips (above and beyond simply selling them to the vendor)<br />
<br />
Im a 9 Shammy in FoB with about 200 chips...what is the quest (or the money making secret)?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
BTW, thanks to a certain Shammy for offloading about 50pp worth of goodies on me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't know the details, but you make money with the bone chips by selling them to higher level players who use the bone chips to raise their faction in Cabilis (hope that's sorta right). I don't know who you turn the bone chips into for the quest, but that's how you make money with bone chips. Oftentimes, it's worth it to a high-level character to buy bone chips (or batwings or whatever else) rather than farm them as it's so time-consuming otherwise. Hopefully, someone else will fill in the details. Sorry my explanation is so sketchy, but I haven't done any hunting in that area. Hope I've been able to help you some, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sell them for the faction quest or to necros for their pets, our dogdog doesn't chew bones.<br />
<br />
Just look for out of level range peeps in FoB and ask them if they need any bone chips. It would not be an Iksar for the faction quest but it could be an Iksar Necro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Trooper Mozo (?) near Cabilis entrance accepts bonechips in stacks of 4 (four) to increase cabilis factions (all except necros). Higher level monks will often pay up to 5 pp per stack (20) of Bonechips, as they can now do the Whistling Fists quest.<br />
<br />
Hope that helped ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Snowgoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I can remember the name, but its the guard on the right side of the gate when you come from FoB that you can give the bone chips to.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Draznar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As a newbie Iksar Shaman, is it worth doing this quest or is my factions good enough?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Your starting factions should be ok... just sell them to outlanders who want to work their way into Cabilis...<br />
<br />
On my monk, I even had scouts in Kurn's tower to tell people that I'm buying bonechips in horrendous amounts ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's Trooper Mozo.  He has four slots; put a bones in each of the four, or put up to four in each of the four slots, and you get faction raises for every set of four.  Monks trying to do whistling fists quest like to buy bones, but plenty of other people do, so they can all get non-KOS in Cabilis.  <br />
<br />
4 or 5 plat per stack of 20 is pretty standard.  Get plenty of backpacks full, and even drop the bonestacks somewhere very out of the way and safe and pick them up on an alt in cabilis to store up extras, if you get full up.  People are thrilled to be able to buy 5 or 10 or 20 stacks at a time; their alternative is to spend sometimes a solid week in Kurns killing green skeletons to get bone chips.<br />
<br />
Take a tour of the vendors inside Cabilis and outside, too.  They often have bone chips on them, too.  <br />
<br />
Heck, I even give Trooper Mozo some bones sometimes with my iksar monk.  Iksars don't even have too good faction in their own city!</div></div><hr />
