&lt;h3&gt;A RED Dragon Lies Beneath!&lt;/h3&gt;<br />
&lt;/a&gt;<br />
I took the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocities.com/teo592/quiz/dragon.html&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Inner Dragon online quiz&lt;/a&gt; and found out I am a Red Dragon on the inside. Remember Smaug? Yep, Red Dragon. Oh, my friend I'm in good company. Red dragons are the most vile and crafty of all the dragons. They are also the most dangerous of all dragons. As such they are the Fire Elemental dragons. Reds have a nasty tendency towards luring you in with quiet words and soft emotions, then wrapping their scaly tails around you and biting off your puny little human head. Fun, no?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />
<br />
But of course, Reds aren't all about killing and treasure hoarding. I like to invent creative traps, relax in the mouths of volcanoes, fly over vast forests looking for men ...er... sheep (&lt;i&gt;yeah...&lt;/i&gt;), and pick fights. My favorable attributes are Summer, the sword, fire, courage, passion, will power, and leadership. If dragons went to war, they'd rally behind me in a snap. Well, me or a Copper Dragon. But those Coppers are wusses anyway, and I could beat one up to take command. In fact, I probably would considering my breath weapon is good old fashioned Fire, and plenty of it. Oh it's good to be the king.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />

&lt;h3&gt;A WHITE Dragon Lies Beneath!&lt;/h3&gt;<br />
&lt;/a&gt;<br />
I took the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocities.com/teo592/quiz/dragon.html&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Inner Dragon online quiz&lt;/a&gt; and found out I am a White Dragon on the inside. If there ever was an apparition of balance, power and reclusive intelligence, my Inner Dragon is it. Whites are a fairly common dragon and are considered one of two harmonious dragons. My anti-thesis is the evil Black Dragon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />
<br />
My Inner Dragon likes to think things out, plot against enemies, and look down upon the world from the highest mountain peaks. My favorable attributes are the Day, the Sun, truth, a positive attitude, and helpful magic. Humans only need fear me when they stray into my domain without proper tribute. Of course, that tribute would probably be a cake the size of a Volkswagen, but hey, if they wanted to move through my turf they should have brought it, right? If someone ever really wanted a fight I'd be an impressive opponent, considering I pack a breath weapon combination of Fire and Lightning. Even the nicest dragons can do some serious damage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</div></div><hr />

 If there ever was an apparition of Evil to strike terror into the hearts of man and beast, your Inner Dragon is it. Blackies are a fairly common dragon and are considered<br />

<br />
 But of course, being a Blacky on the inside you couldn't care less about that religion garbage. You like to chomp things, cause trouble, make off with people's significant others, and so on and so forth. Your favorable attributes are night, the Moon, the stars, dreams, psychic guidance, balancing Karma, seeking truth, and helpful dark<br />
 magic. Everybody's still got to watch out for you though, because deep down you like to smite at random and have a nasty breath weapon combination of Fire and Acid.<br />

&lt;h3&gt;A COPPER Dragon Lies Beneath!&lt;/h3&gt;<br />
&lt;/a&gt;<br />
I took the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocities.com/teo592/quiz/dragon.html&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Inner Dragon online quiz&lt;/a&gt; and found out I am a Copper Dragon on the inside. My Inner Dragon is the mighty warrior of dragon-kind. It's just that simple. Coppers show up when someone's about to die. Coppers don't mess around, and they don't play evil games like Red Dragons. They don't bother with magic, like Gold Dragons. They just mess things up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />
<br />
But what sort of a dragon would I be if that really was the whole story? I also like to stomp my enemies, start the occasional war, and spend lazy hours preening my battle aura. My favorable attributes are strength, physical abilities, thriftiness, warmth, and longevity in battle. Just in case some puny human (or coniving Red Dragon) thinks they can get the drop on me, I've got a concealed breath weapon - gigantic masses of Fire. Hey, it's the tried and true way to cook a cow in 0.75 seconds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kindonini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/sigh<br />
Where do you all find these things?? hehe<br />

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocities.com/teo592/dragon.html&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;h3&gt;A BLUE Dragon Lies Beneath!&lt;/h3&gt;<br />
&lt;/a&gt;<br />
I took the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocities.com/teo592/dragon.html&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Inner Dragon online quiz&lt;/a&gt; and found out I am a Blue Dragon on the inside. If there ever was a draconic example of a supple attitude, my Inner Dragon is it. Blues are the Water Elemental dragon - typified by their Steam breath weapon. Pretty creative, huh? It goes right along with my Inner Dragon's tendency to maim, but not destroy. Much like my native oceans and rivers will deform the rock over time, eventually wearing it away to nothing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />
<br />
Humans shouldn't make the mistake of thinking I'm weak, however. After all I'm a good 30 feet in length and have a penchant for materializing out of any body of water, no matter how small. I also enjoy communicating with aquatic lifeforms, hunting in totally inhospitable terrain (i.e. 3000 feet below the waves), and using my fluid nature to my advantage. My enemies probably won't even see me approach in the first place. My favorable attributes are the sunset, Autumn, water, compassion, intuition, and calmness. Naturally, I pity the fool who'd try and prove that calmness part, he'd probly wind up being scalded. *small grin*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</div></div><hr />

&lt;h3&gt;A GOLD Dragon Lies Beneath!&lt;/h3&gt;<br />
&lt;/a&gt;<br />
I took the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocities.com/teo592/quiz/dragon.html&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Inner Dragon online quiz&lt;/a&gt; and found out I am a Gold Dragon on the inside. My Inner Dragon is the most honorable of all. Golds are the third rarest of all the dragons (after Platinum and Chromatic dragons) and have a station in society that reflects their rarity. I am what one might call a Draconic Knight. Golds live by a strict code of chivalry and commitment. Remember Draco? Yep, Gold Dragon. My appearance is fearsome and all-mighty but I'd never stoop so low as to bring any harm to a human. I'm one of only two dragon types that are aligned &quot;Lawful Good&quot; and demonstrate great magical proficiency. My piety, beauty, wisdom, and inner strengrth are absolutely without parallel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />
<br />
Of course, being a Gold  Dragon isn't all high ethics and codes. I like to fly around scaring things, advise humans in their affairs, and shapeshift. Strike that, I &lt;b&gt;LOVE&lt;/b&gt; to shapeshift. And I'm great at it. In fact, who's to say I'm not really a Gold Dragon after all? My favorable attributes are honor, truth, kindness, gold, wisdom, bravery, and trustworthiness. If anyone threatens or tries to kill me, I could strike back with my breath weapon - Fire. But then, no one's tried anything that stupid in the last couple thousand years. After all, I'm about 54 feet long.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</div></div><hr />

&lt;h3&gt;A GREEN Dragon Lies Beneath!&lt;/h3&gt;<br />
&lt;/a&gt;<br />
I took the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocities.com/teo592/quiz/dragon.html&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Inner Dragon online quiz&lt;/a&gt; and found out I am a Green Dragon on the inside. My Inner Dragon is the embodiment of Nature and the Earth. Greens spend almost all of their time below the canopy or just above the treetops in tropical rain forests. Not a bad life considering every other creature in the forest looks up to me, figurativly and literally. I speak the language of every animal and plant in my domain and know most of them by first name. If people mess with my forests, I'm more than happy to wail on their puny butts. Because of my protector/caretaker role, I am the Earth Elemental dragon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />
<br />
Naturally my whole life pretty much revolves around the other couple million species I keep an eye on, but that's not my whole dragon. I also like to like to impose my steadfast will on others, commune with Nature, and lobby governments for alternative fuels and conservation. My favorable attributes are gemstones, mountains, caves, soil, respect, endurance, responsibility, prosperity, and purpose in life. Folks shouldn't get the idea I'm a hippy push-over though, because my breath weapon is a nasty Fire/Acid combination. Maybe I should invest in a hemp shirt reading &quot;Don't knock my smock, or I'll clean your clock.&quot; *wink*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</div></div><hr />
