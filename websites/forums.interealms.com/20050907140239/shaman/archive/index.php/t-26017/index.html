Looks like this is now stacking with Champion on Test. Could prove to be VERY interesting if they let it go live this way.<br />
<br />
Am I reading this wrong? I clicked stacking on both ToMight and Champion, and didn't see them listed under one another - although SoMight remains unchanged. Thoughts?<br />
<br />
If it does go live this way, it looks like Sony has decided to make us the group damage boosters, between this and Panther/Leopard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That is a role I would be quite willing to fulfill personally (though I'd prefer the buff portion of it to NOT be something with supershort recast timers).<br />
<br />
  I like the idea of being able to raise the DPS of the group and drop the DPS of the target.  Sorta gives a godlike control to maintain balance of the cosmos (or tilt it in your favor if you prefer)... ie- a shaman.<br />
<br />
  Wouldn't mind seeing us get some decent direct to mob attack stuff upgraded, or moving some of this group buffing into a bard window (or a third one, for the low low price of tons of AA!)<br />
<br />
The big question will be if this same adjustment is made to our focus line.  If all they did was move the slots for this particular buff, it may mean that you can stack those 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As far as I can tell, all they did is to change the slot. Might and Champion have always &quot;stacked&quot;, it's just that the highest Damage Modifier takes precedence.</div></div><hr />

Which 2? If you were referring to champion and Might, read above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I mean the post 65 STR buff and the post 65 Focus buff<br />
<br />
 (Have been away from game and unable to access Lucy since early OOW, so not even suer that we got both upgraded.  Pretty sure we did though.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Might and Wunshi have been stacking. They don't overlap in any slot as Might doesn't raise Strength and Wunshi has no Damage Modifier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think I know why they changed it... <br />
<br />
Talisman of Might and Champion have always stacked though, so that wouldn't be the reason for the change.<br />
<br />
Pretty sure it's for some other reason.<br />

Anything that's listed there will not stack with each other, therefore any of the melee discs that were used with talisman on it, were immediately overridden.<br />

haha.. he's been like that for a long time.  Really ever since AO officially stopped raiding (and pretty much been in the top 3 since way before that).</div></div><hr />

I pretty much stopped casting might on PC's as it would be removed if they used an offensive disc.  I do buff pets with it sometimes.</div></div><hr />

Is this what you've noticed lately happening or something that you noticed happening a long time ago.  Back when omens first came out, this was the case always.  Everytime that one of them used a melee disc might would get removed.  However, they changed/fixed it for single might a long time ago and I have not heard of anyone complaining about it since.  Group might though is just how I mentioned above.  I have not grouped with a berserker ever so I honestly don't know anything about their melee discs, but I know who it is with all of the other classes in the game for the most part.<br />
<br />
Actually, here is where things changed.  Reading the history of spirit of might, on the Dec 15th patch, they changed it to slot 7, making the single version able to not be overridden by melee discs, but they neglected to fix the group might at the same time.  So, this is all that they are doing is going back and fixing it.  (I have bugged this a few times since I received the spell in Jan, so I'm glad that this change is in effect coming).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Has it been fixed to work on pets? It never worked on puppy when I cast it, but I notice his max hits go up when a Druid cast Lion's on him three weeks after OoW went live.</div></div><hr />
