<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cerdle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all.  It wasn't until I posted on the Hunting Grounds asking for advice on a place to hunt solo that I realised that the thing that is preventing me from doing some of these places was my choice in factions.  I was wondering how important factions are to you in your overall game plan.  Does it change?<br />
<br />
For example, I an an Ogre.  The following are some choices I made for factions.  Any of you in a siliar situation, did you change, and if so was it worth it? <br />
<br />
<br />
VS: So I can bank, buy and use OT Hammer at the Outpost.  I am bound in the nexus which gives access to the major zones, but with OT hammer I am 1 proc (off a soulbinder =P) and 1 zone away from almost every old world city via Firepots.  The downside is I cannot hunt in KC, HS, and a few others<br />
<br />
Giants:  Did that one from a RP standpoint since Ogres and Giants were the children of Rallos Zek.  Then I saw the quest armor and regular quests and liked what I saw.  Downside is my Guild and everyone else I know is on Thurg or CoV faction which means that I cannot do the quest armor.  However, I can do the normal quests like Girdle of Reflection, Circlet of Vallon etc.  And I can do it for the guild which is nice.<br />
<br />
Katta:  I liked the quests in Katta so picked them.  Plus the merchant availability for the skills I use are there.<br />
<br />
<br />
So I guess my main question is, is it easy to flip flop?  I don't know of any VS faction quests or kills to raise it other than the Berzerker braid quest.  So if I lost that one there is no going back.  Your thoughts are appreciated.  Thanks!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just a FYI, I think they made hitting the soulbinder a bannable offense.  Instead of fixing it to actually attack, they'll just lose 10 bucks a month.  WTG Verant!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cerdle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Doh I did not know that!  Thanks.  WEll I guess that means proccing on them skeeters in Echo then.  Thanks for the info.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drizan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You know if you get really desperate you can duel someone to proc the hammer..<br />
<br />
<br />
Had someone ask me the other day if we could duel so they could port to OT.  <br />
<br />
Lol nothing funnier than a gnome trying to hit me while I buff his dex and hit him with alacrity.<br />
<br />
<br />
Poor little guy looked like he was going to die from swinging that big hammer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There is nothing wong with hitting the soul binders..they fixed it so you can't get free skill ups off them, which was the real issue,  by making them low level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bruzza Bashalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am a Troll, so I had similar factions decisions to make.<br />
<br />
VS:  Screw it.  OT is not the be-all end-all for banking now (I am bound in the Nexus, bank in SH) for us evil-types.  I have been max KoS for a long time now, and I still use my hammer daily, if not more often (I love to solo in Howling Stones).  When you zone in, one WEAK Skellie will aggro on you.  Run toward the corner of the wall (away from the foreman and bank).  Root him, invis up and run between the foreman and the workers (it can be done with no aggro, trust me), past Cliff and you are home-free.  Out of 200+ hammer poofs, I have never been killed, and have only created five (spectacular!!) trains to Skyfire.  You do not need VS faction IMO, and it means less and less as you work up through the 50's toward 60.<br />
<br />
Giants:  I have been Giant, then Dorf/Dragon, and now I am back on my way to Giant faction.  RP is a big reason, but the Giants have better quests than the other two factions IMO, and you can still do the entire Coldain Ring quests max-KoS.  However, most of Velious requires a guild effort to get any benefit from, so if you plan to stay with your guild for a while, go with whatever faction they are on.<br />
<br />
Luclin factions:  Still deciding, but leaning toward Katta for the quests so far....<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you out!  Good luck :)</div></div><hr />
