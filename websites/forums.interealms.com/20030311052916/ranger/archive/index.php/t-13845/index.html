<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aeninya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">last night i was pissed off, i needed somewhere to vent.<br />
<br />
i figured this would be the place since nobody would ever find it<br />
<br />
but people did and i got deguilded and lost basically every friend i ever made in game<br />
<br />
so i guess this is my retirement form eq post, theres nothing left for me.</div></div><hr />

I can understand the pre-55 thing totally, and agree with it.  But yanno what? That's really only for the level 51 guy who joins and says &quot;great, lets get my epic, where do we start?&quot; not for someone who is literally a single drop away from their epic.  JRs are not even that rough, a single group can do them, and to stonewall someone like that is just dumb.  I am profoundly sorry that you are getting screwed over like that :(<br />
<br />
90% of being an officer or guild leader (or any good leader anywhere) is knowing that no rule is perfect, and above and beyond that knowing when those rules don't fit, and how to fix the situation.  The epic thing makes sense in a broad way, but christ, for a JR, its just incredibly dumb.  Heck, he's a druid, and he has his epic, he should KNOW how big a stumbling block that is, and if that's all you have left, he should know what its like being stuck with JUST THAT BIT staring you in the face.  JR was what whupped me for a long time in getting my epic, I had everything else, and I know the feeling. <br />
<br />
I hope it works out, it sounds like an overall crappy situation.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Readd Skarlett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/sigh, guess it's good to get off your chest</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Your GL is being really anal about the JR thing. I'm very sorry to hear you are being shafted like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thornwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Don't hold back, tell us how you really feel!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Amdee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well shoot, then put the post back up. It wasn't that bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ouch.<br />
<br />
If they're going to be that childish about it, put your post back up.<br />
<br />
They also sound like they're not worth quitting the game for. Hang on and find a guild that appreciates you a little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Taamar Bladesworn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You've been deguilded over something you said in the rant section of the Ranger's Glade? Wow.... time to move on to a guild with more going on. As a guild leader I think that may be the most rediculous thing ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Silvanoshi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">/agree Taamar, ranting happens.  Because you chose not to go off on them and instead get it out somewhere that wouldnt hurt them, that should be taken into consideration.  My old guild we had a rant section, and what was said in rant, stay in rant.  We had arguments in the forum and such.  But it never interfered with who stays in guild and who gets kicked out.  My advice, look for another guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aeninya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">No no no.. you guys really don't get it.<br />
<br />
I made personal attacks on my longest in game friend and guild leader, and even exaggerated the truth a bit.<br />
<br />
I am TOTALLY in the wrong here, the guild were, and still are, great people.<br />
<br />
It's one of those turn the clock back type moments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Malevant Faeshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Has stuff been worked out at all? :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Subwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Aeninya hun...shoot me a tell ingame...Please dont quit hun....I'd miss ya too much. I would be glad to help ya find some fun and a new guild to make a home out of:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Elwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Or you can come to Povar and start a new path for yourself. :)<br />
<br />
I can't promise to always spend time with you but I can give you some cash and starting equipment.<br />
<br />
Do not blame yourself so harshly. You were angry, and if what you said about this guy was entirely true, he does not sound like a great friend. You may be better off to dust yourself off and go a different path in EQ, whether on your home server (it's possible) or elsewhere. He was a time bomb waiting to happen anyways.</div></div><hr />
