Don't know, I get the same thing at home, running WinXP Home, but here at work it works fine on Win2000 Pro. So I end up doing all my editing here. I always get home and realize I screwed something up =) like I have laced veil and on my chanter, who was actually wearing a loam encrusted veil.<br />

Do you try logging in from two different machines? I'm wondering if it realizes the two different cookies/IP's or something and freaks thinking someone else is trying to log in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Are you at work? or running through a proxy?<br />
<br />
I always have to go into Tools &gt; Internet Options &gt; Advanced tab &gt; and ensure &quot;Use HTTP 1.1 through proxy connections&quot; is checked.  Otherwise the site will not work at all.  I get all sorts of errors similiar to what you posted.<br />

Internet Explorer 6 <br />
<br />
There are few things you need to check with IE 6... in no particular order: <br />
<br />
- Make sure you keep up with the latest IE 6 with critical updates from Microsoft (Tools -&gt; Windows Update -&gt; Scan for updates). Make it a habit to check this at least once a week for maximum compatibility. <br />
<br />
- Make sure Tools -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Use HTTP1.1 through proxy connections is checked ON (ie. checkmarked). Use HTTP should also be ON. <br />
<br />
- You should have your Security and Privacy levels set to medium. If it's higher or custom, make sure you know exactly what are the consequences (trying to set back to medium is a good idea to be sure it doesn't come from here). Medium high should be acceptable. Magelo does use a cookie to automatically log you in whenever you visit. <br />
<br />
- If you are using something like Norton Internet Security or Zone Alarm (its privacy settings), make sure you configure it properly to work with Magelo (see Zone Alarm or Norton HOWTOs in the library). <br />
<br />
- Clear your browser cache when you suspect IE is messing up (eg. displaying an old page or an empty dropdown list). Here's how: Tools -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Delete Files. <br />
<br />
- To keep IE's cache manager from outsmarting itself, set Tools -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Settings -&gt; Every visit to the page. This will go a long way towards allowing you to see the web content you've selected all the time, and not something else. <br />
<br />
- Finally, make sure you don't disable Javascript in the Advanced section of Tools -&gt; Internet Options. (hmm, where is it?) <br />
