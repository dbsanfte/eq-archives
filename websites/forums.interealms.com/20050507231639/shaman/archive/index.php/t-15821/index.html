<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Pretty much as the title says...I find that yes I can log in and get a group and all. I find it way to mechanical, and depressing too when I think that everything that can be done is done.<br />
<br />
I look at this as being burnt out. I am going on vaction for two weeks and thus will be back once school starts again, so that might fix the problem.<br />
<br />
I think I need another game or hobby to shift my focus too for a while. Thinking of going to EQOA again...but who knows how long that will last. EQ2 isn't due for a while and so on with the others.<br />
<br />
So in short what do you do when your burnt out? I am sure its happened to others just as it happened to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One of 2 things.<br />
<br />
1) Log, obviously :)<br />
<br />
2) Hit the bazaar and search for cheap deals. The bazaar seems like a game within a game to me. There's something very satisfying about finding an item way underpriced, marking it up and selling it on. I may be weird, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i just went thru this. guild was going pretty good. had rebuilt to a pretty good raiding force and we were moving forward.then in about a months time we lost 14ish 65 raiders.which was half the raid force. i was already wavering on the edge and this pushed me over.<br />
  i quit playin for about 3 weeks. then went on vacation out of town for 2 more. while i wasnt playin i played neverwinter nights and mechcommander 2 for my gaming fix. when i came back i had a much better attitude but now it is also much more casual as well. ive started playin my alt more and soloing more, part of this i think is that it seems i only get groups with f*cktards lately. <br />
 i have played since pre kunark but up until about a year ago i was traveling for work 2-3 weeks a month typically so it kept it from getting tedious to me.also then i wasnt a class officer and we had more than one shaman for raids.<br />
  gettin kind of long but basically i suggest taking a break. do an alt or an alternate game or just go outside. or even turn on the monitor with no cpu and watch some TV. good luck whickever you choose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">take 2 weeks off, don't read EQ news, don't check here, avoid everything EQ, and see if you're interested when you come back, if not, hit up playersauctions, cash out, move on</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bahamute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I just recently was on a long eq break. I was gone for about 6 to 7 weeks enjoying life and geting a job. Now that I am back the game does seem to be a little more fun but as someone else said I do find myself playing alot more casualy and im not siting and playing for 8 hours a day. A good break helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Find a better guild, or a group of friends to do **** with in game?  Or take some time off and quit EQ and do something more worthwhile with your life.   :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I went through burnout recently  :mad: <br />
I did long, boring, not worthwhile quests. For some reason long boring camps were fun and I enjoyed furthering my character with things most people dont have.<br />
I finished VP key, 8th cudgel, got keys from comms in ssra, and am halfway through seru earring :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>thatguy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">play MOHAA online. its some good action to break up the slower pace(except some raids) of EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If everything is too mechanical, go do things in game you've never done before.  Like, take a 2 groups and go clear VP, or take a single group and xp crawl around the zone.  Go take a group into the Deep and see if you can crawl your way to Ssra.  Go get some friends and get yourself flagged for the 7th Hammer (ie finish all the trials).  Get 2 groups together and go kill the named frog in PoS instead of just doing some boring xp camp.  Find a partner and see if you can fight down and kill Jumpy &amp; Protector in Seb just the 2 of you.  Then do the same with Drusilla in Charasis.  Work on completing the gate necklace quest.  Work on getting a key to Saryn's Tower.  Work on getting a key to AD's lair.  Work on getting a BoT Tower key.  Work on getting a key to Agnarr's Electric Penis gate thingy.  Work on getting your VT key.  Work on getting your VP key.  Find something you haven't done before and go do that for some adventure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i did baulder gate 2, ps2 games, get a secondbox, if u can find it Fallout 2 is an exelent game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Take a break until Sept 9th  .... LDoN ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm the master at taking long breaks in EQ and trust me when I say this -- the game is so much better when you come back from a long layoff.<br />
<br />
I took my first break from EQ in late 2000 for about 3 months. I then came back and leveled up to 45 around 2001 and then took a year off(back when 45 was a hell level and it did suck hard). I came back and leveled from 45 to 61 and then took 4 months off. I'm now 64 and having the best time in EQ that I can remember.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't worry about EQ dying. I've heard that so many times over the years. I remember how DAOC was going to kill EQ. I remember how Anarchy Online and then Shadowbane was supposed to kill EQ. Bla bla bla.. Oh yea SWG was going to be the EQ killer and then surely Horizons will.. yea right. The game will survive for another 2-3 years at the very least. I have no interest in EQ2 at all.<br />
<br />
Quit cold turkey. Don't delete your characters but cancel your subscription and remove EQ from your hard drive and don't look back. The addiction will hit you again sometime down the road.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Chernobul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">try new things, don't just say &quot;eq r b0ring now&quot;<br />
<br />
try doing really hard mobs with a ranger in the group! it's almost asking for a port back to bind with no gear!<br />
<br />
also i group up with some friends and try raid type mobs with only a few people and normally one enchanter.<br />
<br />
believe me you can have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">When burnt out, there are really 2 solutions:<br />
<br />
1) Don't do whatever it is you did most. If it was tradeskills, try some raids, if it was raids, try exploring some zones you've never been to before, etc.<br />
<br />
2) Just stop playing. Since I started playing (now 4 years ago), I've taken a least 6 or 7 breaks of 3+ weeks - as high as 7 months once -, and it always helps a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Don't spend too much money twinking him, because you'll probably come back to your main, but don't do the newbie armor quests, there's always something that just won't drop...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">&quot;What to do when Burnt out&quot;<br />
(1)Cry-You gain all this useless time!, and there are no replacement game good enough.<br />
(2) Rejoice- Addiction is over!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Agendon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Stop now, when you still can  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Badz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Several things put the fun back into the game for me.<br />
<br />
1) I got a second account and now I can play when I want without sitting around LFG.  I invite people to play with me and if they are not fun to be with then I boot them out.  I get so tired of non-shaman telling me how to play a shaman.  I have a shaman-warrior duo, shaman-enchanter duo and a shaman-mage duo.  In all 3, I play the shaman and bot the other one.  <br />
<br />
2) Convinced some RL friends to start playing on Friday nights.  We all got our wives to agree that Friday nights was EQ night.  So now, we gather at PoK bank at 7:30pm and head off in a full group to fight until 3am.  We are all enjoying EQ a lot more now.  Since we know we have Friday nights, we seem to place less during the week but enjoy the game more.  We had all started 2 sets of characters so that we alternate every Friday to avoid burnout.<br />
<br />
3) Make alts.  I have an alt in every class except paladin.  Yes some are twinked but others have been started on different servers so I can avoid the tempation.<br />
<br />
4) Most importantly - get away from the power game.  That was the addiction I had to get over.  The most painful part was realizing how strung out I had gotten on being the best, having the most, etc.  I now like grouping with my RL friends on Friday night and we set off to get a level or two.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is I play less and enjoy it more.  Anyway, just my 2 cp worth from someone that was burned out.  EQ is a game and meant for entertainment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Out of game options - <br />
<br />
1. Read a book.<br />
2. Go to a movie.<br />
3. Call up some friends you haven't seen in a long time and do dinner.<br />
4. Play a board game with your spouse/SO/roommate/friends.<br />
5. Go bowling.  It's surprisingly fun.<br />
6. Pick a project around the house and do it (paint a room, wallpaper, build a shelf, etc).<br />
<br />
And in-game options - <br />
<br />
1. Start a new character and play to level 20, NO TWINKING<br />
2. Go to a midlevel zone and start buffing people<br />
3. Go to a middle-high end zone and own the place<br />
4. Tradeskills!<br />
5. Do a quest you've always meant to do but it looked to hard.  Even if you don't want the reward.  Find someone to MQ it for if possible so they can use the reward :-)<br />
6. Go to a Tier 1 zone and group.  Bad groups will be entertaining, being able to help out good people who are simply low level will be rewarding.<br />
7. Take your group back to Kunark and kill Gorenaire, Talendor, Trakanon, etc. as a one-grouper.<br />
8. Go play Asheron's Call 2 and marvel at the pretty graphics... and how empty the world is.<br />
<br />
Lots of other options, really, the sky's the limit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I quit for a year but it was more from frustration with the game than boredom.  Now that Im back I like the game even more, but am playing it more casually (less) than before, although still quite a bit.<br />
<br />
Try some of the suggestions above, a friend and I started a group we call BYoC (Bring your own coffin) that has less than 3 groups, 1 group almost all bots that we try and challenge ourselves and push the envelope in, once a week and everyone in the group really looks forward to this day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">It happened to me when level 45 was a hell level, so i played some D2. And i've taken mini breaks here and there when a game comes out that i wanted to play. (vice city, World series baseball, NFL 2k3, Knights of the old republic) .. Right now, i'll probably take a couple of days to play ESPN NFL football.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Moglyzok Moogleman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Personally what I do is when I take a break is look at my warhammer 40k army, usually driving myself to painting them and having not much else to do I can get alot of the little guy's done, usually it doesnt last too long so I call friends and we do something, play axis &amp; allies, watch movies, play console games etc... But usually burn's are just temporary In my experience, I just get tired of hoping to see that blue line move up .5% heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Battlefield 1942...kill some Nazi's!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Thanks for the suggestions guys...I'll be sure with this new found boredom of EQ...I might actually start studing more intensively for big tests at school...esp when its my first year with physics.../shudder</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Just quit!  stopped playing begining of summer after about two years.  Though i troll a lot (less now) i dont miss it.  The BS that constintaly was being dealt with (as guild officer) along with having played pretty hardcore for the past two years just took the fun, etc out of the game.  Its a fun game but there is other things to do.  and i plan to never come back :) *knock on wood*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I actually havent logged in myself for more than a week. Thats by far the longest stretch in the last 2 years. <br />
<br />
Not sure if thats a good thing, I seem to be spending my time drinking and overclocking my computer till it BSOD's. Who wants my stuff? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I'm a big fan of long projects as a cure for boredom.  I did the Qeynos monk sash quest a long, long time ago just because it sounded fun.  When I eventually made a monk I gave it to her.  Nowadays you could sell it to monks seeking their epics.  <br />
<br />
Another time it was the quest for Ice Comet that results in the Star of Eyes, with unlimited clicky Identify.  Not exactly priceless, but a handy trinket nonetheless, especially if you get into this obscure questing stuff.  And you'll get a nice rush from the invis sprint for a few of the pieces.<br />
<br />
I started working on Cabilis faction when I got tired of exping more recently.  I started by running around the newbie area in LoIO siccing Dogdog after every baby sarnak or goblin in sight.  Gives that warm, fuzzy, invincible feeling. :)  Between that and time spent in Sebilis, I managed to get to dubious with the guards with the help of an illusion potion, so I switched to bone chips.  They're sometimes available at reasonable prices and in nice, big quantities in the Bazaar.  Or you can hop from city to city and go vendor mining.  <br />
<br />
Once I was acceptable to all Cabilis except the necros, I went back to exping for a while.  Next time burnout hit me again, I started the cudgel quest.  I've finished all of the parts I can solo (having picked up my Venril bones before I even started) and now am back to exping until I get around to dragging some folks into Howling Stones to finish it off.  Some of the camps were pretty tedious, but it was fun to explore those dungeons I'd only barely seen before, and the tedium gave me a new appreciation for the satisfaction of exping.<br />
<br />
Those are among my most memorable, but there are plenty of similar quests out there as well.  Even doing silly little newbie quests can help bring you back in touch with the story line.  If you're into that sort of thing, they can be a lot of fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I've been burnt out many times over my career, and when I do I just take a break and play a different game for however long it takes.  Usually just 2 weeks or so.  Sometimes I play some of the newer, modern games (both single and multiplayer) that are out, and sometimes I did through my old CD-ROMs and find some nice, old school games that can keep me hooked for days at a time.  Master of Orion 2, X-com UFO Defense, etc....  The old classics :)  I'm going to see if Simcity2000 runs on my machine, and if it does, I'm going to play that for a bit.<br />
<br />
If you just want something different to do inside EQ that can get your mind off of the grind, there are a few things you can try.  I actually enjoy tradeskills (hell if I know why).  If I go and do tradeskills for a few nights running, I am usually ready to go back to exp and raiding when I'm done.  Long, time consuming, almost epic quests also work as well.  /hugs 8th shawl and seru earring.<br />
<br />
Burn out mainly happens because, although you are enjoying whatever it is you are doing, you do it so many times that it stops being fun and starts to be work.  When that happens, it is usually best to go do something else until you realize what it is that makes the game fun, and then you're ready to go back.  Good luck.<br />
<br />
(btw, if you are burned out already at 48, I might suggest taking this opportunity to just stop EQ altogether before it gets its claws in you :) ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">If you have an XBox rent or buy Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.  Best console RPG ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I take a break from gaming -spend some time in the sun.<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
Play another game  - warcraft 3 is my current favorite.<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
Make an alt - I now have multiple 50+ alts  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Tannus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Alts are fun, I play them alot when I am starting to burnout...but I still burnout on them quick.<br />
Cutting back on EQ playtime usually works good though, find something else to fill some time.  Getting a PS2 helped me alot, have not had a burnout since. When I don't feel like EQ I play PS2 for a day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">as added fun for burnouts....I do a couple things...<br />
<br />
1)  I sit in the bazaar and twiddle my thumbs..check for spells and gear now and then..and chat with friends ingame...<br />
2) (if you dont already) Go get yourself a copy of something totally different gamewise...go get Unreal2...or better yet, get Half-Life and run by killing scientists, aliens, security guards (yourself sometimes)..and best Yet..Half-Life2 comes out next month reportedly...with better graphics too, whee!<br />
3)  Watch tv<br />
4) Do the most sinful of all other acts..and go outside.  You know..that place with grass, a funky smell..and that thing people call sunlight... =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Master of Orion 2, X-com UFO Defense, etc.... <br />

These games own all :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I would suggest taking a break and do something else for a while.<br />
If you want to keep playing I would suggest changing servers to one that is completly different then the one you are on now.  Try a PVP out...those are great fun at any lvl...just ask Fancy the Bard.  I got burnt out and started a monk on the Roll Playing preffered server (can't remember the name ATM) and that was a BLAST.  It kind of reminded me of what it was like when I first started playing.  There were lots of people who wanted to help you but you couldn't understand what language they were speaking...so they would just buff you and leave.  Also by only being able to have one character on the server there were no twinks.</div></div><hr />
