<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ysgwyrthyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sumthin me noticed in da May 8th patch message (den prompty forgot about wen me thort pet trackin woz killed) woz da followin line:<br />
Characters can no longer scribe a scroll that they can't cast due to deity restrictions.<br />
Me remembers a long time bak VI woz talkin 'bout implementing dis sorta ting (i.e. remove a spell frum yer spellbook, convertin it inta a scroll), and me remembers seein blank parchment, quills, and similar stuff on merchants ta support dis but it woz never implemented.  Da quote abuv makes me tink dat mebbe peeps now *can* scribe scrolls.  Anybudy heard anythin 'bout dis?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You are misinterpreting what they said.<br />
<br />
In game terms scribing a spell scroll is transfering it into your spell book, not creating a scroll.<br />
<br />
For quite a while it was possible for a Cleric to scribe the Imbue spells for deities other than their own. Now they can't.<br />
<br />
My cleric (Tunare worshiper) has the imbues for Mith Marr,Erolisi Marr, Tunare, Brell, and Bertoxx in his spell book. And he can cast them all.... I'd have the rest but I never got around to getting them.<br />
<br />
With the change (bug fix really), he can't add the other imbues to his spell book (but can still use the ones that are already scribed).<br />
<br />
The quills, parchment, etc are for use in Practice Research for Int Casters.</div></div><hr />
