<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the Sport of Cup Stacking<br />
<br />
Who the hell participates in this sport?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That's insane.  If the cup stacking gig doesn't pay off, she could use that manual dexterity to make big bucks in... forget it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Damn!<br />
Can we say &quot;future bartender?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I actually like went blind watching this...<br />
<br />
I strained my eyes too hard to try to see it step by step, but it just doesnt work<br />
<br />
the only way to see it is if you drag the cursor over the playbar step by step...and even then it boggles the mind, cause its all blurry :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Torlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Oh my! Thats pretty cool!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">When do you guys hold your &quot;World Series&quot; in cup stacking? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">LOLOL !!!  This site absolutely KILLS.<br />

My favorite quotes:<br />
<br />
Mission Statement:  &quot;See it, Teach it, Believe it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;From activities to competitions and sanctioned tournaments — cup stacking with Speed Stacks is everywhere you want to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Speed Stacks, Inc. took nine Speed Stacks Demonstration Team members and families to the Colorado School for the Deaf and the Blind in Colorado Springs for a 'hands-on' cupstacking workshop.&quot;  (What's he doing?  Stacking cups?  Stop messing with me- what's he really doing !!!)<br />
<br />
The whole profiles thing (http://www.speedstacks.com/news/stacker_stories/index.htm) is a little creepy- a little too much like personal ads for 6th graders... &quot;Jesse enjoys cup stacking, chess, track and field, triathlons and fishing. He is also an excellent hiker who hiked Pikes Peak in five hours. Jesse is a good student and budding artist. He plays the piano and clarinet. He is adventurous and has a wonderful sense of humor.&quot;<br />
<br />
of course, Emily's profile provides this gem:  &quot;Her ball handling skills started being noticed by college coaches when she was in 8th-grade.&quot;  Uuuhhhh.. okay.  <br />
<br />
It's also a little sad that the world record holder super-duper cup stacker is the founder's daughter... I imagine she's got some life going on.<br />
<br />
If this thing is a joke- it's the funniest thing ever.  If not, I'm very very scared.  Very.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Bigguss, you have noooo idea what my insomnia lets me find.<br />
<br />
Im pretty sure its not a joke, because its not even half funny compared to this:<br />
http://www.cheeseracing.org<br />
<br />
Cheese racing BETTER be a joke, cause its just soooo sad someone actually paid money for that web addy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Now cheese racing is a mans sport. :D</div></div><hr />
