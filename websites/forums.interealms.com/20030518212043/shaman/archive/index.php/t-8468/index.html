<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tvebakka Knasermeget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">K..sry but i have to say this. I can not understand how you can say WOW i got 1 yellow in 2 hours exp here is great...if i dont get like 1 blue in max 4 kills im finding another place. Not many here have found that so i will try and let you people know what i have done.<br />
<br />
First off im a cat and a twink i have to admit to that. Jaundicebone helm-boots-bracer-legs(just bought them as im posting this)-arms. Obolous death shroud-Iksar cheastplate-shadel bandit ring-Rune etched icewurm fang- skull marked shield. Just to name the most prominent parts...<br />
<br />
Allready before i made my shamman i knew i wanted him to be melee based. Maybe its cause i have a 58 war i dont know. But Melee is the way to go. You get slow and speed and good buffs...give me just one reason not to do melee. <br />
<br />
I went from 36 to 48 in less than 4 days..with NO pl. <br />
<br />
36-38 i took in kedge..ohhh i hated the impalers but they could be avoided<br />
<br />
38-42 i took in dsp.. killing wolves fungus zelniaks plain anything...it was nonstop killing which made it so damm good exp..<br />
<br />
42-45 i took in CoM.. i camped the 2 at zone 3 at bridge 2 up on left and 2 up on right...at 44 i was allso killing a few of the mobs in part of the stables...the left side when you run to stables...<br />
 <br />
45-48 I took 4 yellows in loio on the bloodgills.. they are very good exp and havent gotten a heck of alot hp.. grouped with a monk twink from guild in Echo at tm room and took 1 yellow together in no time..when she left i stayed and got 1 yellow in 45 all of 46 and 47 in close to 9 hours id say.. this including dying cause for fun i tried to help some foos kill the chanter in here... BAD IDEA!!! Ohh the soloing here did mostly involve only the room next to TM...could kill TM at level 45 np...but took all i had cause i couldt single pull the mofo...later i had a sk to camp TM might as well let him i wouldnt be killing him anyway. Cause of the kindness i showed him sharing the camp he let me kil most of the slaves...this was nonstop killing to.<br />
<br />
sry for making a big story line..wasnt intended. Hope this can help someone.<br />
<br />
Ohhh btw..i never hunt without KEI...yes i know. Im a addict and im proud of it.<br />
