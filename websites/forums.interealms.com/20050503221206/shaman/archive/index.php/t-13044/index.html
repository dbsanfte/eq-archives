<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Medican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I heard of the sitting on a horse get's you to meditate while running type of deal so I was wondering if there was any differnece between having a horse and the lizards from LoY. Are the lizards better? or Horse? Run speed difference? Mediation differnece? Regernation Difference? Thanks once again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The only difference is that the lizard moves a little jerkier but it doesn't have the lame ass head in the way. I took the 3k loss on both my character to switch to lizards. As far as speed the same priced lizard is same speed as same priced horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hyllus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">All Things are the same that you said, Speed, mana regen etc<br />
<br />
Only difference is that You dont have a big horse head on the lizard, but with the lizard you have a very rocky motion and may get sick after along time of it =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ride the lizard in third-person veiw. It's a hoot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Urnti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Or better yet..only use the lizard for the regen and click off when you gotta run ;)</div></div><hr />

Actually, you don't get the benefits of medding while running or autoattacking. You get the benefits of medding while casting and standing still. Also, you don't draw sitting aggro when you swap spells during a fight. I like the lizard better, personally. There's no &quot;cheap&quot; color like there is with horses, but I like not having to shrink twice every time I summon my mount. The motion is jerkier, but since I don't use the lizard for travel, it's not a problem. Also, in third person view, the motion of the lizard running is hilarious. It looks like you're bullriding. LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's all about looks.  I guess I'm old-fashioned  =/  I prefer the horse look way over the lizard look... I'm normally in any view other than 1st-person view, so the horse-head doesn't really bother me.  Black horse and white horse are a great look.  Lizards just look dumb =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jantulu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Lizards forever!! &lt;-frog</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>loptar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">a quikc shrink takes care of that horse head.. i mean, we &lt;are&gt; shammys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shammann65</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm a Cround Control Shaman when I decide to group. Still Bear Form all the way. Meditate isn't needed when you have canni5 + Torpor. When your trying to do CC you need fast accelaration to get to the mobs to park. You need to run to the spot where you need to park the mob (He'll be beating on you) Horse/lizard will delay valuble seconds on this. I use my Fast White horse for looks when traveling only ... just mah 2cs.</div></div><hr />

Signature restrictions for the Crucible are 100 pixels high, roughly 250 pixels wide and less than 25K in size.  <br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Use horse/lizard in groups (shrunk of course).  When i need to do crowd control I hit /dism and run around doing what needs to get done..and then re-click my bridle for more mana-regen.<br />
<br />
Do I NEED it? No..it just helps a bit and I annoy my groupmates with 3 or 4 canni's less every pull.  In an over-powered group I am often casting JUST slow..in which case the mana regen from horse-sitting replenishes me in more than enough time for the next mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You can also invis yourself (as long as you do not have anything that allows see invis) to quickly remove the horses head (until you zone or switch camera views)..but with most being shammy's shrink is the easiest.  I prefer horses because of looks.  Just not a lizard mount fan.  Too bad they didnt make a few different styles of lizards, and several different color combinations for horses.  Granted there are only 3 hairstyles for each race so I guess I should know better than to wish for more.</div></div><hr />
