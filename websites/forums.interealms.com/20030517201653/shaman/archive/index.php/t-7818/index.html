<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ooogly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You dont really need any resist gear to do the planes in pick up raids. <br />
<br />
If you're gonna be doing Vox and Naggy get some MR, CR and FR gear. MR being most importaint.<br />
<br />
I suggest heading to the bazaar and doing searchs in each slot for items with these resist.<br />
<br />
You wont need PR and DR for awhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>sir0die</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">what about focus items. I'm usually in bear form, have a iksar BP, and almost always have some form of regen (chloro right now). i cannidance alot. I also buf alot and have my pet by my side if i intend on fighting in zone.<br />
<br />
can someone give me a few suggestions on which focus items would be good?( that would be obtainable by a 40-45 shaman with a few friends)<br />
<br />
I'd like to have the lvl 3 items, but i don't know if i am capable of getting them. I deffinatly want mana preservation 3, extended range 3, enchantment enhancment 3, and whichever helps my DOT's (affliction enhancment?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Do the coldain military wristguard quest (search the forums, there's loads of info here,  and note you don't need the wolf harness, just the gem of pursuasion)<br />
<br />
Its an extended affliction 3 item, great for soloing. You WILL need your friends for the final part of the quest, its soloable at level 49 or so. The other parts are best done with a Rallos Zek worshipping mule, Troll warriors are the most commonly used. Mine has dinged level 9 after doing the quest for lots of friends :)<br />
<br />
Mana preservation 3, or affliction efficiency 3, are probably your next best bets.  MP3 = Obulus Death Shroud, 10-15k. Not sure about AE 3 items, again, search the forum there is a thread on focus items.<br />
<br />
Note that afflcition items work on dots, slows and roots, not just dots.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Amulet of Insight is an Extended Enhancement 3 item that goes for 4 - 7 kpp in the bazaar.  Stats aren't great but the effect really helps if you buff a lot, and you can always switch it out if you prefer.</div></div><hr />
