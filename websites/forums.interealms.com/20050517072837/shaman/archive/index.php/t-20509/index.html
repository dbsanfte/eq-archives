There was also pretty bad tell lag last night on BB server.  I'm assuming it was from everyone patching and added people from the reactivated accounts for 1 month free.  I'm hoping it settles down in a day or two.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, there's 2 problems here...<br />
<br />
1) I have a GeForce 2 GTS on an Athlon 1ghz with 512mb RAM, it's old, but ran fine in EQ up until yesterday<br />
2) I know I'm not alone in saying... I can't &quot;pony up the cash&quot; for an upgrade, not to mention, with how the EQ engine is built... a CPU upgrade will do you more good than a video card upgrade will. (Not to mention, some people will not pony up the cash for a video card upgrade for 1 game)<br />
<br />
My video card runs fine in nearly every other game on the market... it lags like crazy in EQ. Specifically... I can play on a 64 player Enemy Territory server, at full capacity, with no noticable slow down (Granted, ET's engine is the Quake 3 one, which has been out a while, but is also optimized for framerate, unlike EQ's engine). I run toward any adventure camp, and it's majorly noticable, whether it's Butcherblock, or South Ro.<br />
<br />
While it still functions to a &quot;playable&quot; extent, at least just running around, and in some cases it's noticable better... it's worse as a whole.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've also noticed when I jump, I &quot;hover&quot; in the air  for about 10 seconds, before falling back down.  Never saw this untill the new graphics last night.<br />

I had not loaded the new suggested drivers, but I think i will, to see if it solves the weirdness.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have two boxes that I play EQ on.<br />
<br />
1) a GeForce FX5600<br />
2) a ATI Radeon All-In-Wonder 7500<br />
<br />
When EQ told me to upgrade my drivers, I did (despite both having pretty recent drivers).  The patch worked fine for me on both.  The ATI actually was improved ALOT by this patch; frame rate was WAY up, the graphics looked a little better (could be my imagination, but I really think they did) and I generally experienced no difficulty.  On my main box (the GeForce) everything was good, but when running two copies of EQ one of them was drawing armour kind of wacky on some toons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>MurojTruewolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well, everything looked beautiful as I logged in from my work machine this morning. The only problem I was having was the insane amount of lag I was experiencing. I actually turned on models (which I have never played with on), and everything ran pretty smooth. I'm going to test it out at home on my main PC, and see if it was just the firewall here at work that was giving me lag issues today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Running a 1 gig P3 laptop with a 32 meg G-force 2 mobile video on XP Pro. The only problem I ran into yesterday was lag during combat. The ping time and packet loss were normal, but there was up to a 2 to 3  second lag between action and update on the screen; mostly relating to the monsters position more so than spells and combat updates. Caused kiting and such to be impossible, pulling to be actively dangerous, and almost impossible to kill the mob once they started the death crawl unless they were rooted or snared. As for normal lag like in the bazaar or running I noticed no significant difference. Played with the 45.23 and 56.64 drivers from nVidia and noticed no difference. Couldn't play with the sky turned on, and spell effects increased lag; but I played with sky and spell effects off before anyway. I do hope someone figures out what is going on with the mob positiong thing and I'll keep tweaking to see if I can improve it myself. One thing of note, they did patch multiple versions of eqgame.exe and the dx9 related files yesterday during the long update, so they were having some kind of problem on their end for sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yeah, the 7500 series is older than a year..I meant that I'd only bought mine about a year ago..got a pretty reasonable deal on it at the time too.<br />
<br />
They found a set of drivers that fixes the issues the 7500 was having, so when I get home from work today going to try them and hopefully be able to play the game again.<br />
<br />
Also broke down and purchased a FX5600 ultra, it should arrive in a couple days, so one way or another, I'm gonna be happy again very soon.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>slimb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Personally I run fine on both my boxes.<br />
<br />
One has a NVidia 5200ultraFX the other a Geforce3ti200 (i think) with 64mb of ram.<br />
<br />
Both machines have 1GB of Ram and Athlon XP 2500 processors in em which I believe is probably the main reason I didn't run into many problems.  The game definitely looks a bit crisper than it has.  I've noticed minor improvements in some zones and lag - but no big changes.  As is, this wasn't supposed to make for any huge changes anyways yet. <br />
<br />
I have a feeling that this got pushed live for a few reasons, one, they need a bigger testbed - the only way to do that is to push it live.  Two - they probably have deadlines that upper management says &quot;get it out or else&quot; so things like this go live.  Remember Luclin?  That was horrid - this isn't as bad IMHO.  We'll see a patch or two soon I hope with more fixes put in.</div></div><hr />

Just a reminder, first you have no real idea who or how many are affected like this so your marginalizing of people on the basis of incomplete data is wrong. Secondly even if we (yes i had a problem with the latest and 'greatest' Nvidia drivers, had to back rev and works fine now) does not make them wrong either.</div></div><hr />

seems that way, all intel chipsets were FUBAR'ed, patch tonight supposed to fix that, plus if you go to the tech boards there are some things you can try for older Nvidia and ATI cards.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">After testing on a heap of different boxes, I have found the following (personal opinion supplied ....).<br />
<br />
Running fine = frame rates adequate for moving around in Raid Situations ..<br />
Lag = frames rates at under about 5 frames per second that really hamper movement.<br />
<br />
I have 5 boxes that used to be able to play EQ fine before the DX9 patch, and I since that equates to a lot of hardware, I have been playing with a few different configurations ....<br />
<br />
I have a range of CPUs (no AMD's at this stage), but the ' lag ' issue I have shown to be CPU independant (have had EQ running fine on a Celeron 300A post patch) ....<br />
<br />
Ok, this is the way I tested ... I had 3 variables, CPU, RAM and Video Card ... I kept 2 variables constant and changed the third .... I use 3 CPUs (Celeron 300A, Celeron 450A, P3 1GHz), 4 RAM settings (128MB, 256MB, 384MB and 512MB) and 4 Video Cards (TnT2, GEForce2MX400, GEFroce4MX440 and GEForce2 GTS) and I tested each in the Bazaar from Nexus zoneline, to the most populated Trader corner, turned around and ran back to Nexus Zoneline without SoW, but with Run3 ..<br />
<br />
I get BAD lag on all GEForce2 cards (MX and GTS) when system memory is 256MB or less (no matter what CPU I use) ... if I boost system RAM to 512MB frame rates improve marginally....<br />
<br />
GEforce4 MX440 cards with 256MB RAM or less are not as laggy (and are almost playable) and scale as CPU speed increases (unlike the GEforce2 cards) ....<br />
<br />
Ok, so from the testing I have done, my conclusion is:<br />
<br />
If your system RAM + Video RAM is less then 384MB combined, you will get nasty frame rates in general .....<br />
<br />
<br />
These are my recommendations to people in different situations for upgrades:<br />
- If you are using a GEForce2 based card, ditch it for a GEForce4 based card (this MAY be tweaked by either SoE or nVidia thru patches / drivers) ..<br />
- If you have less then 512MB RAM and do NOT have a GEForce2, upgrade your RAM.<br />
- If you have a video card that is not nVidia nor ATI (and ya having problems) the cheapest upgrade is a GEForce4 MX440, the best value for money upgrade (assuming you have the CPU power to drive it) is a GEForce FX 5900 XT (cheap and powerful) ...<br />
<br />
Hehe, Corbane, I would also like to know which Video Drivers you are using with ya Voodoo3 to get EQ to play ok !!!!!!!  I am getting weird mob warping,  loosing dye colors from models, faces disappearing on models and white patches in treees, etc .... Have tried HQfx beta 10 drivers and the last 3dfx drivers ....... (are you using the AmigaMerlin 2.9 drivers?!?) .... <br />
<br />
Hope that helps somebody,<br />
Tek</div></div><hr />

<br />
That said this is the most horrendous marketing decision I have ever seen. The same week I see old guildies coming back for their free promo month they put this crap in. We had retired players almost getting the EQ bug again, getting all nostalgic about the old zones and the fabled versions there. Right when they are almost sucked back into EQ they are hit with this mess and said &quot;to hell with EQ&quot;. I personally know 5 players that if given a stable EQ through there promo subscription would have stayed for a 3 month cycle. I imagine they lost a very large amount of re-suscribers with this poor timing.<br />
<br />
Why not test this peices of crap another few weeks or a month and at least see if they can get some new subscribers instead of running them off the same week they get the back. Pure stupidity, bad timing.</div></div><hr />
