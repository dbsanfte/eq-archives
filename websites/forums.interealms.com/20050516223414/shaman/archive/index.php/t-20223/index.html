<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In order to examine healing effectiveness, I estimated the healing power of a number of spells for clerics, druids, shamans, and paladins.  Healing power is the maximum rate at which a healer can repair damage dealt on their target by chain casting a particular spell.  I calculated healing power of direct heal spells as heal per second using the following formula:<br />
<br />
HPS = (amount healed)/(casting time + recast time)<br />
<br />
Here are healing power estimates for some high level direct heal spells:<br />
<br />
Cleric, Holy Light: 508<br />
Cleric, Supernal Light: 458<br />
Cleric, Supernal Remedy: 363<br />
Cleric, Ethereal Light: 228<br />
Cleric, Complete Healing: 612<br />
<br />
Druid, Sylvan Infusion: 335<br />
Druid, Karana's Renewal: 382<br />
Druid, Nature's Infusion: 291<br />
Druid, Nature's Touch: 126<br />
Druid, Tunare's Renewal: 239<br />
<br />
Shaman, Tnarg's Mending: 217<br />
Shaman, Kragg's Mending: 159<br />
<br />
Paladin, Light of Order: 156<br />
Paladin, Light of Nife: 141<br />
Paladin, Touch of Nife: 159<br />
<br />
Healing power for heal over time spells must be calculated differently.  Essentially, the recast time for is 4 ticks (24 seconds), although healing is distributed on a tick by tick basis rather than instantly.  HPS represents the average healing per second over the life of the HoT.<br />
<br />
Cleric, Holy Elixir: 79<br />
Cleric, Supernal Elixir: 71<br />
Cleric, Celestial Elixir: 43<br />
<br />
Shaman, Breath of Thrushar: 48<br />
Shaman, Quiescence: 40<br />
<br />
These calculations do not include the effects of AA's or focus effects, which I assume would have similar effects for all classes.<br />
<br />
From these calculations, it is evident that in terms of raw healing power, shamans rank with paladins, or slightly better.  Kragg's Mending much less powerful than either druid incomplete heal (ICH), and is essential equivalent in power to the two paladin heals introduced in GoD, neither of which are ICH.<br />
<br />
How does shaman slowing effect healing power for shamans?  The effect of slowing must be averaged over the time that healing is required.  The calculations here are a bit more complicated, so I will just summarize my findings.  For a mob doing 650 dps (not unreasonable by GoD standards) that is fully slowable (after casting Turgur's Insects and Malos), the effect of Tnarg's Mending is roughly equivalent to that of Holy Light on an unslowed mob.  Tnarg's Mending is over twice as effective as Sylvan Infusion on a slowed mob.  For a mob that is 50% mitigated, however, Tnarg's Mending is about 80% as effective as Sylvan Infusion.  If a mob is slowed with Balance of the Nihil without casting Malos, however, Tnarg's Mending is better than Holy Light on unmitigated mobs (this is because Balance has a rapid cast time of 1.5 sec).  On a 50% mitigated mob, slowing with Balance reduces the effectiveness of Tnarg's Mending to half that of Holy Light, and only slightly better than Sylvan Infusion.<br />
<br />
Healing capacity is another measure of healing effectivenss. It is the total amount of health that can be healed using a specified spell given the total amount of mana the healer has. It can be calculated as follows:<br />
<br />
Healing capacity = (healing power/mana cost) * mana pool<br />
<br />
In this thread  (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19080&amp;highlight=gardeltron)   I showed that mana costs are much higher for shamans than other priests due to high costs of debuffing.  Since their healing power is also lower than other priests, shaman healing capacity must be much lower.<br />
<br />
I conclude from this analysis that shaman healing is far less effective than other priests, and consequently, is unbalanced relative to GoD content.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If your intention was to just show the HPS numbers for the different heals, that's fine. <br />
If you want to link this to the healing abilities(HPS wise) of the different classes and how they compare to each other, you will have to elaborate on a few things.<br />
<br />
The best(in terms of HPS) Paladin heal, Light of Order, is listed as 156 HPS. This figure is only so low, because of the 5 second recast, however. If the Paladin decided to mem Light of Nife as well though, he would be increasing his personal HPS quite a bit by alternating his two heal spells.<br />
<br />
Just an observation.<br />
<br />
It's late, but how long are your fights actually. What is the time figure you are basing this analysis on?<br />
On the first glance it looks like you are ignoring the damage dealt by the mob, before it is slowed. Whether the mob dies in 30 seconds or 3 minutes has a huge impact on this, since you'd have to include the unslowed DPS into the HPS for the whole fight. <br />
If the mob stays unslowed for 10 seconds out of 30 is drastically increasing the HPS needed opposed to a 10 second unslowed DPS of a 3 minute fight.<br />
The analysis doesn't include many other factors and you are risking to over-theorizing(is that a word?) this à la Thott.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">These calculations do not include the effects of AA's or focus effects, which I assume would have similar effects for all classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just before I head to bed, this sentence couldn't be more wrong. Discarding AAs like Divine Arbitration or the fact that Holy Light would gain substantially more HPS from healing AAs and foci basically distorts the picture.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd add 15 mana to every second we'd spend casting a heal and waiting for gems to refresh for a more accurate representation of mana investment<br />
<br />
Oh and man...335hp/sec versus 217. They're not even on the same planet =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If we're talking solely about fast heals, I wrote this up for an earlier post.  Since the cast and recast times are all almost identical, you can also look at it in a purely hp healed to mana ratio and draw conclusions about where shaman should be in terms of pure fast heals.<br />
<br />
Looking at the previous fast heals, we have:<br />
Cleric: Supernal Light (2750 hp, 600 mana, 3.75 cast) 4.58 hp healed/1 mana.<br />
Druid: Nature's Infusion (1750 hp, 500 mana, 3.75 cast) 3.5 hp healed/1 mana.<br />
Shaman: Tnarg's Mending (1300 hp, 450 mana, 3.75 cast) 2.88 hp healed/1 mana.<br />
<br />
Looking at the new fast heals in GoD, we have:<br />
Cleric: Holy Light (3050 hp, 660 mana, 3.75 cast) 5.30 hp healed/1 mana.<br />
Druid: Sylvan Infusion (1925 hp, 550 mana, 3.5 cast) 3.5 hp healed/1 mana.<br />
Shaman: Erny's Mending ??????<br />
<br />
<br />
Mathematically, a Shaman's Tnarg's healed ~47% as much as a Cleric's Supernal Light, and ~75% as much as a Druid's Nature's Infusion. A Druid's Nature's Infusion was ~64% as effective as a Cleric's Supernal Light.<br />
<br />
Now in GoD, a Druid's Sylvan Infusion is still ~64% as effective as a Cleric's Holy Light. Along these same lines, assuming that our new heal should still be ~47% as effective as a Cleric's Holy Light, and ~75% as effective as a Druid's Sylvan Infusion, then our new heal should heal for approximately 1435 hp. Given that the mana ratio's for the most part remained the same on the new spells, with the exceptions of the cleric's, our new heal should then cost us ~500 mana.<br />
<br />
<br />
IN SUMMATION:<br />
IF we are going to contend that our healing power should remain in line with these numbers, our new heal will be: Erny's Mending: (1435 hp, 500 mana, 3.75 cast) 2.88 hp healed/1 mana. With these numbers, we maintain the status quo of healing ~75% as much as a Druid and ~47% as much as a Cleric.<br />
<br />
IF we ask for a 1600 hp heal, using these mana ratios, it will look like this: Erny's Mending (1600 hp, 556 mana, 3.75 cast) 2.88 hp healed/1 mana. BUT with a 1600 hp fastheal, Shamans now heal ~83% as much as a Druid's fast heal and ~52% as much as a Cleric's.<br />
<br />
IF we ask for a 1700 hp heal, using these mana ratios, it will look like this: Erny's Mending (1700 hp, 590 mana, 3.75 cast) 2.88 hp healed/1 mana. BUT with a 1700 hp heal, Shamans now have a fast heal that heals ~88% as much as a Druid's and ~56% as much as a Cleric's.<br />
<br />
IF we ask for an 1800 hp heal, using these mana ratios, it will look like this: Erny's Mending (1800 hp, 625 mana, 3.75 cast) 2.88 hp healed/1 mana. BUT with an 1800 hp fast heal, Shamans now have a fast heal that heals ~94% as much as a Druid's and ~59% as well as a Cleric's.<br />
<br />
<br />
Given that we would only be receiving a new fast heal, and not a complete heal, going with an 1800 hp heal would not be as overpowering as these numbers suggest.  If we tweeked the cast time so that it was much quicker, closer to a cast time of 1-2 seconds, and then extended the recast time, we would now effectively have an emergency heal.  After focus/aa, an 1800 hp heal would begin to make a dent in tanks which have &gt;10k hp and since we're not looking to take over the position as main healer, these changes would be extremely effective and beneficial.  With an 1800 hp heal, we would now at least be effective as a backup/secondary healer when things become shoddy.<br />

<br />
HoT's are notoriously underpowered.  Note that SC has a very long recast time (30sec) as do the two paladin group heals.  SC has a HPS of around 30, similar to the two group heals.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The solution to this is faster cast and a moderate recast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure how to respond to your several points.  To elaborate a bit, in looking at the effect of slow on the shaman heal, I assumed that the mob DPS (650) exceeded HPS and calculated the amount of time before a 9000 hp tank reached zero hp.  I assumed that the same mob for a cleric or druid was unslowed.  For a shaman casting slow before healing, I assumed that damage was unmitigated or unhealed for 8 sec (cast time for Turgur's + Malos).<br />
<br />
As far as focus effects are concerned, most focus effects such as Improved Healing IV (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3501&amp;source=Live)  increase amount healed by a set percent.  Clearly there would be a significant difference between a shaman with IHIV and a druid without, for example.  The same would be true for priest archtype AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Looking at Howler and Juujuu's calculations on healing efficiency and mine on healing power, it's clear to me that the most glaring omission in our healing abilities is an upgrade to Tnarg's Mending.<br />
<br />
An 1800hp quick heal would put us back into the equation as healers.  An upgrade to Breath of Thrushar would not.</div></div><hr />

That does not seem to include 2.25 seconds for the spell gems to refresh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">That does not seem to include 2.25 seconds for the spell gems to refresh.<br />
<br />
I believe you're right Murtak.  So my calculations were too optomistic.  I redid them using 10.25 as the time during which no healing can take place by a shaman, and the results were as follows:<br />
<br />
On a fully slowed mob, Tnarg's is about 84% as effective as Holy Light on an unslowed mob, but is more effective than Sylvan Infusion on an unslowed mob.  For a 50% mitigated mob, Tnarg's is about 78% as effective as Sylvan Infusion on an unslowed mob.<br />
<br />
Another interesting result was that on a 50% mitigated mob, our healing with Tnargs is about the same as healing by a paladin on an unslowed mob.<br />
<br />
I think it is safe to say that Malos + Slow + Tnarg's gives shamans parity with druids healing when a mob is unslowed, and still leaves us far short of clerics healing damage on unslowed mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Here is an interesting idea for the capacity of a high DPS mob till slowed.  <br />
<br />
What about giving the shaman an AA that allowed this effect:<br />
<br />
Stinging Wort Potions <br />
Effect: Calimony <br />
+17 STR, +300 HP upon drinking, then -2 HP per tick for 6 min<br />
<br />
Except it would be an AA and a group effect that would boost the groups HPS over a limited amount of time.  <br />
<br />
Boost hps would not really be healing, not sure if that would create aggro or not.  <br />
<br />
This is just a conceptual idea.....</div></div><hr />

Shouldn't that be 11.5 seconds?  5 for malos + 2.25 refresh + 3 for slow + 2.25 refresh until you can start casting a spell?<br />
<br />
Just out of curiosity, have you done the caculations for Necromancer healing?</div></div><hr />

Hmmm, suppose it should be.  Shaman healing with slow is starting to look pretty darn bad.<br />
<br />
Just out of curiosity, have you done the caculations for Necromancer healing?<br />
<br />
Heh, wouldn't it be ironic if necromancers could out heal us?  I'll look into it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That would be 12.5 secs  :p .<br />
<br />
Not really to nitpick this time, just incase you want to recalculate your numbers.</div></div><hr />
