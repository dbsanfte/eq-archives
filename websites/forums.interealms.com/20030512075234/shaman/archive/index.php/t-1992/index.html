<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am up to this part but I havent found much info if anyone who has fought him could post any info I would be very great full. I know that he HT's once and all 4 guards do to. I also know that the guards will repop if VSR is still standing. What I am looking for is HP, resists, things of that nature. Thanks in advace and be safe all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ok we tried him and failed. The reason was simple we didnt know what was going on and the chanter got droped. Here is what happens.<br />
<br />
The appertion and the fight are in the big room with the stage with the locked door that leads to the portal out. When you give the box to the appertion VS and Sprit of Rile will pop on the stage and start to fight. You can NOT attack VS at the point. It is scripted and you can not target him. The 4 gurads pop in a line across the center of the room inbetween the locked door and the hole in the wall. You can attack, mez, slow and debuff them while VS and SoR are fighting. Once VS kills SoR he will come off the stage to fight you can now deal with him.<br />
<br />
Here is what I would sugjest. Pull the appertion out of the room mezed or charmed. And kill all room pops. I dont know if you can hand in the box while he is charmed but it seems like you can if he is just mezed he cons the same when just mezed. I would hail him and see if he asks for the box. Now he will aggro on any non iksar that get close to him. So if he dosent respond you will have to have everyone move back and camp out that he has aggro on. If he dose ask for the box while mezed then you should be able to just turn it in NP but this is just my thory atm and I will test it next time. <br />
<br />
Now you have handed him the box outside of the room all 6 mobs will pop and VS and SoR will start to fight. Send in the tanks to eat the HT's (runes and a celest heal will help) give them about 5 seconds then the chanter and shm go in and mez and slow the 4 guards. One tank sould go up on the stage has soon has possable so that he gets the first aggro when VS is done with SoR. VS's HT is 800 and change I forget the exsact damage and it recycleys quickly so dont relie on just CH's throw some quick heals in there to. Max hit is 250ish I dont recall off hand. VS looks like a big snow dervish thats made out of bones. And he will pop on the right side of the stage has you face it. <br />
<br />
The mistakes we made was that I handed in the box inside the room so I got nailed right off. Things where going ok I was resed back in at once. The other big probllem was that we really didnt know what to exspect. I thought we would be able to fight VS right off.  Well at about the time VS came off the stage muliti mezs broke at the same time and the chanter got droped. From there it was a mad house of confusion. Even with VS the 4 guards and a few room repops running around we still got VS to about 25%. So the key seems to be keeping the 4 gurads mezed. And at least 1 of the guards is a healer so that didnt help. Well hopefully I will try agine soon. Once I have a secsefull kill on him I will post agine with more info.<br />
<br />
Be safe all and good luck</div></div><hr />

Hrm, 800 HT? 4 guards? Doesn't seem that bad. You know the classes of all the guards?<br />
<br />
I'm trying to figure out the full force required for this guy.<br />
I've also herd about the apperation despawning before turn in, can anybody explain what they did in case of this event?<br />
<br />
Hits for 250? Can he be slowed as well?<br />
From what I'm seeing one solid group should be able to take him out:<br />
All 60 - CLR, SHM, ENC, TNK, DMG, DMG<br />
<br />
The apperation has bee my biggest concern. You moved him out. How did others go about this?<br />
And no, you can't turn in anything while an NPC is mezed. :(<br />
Charm won't work either, even if your had the ability to charm. Faction won't be high enough ( just Amiable doesn't work, need higher ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yea the HT's from him was like 874 something like that it may even be a proc the MT said he didnt see anyplace where VS started to cast a spell when he looked back. I dont know if HT has any text like that I never thought about it till now. And has for amiably con that is what the appertion coned to me with or with out mez so you can hand in the box to pop the mobs with that con. I do doubt that charm would work tho. I belive the guards only HT onces but I cant swear to it. Has for the classes of the guards they are named... <br />
Arisen Disciple<br />
Arisen Priest<br />
Arisen Necromancer<br />
Arisen Acolyte<br />
So I would say a monk, healer, Necro, and wizzy. I dont recall any spells that where casted but things happened pretty fast. I would still sugjest pulling the apperion out to hand in the box. The guards HT for 700+ I had 3.4K hp's and I droped like a rock. If you figure the HT's at 750 thats 3K hp right there. So even if you do live throug it odds are your clr will now have aggro and thats not good. <br />
<br />
I would say that 1 group could do this. And you also have to have a rog. And sinces you have a rog you wont need ports out thay can open the door to the portal to OT which is right there. But at the same time Wiz and Dru nukes could help a lot so if you have a few extra people that want to come with I wouldnt turn them away if they are good players. For a single group figure Clr Shm Enc War Rog are a must the last spot could be filled by just about anyone really.<br />

How we moved him out was the chanter keept him charmed while we cleared the room mob's. She then took him up to the stage and everyone but me went into the hall way with the fake wall at the end out of aggro range. The chanter then broke charm and mezed him. When back to everyone eals and camped out and came back. Once she was back I hailed him and he said something about the realicks. (he may have still been mezed I dont know was a lv60 enc and she was back pretty quick) I then handed him the box he despawned and VS, SoR, 4 gurads pop. I tried to get to the group but only made it about half way across the floor. Tanks and chanter went to work. I was resed back in, looted got a heal. Chanter droped and we got waxed all in the space of say 4 minit's. For the first 2 I would say you cant fight VS. I was resed back and looted and VS was still fighting SoR for about another 30 seconds after I finnished looting.</div></div><hr />
