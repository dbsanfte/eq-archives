<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">A slow that affects spell casting - that is a good idea, and a reasonable extension of the melee slows in game now.  Good idea, Fenira (yeah, others have mentioned in past, I know)<br />
<br />
Vendor sold Malo and/or Torpor may be too much to ask for, but it sure seems reasonable to add more mobs that drop these spells.  The Tribunal and their mini-bosses should drop level 60 shaman spells, INCLUDING Malo and Torpor.  Or perhaps they should give out quests for AE/lure-resist/PBAE slows or MR debuffs. <br />
<br />
A Cripple that more clearly prevents flurries and rampages?<br />
<br />
Stat Buffs that make a bigger difference, a more measurable diffference.  ok, lost cause - hopes and prayers should be addressed to EQ2 development team.<br />
<br />
No one has mentioned the long desired heal that could allow shaman (and druids) to keep up with heals in an experience group.  mini-torpor or mini-Celestial Heal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>korinna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Grow does work outside btw, at least in pog it does. I would love to see a group shrink and a group grow you can cast on other groups.<br />

A fire based DD would be nice, cold is always resisted or even a magic base DD. <br />
<br />
I have Topor but would love to see it easier for other shamans to get and get rid of the snare effect  :)<br />
<br />
and fiannaly a ae line of dd thats not going to hurt me when i cast it, that rain spell seems almost useless.</div></div><hr />

Or... something that drains int+wis the same way as above.   Heck maybe even transfer it to the shaman for a temp period of time.<br />
<br />
Cause hunger.  Probably won't do much to mobs though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">i think you guys misunderstood rains.<br />
380 mana for a 1620 dmg dd? 3 resist chances, but theres lots of low pr mobs around. <br />
alternatively, you can hit 2 mobs for 2160 dmg, excellent in certain areas, the ae isnt all that big, hide damnit. so it requires the grey matter to be older than 4 years, but it's not excactly hard :)<br />
<br />
we have lure slow, it's called plague of insects 25%, it's for those cute mobs youre not allowed to slow, but hey, grats, you can cast this instead.<br />
20% lure slow magic would find a nice place at page 32 in my book :)<br />
<br />
i'm curious as to why we have disease cloud and no later ae dots tho :)<br />
i dont want a fire based dd, i want an upgraded poison dd.</div></div><hr />

More DoTs, more nukes, more pets. A 90% slow would be funny but way broken. a recast-time slow... now there's something :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I would love a shrink that worked on others out of group and could be cast outdoors.<br />
<br />
I think shamans should get a critical debuff AA skill. This skill would be like spell casting fury and you could get a critical debuff and increase the spells effectiveness by a small amount. There could be 3 levels that give a 5% cumulative increase.<br />
<br />
I would be so happy with just those two changes. I think our class is pretty complete. It will be interesting to see what they come up with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">No Black, Disease slows are NOT lure based. If a mob is IMMUNE it is exactly that Immune to changes in speed. No slow or spell with slow as a partial effect will land. The PoI spell was stuck in to help out with mobs that are not Immune but are intentionally high MR, as it saves vs disease.<br />
<br />
To &quot;Fix&quot; slow Id like to see a disease line thats nearly equal to the Turgur line. and a lure based short term slow (1 min - 1.5 min) for 20 - 30 percent thats AA related and hits ALL encounters. put a 20 or 30 min recycle to keep it from becoming another issue of 2 shaman working and the other 3 chatting till some one goes LD. At least that way there would be something AA related for us to strive for and do as a class on large raids.<br />
<br />
But I think our best angle is Curses. Curses are most definatly the realm of the spirit (if ya dont believe me I WILL stick another pin in  my VI dolly). So that seems to be the best line for us to pursue in our quest to have something to do at a raid. Dont make them dots for damage, make them dots to stats and abilities like the mobs that use them on us now.</div></div><hr />

Really I like where we are at as a whole though. I dont want an epic &quot;upgrade&quot; that will take away its dot though.. far too useful as is.. and any clicky slow would cast way too slowly I bet.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps another Focus that adds Agi, Sta, and AC or Attack.  Though I can see probable stacking issues with that because of the AC or Attack component.  Maybe make them small enough that it isn't out of balance when used with forms or cleric buffs. <br />
<br />
A spell that slows cast time.<br />
<br />
Summon a mob.  Hehe, since we cannot snare without the proper equipment.  If we see a mob running summon the mob back tothe group.  heck they do it to us.  Give it a longish cast time 10-15 secs or so and a level limit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">i think you misunderstand, the mobs who are flagged immune, are flagged immune for a reason. so theres a few mobs around we cant slow at all, so what? in effect it would make zero difference, they'd have to increase the dps of existing immune mobs by the % of the new slow.<br />
i'm aware of why disease slow was added, and i said so :) it IS the lure slow in effect.<br />
<br />
yes i like the idea of needing several shm's to slow sorta, but it'd be more like forced. see you'd NEED x shm's for certain raids, theres already this need for other classes, i'd rather not be sitting around waiting for shm's to log in as well :) rather make them less important.<br />
<br />
theres a total of 2? mobs or something needing the disease slow<br />

/ooc You will not evade me an_Annoying_Gater01!<br />
<br />
Slow cast time would be sort of nerfing it because by the time you've cast it off, the mob is out of sight/range and it don't work. Would have to be coded different.<br />
<br />
Lure spells are just really hard to resist (or harder). If it's immune it's immune. You won't slow CT/AoW/etc no matter how hard it is to resist.<br />
<br />
Personally I think the disease one was added so that mobs that were a REAL PITA to slow could at least be slowed a little. Messd up disease counters let you cast it nice nad early too.<br />
<br />
I want an better AE slow (66%) and some new AE dots. If Verant really wants PCs to be killing multiple mobs at once they should at least give us the tool to do it.</div></div><hr />

Off topic a bit, but I always thought that replacing the DoT on the Epic with a Slow would be nice...better defines our role IMHO. <br />
<br />
I agree with this. I've always felt that the shaman epic should be something like a nearly non-resistable 75% slow. That's pretty much what the high end shamans really are known for and not having to slow the mob would save a lot of mana.<br />
<br />
I don't know if the dot is really that uber. I know those out there with the mystic pig-sticker use it a lot but is it really that &quot;uber&quot; or just an added benefit? I think having the slow would be more shaman-y and useful. Like the clerics' click-stick is really what their class is about. <br />
<br />
Slow or nice heals would be good. What do you epic weilders think? Is the epic dot more nifty than a slow or heal?<br />

You wouldn't believe the train I made in Chardok with just Run Speed 3.  We had a bad overpull with Korucust, and I managed to run all the way to the zone.  Sadly, the zones pathed back THROUGH the fort and completely wiped out an AOE group.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I think my top 5 would be:<br />
<br />
1. Lesser Torpor (level 50, 600pt heal, over 24 seconds for 100 mana) Soandso falls into a state of lesser torpor.. ect...<br />
2. Spirit Shackles (AE root, 100 mana, level 39 up to 4 targets, not PB)<br />
3. Infectious Wound (Self only buff, dot for 200 dmg over 10 mins to self, whenever something hits you, it has a chance of &quot;spreading&quot; to them {they get a 300 pt dot over 2 mins} level 34, 150 mana)<br />
4. Swarm of Insects(20% slow, disease based, 150 mana, level 44)<br />
5. Talisman of the Ant (Group shrink, level 50, 250 mana)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">AE malo sounds ok, i bet it drops lots more than regular Malo too.<br />
Id like a point blank Torrent of poison or at least take off the beta restriction on mobs under 10% resisting all rain spells.<br />
<br />
To be honest our slows right now pretty much broke the game already, i dont expect a better slow any time ever.<br />
<br />
Putting donlo's dementia as a regular spell would be pretty cool. <br />
AE insideous decay would be great for factioning. A new pet spell would be nice or just a few more spell upgrades. <br />
We are still pretty overpowered as a class, dont hold your breath for anything big.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>mogug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Ok heres are a few thougts:<br />
<br />
Self or group only Super root!  Sticks you to the spot no matter what for 45 seconds. Makes you immune to summoning Mobs.<br />
<br />
LEAVE THE EPIC ALONE! ... the epic is half the reason I can solo with little downtime.<br />
<br />
DROP our casting times on our dots. 6+ seconds for them is insanely long in a fight.<br />
<br />
An upgrade to Malo that has -60 to resists<br />
<br />
A spell that removes ATK from enemies, I mean a really nasty drop ... like 400. Make it Disease based. (I play on PvP imagine taking 400 atk from a mean SK or monk.)<br />
<br />
Upgrade to regrowth 2 versions: 1- regens 10 HP/tick and has a base 25% chance per tick of curing any disease or poison (5 minute duration and nasty mana cost /// 2- 10 hp/tick and has a 25% chance per tick of curing a curse, same duration and mana cost<br />
<br />
Double attack say to 75 skill (I know not a spell but hey a nice addition)<br />
<br />
A spell that locks the top 4 buffs on you so they cannot be dispelled. Dispell still works just starts at buff spot 5<br />
<br />
anyway just a few thoughts<br />
<br />
Mogug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">What I don't want: More Avatar-line spells. If it wasn't for the extra ATK, I doubt this spell would be used at all in the high end game.<br />
<br />
A lot of the people here are leaning towards AEs, and that makes things a lot simpler for Shamans, but keep in mind we don't want to dumb it down too much. Shaman00 begins to cast a spell, and every mob in range is slowed/Maloed/dotted/rooted. IMHO, the only AE-type spells we should get are Rains and group buffs. Everything else is the domain of other casters.<br />
<br />
What I'd like to see: diversification of our buffs, dots, and debuffs. Throw in a few of those types of spells that do things in a different way than what we've already seen and gotten used to. The fellow who suggested the Infectious Disease had a great idea, use it. Maybe some spells/skills based off our Alchemy skill level. You'd think tinkering with herbs and spices and such would grant us an insight into the way the body works, why not take greater advantage of that in combat? Maybe use Alchemy as part of a new Shaman spell quest? Combine X Alchemy items, receive spell; require a relatively high skill for success.<br />
<br />
One idea/change I'd *really* like to see would be a pet spell that summons a pre-sowed pet. For the love of God, what IS our pet if not THE SPIRIT OF A WOLF? Always bothered me having to cast &quot;Spirit of Wolf&quot; on a Spirit Wolf. <br />
<br />
Maybe start relating spell drops to areas where you'd logically think they'd drop. IE: An upgraded Disease-based DOT spell dropping in the Plane of Disease. If anyone would know how to cast a Disease spell, it'd be the inhabitants of that Plane, right?<br />
<br />
What I'd really like to see (nothing to do with spells) would be some new blood in the mob AI. Adapt it a little to what's generally accepted as our playstyle. Look at it this way; if the player were in the mob's position, what would the player do vs. other players? He's not going to go willingly by himself against a crowd of 50 unless he's pretty damn sure he'll be able to kill them all. He's sure as hell not going to go right for the melees, he'll see the Clerics CH and kill them to prevent it from happening. I think a lot of the EQ experience is getting a little watered-down in terms of challenge, I'd like to see it spiced up in a way that doesn't involve my screen going black or mobs spawning in waves.<br />
<br />
Maybe make mobs that are &quot;grouped&quot;. Balance it out, have them act along the same lines as a group of players. Be neat to see mobs debuff and mez your chanter ;)</div></div><hr />

Make it:  Curse of the witch doctor, no initial dd damage just like epic spear, unresistable, uncurable, just like wizards get MB, necros get LB, sks get HT, rangers am3, druids/enc dire charms, what do we get????  rabid bear? Please I am not a warrior.  If rabid bear was a lv60 pet for 3 mintues that always hit and always followed the target sort of like a astral attacker, cool but not rabid bear the way it is now.  I refuse to do aa's because our class defining ones suck (cann 5 is semi good).<br />

AE Malo would be excellent, but it would only drop from a level 90 mob in the back of Vex Thal that spawns when you clear Air in under 30 minutes. It would despawn in 15 seconds.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
a new dot about 45 sec to 1 min long <br />

I agree with a manaburn type dot<br />
<br />
cripple line that reduces flurry <br />
<br />
like the idea of a casting slow<br />
<br />
have right clicky shaman ONLY dolls each one is planar quested and has unlimited charges of different curses. Kinda follows the idea of a shaman (witch doctor)<br />
<br />
a bind wound buff allowing us to imbue bandaids to add to their healing abilities for those who bind wounds follows shaman idea of healer<br />
<br />
imbue weapon with a degrading or single charge poison attack<br />
<br />
an ultimate pet I like my puppy but I want a pet or pet buff that will allow it to keep up with a good group power grinding.</div></div><hr />

i like the idea of an AE maloXXX spell... even if the resist debuff is lower.  and i HATE the long recast on turgur's.    and a must have is a way to shrink out of group.... if anyone has every been the only shaman on a raid shrink all 30+ people you know how hellish it is :)</div></div><hr />

 You wouldn't believe the train I made in Chardok with just Run Speed 3. We had a bad overpull with Korucust, and I managed to run all the way to the zone. Sadly, the zones pathed back THROUGH the fort and completely wiped out an AOE group <br />

AE Malo would be ok, but honestly I just want a better nuke.  That's all I want.  That would make me happy.  More nukes, better nukes, a different sort of nuke perhaps.

3 chances to resist, the mob has to stay in 1 spot.  Each hit can break his root making him able to move and miss the next 2 waves.  <br />
<br />
Also waves are broken.  If there is more than one mob the rain only hits once.  However if an NPC shaman casts it on your group it hits the full 3.  Go to cazic thule if you dont believe me.  Our rain spells are broke!</div></div><hr />

I think my top 5 would be:<br />
<br />
1. Lesser Torpor (level 50, 600pt heal, over 24 seconds for 100 mana) Soandso falls into a state of lesser torpor.. ect...<br />
2. Spirit Shackles (AE root, 100 mana, level 39 up to 4 targets, not PB)<br />
3. Infectious Wound (Self only buff, dot for 200 dmg over 10 mins to self, whenever something hits you, it has a chance of &quot;spreading&quot; to them {they get a 300 pt dot over 2 mins} level 34, 150 mana)<br />
4. Swarm of Insects(20% slow, disease based, 150 mana, level 44)<br />
5. Talisman of the Ant (Group shrink, level 50, 250 mana) <br />
<br />
<br />
lol #1 = Superior Healing,  no point<br />
like #2 &amp; 3 though<br />
20% slow is kinda pointless, but it might help a little on nagafin or something for those little ones.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">would really be nice for us to get upgrades to the poison DD line.  a slow/splurt effect on the epic.  druids get snare/dot...<br />
maybe some high mana not to high damage dot that could be cast on undead luclin mobs (i have yet to land any of my dots on them even at lvl 59).  grow/shrink outside group would rock, torpor too.  anther class specific AA point would be nice, i mean come on, who the hell really wants the alchemy one anyway.  better looking graphic for our epic wouldn't hurt either.  i wouldn't mind to see you epic on fire like the pally one or something.  an upgraded AE dot would really be nice.  you could take the risk at 4 mobs at one time solo (not sure if you would want to depending on where you are).  agi/stam buff that stacks with HoS and focus.  ya, a spell to make rain would be worthless but never the less cool.  maybe some sort of spell that can morph the form of your pet, worthless but cool.  a summon alchemy components spell.  last but not least a spell to slow cast time (i dont understand why they have not put this in the game yet anyway...)<br />

I don't like the idea of changing the epic dot - a slow on it wouldn't cast fast enough or have enough range to be useful I think, and a heal would be nice but not in keeping with the character. IMHO of course.<br />
<br />
Whoever said &quot;lesser torpor&quot; would be pointless is wrong, if it healed 600 hp for 100 mana, that's a lot more efficient than superior heal which does about 585 for 250 mana. And the torpor side effects would (possibly) balance this out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will try to add my coppers to this thread.<br />
<br />
some spells i feel could help us:<br />
- group shrink, as discuted above,<br />
- better haste, not more efficient, but with longer duration, oe even a group haste.<br />
- improved invisibility (&quot;Hide of the Spirit&quot; could be a nice name for that one :) ... because i'm tired of dying because my invis droped right in front of a mob, or to have to cast invis again on a group member right after i invised myself)<br />
- regrowth with longer duration, at cost of more mana.<br />
- AOE debuffs could be nice too.<br />
<br />
<br />
it was suggested on some post that tribunal or mini bosses could drop spells.<br />
I don't agree with this.<br />
I may be wrong, but i imagine this Plane could be the place where followers of Tribunal gather. and I barely imagine killing followers of my god to have the spells i need.<br />
so what about for example something like 10 quests, all related to our duties: A murderer to punish, a stolen item to find and give back to its original owner (why not in a dangerous place :) ), .... <br />
We could be awarded a random spell of a certain level for each quest. the harder the quest, the higher the level of spell.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, one last point, that could lead to a new spell, but not only for shamen:<br />
Is it really logical to think that wizards (and only wizards) can port to these places dedicated to deities?<br />
why don't imagine some or all casters of a deity would be able to lead a ceremony in sort of a sacred place, and there cast a &quot;portal opening to Plane of xxxxx&quot;?<br />
such a portal would stay open for a few minut, or would need to be opened for each group.<br />

Plague of Bertox<br />
Dmg: 5% of the mob's max health over one minute<br />
Recast: 3 min<br />
Cost: 1000 mana<br />
Relatively low resists, but can be resisted<br />
<br />
This way, 3 shaman working together (rolling the dot) could do significant damage to high end mobs that have loads of HP.  Obviously, this is a spell that wouldn't be used on non-raid lvl mobs due to the fact that the damage is proportional to the mob's total HP which would make it ineffiecent. <br />
<br />
Our top of the line DoT (Pox) is two expansions old and doesn't even scratch those mobs with 100k+ hp.  It'd be nice to have a spell that actually has decent DPS to a raid level encounter.<br />

<br />
I'd like another debuff: AE resist debuff sounds interesting, as does the idea for a slow that affects spellcasting. AE root seems to me best left to Druids. I wouldn't mind an upgrade to Cripple. How about a spell that drained hit points from a MOB and gave us mana? Like a cross between a lifetap and cannibalize.<br />
<br />
For lower levels, they really should consider making Cannibalize II a vendor-sold spell. It's no fun to still be using Cannibalize I at Level 50.<br />

Agreed, the DPS would be off the charts on mobs with that much HP.  So, tweak it a bit.  Make the recast 30 minutes to limit how many times it could be cast during a fight, or change the duration to 6 minutes with a 18 min recast, or cap it at a max of 10k damage, or make it do 5% of the mob's *current* HP.  This was just an idea to give a shaman (who were supposed to be the &quot;king of dots&quot;) a dot that can measure up to current raid mobs and provide some damage.</div></div><hr />

A PB healing spell. Equal to chloroblast. 500 mana.<br />
<br />
An Upgrade to regrowth line. 25 HP a tick. A group version as well.<br />
<br />
A Long duration Massive attack buff that is better than avatar. and Will not be overwritten with avatar. So an Oracle can tell primal weilders to kiss my ass. After so long of primal weilders commenting on how thier sword is a better buffer than I am<br />
<br />

<br />
The ability to purchase (With AA) Main hand damage bonus Modifyers  9 point Class AA<br />
<br />
A middle range Cannabalise spell. 900 hp for 500 mana. Sometimes Canna 5 is too much and Canna 4 just aint enough<br />
<br />
A new dot. Based off the curse of the spirits line. (No inital damage) That hits harder on the last few tics. I mean alot harder. We are great at outlasting a monster make our dots have some real bite to them<br />

All I want are spells that make shaman MORE useful on raids.  So removing the group restriction on Torpor falls into that.   Additional interesting Debuffs, or a Lure 5, 10, 20% slow Alt Ability that has a 30 minute recast.   That would force them to take more shaman who have the ability with them if they're facing more than one mob that needs to be slowed with it ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">I'd like to see a sta/agi/cha buff at level 60 that complements focus.  Call it Protection of the Spirits.  Group version would also be nice.<br />
<br />
I would also like to see upgraded offensive abilities of some type post 55.<br />
<br />
Rabid bear = bad joke.  fix please.<br />
<br />
Three levels of Alchemy Mastery = slap in da kissah.  Let's just delete these outright.  No use for them.  Alchemy post SoW potion was barely alive until it was killed by gate icons/thurg gate potions, etc.  Even SoW potions are barely worth making with vendor sold tboots, horses, etc. Let's all pretend alchemy doesn't exist.  There, don't that make ya feel better?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Looking a bit at the non lvl60 shaman, I realize that at low levels we are stuck with Inner Fire as our only buff up until lvl34, when we get Tnarg.<br />
<br />
I'd love to see a lvl24 spell 'Talisman of XXXX' that buffs about 75hps.<br />

Increasing our melee abilities would make my day, hell my month, but is hardly realistic after they gave us Rabid Bear. Can always dream.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">59 pet (how about a skellie wolf instead of the ghosts they give us now)<br />
or a non-level restricted charm animal<br />
targetable true north (makes raid preparation so much easier if you position the mob)<br />
group topor<br />
group avatar<br />
ancient: fire strike (or a similar dd non cold based)<br />
poison wave (similar to mana burn, just poison based dot)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">An AE Malo strikes me as overpowered.  Unresistable + area affect = kinda gimmie.  <br />
<br />
I do really like the idea of a improved Malo that drops resists 5 or 10 more.  Please, please, please make it a quest like PoTC though.  I don't care if it's a huge time sink or I need multiple raids as long as it's not the lottery of disappointment that Malo and Torpor are.<br />
<br />
A better disease based slow.  The concept behind Plague of Insects was pretty cool, but in practice it's rarely worth casting.<br />
<br />
And, like I've said before, a pet at 60 that just looks big and mean.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">anyone notice that we got nerfed... with the compass?<br />
<br />
True North needs an upgrade..... maybe make it absolute north... and it should take into effect where Luclin is located....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Kushpok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">Spirit of Dolphin, for that ONE character who has never been anywhere underwater and has a swim skill of 4 (from falling off a boat and swimming back to the docks).  Take their swimming skill up to 200 effectively for their swim speed, but still allows for skill ups in swimming.  Possibly add in a componentless enduring breath effect as well.<br />
<br />
Though I much prefer people to have their swim skill worked up just because.</div></div><hr />
