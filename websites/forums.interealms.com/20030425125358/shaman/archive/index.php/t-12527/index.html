<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, I just got my tear ( woot! ) on tuesday. I still need to take out neh though. so I was wondering if this make up of friends would be able to take out neh and rak in one night.<br />
<br />
group 1<br />
Me (probably 58 by the time)<br />
MT 62 sk<br />
60+ cleric<br />
63 mage<br />
65 monk<br />
55 bard ( resists )<br />
<br />
group 2<br />
64 druid<br />
61 ench<br />
64 rogue<br />
60+ mage<br />
54 BL<br />
52 BL<br />
<br />
*edit* I can always change the layout of the groups too. whatever you think would work better is fine by me =D<br />
<br />
I know the BL pets will probably eat it on aoe so Ill just ask then to chain summon. Im hopeing that the 64 druid can keep up heals on the mage pet. Ill be on the mage pet for gorup 1 while the cleric is on the MT. from what Ive heard rak is single group doable now with pop but you can never be too safe right? =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">update: I just finished my epic tonight. didnt use the groups as listed =D used quite less actually lol<br />
<br />
It was...<br />
58 shaman<br />
64 rogue<br />
62 pally<br />
64 druid<br />
63 cleric<br />
63 mage<br />
<br />
yeah I did it with one group, so dont freak out if you are short a few people lol<br />
<br />
this is how it went down. we pulled rak to the center of the castle and let the pally MT and the rouge do his thing. well the first go we didnt really have any idea what to do on heals lol that didnt work =D. second go it was the druid and cleric taking turns on the pally and me on the rogue. That worked like a charm. mage just chain summoned pets and he went down easy. didnt have any outside buffs eather. casters had PoTG and tanks got a virtue from cleric.<br />
<br />
If anyone is dreading the final fight, dont let it stop you. PoP has made it REALLY easy nowadays<br />
<br />
just wanted to say thanks for all the help you guys have given since I started to play the best class in EQ /grin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">MQ'd a tear for a guildly ( who had done the entire epic up to the tear) a few days ago. I resisted flamesongofro about 50% with a 200 FR. Had forgotten there is a knockback portion to it as well. <br />
<br />
Epic's arent so epic anymore. (difficulty wise)</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah.. I got my tear at 48, dinged 49 and took some friends to kill Rak.<br />
had a 65 warrior tank and a cleric to heal with a couple of friends out of AE range to bow attack ( nothing special aka rangers AM3 stuff )<br />
<br />
rak went down perty fast.  mage pet died 3 times. eheh<br />
<br />
only downside *grin* is not being able to use epic till 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I lucked out on my last two battles. I did it last week, brought a raiding force of about 3-4 groups and we never even needed to go past the first door. A 65 Necro was upstairs and was nice enough to pull down Neh's Reaver to the U-Bend. She went down pretty quick.<br />
<br />
By the time we got Rak to spawn I only had two mages left but the necro stayed. He claimed he could take Rak alone with a cleric but given everything I had a stake I called on a 62 mage friend. <br />
<br />
Basically the last battle with Rak consisted of a 55 and 56 mage using their Fire pets, The 62 mage using his 61 air pet and the 65 necro using his pet. Only the 55 mage had to chain cast his pet once. <br />
<br />
Rak never even had a chance to get his AoE off.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Neh'ashiir is actually more of a pain in the ass than Rak is, simply because of location. Neh ashiir requires that you run up three levels and kill a reaver. She's easy, but the travel there is boring and there really isn't a shortcut.<br />
<br />
And Rak? I agree with the above poster... the shaman epic at least, is laughable. I know 2 necros that duo Rak ashiir all the time. 2 people. A necro and a mage, or two mages could do it just as easily. Frankly I wouldn't be suprised if an uber one of those classes could solo it.<br />
<br />
Pets own this guy. I remember when I did my epic fight, 4 melees rushed in and died, and afterwards 3 pets were left standing (2 mage and 1 necro). They finished him off.<br />
<br />
And thanks to the floating eye trick (cast floaty eye, float through the door, target rak, and pull him out of the door with a dispell) you dont even need a rogue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>wsbsteven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well Krakster maybe you can help me out someday since they aren't so hard anymore.  Still can't score a tear so I can finish.</div></div><hr />
