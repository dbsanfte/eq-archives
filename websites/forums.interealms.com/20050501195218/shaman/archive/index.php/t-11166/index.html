<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bindare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i enjoy reading everyones posts as i am going to be restarting my shaman soon.  i also like seeing what others shamans have gearwise.  But my problem is everyone has their gear listed under magelo and no matter what i do i can't get magelo to pull up.  all i get is a bunch of garrble.  when i try to pull magelo.com up it says something about a security warning.  if anyone has any ideas about why this is happening or if there is a solution i would really like to know.  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is a solution.<br />
<br />
If you are a Windows XP user, download and install service pack 1.  That took care of the problem for me instantly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bindare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">oops forgot to put that down.  I am using Win ME.  i have tried using IE 6, Netscape and mozilla and i keep getting the same thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Genine Goosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Clear out your cache (including offline content) and also be sure to disable any pop up stoppers that you might have running. That did the trick for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mystt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This is YOUR ANSWER. I know this works.<br />
<br />
in the Internet Explorer follow these steps:<br />
<br />
Tools &gt; Internet Options &gt; Advanced &gt; use HTTP 1.1 through proxy connections <br />
<br />
MAKE SURE THIS IS CHECKED.  It will fix your issue.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mystt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Read above that is your answer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bindare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">thanks a lot that did the trick.  i never would have figured that out.  i still can't pull up the main site but atleast i can click on links and see everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jhumpy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">hi~ I also couldn't get Magelo to work. heh =\ I would sign in my account, click my gears, then go to update char equipment.. I'd click say.. The left ear, type in Black Sapphire Electrum Earring, then that earring would pop up.. I would click ok then it wouldn't appear~ =( Can I also get assistance on this please?:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bindare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">AAAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I restarted my computer and now i can't even go through links.  Maybe this comp is just a big pile of junk.  i went and made sure i did the HTTP 1.1 thru proxy and still nothing.  oh well i suppose it won't kill me to not be able to access the site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Try<br />
<br />
IE6 Settings<br />
<br />
Internet Explorer 6<br />
<br />
There are few things you need to check with IE 6... in no particular order:<br />
<br />
- Make sure you keep up with the latest IE 6 with critical updates from Microsoft (Tools -&gt; Windows Update -&gt; Scan for updates). Make it a habit to check this at least once a week for maximum compatibility.<br />
<br />
- Make sure Tools -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Use HTTP1.1 through proxy connections is checked ON (ie. checkmarked). Use HTTP should also be ON.<br />
<br />
- You should have your Security and Privacy levels set to medium. If it's higher or custom, make sure you know exactly what are the consequences (trying to set back to medium is a good idea to be sure it doesn't come from here). Medium high should be acceptable. Magelo does use a cookie to automatically log you in whenever you visit.<br />
<br />
- If you are using something like Norton Internet Security or Zone Alarm (its privacy settings), make sure you configure it properly to work with Magelo (see Zone Alarm or Norton HOWTOs in the library).<br />
<br />
- Clear your browser cache when you suspect IE is messing up (eg. displaying an old page or an empty dropdown list). Here's how: Tools -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Delete Files.<br />
<br />
- To keep IE's cache manager from outsmarting itself, set Tools -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Settings -&gt; Every visit to the page. This will go a long way towards allowing you to see the web content you've selected all the time, and not something else.<br />
<br />
- Finally, make sure you don't disable Javascript in the Advanced section of Tools -&gt; Internet Options. (hmm, where is it?)<br />
<br />
<br />
Internet Explorer 5 &amp; 5.5<br />
<br />
Your Mileage May Vary, as they say. Those old browsers are less secure, less capable and less compliant with current internet and web standards. If you can get either to work with Magelo, great, but don't expect that to continue. We move with the times. New techniques allow us to provide better, more interactive features efficiently.<br />
<br />
Always stay up to date and you'll be fine. Because by staying with an outdated browser you are reducing the size of the web you can use. Change or fossilize.</div></div><hr />
