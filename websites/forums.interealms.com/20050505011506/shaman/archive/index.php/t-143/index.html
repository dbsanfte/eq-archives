<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yesterday I was in crypt and all of my group had to log so I thought up an idea...why not try to solo in crypt, how hard could it be.  Just invis past the golems and just kill the rooms, so I tell my group and they head out and leave me there.  I'm sitting in hiero room, expecting a PH, and first pop  while soloing in there is named hiero WITH HIERO CLOAK.  <br />
<br />
       Well...he was a bit harder than I was expecting, he summoned, had a ton of hps, and hit for 145ish (I'm 59, no torpor).   I landed malosini, slow, epic, and bane of nife then started clicking my jbb as fast as possible, healing and re-epicing as needed.  <br />
<br />
       By the time he was at 30% hps I was totally oom and at 50% hps, now it became tough, I had to step back, let him summon me, run back out of range again and try to jbb before he summoned again to cut down on the dmg he did to me and let fungi \ regrowth work...and this plan worked!  <br />
<br />
       I finally took him down and by the time I did I had half a bub of hps left and was very tense from the fight :) but I won...and it is very satisfying to wear my new Hierophants Cloak that I can say I got off Hiero SOLO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lumor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wow,<br />
   Grats!!!  That must have been an intense fight!!  And to the victor goes the spoils :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Very nice...I have been so spoiled with torpor...don't know as I would have tried that area solo before 60, heheh.<br />
<br />
Grats</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Eh, other than that fight it was pretty easy (avoiding the golems with invis of course), but I seem pretty lucky, I got that yesterday and then today took a group down there and emp dropped malo for me, and then I won a copy of sunstrike (15kish)...I love the crypt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thats nuts...LOL.  No wonder you're proud of that :)<br />
<br />
I know of several people with hiero cloaks...none of which soloed the mob, that's for sure :)<br />
<br />
Congrats!<br />
