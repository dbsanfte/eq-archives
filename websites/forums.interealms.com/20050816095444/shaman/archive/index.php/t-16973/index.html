      This isn't a question, more of a comment as to my own stupidity!!  Log off at 12:30am last night after a raid.  3:00am, wife wakes me up, and tells me get up and let the cat out (it's making noise and we don't want the kids to wake up).  5:30am, 2 out of the 3 kids come into our room (6 year old, and 3 year old) (they share a room).  We discover that the 3 year old had wet his bed, so we stip the bed (ewwww).  The 3 year old goes to sleep with mommy, we put the 6 year old back to his own bed, and I Gallantly offer to go to sleep on the couch.  As I go down the stairs, my EQ obsessed brain thinks...&quot;wow, I'll bet Rathe Mountains are pretty deserted about now&quot;.  Well eventually, 7:00am rolls around the kids and wife come down the stairs, and I am (you guessed it) sitting in front of the comp killing Giants (hehehe).  My wife takes one look at me, shakes her head, and mutters something about her marrying an &quot;idiot&quot; (heheh).  What the heck, I did make over 1k!!<br />
<br />
Sigh, &quot;Boy am I tired right now&quot;!!   :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I usually get around 3-4 hours of sleep a night.  I'm up with the baby from 5pm till 7pm stay up with the wife till 11pm, then, it's my time.  I log in with some friends and make stuff dead.  With a snooze on the train in the morning and a cup of coffee, I'm golden.  I sleep in on the weekends.  My friends justifiably (even those who play EQ) think I'm nuts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heheheh...yupp, I'm with you there. The third child of mine is now 18 months, but I clearly remember the early morning routine!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">its refreshing to hear some of your stories! My son is 22 months and is in bed at 8:30pm, normally get on around 9pm and normally play in the same room as my wife (who's addicted to tv). When I can peel her away we do stuff. Friday though I move my computers to another room (kitchen) run my long ethernet cable out there and game all night. Its relaxing and loads of fun. Helps me unwind. Wife has a habbit of checking on me in the wee hours of the morning on friday to scorn at me and make rude noises which are very interesting considering she is half asleep.</div></div><hr />
