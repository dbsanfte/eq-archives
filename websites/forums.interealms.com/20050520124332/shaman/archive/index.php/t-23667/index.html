<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eci_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I didn't have power for a week due to Frances... so I haven't been paying much attention to anything internet related.<br />
<br />
Is OoW out now (as of 9/13/04) ?<br />
<br />
Is it a store bought product or only downloadable (like LoY) ?<br />
<br />
How much does it cost?<br />
<br />
If anyone is willing to answer these questions, I would greatly appreciate it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Comes out tommorow, Tuesday the 14th of September.  Expect a HUGE and LONG patch, though.<br />
<br />
You can buy it both ways.  Store bought comes with a particle effect that you can turn on and off for your character apparently.<br />
<br />
And I would guess $30 American</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Bought it via download, got the voice files and the zone music today.<br />
<br />
The zone music is great. This is probably the only part of EQ that has a clear improvement every expansion.<br />
<br />
The voice files... Oh my god. Two actors (Might be one, in some cases) doing the male / female voices of all the races. Half of them sound ripped from Neverwinter Nights, the other half from WoW (in particular, the Gnomes - which are the best of the lot, and actually not too awful)</div></div><hr />
