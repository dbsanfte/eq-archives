<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cloudchaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've played EQ off and on for a few months, long enough to get my druid main up to level 32 and a monk to 17, so I'm not an outright beginner. <br />
Maybe an advanced beginner. ;-)<br />
But I just bought Luclin last week, and I'm wanting to try out a Vah Shir character, and I've always wanted to try a shaman. But before I jumped into it and really invested time, I wanted to ask if there's any serios negatives to being a feline shaman?<br />
Most of the shammies I see are barbarians, but I tend not to play as humans in RPGs simply for the sake that I'm a human every day of my real life, and I don't want to have to be one in my fantasy worlds, too.<br />
So any feedback here would help, and if there's any major drawbacks, I'd appreciate a warning. Of course, if there's any big advantages, I'd like to hear those, too!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Falyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Honestly, if you like the idea of being a cat, and you want to try a shaman, I say *Why not?*<br />
<br />
Realistically, there are few differences between races (they all have their good and bad) so bottom line is play what you like. It *could* be argued the Iksar are gimped due to not being able to use a rare item, or that barbs are gimped due to lack of regen, or...etc, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
Think it would be cool to play a Vah Shir? Go for it, and enjoy it =)<br />
<br />
And pay no attention to the Trolls who will try and convince you that there is only one true path ;-)<br />
<br />
(I am only joking, Trolls =P)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Barbs do have slightly better stats but a small exp penalty as well.  In addition, barbs can slam.  Vah Shir have safe fall and eat twice as fast as other races.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Cats are the only Shammie race with 0 exp penalty.<br />
Cats have safe fall.<br />
Cats can use the JBB, a nice item once you get to higher levels.<br />
They also have generally good newbie hunting grounds.<br />
<br />
They lack regen, and a port stone.<br />
<br />
<br />
But none of that matters.<br />
<br />
Play what you want and enjoy the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tagra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My shammikins is nearly 55 and I must say she's a lot of fun.  Something about being a cat and summoning a wolf-pet....  Not only that, but we're the only shaman race that is actually attractive!  We start off with very decent charisma, unlike our Barbarian, troll, ogre or iksar cousins.   My only complaint is that Vah Shir females have an ugly slouch that makes them look like they've got dowager's humps.<br />
<br />
I think all the classes are fine.  Just play what you want.  You'll level like mad in Paludal caverns!<br />
<br />
The advantages are:<br />
<br />
You're cute and cuddly and liked most everywhere.  Shar Val has the spells very convienent.  Hunting in Luclin can be GREAT experience.  Lots of great quests and tradeskill quests and stuff.  <br />
<br />
The disadvantages are:<br />
<br />
Shar Val is a horrible zone for video lag.  Cats are agnostic and get no way-cool spiritstones or imbued/cultural stuff.  Beggers in Shar Val seem to be more annoying then most every other city.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The biggest problem with Vah Shir is that when they summon their pets, they spend all their time fighting them instead of the mobs!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i have tried all 5 shaman races(tho i only got iksar to lvl5!)<br />
<br />
my main is a 55 ogre, but i have given up on her, as i get annoyed with the racial exp in outdoor zones.<br />
<br />
Cats lvl FAST if u are twinking them, ther are drwbacks to them tho&gt;&gt;&gt;no diety is a big problem atmo :(<br />
<br />
I got my katt to 47 in 9 days played, however i still think troll best shaman race if u arent botherd about the 20% exp loss (i was  so i chose cat)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jagara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">probably not a big issue since you dont have high level mains to twink your kitty, but cats can't wear regular fungis, only the fungus patch vest which I haven't ever seen for sale...</div></div><hr />

<br />
sometimes persoanl interaction cant be replaced by a simple search engine . those are answers to other peoples question ;)<br />
<br />
then again sometimes it can :D<br />
<br />
<br />
personaly i luv the cats , i have a bard and a warrior cat . basicly its all about fun . all races are the same ( except the gimped lizzies, j/k hehe)<br />
barbs can get ikky BP and JBB and be great . lizzies have natural regen . troll just look cool ;)<br />
<br />
whatever is fun mate , whatever is fun ;)</div></div><hr />

ogers ur purty!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I had played my troll shaman to lvl 37 and rerolled a kat shaman because I was tired of the exp penalty.<br />
<br />
Think I got my kat to lvl 22 before I came back to my troll.  Just didn't care for the looks and being agnostic.<br />
<br />
Glad I came back to my troll.  With all the new toys coming out(port stones, diety armor,etc) I think I made the right decision.<br />
<br />
Plus I've never been one to play the goody goody races ;)<br />
<br />
Troll &gt; all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Alminah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Know this: <br />
Whichever race you go for, it will be a very good choice. No matter what, you'll rock... us shaman can't help ourselves in that aspect :) <br />
<br />
<br />
I've played all shaman races, and 3 of them well above 30 at least...<br />
<br />
Mums - my main shaman - is a troll by coincidence, but I'm honestly convinced that troll is the best race there is and I wouldn't switch her race even if I could freely. Trolls has it all... and no real negatives as I see it unless you're too bothered by exppenalty.<br />
<br />
My toy shaman is a vah shir, tho'... and she's doing quite well - just have to play a slightly different game than with the troll.<br />
<br />
Something about being a cat and summoning a wolf-pet....  <br />
I second that anyday :)<br />
<br />
She does wear a ikky regen bp but still I miss regen so badly, badly, badly and I actively miss the opportunity to slam. Those two things have made me thinking of changing the cat to another race. Sneak doesn't come close in making up for those, but as she is planar now and more of a toy I might stay with the cat just 'coz I'm lazy and a cats person in rl... heh<br />
<br />
<br />
...and just FYI... going from troll on a normal server with 20% exppenalty to a cat on SZ that has 20% expbonus... makes you feel like your cheating someway! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">luclin should be a worshippable goddess, thatd take away the agnostic drawback</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Purza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I will have to admit  that my Vah Shir shaman is the only character I have played in EQ and didn't even become a gamer until then.  I personally enjoy playing my shammy.  There is something about being a cat with a dog for a pet and turning into a bear.  But in the end do what ever you want!  The lag is a little bad in some zones, but I leveled well in Paludal, Marus Seru and Dawnshroud.  It was very easy to find my spells and my trainer in Shar Vahl.  Good luck with whatever race you decide to become!  Just have fun!!:D</div></div><hr />
