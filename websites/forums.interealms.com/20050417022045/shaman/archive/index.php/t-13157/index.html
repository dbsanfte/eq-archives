<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Trabayre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The old chardok zone in/out routine is good. I find chardok extremely dull, mainly because I was there from about level 54. One place I found very pleasant is Western Wastes. Kill bronties, mammoths and velium hounds. As long as your CoV faction is decent you won't have problems with the dragonkin. If you do go there get used to solitude, the zone is empty except for the occasional guild going to ToV. Just remember if you die you will probably go unrezzed - getting a cleric there is tough ;) <br />
<br />
Oh and avoid the Ice burrowers - they suck and are Red to you anyway</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>CaradocBertoxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd dry LZO in PoN - banshee's and wraiths but the Zone out by the hedge.<br />
<br />
or PoD defilers/goos biles/rats.<br />
<br />
and please don't shout(all caps)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>JESTER</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sorry about the cap's I didnt even notice, thank you I will try those out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd dry LZO in PoN - banshee's and wraiths but the Zone out by the hedge.<br />
<br />
<br />
Where is that? East through the gorge and across the river? How safe is it to travel through there? Can the mobs see invis?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>CaradocBertoxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah.. Invis / LEVITATE is a must.  some see through invis.<br />
<br />
you head left ( Facing GY / ZI/ZO building ) twards Hobgoblins.. head along the river a little bit then while invis / levitate on run across the river.. you have to watch out for the croc's I belive they do see invis and head along the cliffs past the gob's ( cliffs on left hand side ) be careful though there is a lvl 60 horsie's who are freekn nasty.. keep following wall till you get to a big hedge.  behind that hedge there is a ZO stone.<br />
<br />
from here pull banshee's and wraiths.  they are nasty but at 58 you will probbly be able to do em,  if not ZO. 8)<br />
<br />
careful of the wraiths they are rogues, don't let em backstab you.<br />
<br />
I have no problems slow/cripple them ( usually mal them first - in a group ) but at 58 you probbly not need to mal em.)<br />
<br />
have fun and don't die.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">do you need epic to hold the hedge spot in PoN? also soloing in PoP is probly not worth it come the 11th?</div></div><hr />
