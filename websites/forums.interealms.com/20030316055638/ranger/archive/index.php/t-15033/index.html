You are a troll.  Go away.  We do not need your kind here and you have no business posting flames directed toward an individual on this board.<br />

If you want to post childish comments such as this one, direct it to Flame Vault - not the Glade.  Take your little tantrum with Sean elsewhere.  <br />

<br />
<br />
Tendoryl,<br />
<br />
Page 8, Page 8ed:  To incriminate yourself or make your self look stupid by your own actions.  Derived from Morsereg who page 8'ed himself by accidentally confessing to his own bad actions by signing a post as himself, but being logged in as an  alt.  See this Hall of Fame thread...particulary page 1 to 6 and then page 8.  Pretty funny read actually for people that missed it.<br />
<br />
http://pub142.ezboard.com/fbrellrantsfrm20.showMessage?topicID=13.topic<br />
<br />
My point was not to say his post count made him a troll.  My point was that he defended himself NOT being a troll by telling us to look at his post count.  27.  Not very active at all in the last year since he registered.  While true trolls do post lots of flames just to start fights and get their post counts high in this particular case:<br />
<br />
<br />
why do you think you weren't asked to come join in PoP? cause the devs hate you guys? try cause all you guys do is find sploits like the rampage **** you did to get AAs really fast you fat bastard.<br />
<br />
<br />
This qualifies and nothing BUT a troll post and a personal attack.  His post count was/is absolutely no defense.  Thus in my opinion he &quot;page-8ed himself&quot;.  This was not a front to your post count or anyone elses post count.</div></div><hr />

I regret to inform you that due to failing basic logic and comprehension, in addition to unoriginal  flames, that it is with great regret that we must inform you that you are being accepted into our roles for trolls program.  <br />

This program is based on the popular idea that, if you can find a constructive role, that perhaps you may abandon your brutish discourse, and interact better in this socially inclined world.<br />

I really hate when the minute someone acts like an idiot, someone else immediately swings to insults based on the assumption this person is a teenager, in highschool, was picked up, has acne, etc. <br />
<br />
I believe this happens because the assumption isn't frequently far off from the truth. The kind of maturity that comes with age tends to limit people from posting crap like this.<br />

Play your game, let others play theirs.  I really don't think the Glade is the place to be taking pot shots at people anyway.
