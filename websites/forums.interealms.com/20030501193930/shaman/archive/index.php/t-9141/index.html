<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>malikaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">im having trouble trying to decide how to do my epic. do it the way it is supposed to be done I.E. kill high scale kirn or do what others have reported and just repeated killing the 2 guys in rathe and handing in there stuff for the faction.<br />
<br />
i am not a member of a high flying guild and we are all around lvl 46 - 50 but i do have a few freinds lvl 60 plus who would be able to help me on the last fight, but i think they would loose patience with me attempting to kill so many high level creatures and not even being in their guild. so what shall i do? do it the proper way and as i see the longer way or do it the cheating way? <br />
<br />
im lvl 46 got sheild of falsehood last night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Oh God, everyone here will tell you 'cheating is ghey', 'only l00z3rz cheat', 'do the damn quest the right way', etc..  Fact of the matter is our Epic has that back door, and if that's the only way you can do it, then by all means do it.  Unless and until VI removes the faction farming avenue for our epic, I see nothing wrong with doing it that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It is not that hard to do it step by step, even in a smaller guild!  There are always open raids to The Hole and Fear that you can sign up for.  That is how I did it, and come time for the final battle I posted an open raid, and had more then enough show up between friends and people wanting jade reavers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>FilurGlamrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its allways easy for people to say that getting it by doing faction and the hand in the stuff is cheating.<br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is, that cheating is going against the rules of the game. As of now we shaman are able to bypass large portions of our epic quest by doing things that are more time consuming that doing the actual quest step by step.<br />
<br />
If you feel that getting your epic by going the faction route is what you have to do, then i say happy hunting to you.<br />
<br />
Anyone feeling snobbish for doing it any way you can is just that, snobbish.<br />
<br />
And before i get flamed, I did the quest step by step.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaneras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well it's not like you don't have to do anything.  You still have to go to Fear and get the child's tear and you still have to kill Rak, who is a big pain to fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'll have to admit I actually don't care whether or not someone avoids doing the quest as perscribed...after all you are only cheating yourself out of Game content. If there is other content that is more interesting for you, then I suppose it is within your best interests to skip as much non-interesting content as possible.<br />
<br />
However, in deciding to skip perscribed events, you are taking some chances.<br />
<br />
A. They could fix the quest so this is no longer possible. After all, they did change the quest recently so that you now lose True Spirit faction when you finish the quest. They could make more changes.<br />
<br />
B. You screw up and/or don't have enough faction at certain points and your quest pieces get eaten.<br />
<br />
So if you skip events and it goes wrong, don't come here and bitch about it. <br />
<br />
In the end, it really comes down to why you are playing EQ to begin with. The quest is a great way to meet new people, spend time with guildmates and achieve a sense of accomplishment in finishing a more difficult than average quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you are trying to bypass content cause you cant kill those MoBs then you are wasting your time trying to skip.  Rak is the hardest MoB in the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tolban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For those that think its cheating I have a couple questions.<br />
<br />
Did you do the complete quest on your own or did you follow the epic guide step by step?  <br />
<br />
Is it cheating to follow the step by step guide that another player wrote and posted?<br />
<br />
If you used a guide to complete your epic how can you call another a cheater for doing the same? Even if you do consider there guide to be easier than the one you followed.  Cheer them for finding an easier way.  After all any that used the guide had it much easier than those that completed there epic prior to the guide.  <br />
<br />
We now know that there is more than one way to complete the epic and anyone that uses either guide has taken a shortcut.  I would not call this cheating.  I say do what you can and what your comfortable with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The faction shortcut has long been known, dunno if you just discovered it though.<br />
<br />
I did it the right way because I could. Whichever way works for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Since the changes that made the mage pet trick not work so well any more, Kirn is now the third most difficult MOB to kill.<br />
<br />
You aren't saving yourself that much any more.  The Hole portion is NOT difficult... I don't know why people get so scared of it.<br />
<br />
I would be MUCH more worried about getting your tear out of Fear than I would ever be about killing Kirn.<br />
<br />
My recommendation: do the quest step by step.  Your sense of accomplishment will be much greater.  Plus, if you're worried your guild can't take out Kirn, then you have one hope in hell of them killing the golems or Rak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>malikaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">ok i thibnk i probably go the long and hard way of doing it step by step. but all you people saying its cheating.... isnt getting the guide cheating as well? but the guide makes like alot easier imagine trying to find black dire on your own. i guess it wud be more fun however, chasing rumours and whims where he may be etc.! anyways thanks for advice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You can't complete an epic quest without a guide. No one person, not one large guild, probably not even one whole server, can go everywhere and try everything and piece it all together to figure out all 15 epic quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">A couple things to keep in mind about it all - epic quests are just that, epic.  They're not something you should be able to finish easily &amp; quickly.  I think I started mine around 45ish (did the first step while grouping in OoT, killing seafurbies), and finished it up by about 50 - solo'd Tabian &amp; Glaron at 49 for that part.  The other parts are difficult, but could be good goals for your guild to work on - 46-50 is a good range for a raid for about every part of our epic.  So use it!  Encourage your guild to help you, and get some raids rolling in new lands - City of Mist, Fear, the Hole...  all places you need to go, and all places that your guild can use to get some great raiding experience (not to mention, epic parts for other classes).  Especially the Hole - taking a mass of people down to Kirn is definately going to be a learning experience, if you guys haven't raided much; expect to die some if so.<br />
<br />
I don't think I consider the faction route to be cheating on the quest... the only thing you're doing is cheating yourself &amp; friends out of some good fun.<br />
<br />
And as for the idiotic comments about following a guide to be cheating...  Do you drive?  Cheater, someone taught you!  Do you have a job?  Cheater!  Someone taught you how to do that!  Knowledge is not cheating - using workarounds is cheating.  Although sometimes justified. ;)  I used to use the zone cheat in WK, to avoid a lengthy run. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>wsbsteven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've considered the shortcut method as I don't have a guild but have a few friends that could help with the final task.  I will worry about it more when I can enter fear.</div></div><hr />
