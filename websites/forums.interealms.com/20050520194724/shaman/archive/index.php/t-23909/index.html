<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Morffe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know the Penalty applies to normal leveling, but Does it also apply to AA?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nope, tested in game. it doesn't.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not entirely, Morffe.  They haven't said how it's applied, and I trust the SoE math wizards not at all.  It depends when the penalty is applied.<br />
<br />
Consider the following scenarios.  All scenarios have the following:  90% AA, 10% reg exp.  1 kill for 10,000 exp.  Iksar or troll character for 20% penalty.<br />
<br />
1) if penalty applied last:<br />
9000 AA<br />
200 penalty<br />
800 reg exp<br />
<br />
2)  if penalty applied first:  <br />
2000 penalty<br />
7200 to AA<br />
800 to reg exp<br />
<br />
The above is further complicated when the leadership AA are turned on for additional exp bleed.  Depending on when the penalty is applied, you could have a penalty hitting the AA and the leadership exp if you're not going full AA.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">be sure do always do 100% AA or 100% reg exp because if you do not, the exp penalty is applied to your AA exp as well. <br />
<br />
I do not think this was ever fixed and I do not remember where a dev stated this but that is the way it is to my knowledge. No idea how leadership exp figures in either.<br />
<br />
And just to repeat myself, all exp penalties should just be remove past level 60.</div></div><hr />

High elves and Vah Shir have no exp penalties though.  And class penalties were taken out long ago.  Or do Vah Shir have a penalty?  Can't seem to remember for sure.</div></div><hr />

And neither race has a penalty.  Our math here is excellent.</div></div><hr />

Seems to be confusion in this. I was reading it he was at 95% each and everytime. Meaning he was 5% behind and stayed that way each aa. <br />
Or was it that for every 100% ding the highelf cleric was getting ,   (the vahshir) was getting 95% per?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chairman Meow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sorry for the confusion, for every aa level that my high elf cleric friend received, I got 95% of a level, so there seems to be a small difference.  In OOW however, we all seem to be making about the same expo.  Its hard to tell, cause it moves so much more slowly.</div></div><hr />

Could have been leadership, honestly, which wold barely be noticable when filling the regular XP bar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Just as an FYI, I sent a message to Kyth on the SoE boards on this and asked them to check into it.  Dunno if we'll ever get a response, but if I do, I'll post back and let you guys know what the result is on the exp bleed for penalized classes splitting exp (if any).  She said she had forwarded it on to the devs, for what that's worth!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Actually before leadership aa's, I was in Hoh grinding with a warrior friend. By some fluke our aa's were synchronised. We were both 100 % aa. <br />
<br />
We dinged on the same mob, and at the end of the current aa, redinged on the same mobs multiple times during the night. Unless it's been changed in the past 5 months xp penalties and bonuses don't affect aa xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Unless it's been changed in the past 5 months xp penalties and bonuses don't affect aa xp.<br />
This has been proven a number of times. The question is, if you both had 90/10 on, would you still ding the same mob? The answer lies in WHEN the XP penalty is applied, before or after the &quot;split&quot; between AA and Regular. The current consensus is that it gets applied BEFORE the split, therefore you are dinking your AA XP if you have ANY regular XP turned on. <br />
<br />
Bottom line for races with penalty, ALWAYS go 100% aa, or 100% regular. Makes me wonder if Halflings and other bonus characters get that bonus applied BEFORE the split, which would make them gain more AAXP than &quot;normal&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Vah Shir have the same racial 5% penalty that barbarians have, which this seems to match your observations.<br />
<br />
(FYI, other races are as follows: ogres 10% penalty, trolls &amp; iksar 20% penalty, halflings 5% bonus.  Class penalties were removed long ago, but warriors still enjoy a 10% class bonus, and rogues have a 5% class bonus.)<br />
<br />
Leadership AA sucks a fixed 20% of incoming exp off the top, if you have it turned on.  It is not clear whether this 20% is applied before or after racial penalties are applied, although SOE has stated that racial penalties are not supposed to apply to LAA exp.<br />
<br />
(There is also a further penalty applied to LAA if you have less than a full group, but this only affects the LAA component; it does not affect the 20% that it takes from the regular pool).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The incoming xp doesn't necessarily need to be affected, if the amount of xp needed got the applied penalty.<br />
Ie. race with no penalty/bonus needs 10.000xp to level.<br />
Troll/iksar needs 12.000<br />
Barbarian needs  10.500<br />
Ogre needs 11.500<br />
and so forth, this way the only loss in xp will be due to truncating the rounded numbers.<br />
These numbers were shown back in the days by the showeq people, and it was back in the days because back then the absolute´numbers were being sent to the client, which it no longer is.<br />
When I mention these numbers, I don't mean the actual numbers I wrote, I mean that it was shown that trolls (my primary interest) needed a larger number (absolute) than for example barbarians.<br />
<br />
So this would result in a troll vs. a barbarian killing a mob worth 100xp each running at 90/10 xp/aa with leadership on would gain the exact same number to each part, except in xp it would result in a lower percentage gained due to the higher max for the troll.<br />
My guess with the disctribution would be:<br />
20xp to leadership each.<br />
72xp to level each.<br />
8xp to aa each.<br />
<br />
For the troll this will lead to 0.6% level xp.<br />
For the Barbarian this will lead to 0.69% level xp.<br />
Again using the made of numbers of 10k5 and 12k xp above.<br />
For aa and leadership the percentage gained will be equal since the amount needed per level is identical.<br />
This example shows that sometimes there won't be any loss in xp by splitting your xp over aa and level, but it would be easy to pick a number that's not dividable(sp?) by the fractions chosen and then the resulting numbers will be rounded down. That will never happen if you're not splitting xp in several directions (aa and leadership).</div></div><hr />
