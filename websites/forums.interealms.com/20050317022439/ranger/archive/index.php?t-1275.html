Doesn't this read like something straight out of Deus Ex?<br />
Release disaese, declare emergancy, arrest dissendants and sieze power.  Call me paranoid, but these type of laws open up those doorways.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No offense but does everyone think of the worst case scenerio?  I mean do you really think someone would arrest someone just because they had AIDS?  Let's be realistic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What powers would you suggest that the government be given in the event of a major disease outbreak? Personal freedom ends where it infringes on the rights of others, including the rights of other citizens to remain healthy. Inorder to contain a smallpox outbreak, citizens may have to be involuntarily quaranteened. <br />
<br />
It seems that this law has several provisions for reviews and checks and balances.<br />
<br />
Inidividual rights have to be tempered with the knowledge that what an individual may want is not always the best for others on the whole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-15-2002, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually had AIDS not turned so political there is a good chance those people would've been quarantined.<br />
<br />
However due to homosexuals spreading it amongst homosexuals (at first this was largely true and it wasn't til later that it crossed out of those circles to be a general epidemic not because of anything inherant in the virus but simply the virus met with people of differing sexual orientation either through bi-sexualaity or blood tranfusions to heterosexual people) and several conspiracy theories that this was really some way to oust the homosexual population they were able to remain at large and continue spreading the disease.<br />
<br />
I strongly suspect that unless a way to &quot;cure&quot; viruses is found though either AIDS or something similar to AIDS will eventually make significant changes in how we view quarantining people.  We are reaching an age where one wrong move will bring back the age of the plague.<br />
<br />
As far as the law precedure in place it doesn't surprise me one bit and to be honest makes perfect sense.  Under normal circumstances we are guaranteed rights but under abnormal and dangerous circumstances those rights can and will be placed on hold for the greater good and our Forefathers knew this at the time and nothing has changed since.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tevyn</div><div class="date">04-15-2002, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is always a very touchy subject. On the one hand, the spirit of the law is based on a practical principle. On the other hand, the letter of the law allows broad-based application far outside the intended scope of the legislation. It becomes a matter of do nothing and allow for the possibility of a major catastrophy in which millions could die or do something and allow for the possibility of thousands, perhaps millions being detained or otherwise negatively impacted under the guise of &quot;the greater good.&quot;<br />
<br />
One thing to keep in mind is that almost any position taken &quot;for the greater good&quot; can be reasonably justified. One could give compelling arguments for &quot;unlawful search and seizure&quot; under certain scenarios. Indeed, some legislation to that effect has already been passed in wake of September 11. It is also important to realize that these types of bills are typically written by someone who is very passionate about the topic at hand. As such, often they are blinded to the possible negative implications of what they perceive as addressing a just cause.<br />
<br />
The real question is not how the law would be applied today, but how it will be interpreted and applied 50 years from now by people who aren't products of the socio-political climate of today. &quot;Framers' Intent&quot; is a very difficult thing to judge after sufficient time has passed.</div></div><hr />

People assume that laws will be used resposibly, and short term, they may very well do just that.  But long term?  Who knows.</div></div><hr />

Yes. Thats right. A fairly recent law  which the framers made with the intent of doing  good. Now enter Dmitri Watshisface. He has been arrested, and held under the guise of &quot;Terrorism&quot; according to John Ashcroft. <br />
He (Ashcroft) labels anyone that decrypts safeguards on electronic media as  terrorist.<br />
The kid  in Europe was also arrested for writing a code  that allows him to watch DVD's on his Linux os'ed  computer.<br />
The recording industry, as well as the movie industry has used this law as a bludgeon to prevent scholars from participating in  conferences.<br />
<br />
http://www.cnn.com/2001/TECH/industry/06/07/silenced.professor.idg/index.html<br />
<br />
http://www.idg.net/idgns/2001/04/26/UnderRIAAPressureAcademicDoesNot.shtml<br />
<br />
<br />
So, just using this one example, are we not supposed to worry about the ramifications of laws when they are mis-used? Then intentions of the DMCA are honorable. If you could take out the human factor, thne there would be no reason to worry. But, as humans are fallible, we NEED to look at  the &quot;what if's&quot;. If WE don't watch Big Brother, who will?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deeger</div><div class="date">04-15-2002, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kullas, there's really nothing to stop those black helicopters from getting you right now.  A corrupt judge signs a false warrant, some people are payed to give false witness, and some government agents drop out of the sky and pick you up.<br />
<br />
Nothing to it.<br />
<br />
My point here of course is that giving the government ANY power to protect it's citizens gives that government a way to abuse it's power.  The answer isn't to take away that power, but to put &quot;checks and balances&quot; on it.  E.g. the President is the Commander in Chief but only Congress has the authority to declare war.  The &quot;power&quot; to start a war hasn't been removed, just balanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-15-2002, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kullaas if we took your argument to its fullest conclusion then we would essentially have a paper government with no real power.<br />
<br />
Sorry but I don't feel like living in Anarchy where there is no sort of order or power to be held somewhere.<br />
<br />
Nor do I feel like living under a complete dictatorship.  Hence the current system even with its warts and scars is still the best system in the world to date.<br />
<br />
But with this system we sacrifice a little power to the government for the greater good of the entire nation of people.  USUALLY its not a problem.  USUALLY it doesn't impact day to day life.  Will there be abuses?  Sure but then would there be abuses in Anarchy (i.e. read powerless government) you bet there would and would there be abuses on the other end total dictatorship again you bet there would.  But the current system where we allow some of the power to go some of the time works.  And in wierd non-normal situations of emergency it is sometimes required that people COMPLETELY lose their rights to help make the nation survive.<br />
<br />
The draft is an example of this and Hey guess what During a massive outbreak of Leprosy the government DID quarantine people a few years back.  So don't say people wouldn't stand for it.  When their children and themselves are in danger from a nasty slow agonizing death you would be amazed at what people would allow to happen to keep themselves safe and frankly I don't blame them.<br />
<br />
If small pox broke out tomorrow in Houston I would go into Quarantine to be treated and cut off from the rest of the world cause it might mean my relatives in Ohio would stay safe.<br />
<br />
Swear people only think about themselves in this country and no longer have the will or the courage to sacrifice themselves in the event of a BAD BAD situation.  This country is becoming more and more about MY RIGHTS THIS AND MY RIGHTS THAT.<br />
<br />
Sorry folks half the things you claim as rights are NOT rights at all but long standing previleges we have enjoyed but that LEGALLY can be taken away if the situation merits it.<br />
<br />
Bio-warfare I think would EASILY qualify for such a situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kullaas</div><div class="date">04-15-2002, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But one of the prime concerns of the framers of the constitution is that the government couldn't just &quot;detain&quot; individuals.  Thats the whole reasoning behind the &quot;charge me with a crime or let me go&quot; line of reasoning with the police.  Would you want a law that universally tramples that right on a very vague precondition?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-15-2002, 05:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In day to day operation of the nation that would be true Kullaas.  The Framer didn't want &quot;uncalled&quot; for dentention.<br />
<br />
However they specifically allowed the ability of the government to step up and declare a &quot;police&quot; state in the event of an emergency.<br />
<br />
Bio warfare would fall under a condition meriting Marshall Law...<br />
<br />
<br />
In otherwords we are talking about two DIFFERENT situations.<br />
<br />
One is normal and one isn't.<br />
<br />
The likelyhood of someone seizing power in this country through an abuse of these laws is pretty slim.<br />
<br />
Furthermore and I believe you have argued with me on this before that is PRECISELY why the general public is allowed to keep and bear arms.  Should the government get out of line (and framers certainly allowed for the possibilty and it did happen once in this country already i.e. Civil War) then we as citizens would have the ability to fight back and retake our nation.<br />
<br />
But hey if your worried about Black Helicopters and Government Power grabs then why is it you tend to argue for more Gun Control when its Guns that are the &quot;insurance&quot; AGAINST government power grabs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">04-15-2002, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any law can be abused. That is why we have three branches of government. The legislature to make laws, the judciary to evaluate laws and the executive branch to enforce the laws. <br />
<br />
There are many circumstances where a person can be held without charges: material witnesses, sequestered jurors, commitment to a mental institution, and in many states there are already forced quarantene laws.<br />
<br />
What you are apparently proposing, Kullaas, is that the government not be given power that they might abuse. What about the power to declare war or the power to launch a nuclear weapon, might they not abuse those powers? The entire text of this bill is not on the website, but read what's there. This does not give one person the right to take over the state of Maine. What it does is give the Department of Health and Human Services the necessary authoriy to contain a disease when the Governor has declared a state of public health emergnecy. It hasn't even been passed yet, and it is going through review by the judiciary committee, fiscal committes and others to be certain that if it does pass, it will meet all constitututional requirements, and that all information necessary during the emergency will be available to the public and that health professionals have a clear line of communication.<br />
<br />
If you don't give the government the necessary authority they need to respond to a major health crisis, what are they to do? What if pneumonic plague broke out in the US, do you think all citizens would voluntarily stay in their homes? If you do, you're wrong. Without laws allowing for special circumstances, the government would have two choices 1) allow the epidemic to spread naturally, or 2) take illeagal measures 3) hold an emergency session to pass new, hurried laws.<br />
<br />
I prefer to make plans ahead of time for who will have the authority and how long it will last. That way we're not trying to rush through anything. Bad laws get made in panic times, and THAT'S what brings dictators to power.</div></div><hr />
