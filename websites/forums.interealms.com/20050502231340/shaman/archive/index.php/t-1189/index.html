<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grubbnubbnubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, it was kinda a slow nights, so I desided ta blow sum time anda start da Iksar Shammy cudgel quest.<br />
<br />
I do sum runnin around, a lot of clickin and max all iksar faction but da Necro Lizards.<br />
<br />
I den go anda shameless read da quest section offa www.iksar.org ta learn what I need ta do.<br />
<br />
I makes a Iksar shammy nOOb on da second account to test the quest mobs repsonces.<br />
<br />
Now, assa Ogre shammy I seem ta be hard capped at Indifferent faction wit all da Iksar.  Due, no doubt ta the fact I follow a betta gods den the silly lizards do, anda the hold dat against me.<br />
<br />
It appears dat the quest can't be started with Indifferent faction.<br />
Since I know da quest was working fine, based on the fact dat I gots everything as I was supposse to wit da Iksar nOOb test.<br />
Since I seem hard capped at Indifference Faction, I have no options for fixing it by raising my factions higher.<br />
<br />
I am wonderin if any other, non-iksar shamman have been able to start the quest.<br />
I am guessin a Troll shammy of Cazic Thule should be able to get der faction high enough ta do da quest, but that others would also be capped a Indifferent.<br />
<br />
Let me know if you have, me a quest junky, so would be fun to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was actually going to ask this same question myself.  Since I will be maxed in everything but necro faction tonight myself, I wanted to possibly start the cudgel quests.  Please someone reply and let us know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its a tease: You can use the weapon, but cant do the quest :)<br />
<br />
lol! <br />
<br />
I expect that they will chnage the faction caps at some point. I have heard of non-iksar getting greenmist, so it is possible I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Armageddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I posted a comment on the /clap thread to this effect.  I am an ogre shaman with maxed cab faction.  I failed the first quest with the faction too low reply.  You might want to check the other thread, it's discussed a bit over there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nothenon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Barb Shaman here.  All Cabilis factions maxed out at indifferent.  I was able to do the quest with the Toilmaster to get my newbie cudgel(Iron Cudgel of the petitioner).<br />
<br />
I tried to initiate the dialog with the questgiver for the 2nd cudgel, but lacked the faction to get a response.  i went and got the items needed, and handed them in just for grins, and they got eaten.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">CT worshiping PC's can do the quests in Cab. (Troll SK's for example).<br />
<br />
However if you don't worship CT I think the quest(s) are beyond the faction limits in the game.<br />
<br />
However VI did make an official comment about cab quests and the general populas doing them, on eqvault.com... was last week or the week before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mwinda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ACK!!... been working on my faction or a while now to do this quest... I hope they do something so that you don't have to be CT worshiping.  Otherwise they should put in something that ogres and barbs can get a clicky mini avitar w/no regent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sthaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Gee, maybe they should put something in so Iksar get a clicky Winter's Roar with no reagent.  Sucks, doesn't it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA<br />
<br />
:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">heh, Sthaz has a point.  I'd say that if I had to pick between JBB and the cudgel quests, I'd go with the JBB ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zool</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So Iksar dont get to use JBB.  I'd think that was to offset them getting all the other cool stuff like Regen, nightvision, swimming, foraging, good stats, natural AC...<br />
<br />
Now they get this sweet item. sheesh..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grubbnubbnubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Pah, trolls wit tails!<br />
Joo are all welcome ta do the Ogra only shammy quests iffa ya want, they are super!<br />
I still use Burst of Flame atta 60th, best fire nuke we git!<br />
<br />
Anyways, jus ta update I also tried turnin in the first set of quest items to git da second cudgel, same bad faction messages.<br />
<br />
I am of course guessin dat, like da new Iksar monk items, dat dis quest too is ta be doables by non-Iksar.<br />
If dat is the case, it will probly not be doable by any non-CT flunky tilla after da patch, whenever dat maybe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sthaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hmmm, I thought terrible faction everywhere, a harsher exp penalty, lower base HP due to stam, and the inability to use all plate armor (even without cool clicky effects) were for balance.  The exceptions being in Velious, which was after the creation of the Iksar.  It all seems so unfair when you gloss over the negatives. <br />
<br />
If you ask me, the trolls came out ahead of everyone, +JBB +regen +cudgels +snare necklace +nightvision(?) -faction -exp penalty -no forage (/laff) -swimming -no natural AC and I've prolly left out a few things I've forgotten tho not intentionally.  There's another thread here somewhere with a great discussion of racial advantages vs usable items, beginning of course with a JBB rant.<br />
<br />
All that being said, I love playing an Iksar Shaman and wouldn't change for anything except better Luclin models.  The new ones are terrible, imho.</div></div><hr />

But my opinion comes mainly from the fact that I dont want to turn in 8000 bone chips.  If it wasnt possible to do it I wouldnt be thinking about how much it will suck when I finally get around to doing it :)</div></div><hr />

The only softskins I could tolerate would be the trolls who also worship(and were created by) our god, despite their race being flawed by that poor excuse for evil inny.<br />

Old world shamans got jack for quests . This is is Ever&quot;quest&quot; , please give us old shamans a good quest that ends up with a cool item .<br />
<br />
Go check the quest list on Allkhazam for oggok , it's pathetic and it's barely changed since release . They almost put in the rallos zek necklace quests , but never quite finished =/</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the Spear of Fate is a pretty cool item.<br />
<br />
If you are into mind-numbing faction work then I suggest doing the quests for the Sarnaks that end up with the Spirit Wracked Cord.  Its also very nice.<br />
<br />
Or you could go to Luclin and work on the progressive Shaman quests for the Vah Shir.  The end results are very nice cloaks.<br />
<br />
<br />
You are right about quests and Oggok, tho.  It's a dump (visually and 'culturally' - i.e. questwise).  The only reason I go visit Grobb is so that I can feel good about my hometown.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Good God, people.<br />
<br />
Right now, it's 'iksars get this and poor non-iksars suck for this reason' and 'iksars suck for this reason and it's not fair we should get this', but next time someone posts a thread asking what the best race is, you can bet your ass that iksars will be posting 'iksars get this and lame non-iksars suck for this reason' while the non-iksar will be posting 'iksars suck for this reason and it's fair that we do get this'.<br />
<br />
THE HORSE IS DEAD!<br />
<br />
Back on the original track. No. You can't do the quest. Yes. Verant knows.<br />
<br />
Until then, enjoy your good Iksar faction by walking around Cabilis and watching n00bs freak out.<br />
<br />
While hanging out and doing some alchemy work, I once had a young iksar racist actually /shout over and over that softskins shouldn't be in his city, blah blah blah. It was kinda disturbing, cos this guy who was playing a character in a GAME was being genuinely hateful of the fact I was in Cabilis. He tried to train me with a Crusader. Sad, sad. I'm not KoS to Crusaders. He died. I offered to drag him to the Iksar cleric guild for a rez. Har.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I think that iksars, trolls, and orges should be able to do this quest. Why, cause we get screwed with faction on the rest of kunark. Hmm, guild raid in KC, light races only, cause of faction! Hmm, Howling Stones tonight, whoops, ya can't go, or else no banking in kunark for i00! <br />
Barbs get everything, but are so many, it makes being one, just dumb. <br />
Anyways, CT isn't as great as innoruuk, and thats why they let trolls do it i guess, unless that troll was worshiping CT, which i think is posilbe.</div></div><hr />

Haven't you realized by now, that not only are Iksar&gt;World, but we are also the center of the universe?<br />

I like to role play my Leezard Shammy, but I don't think training the soft skins is the way to go. If the crusaders are cool with them, then we should respect them to a point.  :p</div></div><hr />

Just wait 'til the next 'why don't iksar have the JBB?' debate. You'll have iksar lined up to talk about how much iksar suck.<br />
<br />
'Course, you'll also have trolls, ogres and barbarians who'd only relinquish their JBB if you pried it from their cold, dead fingers assuring everyone that JBBs aren't really that important. People only brag until it begins to look suspicious.</div></div><hr />
