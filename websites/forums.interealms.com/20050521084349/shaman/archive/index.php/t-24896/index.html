It’s a spell/skill I got around level 7 and it wasn’t listed anywhere.<br />
<br />
I started using it and MAN I can trigger some kickass nukes and even some nice “Proc-Like” buffs with it.<br />
<br />
Do all classes get something like this? Or is that more for Priests?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Horomen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe all classes get it (my fighter and scout so far have). In beta you used to trigger HOs by casting a certain spell and it would automatically start. Somewhere along the line (about 2 wks before end of beta) they changed everyones spellsets around, and inadvertently removed the priests ability to trigger a HO. To fix this, they put in a HO trigger button for all classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I noticed sometimes there was a higher failure rate on HO's.<br />
<br />
It would say &quot;So and So triggers a chain of something&quot; and the very next line &quot;So and So has broken the chain&quot;<br />
<br />
It didn't seem to matter what my timing was, I could time things the same and get a different result back to back.<br />
<br />
Does the ability to succesfully pull these off increase with level?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think it may be group-based?  As in, once it's started, the next action in the group has to continue the chain, or it's broken.  Just a guess.  Sure would be nice if the manual that came with the game was worth 1/10th as much as the glossy paper it's printed on.  *grin*</div></div><hr />

You *can* perform your own (solo)  HOs but I cant remember offhand what the low level priest ones are (playing a monk atm). If you click the button to bring up the little HO menu, if you have any spell that can start a HO it will be blinking on your spell bar. Once you click it, next one will be blinking if you have the right kind, and so forth. <br />
<br />
Took me a while to realize the spell/action I needed to use was blinking..i was trying to remember what was what and kept getting lost until someone told me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Solo Ho:<br />
<br />
Div Prov<br />
Smite<br />
Smite<br />
Triggers Blessed something... a bonus on your nuke and small buff to power iirc.<br />
<br />
Later on you can swap Smite for the dot or the next nuke ...cold winds or something.<br />
<br />
In a group, you need to match your spell with the icon on the HO wheel. I think if you right click a spell in your spell book, you will see which spell is associated with which icon.<br />
<br />
Scouts can do some funky things with the HO wheel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Heigelyac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">in groups your HO's can be broken by others who do not follow the sequence...   so build a good group</div></div><hr />

<br />
I found that soloing you get 2 different HO results from the exact same trigger and spells used that alternate. This is up to lev 10. I dunno what happens past lev 10 yet.<br />
<br />
First I'd hit the trigger for a HO to start. Then all I can do is cast Smite to advance it and Smite again to finish it. Id get either an extra divine judgement nuke ranging 20-40 additional damage OR this Piety buff that adds +10 to inspirations making both nukes and heals and anything in the inspiration line more powerful for 3 mins.<br />
<br />
Next is a combo with a lev 9 fighter. They would start the HO and then I would heal (there are 2 choices, heal and smite but smite doesnt seem to have a finisher right now in that chain). Im a little fuzzy on how this one ended but gotten it to work a few times and it seems either me or the warrior can both end it the same way and whoever does gets the buff cast on them. The buff reduces the attack rates of any creature to hit you for 3 mins. I dunno if that means attack speed or attack skill so that they dont hit you as easy.<br />
<br />
We also pulled out a HO that used our weaken/slow spell as a step in the trigger and when you used that there would end up with a crippling type slow on the creature that in theory is more powerful than the lev 10 slow and I even did this move at lev 8 using weakness as the middle step before we even got a slow spell.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps, we need more testing and feedback. The whole thing is alittle confusing, but at lev 10 at least you can get into some fights that last long enough to where you can test the chains. It was just too hard to test them lev 5-8 when the creatures die too fast.<br />
