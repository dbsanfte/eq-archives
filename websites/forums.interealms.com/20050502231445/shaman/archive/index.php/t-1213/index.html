<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Quick question on mage focus spells, specifically the one that decreases spell casting time. Does it affect right click items? I searched around a bit and couldn't find a topic on this, so sorry if it's been discussed before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No- it sure doesn't.  And the crit one doesn't work with right-click items, either.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ah, darn :\<br />
Thanks for the reply</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kanad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This is something I don't understand either...<br />
The mana reduction earring and dmg increasing bracer work with weapons that proc in combat, but not with right click items? Could someone please clarify/provide examples of this...<br />

Ok, good examples of mage focus items not affecting cast times of right click shaman items (personal experience)<br />
<br />
JBV - still takes 10 secs to cast Furious Strength<br />
JBG - still takes 10 secs to cast Deftness<br />
JBH - still takes 10 secs to cast whatever the cha buff is on it (I wear it for the AC only - slowly dropping wis in favor of AC - Cann2/Regrowth make a good combination)<br />
<br />
It also will NOT affect the cast time on shaman made potions (dunno about vendor bought - don't waste my plat on them)<br />
<br />
Only other right click item I have is epic boots, and with insta-click, who cares?  (btw, anyone notice you no longer need to equip them for the effect?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Fudorf - even if the foci did work on item casts, the would not work in the examples you gave. The cast time reducion is only for spells in the 3.0 to 9.5 second range. <br />
<br />
Of course, since it doesn't work on item cast times it doesn't really matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sarita Icestryke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Fudorf, you've never had to equip the SoW booties.  Just like Jboots, they can be clicked from inventory.  Just can't be in a bag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Let's see...<br />
<br />
- Earring (no one is sure if it's either mana cost or aggro reduction effects, but only for DDs anyway). Those will work with all our casted DDs, whether poison or cold, but not with the JBB. Doesn't work with our Rain spells or DOTs in any way.<br />
<br />
- Necklace (chance of not using a spell component). Basically only worth it if you're casting Avatar, unless you're expecting to run tight on scales for EB in an underwater raid, for some reason. Doesn't work with the Imbue spells.<br />
<br />
- Mantle (chance of extending the duration of a buff cast). Plays merry hell with buff timing. Used to be bugged to and applied only of buffs cast on self. And the best one only buff the duration by 10%, which mean you would have to be extremely lucky to get an extra tick out of torpor with it.<br />
<br />
- Bracer (chance of DD crits). Works with all our DDs but not the JBB. Doesn't work at all with our Rain spells or our DOTs<br />
<br />
- Ring (fast cast). Works with all our spells with a casting between 3 and 9.5 seconds. Works great with Malo, Torpor, slows, DD, etc.<br />
<br />
Usually, in raid, I only bother with the ring. The proc rate on the mantle is too flaky to make it worth dropping the stats on whatever else I am using. I don't DD enough (myself, I like using torrent of poison or JBB if I need to do damage) for either earring or the bracer to do me much good. I sometime get a necklace if i am going to be casting Avatar a lot, but that's about it.</div></div><hr />
