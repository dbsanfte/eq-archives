<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, there are lots of threads about soloing dragons, and soloing Yeldema in particular, but I am not interested in that (yet). Have capped Yeldema easily with a small group (4 of us, level 53 - 56).<br />
<br />
The thing is, everyone says that Yeldema is a *****. If she is such a gimp, how much of a step up is it to the next easiest WW dragon? <br />
<br />
I mean, I know that most of the other dragons have an AoE cold or fire, but are we talking 1 group of mid 50's or 2 groups, or 3 groups etc? We can probably get our fire/cold resists up to around 150ish, more if we got a bard around - will this be enough to mitigate some of the AoE damage?<br />
<br />
Any hepful hints and tips appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Mainly you will be hurting on the levels when it comes to resists.   With dragons AEs someonve over 55 takes far less damage than someone under, even if the lower person has higher resists.  Problems you will run into are gating dragons which will proceed to wreak havoc on your raid as they summon you over one by one.   I'd say your best tactic around that is either fighting near the nests, or layering on so many DoTs near the end of the fight your MA can finish them off and loot after his summon.<br />
<br />
  with your 4 person group you should be able to take on an AE or 2, just add in another healer and some serious DPS (like a rogue) for the other 2 spots.</div></div><hr />
