Having the LoN screen come up a few times is understandable, but coupling that with the daily systemwide salespitch from admins is ridiculous.  Find me a way to block the SYSTEMWIDE spam and you're a golden god!!</div></div><hr />

I didn't realize that people were still getting LoE popups!  I guess I got rid of them accidentally.<br />
<br />
For those who don't know how to do what he suggested, here's what I did a few weeks ago:<br />
<br />
1) I went ahead and preordered<br />
2) I wisened up and cancelled<br />
<br />
I never got another popup after that.</div></div><hr />

It's really crappy that Sony would force us to keep clicking. Same with LDoN.<br />

When I buy my new TV, I know what what brand name won't be on it.</div></div><hr />

You are a HERO!  My gods, I was starting to HATE that with a passion.<br />
<br />
Do popups ads EVER work for ANYBODY?  Why would SOE think that it would work in this case?  Probably to get people to sign up just to get rid of them.. Hah!  <br />
<br />
Well, glad it's gone now.   And the worst part is, I might have gotten LoE.  I love RTS games (and get a number of them).  <br />

<br />
SOE needs to fire their marketing people. Annoying your customers is not a good way to increase sales.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">They just believe their customer base is a bunch of morons who will accidentily click the wrong button.<br />
<br />
And considering what probably pops up in the /petition que I can imagine where they got that idea.</div></div><hr />

I hate both the pop ups and the in game announcements, but you have to realize-if it didn't work they wouldn't do it. Commercials don't always have to be appealing to get the message accross. It would be nice if people made informed, intelligent choices, but they usually don't.  :( The greater number of people are heavily influenced by things like marketing, however annoying it may be.<br />
Anyway, I did indeed change the value in that file, and I have not seen a pop-up since. So thanks for the info, thats the kind of stuff we all like to see.  ;)</div></div><hr />
