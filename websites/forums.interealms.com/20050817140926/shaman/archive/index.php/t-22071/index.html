<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok ive been out of the game for 2 months but I was thinking the other day when I was bored (and having the first EQ withdrawal since i quit) about how some things could be fixed. <br />
<br />
What about special one time only quests for spells (that would be no drop). Here is the catch once you do the quest and get a choice of which spell you want you can never get the other spells as you have completed the quest and cna never do it again. <br />
<br />
Now these spells should SEEMbe overpowering if one player could get them all but in reality the fact that you could get only one would make the Difference.<br />
<br />
I havent really thought hard on this but one example might be with healing spells the choices might be (for shaman)<br />
1) group Q/BoT  <br />
2) 2200-2500 blast heal<br />
3) Larger 75% heal<br />
<br />
for Damage <br />
1) an improved bane<br />
2) an improved Disease Dot<br />
3) improved poision Dot <br />
    (I was p.o.'ed when they changed daludas to a farkin heal)<br />
3) 1200 pt quick cast DD<br />
<br />
Not i do not think that this should only be for shaman but across the board for all casters (including hybrids)<br />
<br />
Maybe im smokin crack but it would just be a cool idea</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">good idea</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">(I was p.o.'ed when they changed daludas to a farkin heal)<br />
<br />
Maybe im smokin crack<br />
<br />
Sorry, but I think you are <br />
