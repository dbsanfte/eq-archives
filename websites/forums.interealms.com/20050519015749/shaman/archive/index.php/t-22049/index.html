<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if anyone has done Tipt trial since the patch? How did the boss change?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm assuming it's similar to how they changed Ikkinz 1. Boss is probably more slowable, doesn't hit max as much, and if you defensive on him he splats your cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">According to a rogue in my guild:<br />
<br />
The change to Tipt, and most notedly, the final kyv, is as follows: <br />
<br />
The whole fight's been tuned down substantailly, allowing for a knight to tank the boss, and live to tell about it. <br />
<br />
To keep this tuned down mob from being absurdly easy when you have a warrior, if a warrior pops Defensive while tanking it, the kyv will ignore the warrior completely until Defensive is down.</div></div><hr />

which makes about as much sense as when slow mitigation went in and we actually hasted mobs when we slowed them.  It's bull**** to make a cornerstone class ability actually HARMFUL to your group.  <br />
<br />
If they want to make the mob ignore defensive, fine, whatever, (hello lame lame fix to knight tanking issues) but making it so the mob goes to slaughter your cleric and the rest of your group because you hit defensive is ridiculous.  Have fun doing tipt over and over because your warrior pal didnt know he shouldnt use his disciplines to do his job.  <br />
<br />
What a bunch of crap.  This kind of poorly thought out and poorly implemented &quot;fix&quot; makes me very glad I cancelled my accounts (and havent logged in since) in May.  It's clear to me that SOE has not and will not learn from the mistakes they have made in the past.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just defensive?  Sup furious/evasive</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Evasive too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Oukast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ghey...it was pretty dang easy to start with...that is if you aren't grouped with a bunch of noobs that don't know how to play their chars...<br />
<br />
How about Ranger's Weaponshield?  That's my prefered tank for this mob...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Oukast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">btw, a Shadowknight can leechcurse this mob.... what's the knights crying about?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lohknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This is about as smart as the time they made slow have an opposite effect and actually haste a mob.  Why punish a class for doing what they think they should be doing?  It's like some sort of cruel joke.</div></div><hr />
