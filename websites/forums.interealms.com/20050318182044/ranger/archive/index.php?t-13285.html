<br />
Another odd thing about our piercing cap being lower is that one of our (first two) quest weapons (the Orc Impaler) is a piercing weapon.  Because of that weapon I had always felt that piercing and 1hs were the two &quot;natural&quot; Ranger weapons.  But the weapons skill caps don't support it any more.<br />
<br />
Does anybody have a feel for how much difference those 10 skill points really make?  Is it enough to really matter if the weapon is good enough?  <br />
<br />
If you had, for example, a choice between a 14/20 1hs and a 15/20 piercer (all other stats on weapons being equal), would those 10 points of skill make the piercer a worse choice?  I'm thinking the piercer is still better?<br />

<br />
How much less DPS do you do if you forget to do a +30 ATK buff?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sasandra</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well the 40 visable atk from swiftwind makes it's 13/21 ratio better than a 16/20 weapon, so it's decent amount of DPS.<br />
<br />
also the reason we don't get 250 piercing is because rogues are the &quot;master&quot; of piercing so us and warriors get capped at 240, funny though that with us being &quot;master&quot; of bows we still share the same 240 cap with warriors and rogues</div></div><hr />

I do think the piercing cap is outdated though and shoudl be removed.</div></div><hr />

monks are masters of dual weild. <br />
<br />
This makes no sense.  For a while now in DnD, rangers have always been masters of dual weild(bastard Drizzt is to blame...I want to kill him.).  EQ is based heavily off DnD, so Rangers should technically be masters of dual weild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Borzak</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 07:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm if we're not the masters of dual wield what are we then? Don't say archery masters, for a good 3/4 of the EQ time archery was near useless except for pulling. If not dual wield masters are we just rogues that happen to not backstab and use a 2hs from time to time.<br />
<br />
No, we're masters of dual wield. It was stated by devs very early on we were (defensive being low etc.. it's been beaten to death).<br />
<br />
However now as VI likes to blur class lines/roles it's a moot point.<br />
<br />
Monks are &quot;supposed&quot; to be masters of unarmed combat. This according to VI long ago when crap mattered. Then they gave em the best weapons off trash like mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the 10 skill difference is 27 atk or 2.7 percent damage in main hand lost, off hand not a problem</div></div><hr />
