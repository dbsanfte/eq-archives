<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've noticed the pattern for a while, but I'm just now trying to get an explanation.  I know DoT aggro is broken, but I am wondering how it is broken.  I'm not sure if any of you know either.<br />
<br />
This is how I handle a normal encounter in BoT:  Malos on incoming, send in Dogdog (with taunt off), slow as soon as I can, then usually Bane soon after that.  Everything is ok until about tick #2 or 3 of Bane.  Then the mob comes running for me.  <br />
I understand that is going to happen, and I am not worried about a slowed BoT mob hitting me.<br />
<br />
My question is, why does it take two or three ticks for me to get aggro?  I could cast a DD 3 or 4 times in a row and not get aggro.  So is it because that the curse counters get added every tick?  Bane adds 24 curse counters and is 5 ticks long (normally).  So by the end of the DoT, is 120 curse counters on the mob?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dots generate extreme aggro when they land because of the counters associated with them, poison are particularly bad.  Then every tick when you do some measly amount of damage they generate even more aggro.  Counters do not get readded every tick, which can be tested by doting yourself and curing it, but there's something definately broken with dots and the devs haven't done anything about it in 5 years<br />
<br />
I'm guessing they run on a 1:1 damage to aggro ratio, but the formulas for aggro generation have never been made public so no one really knows.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, duh, dumb me!  The whole curing the Dot thing totally slipped my mind.  <br />
But something funny happens with the counters.  Cause if I nuked for 420 DD, I would not get aggro.  Maybe the counters are cleared and reapplied every tick.  Obviously I am grasping at straws here, but it just confuses the hell out of me as to why I don't get aggro until tick 2 or 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Warren Maguson Emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've thought about DoT aggro and I'll make a disclaimer now, I'm no mathematician or programmer but I've speculated that everytime a tic goes off, the monster calculates hate by the total amount of damage done by the DoT so far.  <br />
<br />
If hate calculation was done this way, then it means that a DoT would generate an enormous amount of hate towards the end of the DoT's cycle.  Multiple DoT's would exacerbate this whole thing, rapidly generating more hate than a melee could possibly generate.  <br />
<br />
So for instance, say you stuck a 400 point poison dot that would run for 7 tics.  On the first tic, the DoT has done 400 damage and you get bumped up on the hate list.  On the second tic, it adds 400 damage to your total but combines it with damage previously done so it calculates the hate generated at that point as 800 for the tic, 1200 total, on the 3rd tic, it adds 400 to 800 (the total done by the DoT so far) for a combined total of 2400 hate points,  on the 4th tic, 400 + 1200 + 2400 would equal 4000, and so on..... <br />
<br />
If DoT's generated hate like that, it would explain why one DoT would keep you so high on the list even after a melee did thousands of points of melee damage.<br />
<br />
But again, this is pure speculation on my part.  SOE has time and again stated that they would not release exact numbers or formulas to preserve the mystery of the game and has built in rules against reverse engineering their code in the EULA.  <br />
<br />
This makes it all the more frustrating for us when SOE says, &quot;Give us proof something is broken.&quot; since we basically have a devil of a time trying to do so when we don't really know where to start. Even if we show them circumstantial evidence, they can still say, &quot;I'm sorry, we checked the code and nothing's wrong.&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm not sure if this information might help, but I remember druids and rangers in PoV outer groups keeping aggro with flame lick (low level DoT). They can keep the aggro off wizards/mages that are nuking! Although I'm sure they could get aggro if they nuked hard enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">DoT damage has absolutly nothing to do with aggro IMO.  Flame Lick vs. BoU should be a perfect example of this, Flame Lick will actually give a Druid more aggro than our 64 DoT.  Counters have nothing to do with it either if you ask me, because only DIS/CUR/POI DoTs add counters because they can be cured (I don't believe you can cure other types of PC Dots, but I'm no expert either).  Yet Druid Mag/Fire doesn't add counters, but can still hold very good aggro.<br />
<br />
My assumption at this point, is aggro is coded into spells.  From a DoT perspective, poison would have to be the most aggro.  Fire would make sense for a close second.  Curse and Diesease following close behind.  The only way damage would be brought into the equasion is if two different people casted the same type DoT of different damage levels.<br />
<br />
Everyone used to think our Poison line gave us huge aggro due to the initial DD involved with the older DoTs.  But if that were the case, then Disease DoTs wouldn't be such low aggro even though their DD is somewhat smaller.  All that said, nobody really knows for sure.  But every Shaman should be wary of their POI DoTs and the aggro they give.  We don't need to manage aggro with DIS or CURSE, but then again, we never cast DIS unless soloing either /shrug<br />
<br />
Thats my story, and I'm sticking with it :D<br />

I have heard that a succesful taunt will put you one above the highest agro in the group, so if you spam taunt, you will shed the agro you have over the dotter.  If the taunt occurs prior to a dot pulse, then the dot pulse will take you above the tanks agro...<br />
<br />
Any thoughts on this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In my experience, the curse line spells have been above poison on the aggro scale. I may be wrong though. For reference, I use Bane and Blood of Saryrn as my poison and curse dots. I can't say where Uthor lies, since I haven't used it for anything but soloing.<br />
<br />
On another note, our epic dot seems to not draw any aggro that I can see. It's also more likely to stick on mobs than Bane is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">In my experience, the curse line spells have been above poison on the aggro scale. I may be wrong though.<br />
You are most definately wrong.  Poisons pull aggro waaaaay more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Counters have nothing to do with it either if you ask me, because only DIS/CUR/POI DoTs add counters because they can be cured (I don't believe you can cure other types of PC Dots, but I'm no expert either).  Yet Druid Mag/Fire doesn't add counters, but can still hold very good aggro.<br />
<br />
Anyone who has played long enough to remember when they added the disease counters to slow knows that counters can and do add aggro to spells. Disease doesn't seem to add much with the counters anymore because they changed it. Poison counters on the other hand are still pretty high aggro. The proof is actually pretty easy to see if you compare a few spells.<br />
<br />
Compare malos to tash. Malos debuffs by more, does multiple resists and yet is almost no aggro. Seems clear that resist debuffs gerenate very little aggro. Tash on the other hand has posion counters on it and seems to generate a pretty substantial amount of aggro. The obvious conclusion is that the posion counters add aggro.<br />
<br />
Now don't get me wrong the counters alone aren't the only cause of the problem. Take flame lick for example, weak as heck dot and no counters but as noted generates descent amount of aggro. What it does also have tho is an ac debuff on it. Which just happens to be one of the components on cripple too which in my experience is a pretty high aggro spell too. Several of the druid/ranger dots have debuff components on them.<br />
<br />
Even so I still think that per amount of damage done dots generate alot more aggro than nukes. Is it because the aggro each tick is equal to the damage done by the spell so far or even the total damage the spell will do? I don't know. The ony thing I do know is that it is definitely more aggro. I can chain cast nukes for significantly more dps and generate noticably less aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">All I know is, I kept agro off a warrior with a bloodfrenzy and a BoC when doing protector of Dresolisk with just Bane, Blood, pox (pants click) and sharkspine Melee, plus healing myself for 90% of the fight. that's pretty ****ed up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I too think people give counters too much weight. Every spell in fact adds counters of some type(if you look up dispells you can clearly see how many counters they dispell).<br />
Spells have a certain aggro value attached, regardless of the counters and when you refer to a Malos to Tash comparison as proof, I can simply tell you to compare Cripple to Tash. Cripple, as we all know, doesn't add any poison counters, yet it's at least as much aggro.<br />
<br />
From the beginning poison DoTs have been coded to generate huge aggro and every new spell that they add of the line is basically copied over first, before they change a few numbers like Damage/tick etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">it's all in the counters.  Poison counters = MASSIVE UNCONTROLLED aggro.  Poison counters are clearly broken, as the aggro associated with them is over the top.<br />
Disease counters used to generate mad aggro too, however, when Sony decided to make Slow curable, and added disease counters, all slow spells were for a few months &quot;broken&quot; as in if you slowed a mob you would get holy gawd aggro in a way you should not.  They tried this and that and finally settled on just removing all aggro associated with disease counters.  That worked to fix slow aggro, and had the positive affect of making disease DoTs be very little aggro.  Or at least, no more aggro than their DPS warranted. <br />
<br />
Curse counters haven't been parsed for aggro yet, so it's hard to say.  However, it does appear that they lie somewhere between disease counters and poison counters for aggro.  Much less than poison tho, since in my own experiments I have found that Bane generates less aggro than Blood of Saryrn, when applied at the same time in the same situation with the same tank.  Thus PR counters &gt;&gt; curse counters for aggro.  <br />
And you have to keep in mind that Bane does about a fourth more damage than BoS.  So clearly curse counters generate much less aggro than poison counters.  <br />
<br />
If they removed the poison counters from Tash line of Enchanter spells, the Enchies would just love it.  Tash would become a negligible aggro spell, just like Malo line is today.  <br />
<br />
Point is, what is currently broken is poison counter aggro.  Fix that and our problems largely go away. <br />
<br />
I attribute Bane aggro to this: Slow aggro plus Bane DPS plus smallish tank aggro generation due to inferior skills/equipment/playstyle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Trust me, counters aren't the real source of the aggro associated with those spells. There are countless spells with huge aggro which have no poison counters whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Further proof is that a resisted Blood is huge aggro, which in theory it should not if it was about the counters, because counters aren't even applied in case of a resist. I am pretty sure the aggro from Tash was warranted by the fast cast time and it being unresistable from level 1(the only unresistable spell for a long time).<br />
<br />
This doesn't mean that poison DoTs are not higher aggro than our Curse ones. They definitely ARE. But the problem lies more in the coding than in the counters. The code for spells like Blood of Saryrn is more than 5 years old.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Flame Lick is an AC debuff too, like Cripple.  That generates a lot of aggro from mobs.  When I'm in a kite group with a druid who uses Flame Lick, they usually need Voice of Thule to keep aggro and that's when I play nice with the dots.  If I run BoU, BoS, Bane, Anathema, Pox and Ancient Nife they can't hold aggro.  Drop Nife and cast Anathema late in the cycle and they usually hold aggro if I don't crit a lot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure that a resisted spell gives the same aggro as if the spell had landed.  Paladins use Stun and it generates the same aggro even if the mobs are immune to it.  Cease, Desist, Stun, Force of Akilae, etc will all generate the same aggro.  Tainted Breath generates the same aggro as Blood of Saryrn also.  The whole line of each spell seems to have a standard set amount of aggro the line will generate if cast on a mob, whether it lands or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'm pretty sure that a resisted spell gives the same aggro as if the spell had landed.<br />
<br />
Yes, that's correct. <br />
<br />
What I wanted to explain with this is that a resisted Blood will place no poison counters on the mob(because it didn'T land obviously), yet it will generate huge aggro. <br />
The code for poison DoTs of that line is the problem, not the number or type of counters.</div></div><hr />

I can not pull aggro off my guild's tanks with resisted banes and bloods. I can pull aggro if I land them and just refresh them, casting perhaps 1/5 as much DoTs overall.<br />
<br />
As to non-counter spells generating aggro: As others have already pointed out AC debuffs seem to be huge too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I can not pull aggro off my guild's tanks with resisted banes and bloods. I can pull aggro if I land them and just refresh them, casting perhaps 1/5 as much DoTs overall.<br />
<br />
Which shows that there is an inherent problem with how the hate/damage ratio for DoTs is calculated. Resisted Bloods doesn't do any damage, thus the hate is overall lower. <br />
A resisted Blood, however, generates more aggro than a resisted Bane(none of the spells will place counters on the NPC) and I suspect every point of damage from a DoT to generate X amount of aggro, regardless of the counters.<br />
<br />
As to non-counter spells generating aggro: As others have already pointed out AC debuffs seem to be huge too.<br />
<br />
As I said before, *all* spells that leave an icon on a mob have &quot;counters&quot;. Some are just not cureable, yet different non-cureable spells will have different counters, which seem to have no relation to the aggro they generate, though.<br />
<br />
I have no proof, but I highly suspect that hate attached to spells is based on the type of spell. Spells that the Devs considered very powerful back then(Slows, Tash, AC debuff) generate a lot of aggro. <br />
<br />
The fact, that Malo(s) generates very low aggro, is a result of them being an upgrade of the Malaise line(which was very resistable). They must have merely changed the entry Resist: Magic to Resist: Unresistable without changing the entry for Hate(1-10):1(hypothetical field here).<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that these speculations are just based on observations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well, it matters little whether poison counters and AC debuffs are huge aggro or if poison counters and AC debuffs are coded to be huge aggro in the end.  :p <br />
<br />
Net result is the same, some spells create heaps of aggro for no good reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Gonna stick with it being in spell coding.  I guess when all poison based spells were coded, the Dev was in an evil mood :P  Probably did the Druid/Ranger fire DoT lines after lunch.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Basically, yes. The only problem is that I saw a post from Brenlo(was a Dev for sure, maybe not Brenlo) on the Live boards acknowledging, that there is a aggro problem with poison DoTs, but they didn't know why. <br />
<br />
That alone is already alarming and I wouldn't like them to lower the poison counters on our DoTs based on the conviction of the player base and ending up screwing the PvP people, who actually appreciate high counter DoTs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Removing the poison counters isn't the fix.<br />
Removing the aggro from the poison counters is the fix, just like they did with disease dots long ago.<br />
The counters with disease caused massive damage.<br />
Disease counter aggro being &quot;nerfed&quot; was one of the main reasons SKs now have pure taunt spells.<br />
They came to rely on spells like disease cloud (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=340&amp;source=Live)  to pull aggro, even through it was a level 9 spell for them doing a massive 5 damage + 1 per tick and only giving 1 disease counter.<br />
They would just cast disease cloud on a mob, and pull aggro almost immediately.<br />
And if they didn't, the recast time was super fast such that they could chain cast it until they got aggro from this spell, and it was essentially no mana cost (well, it's 10 mana, which doesn't count compared to spending 10-30x as much mana now for the same effect off other spells).<br />
Drop aggro from poison counters is the fix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">You may be able to set up a test of how much aggro each spell actually generates by using an SK and their aggro spells.  Have them cast Terror of Thule/Terris, which have fixed hate amounts, and then throw on one of your spells and see when they turn.  It would work like a Diophantine equation.<br />
<br />
a*x - b*y = 0<br />
<br />
a = amount of hate Terror of Thule/Terris gives<br />
x = number of times SK casts the spell<br />
<br />
b = amount of hate shaman spell gives<br />
y = number of times shaman casts the spell<br />
<br />
<br />
It would require a lot of values, since you're really solving to find the value of b for a particular spell.  The good news is that this equation will always have a solution.  The bad news is that you'll have to factor out a lot of stuff that might affect aggro additionally (distance from mob, ticks of damage on DoTs, etc).  It's probably easier to bug a developer to reveal the value a certain spell has.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Near as I've been able to figure, the damage a DoT somehow has its aggro modified by the counters to which it is applied, something like damage * counter aggro modifier = hate.  Thus, damage dealt by disease and epic have little aggro per tick because it's low or moderate damage applied to low-aggro counters, but a spell like Blood of Saryrn or Bane has HIGH damage modified by HIGH AGGRO counters.  The initial landing doesn't pull aggro, the first one or two ticks don't, but that massive hate built up by the modified &quot;hate damage ratio&quot; of hp of damage to hate point eventually overwhelms everything.<br />
<br />
All I really know is Slow + Cripple + Blood of Saryrn + Bane = absolutely no way in the universe you're taking aggro away from me...provided I live long enough to cast them all.<br />
<br />
They call us kings of slow.  They should call us kings of aggro instead.  If there's anything we can truly own, it's aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">...My assumption at this point, is aggro is coded into spells.  From a DoT perspective, poison would have to be the most aggro.  Fire would make sense for a close second.  Curse and Diesease following close behind.  The only way damage would be brought into the equasion is if two different people casted the same type DoT of different damage levels...<br />
<br />
I am not sure, i agree with your assumption about different spell types giving different aggro by default, but it's certainly true SOE can define different aggro formulas for separate spells.<br />
<br />
Remember the fuzz about heal aggro for CHs and the comparable heal aggro of direct heals (especially druid ones)? There was a lot of complaining, when player analysis seem to show a 3.000 HP direct heal could draw more aggro than a 7.500 HP CH. It is a while ago, so my memory is foggy but i think SOE tweaked the formulas to calm the angry mobs :D.<br />
<br />
But i would guess, such 'special' formulas are only applied for special spells, that need different form of aggro. Most spells probably follow a limited set of default formulas, as i can't imagine SOE defining 100s of different formulas for every single spell.<br />
<br />
If counters have or have not a direct impact on aggro (my ASSumption would be they have some impact), i don't know or care. But in practice i know (from game experience), that poison DOTs draw vastly higher aggro compared to similar curse DOTs or DD spells. That should be fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">If you can, exp a bit at the castle in PoFire and do this little experiment.<br />
<br />
Drop Malos and slow then :<br />
<br />
For some pulls, just use your cold DD only.<br />
For some pulls, just use your poison DD only.<br />
For some pulls, just use your disease DoTs only (try to drop 3 or 4 if you can ;)).<br />
For some pulls, just use your magic DoTs only (try to drop 3 or 4 too).<br />
For some pulls, just use your poison Dots only (try to drop 3 or 4 too).<br />
<br />
For the DD, with approx the same number of nukes, I was able to steal aggro. But what's funny it that with less poison nukes and so, less damage, I got aggro without trouble while I still had to cast one or two more times with the cold DD.<br />
<br />
For the Dots, even with 4 disease dots, I barely never got aggro.<br />
With the curses, got the aggro at the 3rd dot usually.<br />
And with the poison ones ? Usually, the first one was enough to get the aggro.<br />
<br />
As many said, how is it possible to steal aggro on a very well equipped warrior/pal/sk when you drop 3 dots while wizards nukes for 10k minimum in the same time and keep unnoticed by the mobs ???<br />
<br />
That always bugged me.</div></div><hr />

Now, based on the actual debuff of the spells, and the fact that both are unresistable, One would think that Malos would be MUCH higher aggro, however in practice we know this is false.  Considering lucy is pretty good at spotting straight +hate effects on spells, that leaves you with the *1* poison counter as the difference.  Poison counters DO have a heavey aggro cost.</div></div><hr />

Slot Description <br />
2:  Decrease Cold Resist by 55 <br />
3:  Decrease Magic Resist by 55 <br />
4:  Decrease Poison Resist by 55 <br />
5:  Decrease Fire Resist by 55 <br />
<br />
Now, based on the actual debuff of the spells, and the fact that both are unresistable, One would think that Malos would be MUCH higher aggro, however in practice we know this is false.  Considering lucy is pretty good at spotting straight +hate effects on spells, that leaves you with the *1* poison counter as the difference.  Poison counters DO have a heavey aggro cost.<br />
<br />
The fact, that Malo(s) generates very low aggro, is a result of them being an upgrade of the Malaise line(which was very resistable). They must have merely changed the entry Resist: Magic to Resist: Unresistable without changing the entry for Hate(1-10):1(hypothetical field here).<br />
<br />
<br />
I am pretty sure the aggro from Tash was warranted by the fast cast time and it being unresistable from level 1(the only unresistable spell for a long time).<br />
<br />
<br />
The code for Malo(s) and Tash is over 5 years old. When they upgraded the line through the years, they just never touched the aggro values for them. <br />
Notice how they copy older spells of the same line and just adjust &quot;relevant&quot; fields when they create &quot;new&quot; ones?</div></div><hr />

They call us kings of slow.  They should call us kings of aggro instead.  If there's anything we can truly own, it's aggro.<br />

That's awesome - I wish I could make that my sig  :p <br />

I 3-box with a mage.  I can nuke away happily with my mage, landing 2k nukes (just got my level-61 Firebolt of Tallon which does roughly 2k) and won't pull agro off my shaman, who uses just slow + Bane of Nife.  I'd love to see something done with DOT agro to make it more appropriate to the level of damage being done.<br />

Use Bane and DD spells.<br />

If you want to use Poison Dots.  Have a paladin tank.<br />

Shaman should beg for a buff which has a 10 min recast, 5 min duration.  When you would normally die you are Feign Deathed with 0 mana and 10% hp.  I know I'd use it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I too think people give counters too much weight. Every spell in fact adds counters of some type(if you look up dispells you can clearly see how many counters they dispell).<br />
<br />
I'm sorry but this is wrong. Dispells do not work on counter. Disease, poison and curse are the only counters in the game. If you look them up in lucy dispells do have a number listed after them like cures have but that doesn't mean that they mean the same thing. In the case of dispells the number is apparently a level modifier which increases the chance of the dispell working.<br />
<br />
Counters and cures are always 100% consistant and repeatable on thier results. If a cure spell cures a particular spell in one cast it will always cure it in one cast. Blood of nadox will always cure Bab's ae in fire on everone in the group in 1 cast. Dispell are not consistant by any means. Sometimes they dispell nothing, sometimes they dispell multiple things. Sometime they skip the first buff and dispell ones past them. That is a fundimental difference between the 2 and a clear indication to me that they do not use counters.<br />
<br />
Spells have a certain aggro value attached, regardless of the counters and when you refer to a Malos to Tash comparison as proof, I can simply tell you to compare Cripple to Tash. Cripple, as we all know, doesn't add any poison counters, yet it's at least as much aggro.<br />
<br />
From the beginning poison DoTs have been coded to generate huge aggro and every new spell that they add of the line is basically copied over first, before they change a few numbers like Damage/tick etc.<br />
<br />
While I can't say your definitively wrong about this I don't agree with this either. It just seems like looking for an answer someplace else because you don't like the obvious and contradicts experience and the patch msg of when disease counters where added to slow. It was specifically stated that the counters where generating aggro and that it was being fixed. When Sk's complained about loosing disease cloud as a way of holding aggro the response was we didn't intend that but we'll make new spells for you to generate aggro.<br />
<br />
Those spells are another thing that lead me to beleive your incorrect. If you look at spells like terror of thule http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3405&amp;source=Live they do nothing but add aggro yet they have an effect slot to do that. Assuming you could set an aggro value for the spell like you set a mana cost for the spell why would you need to add an effect to the spell to add aggro? That just wouldn't really make any sense to me.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong I'm not saying that counters are the only source of aggro on dots. As I've said before the issue is complicated because there are so many variations on dots. initial dmg, no initial dmg, debuff components for all sorts of different things etc. Even so beyond the counters, debuffs and other complications I do beleive there is something probably in the way they calculate aggro from dots, not a property of the spells, that point for point of damage they generate more aggro than nukes or melee dmg.<br />
<br />
As for the specific example of cripple I attribute the aggro on cripple to the ac debuff on it which just happens to be on ranger/druids immolate dots too. There have been other procs/spells that debuff ac and they have been noted as high aggro spells too. The fact that other spells with out counters can generate aggro doesn't mean that counters aren't a source of aggro on spells that include them. There are obviously multiple ways for spells to generate aggro. The stun effect of stun spells has been tested to generate aggro and is commonly accepted that the stun effect it's self generates aggro yet other spells can and do generate aggro too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Actually Disease DoT's pull almost no aggro at all.<br />
<br />
I can pull a mob with Slow, /pet kill . . . when mob hits 95% I can back out and Scooby has aggro.<br />
<br />
I can then proceed to cast:  Breath of Ultor, Plague &amp; Pox of Bertox and Scooby holds aggro.  I suppose if I was patient enough, I could just sit back and pop a cold one, heal Scooby and kill mobs.  However, at 50% on the mob I'll toss on a Blood of Saryn and the mob *definitely* notices that.<br />
<br />
Yea, I know, I could root it.  *sigh*</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you had an internal means of setting hate values, would you want to make it public to everyone?  If players knew the exact hate values that every spell generated, then they could exploit situations.  <br />
<br />
If you look at the &quot;Raw Data&quot; tab on the spells, you'll see there's a lot of information there.<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spellraw.html?id=4901&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
There are 12 &quot;slots&quot; in which effects can take place for a spell.  All spells use slots.  If you look at attrib1 for Daluda's Mending, it's a value of 0.  If you look at base1 it's 1550.  Obviously an attrib value of 0 means &quot;alter hitpoints&quot; and the related base value is how much it is altered.  Now look at any DD spell and attrib1 is 0 and base1 is the value of the nuke, but negative, since it alters hitpoints negatively.  That's why heals are sometimes based upon DD templates in the history, since DDs and heals are the same kind of spell; one gives hitpoints and one takes them away.<br />
<br />
For SK aggro spells attrib1 is 92 (alter hate attribute) and base1 is the value of the hate to be added.  Any spell or ability that directly affects hate will have an attrib value of 92 in its raw data page.<br />
<br />
There are still about 22 values that are labeled as &quot;unknown&quot; and one of those could be how much &quot;internal&quot; hate a spell generates.  The last 6 unknown listings are for spell resist values and such during PVP and for categorization in the database.<br />
<br />
For heals and direct damage spells, the hate they generate may be in the legacy code.  Something like if a wizard lands a nuke for 1800, then X% of that value is added to that wizard's hate value on the mob's hate list.  I figure the same for heals, but at a lesser percentage.  Some spells don't do damage or heal damage, so hate has to be calculated a different way.  I would assume an internal value is set somewhere for the line of spells and kept at that value for the entire line.  From a programming perspective, that's the easiest alternative to putting in a specific calculation for each class of spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Speaking as a necro (ex-shaman), who basically does nothing else but DoT's things, I can assure you that the counters have a lot to do with it. It's virtually impossible to pull agro with disease spells, It's virtually impossible not to pull agro with poison spells. It doesn't specifically matter which spell you use, all spells with poison counters are high agro. Curse counters are significantly less, but still higher than counter free DoT's.<br />
<br />
Putting down relatively fast, counter free DoT's, such as funeral pyre attract very little agro. Suggesting that a DoT is otherwise considered as a series of small nukes for agro purposes. Of course a DoT with an effect, such as snare, attracts additional agro for that effect which is almost certainly applied only on landing.<br />
<br />
Just my perceptions. Proving this conclusively will be rather tedious.</div></div><hr />

I'm fully aware that there are unknowns in there ang things are still being figured out, like the rescent proc rate. If you think that one of those unknown is aggro related then come up with an explanation of it and testing to support it. Till then I'll still stick to the beleif that it's in the code and the counters and other debuffs that alot of dots have.</div></div><hr />
