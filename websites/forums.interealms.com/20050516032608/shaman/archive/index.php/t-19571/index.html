<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">im on drinal, the server with the second highest population count, legends being foremost.<br />
yet for the life of me i can't seem to get a group in the last 2-3 weeks.<br />
i've tried everything even starting my own ldon groups so i could get bane and burning affliction 4, well after sitting LFG for 4 hours i gave up.<br />
when i do get tells its for PoD CY or PoS armadillos ...<br />
i know for a fact there are not many shaman on drinal, i have alot of shaman friends, you will barely ever see more than THREE in an open raid or zone at one time. so i decided to just quest to change things.<br />
i have been trying to get old friends to help me with my chardok quest for the spirit wracked cord.<br />
i need to kill drusella and get the urn, its a huge bottle neck, most people have never even heard of charasis.<br />
so now, after being beaten and rezzed more times than i can remember.<br />
im asking, is there any zone where i can solo for exp, not loot, just exp.<br />
take a look at my gear, aa's gimme some advice ...<br />
<br />
thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Greetings Friend :D<br />
First let me say I too am on Drinal . Its a wonderfull server .<br />
As far as LDoN normal setting adventures go I have the folloing advise .<br />
#1 Dont worry about class composure . 6 warriors can pretty much win a normal . Just grab 5 LFG people over level 60 and have some fun . Im not saying youll win EVERY time but youll do just fine mostly id bet .<br />
#2 If you have two people that are your friends and you trust them as good players , Dont be scared too go for a 3 man .<br />
<br />
Now as for soloing here is my advise .<br />
#1 PoTactics , I like too root rot the Diaku guys near the front , Seems there pretty easy and I get like close too 5% aa per kill .<br />
#2 PoD courtyard I solo here sometimes becase I find it a fun spot , I think in get 2-3% aa per kill .<br />
#3 Umbral plains , I solo here mostly becase its fun and I just really like the zone . I do think that you get 2-3% aa per kill here though but the kills are kinda long and It can be hard too get singles .<br />
<br />
I hope this helps and /t me anytime im on what as were on the same server . Me and you and say a melee type of some type could 3 man a LDoN sometime :D</div></div><hr />

have been trying the daiku since i got flagged for tactics, i just dislike the harmtouchers for 1k lol.<br />
i will indeed send you a tell sometime, see you ingame friend ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Be sure to check out the Hunting Ground forum for 60-65. Lots of good advice in there. Droga comes to mind as a good place to xp with cash as a bonus.<br />

On an off-topic topic Drinal isn't close to top of the population list any time I've checked. Bristlebane is ridiculously overpopulated and is number one on the list pretty much any time except 4am-8am EST when Veeshan and Karana are at their peak.<br />
