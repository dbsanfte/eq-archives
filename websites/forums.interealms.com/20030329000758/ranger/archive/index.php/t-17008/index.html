<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaneras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I hate to start a we suck thread, but after sampling some of what PoP has to offer I feel as if the ranger has no place in this land.<br />
<br />
I play a 60 ranger, who hasn't gotten flagged yet so I'm still on Tier 1 working AA, but it seems we are once again the most unnecessary class in EQ.  Lately I've been playing my shaman who is now 58, he gets groups usually within 5 minutes and often can be selective about where he wants to hunt.  My ranger on the other hand, will often go LFG for a long time unless a I start my own group or join my guild.  I see rangers and mages LFG for hours sometimes and it's disheartening.  <br />
<br />
If you look at the other classes (outside the holy 3), they all bring something special to PoP, things which groups look for.  <br />
<br />
SK - great tank, superior agro, feign death<br />
Paladin- great tank, superior agro, group heals<br />
Rogue - maximum damage output<br />
Monk - feign death, excellent damage<br />
Bard - jack of all trades, most under-rated class<br />
Shaman - crucial in PoP, slow, uber melee buffs<br />
Beastlord - can slow, spirutal purity, big pet damage<br />
Wizards - Can make a living in the trails.<br />
Mages - see wizards, though they can't get groups outside trials.<br />
Necros - mana pump, charm, dots.<br />
Druids - have a tough time getting groups, but very effective in trials.<br />
Rangers - ???????<br />
<br />
So...as far as usefulness is concerned, it's becoming easier for me to log my shaman instead of my ranger.   Through all the thick and thin, I've always been adamant about playing my ranger, because I wanted to be an archer, but PoP is forcing me to change.<br />
<br />
The only solution I see is to give rangers something that groups will actually need, like feign death.  I know this has been talked about before so please don't freak out.   Maybe a spell called &quot;guise of the possum&quot; or something like that, make it use a foraged component to activate, not a spell or ability.  Otherwise, I see my shaman getting logged more and my ranger less.  <br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really see no problems with rangers in PoP.  To be honest, I've heard alot more rogues complaining that rangers are doing close to their damage output, plus we have the utility of a hybrid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First thought is why isn't &quot;join my guild&quot; your first choice?  I joined the guild I am in well over 2 years ago.  Since that point I have been in maybe 5 pickup groups.  Why join a guild if you don't wanna group with them?  These folks are your team, they know you, you know them, you should work together as often as you can.<br />
<br />
Second thought, anyone who avoids ranger as a damage dealer in a group is a moron, and if someone is that dumb about things, how good of a group can they make up?  We put out awesome damage, we have spells that let us manage agro very well, which means that if we know how to play, we don't tax the cleric/druid/shaman, and if you've gotten the AA's pumped into archery, our damage goes even further through the roof.  I haven't seen a &quot;we can't take you, your a ranger comment&quot; to me or any of the ranger's I am friends with since Kunark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Timmit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I dunno...I rarely had a problem getting a pickup group at 61, and I have even less of a problem at 65.  My usual LFG time is about 10 mins (during the server peak time), although sometime's I get invited the second I turn lfg on.  Maybe Xegony is weird, but I don't see many rangers lfg in PoP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed.  With Harmony and an extended range item (Ivory Claw Necklace has ER 4), pulling is very easy in Nightmare or Disease.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's your problem right there. Get some level first. As Sean said before, level 65 is not the pinaccle, it's the base.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sasandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">in PoP ranger's are a lot better than they used to be IMO, we are now one of the best pullers there is with harmony since almost every zone is outdoors, can give the entire group a significant boost in DPS via atk buffs, 193 visable at with SoP, SoT, and FoN.<br />
<br />
also with our high inate atk, low ac on PoP mobs, and our new nukes we do significant damage, typicaly in xp groups I do as much as rogues and monks with my melee, even on guild raids i'm almost always in the top 3 for damage when i'm meleeing (not archery), myself, the higher monks, and the higher rogues swap around that postition depending on the mobs AC, resists, positioning, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>lotholeaffall2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Kaneras, I feel your pain. Grouping in PoP is not easy, and soloing has become much harder IMO. Shammy's are one class that is almost always required in PoP, while rangers are not. There is nothing wrong with us I would say, but PoP has mostly forced people into the following group layout (other combos are possible but xp is not as good):<br />
<br />
1) Plate tank<br />
2) Cleric (maybe druid, or perhaps shammy but I have yet to be in a group where shammy was main healer in PoP).<br />
3) Slower (Shammies prefered)<br />
4) Can be open but most likely will go to a chanter if group has shammy to slow<br />
<br />
Spots 5 and 6 can be filled with:<br />
<br />
rng/rog/mnk/wiz/mag/nec/bst/dru/pal/sk/war<br />
<br />
We just have to compete for fewer spots now. Many other classes have become candidates for the dmg dealing spots.<br />
<br />
And frankly, I should say I am definetely not one of the rangers that can outdamage similarly equiped and leveled rogues and monks on a regular basis. My gear is not bad for my level but it is math really... rogue backstab/monk higher dmg table and special attacks &gt; our atk advantage and nukes. Maybes this somehow changes in the 60's but I would like to know how.<br />
<br />
But I won't claim upgrades for us because of this. The problem is not with our class (given I have some suggestions) but with the new required group layout in PoP. <br />
<br />
Monks and rogues felt it too, check their boards and you will see a 8 page thread that touches this. The difference is that with PoP they lost something that they should have never have had in the first place. Monk pulling is not absolutely essencial anymore, and rogue dmg is nice but not essencial. Now they seem to want &quot;upgrades&quot; because magic users became more viable as dmg dealers, and some of their abilities really shine in PoP.<br />
<br />
I, on the other hand, think it is great that now all classes have some appeal to groups. But there is a bottleneck for the 5th and 6th spots in groups, and maybe SoE should address it somehow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sasandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">of those 4 spots, cleric, plate tank, slower, enchanter, 3 really aren't required at all, people seem to think they are, but in reality they aren't, actualy the best group i've ever had in PoP didn't have 3 of those 4, it was in PoV, the groups was myself (tank), shammy, druid, mage, rogue, rogue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aeneran Orcreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Maybe Druzzil is a more ranger friendly server, or I'm just lucky, but I havent had any real issues with pickup groups.  It seems to me I get groups pretty fast.  As to what rangers bring to the table I think we have a whole lot to offer these days.  Speaking as a 62 ranger I do have some things that no other class can bring.  I buff the party for over 100 shown Atk(SoT/CoP), harmony pull all kinds of camps with a failure rate that in my experience compares very well with a FD puller(ie adds or dead ranger is about the same as adds or a dead monk),  and I use archery most of the time so I provide plenty of dps with very little aggro unlike monks/rogues who have a much higher likelyhood of the mob turning on them thus requiring the healers mana or a reduction in their damage output.<br />
<br />
As to the trials themselves(although have only won Exe its what most ppl say is the easiest trial), our tools are tailor made for them, we can aggro fast enough to MT all the mobs up to Exe(and lots of rangers can tank him, I died the two times ppl asked me to MT him, but I dont have great gear), have summoned nukes for nice dps on the rocks,  can chloroblast party members in a limited number of healers situation, and had Trueshot to destroy the Exe for again little or no aggro when the time came.<br />
<br />
I think we have some item issues still, but I have found PoP to be a ranger paradise so far.  Now only if I could get more guild Warriors flagged to tank in Tier 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Syna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have not had a problem finding groups. As already mentioned, ranger own for pulling, especially in PoI, PoJ and PoD, due to Harmony. I don't know about the other areas. <br />
<br />
Snare is totally important as well as aggro management (pulling stuff off clerics) and root parking (i.e. CC). <br />
<br />
Lastly, our damage is damn good. IMHO, beastlords still have problems with their pets and shammies will always be favored over them for buffs. Rogues and Monks are good, but they just cannot help out groups with attack buffs, snare and etc. <br />
<br />
With all due respect, if you don't like your ranger anymore and cannot see why you should play him, then start a shadowknight or something. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aerilyn Elvenboon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have never had an easier time finding groups as I have now in PoP.  :)  The secret is out that we have much to bring to XP groups in the planes: great damage (AM3 is teh pwn and our new nukes add even more), buffs people love, harmo pulling, snare.  I like being able to do arround 80 DPS and do it away from the fray and seldom need healing, this is one of the most invaluble things we bring to the table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Metra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Everyone knows that &quot;Rangers can't tank&quot; right?<br />
<br />
Not neccessarily. I've noticed that (starting around level 58) I am actually (surprise) able to tank effectively, despite my lackluster gear (not even runed scout's armor yet except for one slot). The secret to ranger tanking in PoP is our ability to grab aggro fast and hold it solid. It turns out that in PoP, clerics spend most of their mana keeping the tank alive those first few seconds until the mob can be slowed/crippled/etc. Once the mob has been gimped, the amount of mana needed to keep the tank alive is relatively minimal. And the slower can't slow until the main tank has solid aggro, otherwise the mob will bounce around and the cleric will be wasting mana CHealing everyone. So the faster you can grab aggro, the sooner the slower can slow, which means less mana spent on CHeals.<br />
 <br />
For some reasons Warriors seem to have real problems holding aggro at that level, whereas a snare + immolate will stick them on you like glue. I've tanked for hours at RCY in PoD without a problem, and our shaman was casting slow the instant the mob was in range, with no aggro problems. So in that particular situation, I am actually tanking *better* than a warrior, in the sense that I'm more mana efficient for the cleric. (SKs will of course be even better.)<br />
 <br />
This only holds true, of course, for the weaker PoP mobs such as lightcrawlers and underbulks. Rangers will have a hard time tanking mobs that can kill you in less time than it takes to slow them. (The foreboding guardians in PoN are an example of a mob that I have trouble with - although if the mobs are slowed and the main tank dies I can take over and finish it.)<br />
 <br />
So this gives you even more options in terms of group roles, and can only help in finding groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fufinski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I actually feel much more needed in PoP then I did before.  I regularly get asked if I am free to come and tank for guild groups because they know I can do it.   Metra is right that the great thing about rangers is there ability to build agro fast.  In a recent pickup group the MT was a palie and the shaman commented that she loved palie tanks as they are the only ones to hold agro after slow.  I asked what about rangers and they didn't seem to think much of them.  The palie then left and I carried on pulling and tanking.  The shaman had been waiting a few seconds with the palie and then me before slowing, so I said slow on inc.  The shaman never got agro.  She said she never realised a ranger could hold agro like that.  The secret is to toss in a TW just before you hit camp and then a few more.<br />
<br />
<br />
And as for pulling, I was puller for groups from my early levels untill late 40s, and then as I entered the raid game monks took over.  I now find myself getting to be puller on raids for the first time in a year or so.  I love the new harmony.  I love the fact that I get to do a part of the game I had almost forgot I liked.  I even teamed up with an SK recently on a raid to safely tag team.  I harmony, he pulls and FD I then tag from him (and harmony any adds on him to help split them).  It worked like a dream.<br />
<br />
As for Sasandra's best group I would agree.  A shaman and druid are more then enough healing, and teh druid can nuke as well since a slowed mob really is not too bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>shadow-wolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I agree with Metra, at lvl 56, I've tanked fairly well for the past 2 nights in PoN and PoD.  In nightmare i was MT, AC little over 1000 and HPs around 3400.  Monk pulling, i'd tag with bow and snare once mob was in range, followed by a flame lick, and the shammy could resist debuff and slow before the mob reached me, or shortly after.  usually from there, 1 or 2 c-heals for the fight.  In PoD i was grouped with 57 war, 57 war, 59 shammy, 60 cleric, 55 wiz, and the shammy was continually getting agro from debuff+slow, so i told them I'd tank the next one and show them how to hold agro.  did snare + flame lick, taunting etc. mob locked onto me and didn't budge.  I told the wizzy to chain nuke if she wanted, just to see if it would move off me, but with a flame lick every now and then, the mob was stuck to me like glue for the entire fight.  Afterwards the shammy was saying &quot;what the hell holds agro so well?&quot; since it was the first pull she could slow without getting hit at least once.  Obviously this is only yard trash type stuff (treants, ravens, underbulks, lightcrawlers), I'd surely get owned with tougher stuff, but it sure is fun to tank now and then.  The other thing we bring to PoP is decent CC without someone dedicated to it.  I was doing CC in PoD on pulls with more than one, wiz would try and root on the way in, but it was easier for me to snare add, flame lick to ensure it chased me, kite away and root.  Then when we killed main mob I'd jolt a few times and by the time root broke, MT had generated enough agro to bring it back to camp spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm really enjoying my role in PoP as a puller and damage dealer. The new harmony works great, last night I was working in conjunction with an SK to pull the air giants in the Tower in BoT. I've yet to have a resist on the new harmony since PoP came out (touch wood).<br />
<br />
I'd say I do equivalent or greater damage than a similarly equipped/aa'd rogue. Not to mention the damage we add to the group as a whole with SoT/SoP.<br />
<br />
And the no damage Earthen Roots rocks! It's a great tool for helping out the enchanter with CC on multiple adds, and with it's -30 resist adjustment it's the most reliable root in the game, as far as I know.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Taewedar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Personally I don't like POP that much, but I don't feel rangers got shafted that badly and we still have a role. (Although the parchment turn in is a headache for hybrids). <br />
<br />
Usually if I'm spending time LFG, there are several others as well. I can tank if need be, but it's not what I'm best suited for. <br />
Our atk buffs, dmg output and utility make us a fairly useful class. Not required, but certainly not disliked. Personally I sorta enjoy not being required, because it lets you find a replacment for a group fairly easy. If I play my enchanter, it's much harder to leave a group, because doing so usually means they have to stop until they find another. <br />
<br />
Pop in someways removed the holy trinity along with the various adjustments made over time. I've done BOT with a druid healing. True we had a warrior tanking and an enchanter to slow. I've been in POV groups with a paladin tanking and a druid healing and shaman slowing. You almost always require slow of some form, but the rest is relatively easy to swap in and out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>lotholeaffall2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">of those 4 spots, cleric, plate tank, slower, enchanter, 3 really aren't required at all, people seem to think they are, but in reality they aren't, actualy the best group i've ever had in PoP didn't have 3 of those 4, it was in PoV, the groups was myself (tank), shammy, druid, mage, rogue, rogue.<br />
<br />
So your group had 2 of the classes I mentioned as required. Your gear/level has to be much superior than mine then for you to be able to tank, not bad news however, means I have something to look forward to. Still, pallies and sks can hold agro np and don't get slapped like me :)<br />
<br />
But I need to disagree there, the best groups I have been in PoP had the following classes:<br />
<br />
-Plate tank (warriors can hold agro quite well nowadays with recent taunt changes). If I tanked our cleric would have problems most of the time, except for things like PoN yard-trash.<br />
-Shammy that could pull and take some hits.<br />
-Enchanter haste and mezz!<br />
-Cleric as healer. Nothing beats that.<br />
<br />
Our brave shammy queued already slowed mobs at camp, chanter mezzed them, we killed one by one.<br />
<br />
It is good to see most of you have no problem finding groups. I need to ask , thou, have you tried the pickup group scene? I can always find guild/friends groups because, well, their are my guildies and friends and like to group with me. But is everyone that lucky going out there and shouting &quot;Ranger LFG&quot;? I can't say I am :( .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kaneras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">About rangers tanking in PoP, this is just outright silly.  Many rangers will die to an unslowed fiendish consort before the cleric can even get a CH off.  I don't think I've ever been in a PoP group with a chain class tanking, most clerics would not even stay in that group, it's too inefficient.<br />
<br />
Pulling with harmony in PoP may work, but people still don't respect rangers when it comes to pulling.  99% of group leaders still want monks for pulling.  Many mobs in PoI and PoN (scourge hobgobs come to mind) are not affected by harmony.<br />
<br />
Since I browse the shaman boards a lot, I see things like this often.  This statement refers to Legacy of Ykesha.<br />
<br />
The real question on everyone's mind is: What classes will be Froglok playable? I'd even play a ranger, if it were a Froglok. <br />
<br />
I'm at a quandary as to wether I should spend more time playing my ranger or my shaman, so I've decdided to play both for the time being.  I've got to admit, I have a great desire to solo an ice burrower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Neetero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I was doing CC in PoD on pulls with more than one, wiz would try and root on the way in, but it was easier for me to snare add, flame lick to ensure it chased me, kite away and root.  <br />
<br />
Surprised more rangers aren't using TW instead of flame lick.  TW is faster casting (less chance of interrupt while tanking and more damage from melee), less mana, and will not prevent chanters from mezzing adds.<br />
<br />
TW &gt; FL  Try it sometime, I bet you won't go back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dravack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Bah....<br />
<br />
This ranger can't tank crap is stupid.  I duo with my cleric all the time in PoV with no problems at all.  My gear isn't anything to die over and I'm not loaded down with uber items.  One thing to notice, if you are going to tank, pull out a 2hander and watch the dmg you take go WAY down, they riposte alot up there.<br />
<br />
On another note, If I feel like grouping instead of 2boxin with my cleric, I shout &quot;lvl65 EQ/AM3 ranger lfg&quot;, I get a group within seconds.  An EQ/AM3 ranger is loved by pickup groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shugamayatu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Ranger's tank just fine in PoP XP groups. Even in tier 2 planes.<br />
<br />
I do guild groups and pick-ups, I don't have problems getting a group. Honestly, I'll do whatever role is apropriate, or that the group needs me to do (tank,damage,pulls,ghetto CC, etc)<br />
<br />
1. Levels = god, get them, there's no reason to stay at 60 if you're hunting in PoP. A level 65 &gt; a level 60 any way you cut it. (But I've got EQ/AM3! - Waahh! MT dies and you're only usefull as a speedbump while folks gate/evac/run. lvl 65 = tank it and let the cleric click/rez the MT in so he can be ready for the next pull)<br />
<br />
2. Rangers tanking = the cleric has to heal you, and only you, cause nobody will get agro off you short of lifeburn/manaburn.<br />
<br />
3. Ranger pulling = chanter/shammy can slow on inc, TW or snare will grab agro right back to you in almost all situations. You can either then tank or shed to MT as needed.<br />
<br />
4. Ranger as damage - we rule! and bring utility.<br />
<br />
The problem isn't with PoP, or Rangers, but with your expectations of both. Set yourself up for failure, and you will. It's as simple as that.<br />
<br />
I've done all the camps mentioned in this thread as the Main Tank, it's just not that hard if you put your mind to it. I leveled 62-4 almost exclusively on Guardians in PoN. Pull with harmony/snare, and just walk/kite the bugger until he's slowed and then engage, you'll still eat the HT, but no biggie. The only requirements for this camp are a lvl 60+ slower, and a cleric. (i've done it with as low as a 54 cleric)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Viken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Rangers...<br />
<br />
 - Most zones our outdoors so we can pull better then monks and take less of a beating on the way back compared to druids.<br />
<br />
 - We raise the dps of the entire group with SoT and SoP<br />
<br />
 - Patch heals with Chloroblast<br />
<br />
 - Amazing damage output with AM3 since PoP tends to give you large areas to hunt in<br />
<br />
 - With enough HP and AA we can even tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Delyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I don't know why people are having such a horrible time getting groups as a ranger. Maybe the zone is just crowded? I know PoN on Aro had been like DL was in its peak (frequently over 100 people in the zone /shudder).  I doubt your lack of group was due to you being a ranger.<br />
<br />
As far as &quot;required&quot; classes for a group. BAH. There no such thing imo.  Have to be ready to adapt to the situation. You can make just about any group work.<br />
<br />
Those that doubt a rangers ablity to tank in a pinch or as the MT in certain groups on certain mobs in PoP are goobers or don't have any confidence in their class or the healers backing them up. I personally have Mtanked in PoJ and PoD (frequently) and PoN, PoI (on occassion). I  have recently started grouping in Storms and have MT there when a) the warrior was ...in space somewhere I guess because he just wasn't responding to the stimuli of a pull b) after a tank when link dead for a few pulls (on the lvl 60ish frogs inthe cave) c) when the MT died and I stepped up to kill whatever it was that killed him. Not my preferred position, I do more damage if I dont' have to tank, but I can do it if I need to. <br />
<br />
lvl 60 ranger btw, not even in full skyshrine armor yet. So no  'uber high lvl ranger'<br />
<br />
And yeah =) ripostes are mean. Find a good twohander and a decent alternate haste item if you find yourself having to tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Reandn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I have trouble getting a pickup group sometimes, but I think those times are when there are lots of people LFG.  At a time like that the best way to get a group might be to start putting one together yourself.<br />
<br />
But in general, assuming a slot is open and they don't feel they need to fill it with healer/slower/cc/(plate tank), then I think many people actively seek out rangers to fill out their group. Especially AM3/EQ rangers.<br />
<br />
We offer very solid DPS, we buff all the other melee's DPS, we can pull, we don't need much healing (zero if not pulling, some if pulling), we can be backup healer, we can do root/snare crowd control, and we can be backup tank (and in some places main tank).<br />
<br />
I had an interesting pickup group in POV last night -- shaman (a very good one), enchanter (dire charm), 64 warrior and me (63 ranger AM3/EQ).  We were doing the castle area and the XP was rolling in.  Of course this group worked because everybody was very good at their jobs -- we had a tough 3-pull and at the end of it the shaman was at 95% mana ;-P  But certainly those folks were happy to have me in their group and I don't think a rogue or monk could have quite filled the role I was filling.<br />
<br />
As a community we can enhance the group desirability of rangers in pickup groups by performing well when we do get in them.  The more people who see what a ranger can do, the more they will think of a ranger when putting together their group.<br />
<br />
BTW, I can tank in tier 1 zones if we have a slower, but unless you have really uber gear (which I do not), I don't think it is really feasible for a ranger to be tanking in most tier 2 or higher zones.  Some can handle it, but even if they do okay at it, I think a plate tank would have been more efficient (assuming the plate tank can hold aggro decently).  A ranger can certainly jump in as backup tank for a pull or two (or save the day if the main tank misses enrage and drops dead, or goes LD, etc.), but I think you will find that mana flows more efficiently with a plate tank.  <br />
<br />
It is certainly true that in situations where the ranger can tank, a ranger is extremely good at holding aggro.  Especially if they are the puller also, they will be the ONLY one taking damage (AE and riposte aside).  But I deal more damage and take less of it when I can use my bow, so that's another reason for somebody else to be tanking.<br />
<br />
Anyway, at least on my server (Bristlebane), I don't think rangers have any more trouble getting pickup groups than any other class.  Every class has their times when they sit there LFG for two hours.<br />

In PoV groups, i'm often the puller (track pull is great when competing with 5 other wasteland groups), damager, and when we're without anything else, I tank just fine there. My gear is just above average, nothing great compared to all the gear out there now, but it holds up tanking (and no, the clerics arent oom every pull :p). Just make sure to switch to a 2 hander when tanking.. ripostes are mean in pop :p<br />

<br />
PoP requires a bit of readjustment to, because things hit so darn hard and mitigation seems to be so much more useful, but its easily doable.  If you have a tight group, you can tank in any tier 1 zone, and you can be an awesome contribution when there's a knight or warrior there instead.  PoP, at least thus far, has been one of the most Ranger-friendly expansions for me, almost as good as Velious.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That said, without the aa and gear, it does get more difficult as you go, but certainly not impossible with your average gear ;0<br />
<br />
Lastly, we most certainly can tank (and well I might add) even in the elemental planes with the proper aa and some higher end luclin gear.  I can duo with my cleric in earth, water, fire, and air without too many issues, although it is nowhere near as lucrative as a full group :)  Just be patient and nab every tanking aa you can find and eventually, we can hold our own even in the high-end of planes of power.<br />
<br />
That said, we still spike horribly, and a plate class is the better choice if the group has one, because our damage tanking these days is pretty abysmal compared to using our tools from range or behind the mob :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
at 58(+8) with mostly kunark gear i tank just fine in PoD, as long as there is a slower and a C-healer (can be shammie, druid, or cleric)  the key is to gain aggro fast with snare and tangleweeds and try to kite in a small circle in front of your group until it gets slowed.  once it is slowed, start taking hits like normal.  no problems at all that way.<br />
<br />
The other option is to let the slower pull with slow, and you grab aggro on the way in, before the slower gets hit.  this is actually easier because 2 snares is more aggro than one slow.  just TW then snare and it's on you.<br />
<br />
On defilers or other mobs that HT, we root them on inc and send in pets to take the harmtouch.  then nuke to break root and you are good to go.</div></div><hr />

The sad one was when I took over tank duty from a SK one level higher than me because the mob kept bouncing around when the SK was tank.  I loaded up call of fire and started snareing the mob before the sk had gotten it into camp.  Shammie slows it before melee even starts.  I drop a flame lick onto it after slow and the mob comes straight for me and dosnt look at anyone else for the whole fight.

The PoN that I hunt in has yard trash that hits for 300hps.   Being an average ranger I suppose, I have self buffed AC of 1050, and HPS around 2900.  Those things beat the snot out me.  Main tank?  Forget it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Sorronn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">PoP is exposing the bad players as bad players.<br />
<br />
Prior to PoP the combination of HP inflation, twink gear, and gear inflation without corresponding increases in &quot;yard trash&quot; type mobs allowed many players to level 1-60 rapidly and without any need to learn their class.<br />
<br />
Last night I was in a pickup group in PoN with another ranger, L59. He went to pull and picked up an add. First off, he could have avoided the add simply by harmonying it (he did not) and then he could have separated the mobs by snaring one, bringing the other into camp, and then dragging the snared mob off to be rooted later. He did neither as he did not have snare, root, or harmony even memmed. By the time he got to camp, he was in bad shape and the CH from the cleric got aggro. I peeled to get the mob from the cleric but got the lucky hybrid multi-fizzle while I attacked and taunted and the cleric got interrupted trying to DA and died. At this point the druid in the group (L57 and no CH yet) was chain spamming superiors and choloblasts left and right on the main tank, myself as I finished snaring, kiting away, and rooting the spider, and on the ranger who pulled. Unfortunately he had pulled when the druid was nearly OOM and the cleric was 30% mana (cleric and I talked later and agreed he should have just let him dirt nap for that alone) so with the cleric down and the druid OOM, we were out of healing quick. The druid, monk, and ranger all bolted for the zone out when the warrior dropped as well. Now this all happened very rapidly so as I got control of the ent, I kited him away from the spider and parked him. Then I memmed chloro and got it up to attend to my minor wounds. And then I started plinking at the ent with my bow while the other group members caught a breather.<br />
<br />
They zoned back in surprised to find me still there. I told the druid to med a tad and drop a DOT on it and for the monk and ranger to attack from range til the cleric got back. That would have worked except the ranger waded right in again and despite repeated warnings that the druid was OOM again, he stayed on the mob til he was 4% health. I kept hoping he'd absorb a lucky double and keel over dead but I was not that lucky. Instead, the druid and I finished the ent about the time the cleric showed back up (so at least he got a little exp for the death). We then dragged the spider up near the GY since the cleric's corpse had popped up that way in the meanwhile and proceeded to root-cook him nice and slow. I made a few comments about how root and snare are your friends, for the sake of this wayward ranger, when I was asked why the raven nearby never added to our little 2 mob fiasco. I explained that I harmonied the mob. This produced a query of &quot;how's that work?&quot; I answered the question but found myself dumbstruck that I was dealing with a ranger who, at the high 50s, did not understand or use snare, root, or harmony.<br />
<br />
Now don't get me wrong, this fellow was a nice guy. But he was not a very competent player. He did not know his class or how to use it. In the past, players could earn plat and make up the difference in AC and HP with gear bought from other players and this would cover up their lack of competence. This fellow was one of those players.<br />
<br />
But now, with PoP, we are back to the situation we saw at the release of Kunark. Mobs now hit for 5% to 10% of a warrior's HP. Casters are fairly fragile against PoP mobs. Multi-mob pulls can be very bad instead of a minor annoyance.<br />
<br />
Working in this environment and succeeding requires a better knowledge of the class. Right now there is no bazaar buyable gear for the masses that will cover up their incompetence. This exposes these bad players for exactly what they are - bad players. (Note: I am not implying they are bad people, they just are not terribly competent at the high level game.)<br />
<br />
So PoP will both help and hurt the ranger class. It will help the class for every competent ranger out there who can get groups and show off his stuff. It will hurt the class for every incompetent twink who thinks that bazaar gear can cover up their lack of playing knowledge. Whether the cumulative result is good or bad will depend on whether there are more competent rangers than incompetent ones.</div></div><hr />

Now Greymarch your are completely and utterly wrong about tanking in the planes. <br />
<br />
I am level 60 and can tank in PoP tier one including PoN, PoI and PoD - this is not a problem on most yard trash mobs/none named mobs.  I don't have amazing gear some Skyshrine some Thurg etc and I dont find it hard at all.  <br />
<br />
It is as Sorronn put it really up to the quality of the group members that allows you to do this.  Yes I am not tanking mobs that hit for 500, are unslowable... however,<br />
<br />
Last week 3 rangers (one including me) a chanter, shammy and 58 druid (yes no cleric) easily spent 3 hours just pulling treants, birds and spiders in PoN while I tanked.  Was a great exp group too since mobs died quickly with 3 hasted rangers and the mobs were always on me - I would snare incoming allowing the Shammy to slow immediately (they said they would slow with a ranger tanking anyday since they dont ever get hit ), the druid never got aggro from epic dotting, complete healing and we chained pulled mobs for hours.  I don't think the mob ping-ponged once the whole time.  <br />
<br />
I suggest before you go claiming that Rangers cannot tank in the planes that you wait until you are 59 or 60 and in a good guild group made up of competent players. You will tank just fine.<br />
<br />
BIG difference bewtween claiming you are tanking in tier one PoP and &quot;soloing&quot; Inny.....No we will not be MA in raids for big mobs but in exp groups rangers are tanking even in the Tier 2 planes.  We are only limited in our imagination and abilities - those that think outside the box finds ways to accomplish what they set their minds to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People gather a couple friends, guildmates, and even do a damn pickup group, and go pass the Execution trial after some time. It's not that hard to pass.<br />
<br />
So these people move on to Valour and Storms, where the exp flows like wine in relatively safe environments. You can coast thru 61-65 and gain AAs at a huge rate, requiring little to no skill.</div></div><hr />

At second,  ranger is one of the best classes for PoP IMO (snare, root-ghetorootparkingwhateveryoucallit, track, harmony !!!, with good gear dmg very comparable with rogues, wizards etc., if not higher). FD pulling? .. its slow, harmony/pacify r00lls<br />
<br />
At third, as someone said PoP showed difference between player skills more then any other expansion before. If you or someone from your group sucks only a bit with mobs hiting 600ish in tier2 planes ... have nice party at nexus. (examples: healing on Inc = dead healer, unexpected broken mezz = dead mezzer, slacked heal = dead whoever needed heal etc :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Nerple</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">What I have found is that no one class is necessary.<br />
<br />
Most of the groups I am in, at least withing my guild are witha  Druid healing, a Beastlord or bard slowing, and either an SK, the beastlord, or myself tanking.  With a bard or the beastlord's pet on Crowd Control.<br />
<br />
When PoP came out, I was 57 and tanking most everything in PoDisease just fine with equipment that is a lot worse than what I have now.<br />
<br />
Hmm, this doesn't really relate being a Ranger or all, but depending on the camp, the only class I really desire is a Ranger/Druid for snares if necessary at that camp.  I have an obsession with Ranger/Druid Snare, its sick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Beaorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">examples: healing on Inc = dead healer, unexpected broken mezz = dead mezzer, slacked heal = dead whoever needed heal etc<br />
<br />
<br />
true for the most part; however, as a ranger I can keep # 1 &amp; 2 from happening.  <br />
<br />
I try to make sure I cast the first heal or 2 or 3 on incoming that way it allows the cleric a bit more time before he needs to cast a heal.  It also will pull heal agro to me instead of the cleric and it will pull any adds to me giving the enchanter an easier time trying to mez (splits the MA mob from adds and keeps the mobs off the chanter while she is trying to mez them).  This also keeps the tank alive longer since not all of the mobs are beating on him at the same time, thus reducing clerics agro that would come from chain healing the tank with multiple mobs on the tank.  If the chanter has problems mezzing or the shaman has trouble slowing I just use weaponshield to give them an extra 20 seconds.<br />
<br />
Once a mob is mezzed I take a few seconds to cast a tangling weeds and a snare on each of the mezzed mobs.  When mez breaks the mob makes a beeline straight to me instead of the enchanter.  This gives the enchanter much more time to re-mez and does not have to worry about channeling a mez before she is squashed.<br />
<br />
As for a slacked heal you are generally right.  I can only do so much with chloroblast.  However, I have had a few groups where the cleric died with a couple mobs in camp and luckily the warrior had enough intelligence to hit /defensive when the cleric went down.  I was able to keep the defensive warrior alive by chain casting chloroblast for the duration of the fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is just not so.  you must be trying to tank unslowed mobs or something.  my gear is good, but not spectacular by any means.  less than 1000 ac.  I have tanked on several occasions in PoD for hours on end, pulling bugs on left ledge or on the right side of the castle.<br />
<br />
For example, a coupla nights ago:<br />
<br />
62 cleric<br />
57 mage<br />
54 druid<br />
62 monk<br />
58 ranger (me)<br />
62 chanter (also played by me on 2nd PC)<br />
<br />
(only the ruid and mage were in my guild.  never played with the other two before.)<br />
<br />
the monk pulls, i cast tangleweeds on incoming.  <br />
i hit the assist button on the chanter then hit the hotkey for tash.<br />
if it is a defiler i root it and mage sends pet to take the harmtouch.<br />
i cast snare on the mob again for aggro.<br />
i hit the hotkey on the chanter for slow.<br />
I run up and tank<br />
monk joins in<br />
mage pet joins in<br />
mage nukes, cleric heals, druid dots and patch heals.<br />
chanter nukes if he has sufficient mana when the mob is at 20% to make it turn sooner.<br />
mob dies.<br />
<br />
chanter keeps everyone in kei and haste (including mage's pet) and a nice big rune on himself.<br />
<br />
pulls were non-stop for 3 hours or more (except for when the  cleric and druid went LD at the same time in the middle of the fight.  we still all lived, thanks to greatter fetter, archery, ranger heals, monk bandaids, and mage pet-heals.)<br />
<br />
You could have replaced one shammie for both the druid and the chanter without any problems.  if you had a druid and shammie over 59, you wouldn't need the cleric.<br />
<br />
rangers tank better than monks.<br />
<br />
let me say that again:<br />
<br />
Rangers tank better than monks. (now)<br />
<br />
Even in PoP where the mobs hit me for over 350 every time.  If you have  semi-decent gear, buffed hps over 2600, buffed AC over 900, and are fighting a slowed mob, tanking is not a problem for a ranger.<br />
<br />
Some problems i have seen in PoP:  <br />
* rangers using really fast weapons.  the normal riposts will kill you in PoP.  you can still hold aggro with a 2-hander if you taunt, cast snare and TW or FL occasionally.<br />
* rangers trying to tank mobs that are not slowed.  earthcaller/swarmcaller is not enough.  you really need a t least 65% slow to land before you can get in there and take mele damage.<br />
* rangers eating a harmtouch.  don't do it.  especially don't do it while meleing the mob.  you will die.  you may die in 5 seconds if you take a harmtouch while meleing an _unslowed_ mob.  the harmtouch can be around 900 hps for bugs in PoD.<br />
<br />
The above is all for underbulks and lightcrawlers.  flies, rats, and slimes are even easier.  I try to avoid spiders.<br />
I have no experiance in PoI and PoN because those are controlled by other teams.</div></div><hr />

I was never under 60 and trying to tank, I was always 61 plus in PoP, but I'm not lucky, and I'm not a lying......<br />

<br />
You can tank with a slower and and a cleric/druid. I even tanked at 58 with a 60 shaman to slow and heal (no cleric/druid/chanter) in a POI entrance group, but he did have KEI and I had to root once or twice and back off after I got smacked for a fair bit. My AC is good, my HP are probably below average. <br />
<br />
Plate tanks are better choices to tank normally. <br />
<br />
Most shaman don't want to slow, buff and heal. They normally prefer a cleric/druid/enchnater in the group and some are very choosy.<br />
<br />
It is not always so easy to find guild groups if (a) higher levels are in tier2 (b) you are in smaller guild (c) play at irregular hours<br />
<br />
I think one of best attributes of the ranger in POP is either doing crowd control or assisting the enchanter with crowd control.  I have pulled but am not the best due to my slow PC and it is generally safer for me to peel adds and root park if there is no enchanter.</div></div><hr />

While plate tanks DO tank better, I know I allow anyone in my group to go 'all out' on nukes/dots/slows/melee without me losing aggro, so that saves time/mana in the end, and if we don't have a downtime due to healers needing mana because I'm tanking and not a warrior, I'd say I tank good enough.<br />
<br />
All in all, PoP is working nicely enough for me, you just have to remember all the things you can bring to a group, and then actually do them so people remember you. If you say 'Oh, no plate tanks in this group? Won't work' or 'Yikes, we need a monk or sk, cuz I can't pull here' chances are that you won't get invited to that group again.<br />
<br />
Moral of my little story is, other people put enough limitations on you and your class at it is, you don't need to put any further yourself.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I never do pickup groups. I loathe them with a vengeance, it's all friends/guildies as far as I'm concerned.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Dauvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">The problem resides in how most people think, including some of you.  I know of a 56 ranger with epics that duo's in PoN with a 62 cleric.  This is just with EC for slow.  No, its not the best tank but he does tank.  I was tanking consorts at 63.  My best consort group to date has been.  rng, rng, rng, dru, clr, bst.  The bst was 64 and slowed on incoming AND tanked, PoP isn't about ch's its about damage control. <br />
<br />
 One pong and you could lose a healer/slower/mezzer to a 500 hitter.  PoP may have let the lax people slip through but it also allows the better ones to shine.  I've seen warriors in equal gear and yet the 58 warrior out tanks the 62 warrior.   Easy to tell who coasted in on the shoulders of others now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
true for the most part; however, as a ranger I can keep # 1 &amp; 2 from happening.  <br />
<br />
I try to make sure I cast the first heal or 2 or 3 on incoming that way it allows the cleric a bit more time before he needs to cast a heal.  It also will pull heal agro to me instead of the cleric and it will pull any adds to me giving the enchanter an easier time trying to mez (splits the MA mob from adds and keeps the mobs off the chanter while she is trying to mez them).  This also keeps the tank alive longer since not all of the mobs are beating on him at the same time, thus reducing clerics agro that would come from chain healing the tank with multiple mobs on the tank.  If the chanter has problems mezzing or the shaman has trouble slowing I just use weaponshield to give them an extra 20 seconds.<br />
<br />
Once a mob is mezzed I take a few seconds to cast a tangling weeds and a snare on each of the mezzed mobs.  When mez breaks the mob makes a beeline straight to me instead of the enchanter.  This gives the enchanter much more time to re-mez and does not have to worry about channeling a mez before she is squashed.<br />
<br />
As for a slacked heal you are generally right.  I can only do so much with chloroblast.  However, I have had a few groups where the cleric died with a couple mobs in camp and luckily the warrior had enough intelligence to hit /defensive when the cleric went down.  I was able to keep the defensive warrior alive by chain casting chloroblast for the duration of the fight. <br />
<br />
nice to see you probably know how to play your class, but i was talking about tier2 planes, because i skipped tier1 and i have no exp with them. In tier 2 mobs hit not for 300, but for 600. So its cool you safe ench, or cleric, but you will die instead. Only way is root-snare parking, but again some mobs there are unsnarable-rootable.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Greymarch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Like I said earlier, since this is an anonymous messageboard, you are going to get kids who post exaggerations.  Just because someone posts an exaggeration that is rather long-winded doesnt mean that it is true.<br />
<br />
A ranger below 60th level should not be MT in a tier 1 plane.  If you are MT, then your healer must be very patient, or very stupid.  For a group to achieve maximum efficiency, and maxium exp, a plate-based tank must MT.<br />
<br />
I have been playing a ranger since the very first day EQ was released (I even participated in phase 4 of the beta-test.)  I know every tactic available to rangers, and when I join a group that expects me, or some other ranger to MT, I say to them &quot;you know that our group will not be working at maximum efficiency.&quot;  When they ask me why not, I simply explain a ranger's lack of AC, lack of HP, and how this will cause the healer to spend far too much mana keeping the ranger alive.<br />
<br />
Rangers are a secondary tank.  We always have been, we always will be.  We are like monks, rogues, and beastlords.  We do lots of DPS, and occassionally draw the aggro off the main tank if he is in trouble, or draw the aggro off a spellcaster if they are being attacked.<br />
<br />
Rangers are a fantastic class.  I personally think they are the most fun to play out of all the classes, but rangers are NOT main tanks.  And to all of you out there that think you can be a wonderful main tank, I guarantee every time you are in a group, and are the MT, the healer in your group is mumbling to himself  &quot;dammit, I am wasting too much mana keeping this SOB ranger alive!&quot;<br />
<br />
When reading posts about rangers, avoid the exaggerations and hyperbole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Zeyk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Here's the thing, you keep saying a plate class mt is needed for &quot;maximum efficiency&quot;.  Which isn't true entirely, imo, Rangers tank as efficiently as a warrior vs. some of the lowbie pop mobs, like those you'd find in PoD, PoN.  Simply because the mob can be slowed on incoming and the chanter/shaman won't get touched.  Wait for Warrior to get CH'd once then slow or slow before the mob reaches the group?  Max Efficiency, in an xp group, is had when a pal or sk is MT.<br />
<br />
And who said anything about max efficiency to begin with?<br />
<br />
My girlfriend is my healer, she never mumbles when I have to tank a mob, it happens, she deals with it.  Mob is slowed before it hits me once, and she's a cleric.  Cake.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Works just fine in tier 2 as well. I tend to play the snare/take a hit/jolt/dump to MT agro game nightly. <br />
<br />
On a slowed mob a hit for 600 is about 15% of my hp, and i just regen it back. Most of the clerics I know don't even bother healing me unless i'm at 50% and agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Reandn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">If your main tank is a plate class who is unable to grab and hold aggro quickly, then you might be better off with the Ranger tanking.  But you would probably be even better off with a different plate MT who can grab aggro better (i.e. SK or Pally).  It depends on the exact makeup of the group, what is being fought, etc.<br />
<br />
For example, if an early slow is necessary/desirable because the mobs hit hard and fast, then you lose efficiency by having the slower delay the slows to let the MT build aggro.  If they don't wait, the mob attacks the slower (especially a problem if your slower is a fragile enchanter) and ping pongs and wastes healer mana, etc.  If they do wait, then the MT takes more damage than necessary.  If the MT needs early healing because the mob isn't slowed, the cleric may draw aggro and we have more ping-ponging and inefficiency (and in any of these cases higher likelyhood of a death).  If the MT can grab and hold aggro quickly, then the slower can slow quickly, and everything runs more smoothly.<br />
<br />
In an optimal group, there is an enchanter to tash, and the slower is a shaman who can take a few hits while the MT grabs the aggro back.  If you have a non-optimal group and mobs are ping-ponging, mana wasted healing the enchanter, etc. then sometimes having the ranger be MT will be just what is needed.  A ranger tanking a slowed mob might be more efficient than a warrior tanking an unslowed mob that is ping-ponging onto the enchanter.  Rooting the mob on inc helps, but if your have an AM3/EQ non-MT ranger you are losing efficiency because they get 50% damage on the rooted mob.<br />
<br />
It's all about adjusting to the mobs/zone and the class/level/skill of the players involved.  No one answer is best in all situations.<br />

In other news, I succesfully completed the trials this weekend, and whats more I was the main tank.  Now before you all get excited about how great our tanking ability is, let me tell you that the first time we tried I got killed very fast with the Exe pounding on me, there is no way a 60 ranger can tank him.  The second time I drew agro and kited him for 15 minutes until the mage pet wore him down from behind.  This was an aoe group, me, rogue, wizard, mage, cleric, chanter.

There are a few things I do though to stack the deck in my favor when its time to lfg.  I find its a whole lot easier to get something going when you already have 2-3 people in a small group so I'll work on my friends list, guildies, lfg people,etc.  Another thing I almost always do is solo while I lfg, lots of times I'll just put lfg up and then got fear kite or root/shoot in PoN and most of the time I get a random tell or 2 asking if I want to group within 20-30 mins.<br />
  I'm really curious about the 5 sec death on consorts Kaneras, was it enraged or unslowed at least?  Its a rough camp, but I've tanked there and most non boss mobs in all four tier I zones.  I have rather weak gear(zero ToV or better gear-only have seen a chain helm drop vs boatloads of silk and plate) compared to the magelos I see on most 58+ rangers and my only melee related AAs are ND2 and CA1.  In spite of this, no where in Tier I(except maybe guardians in pon, but have tanked them too when slowed) have I felt overmatched as tank.  Would a plate tank have done better, likely, but its never slowed the group down at all with me tanking there.  As an aside, my main alt is a 52 cleric and from what I can tell where I stand, I out tank a 56 warrior in full thurg armor easily, so be careful who you pick over a ranger.  I havent tried in tier 2 yet, but I was grouped the other night with a 62 Ranger(Rufindil if you read the glade props to ya) who was over 1400ac fully buffed and was tanking in PoV just fine.<br />
   I really like archery for the lower aggro, especially if my group is using a warrior as MT, its nice on keeping aggro on the war.  That said I picked up some curved claws a month ago and have been having a lot of fun watching the melee spam when I feel its more appropriate to sling my bow.  I'm kind of rambling, but I find myself enjoying PoP most of the time I'm up there fighting and maybe I'm too biased, but it sure seems like I'm contributing alot to my groups.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Khross</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Rangers can tank any exp mob in any zone with relative ease.  The first thing they need to do, is make intelligent gear decisions.  A ranger can easily get to 3700+ unbuffed HP in 1 groupable gear.  A ranger can easily break 1200 unbuffed AC in 1 groupable gear.  And in a competent group, a ranger can easily tank as well, if not better than most warriors because of aggro generation.  After all, damage localization saves more mana than most warriors damage mitigation and hitpoint pools when it comes to pick up groups.<br />
<br />
Most of the warriors who will be better exp tanks are too busy grinding exp with guildmates or picking up their exp on raids in Tier 4 planes.<br />
<br />
And I'm with Shug, Levels first then AA.  Levels equate to substantial and real increases in a characters power level.  AA is just a way to fine tune that power level.  Hell, most of the groups I am in, my archery AA is of little real value, since mobs are dying faster than I can pull them to the group.  The only thing that matters is I can survive long enough to snare and hold aggro on recharms, and outrun, survive incoming pulls.  In a bind, I can even tank the mobs in BoT that I'm killing with relative ease.<br />
<br />
Of course, since more than enough rangers are hung up on dual wield all the time, or archery, they don't think about other methods of playing the game.  The biggest thing you can do to improve your viability as a tank short of acquiring more hitpoints and Combat Agility, is to minimize ripostes.  Go buy a slower 2 hander and see how that changes your survivability against mobs that hit for 600.<br />
<br />
Stop putting yourselves into boxes and telling people who regularly do the things you say can't be done they are lying.  You may not be able to tank in BoT, PoV, PoNB, CoD, PoStorms, where ever, but there are plenty of rangers who do so just fine and probably with gear a lot less spectacular than you would imagine.</div></div><hr />

Absolutely!  that is the biggest lesson i have learned in PoP.  the ripostes really hurt, and when the mob ripostes 3/4 of your quad attack....that's 1200 hps to you in one round, not counting his normal double for another 600.  it can eat you up fast.<br />
<br />
dual wielding fast weapons with max haste is the traditional way to tank and hold aggro. (at least that is what i was taught)  but in PoP it makes for a dead tank.<br />
<br />
I don't even have a very good 2-hander.  when i tank in PoP i am usually using a woodsman's staff.   But it's good enough and i can hold aggro with spells just fine.</div></div><hr />

Reading these posts reminds me of when I first learned to use root as a mezz. I was mid 30's and was reading a Ranger walkthrough and came across that idea and was &quot;Holy crap, can't believe I never thought of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
but this all reminds me of a group I had last night. Lets just say the group set up a special chat channel in tells, we had everyone &quot;/join papertank&quot; but we left one member out. They asked me to tank, and while I didn't have our tanks hp, or AC, I could control aggro well enough that our chanter and cleric wouldn't get killed while slowing and healing. looks like tier 2 is now having the same problems as tier 1, time to start exping in tier 3 imho.<br />
<br />
Also you want the best group makeup in EQ. Hands down its Ranger/Chanter/ Cleric<br />
<br />
Ranger pulls and uses bow, also keeps the Chanters CoD pet snared. Cleric heals the CoD pet. until the nerf this you can make an Aa every 30 minutes, though I expect a nerf on the next patch. Just mke sure to keep that pet always snared and make sure the Chanter stays away from the pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Samanthie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">Well dear I am sorry to hear of your issues in trying to find a group at level 60 in the planes.<br />
<br />
Much of the Planes, in the two weeks I have been playing EQ since my spousie left does seem to be catered to the players who have completed at least a good portion of the Velious and Luclin content, and who have been somewhat properly equipped in the process.<br />
<br />
Luckily for me I am somewhat well equipped (primairly Velious level gear) with a self buffed AC around 1250ish and around about 4000 hp with standard Aego and level 60 type group buffies.  Using this as a marker I wandered off to seek fame and fortune.<br />
<br />
Using these rough AC and hitpoints I found that although I could tank in Tier one, it was generally more advantages to have a Plate class tank to reduce the frequency of cleric heals and to allow me to take adavntage of my archery AA (EQ AM3 --66 AA leaning towards archery)  In the absense of a plate class tank, I did have the ability to tank in both PoI and PoD with a slow class and a cleric, but the down time seemed to reduce the amount fun that we had.<br />
<br />
Getting Flagged for Tier 2 at this point in the game, being unguilded was difficult.  (My spousie and I had taken a 8 month break from EQ due to RL matters.  When we returned, we found our guild had disbanded, and we spent several days trying to find a new home)  At this point in the game, most of the higher level and better equipped players on the server frrom all the major guilds have been flagged for several months, and are already working their way into Elemental planes.<br />
<br />
This is the time to call in all of your favours, &quot;blue chip tokens,&quot; and even your wallet if you are unguilded.  In my opinion, geting flagged for Tier 2 at level 60 plus is critical.  If you have to &quot;bribe&quot; a group of DPS with a decent cleric to come in to get you flagged for Tier 2 then I would suggest it may be in your best interest to do it.  Getting Flagged for the higher Tier will give you more face time and better opportunities to find a group at what ever hour you play in.  Being able to take advantage of twice the number of zones (well 2 more vice the 3 you could hunt in) will increase your ability to find a potential home for the night.<br />
<br />
As Sean and so many others have said, then I would suggest working on levels and then your AA.  You said you wanted to be an archer, so once you earn your 65, then I would suggest going for your AA points along a pre-planned, well-thought out path that will meet what you want to do as an endstate.<br />
<br />
The exp I have found in the Tier 1 zones, in good groups, pales in comparision to what you can find in Tier 2.  I presume as much for the Tier 3 and higher.<br />
<br />
I have had few issues finding a home at night, even on the somewhat saturated Ranger population on Drinal.  Having the ability this week to bounce between Tier 1 and 2 gives me a better chance of landing an exp group after the nightly raid on mob xyz.<br />
<br />
I know it seems as if at level 60 no one wants you.  Soon der that will all change and you will be respected for all the wonderful tools that other people have outlined above.  Keep a smile on the face hon.  It does get better than where you are standing now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Kaneras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">I tried tanking with my 61 ranger in the frog cave in PoS last weekend, we had a 62 chanter to slow.  What a joke it was, the cleric could barely keep me alive until slow could land against frogs that tripled for 550.  My hit points would literally melt away in seconds.  The wizard and cleric (guild) were cracking jokes about it.  <br />
<br />
Pulling is no picnic either, I have to survive the initial agro, and if the main tank is a warrior this can be dicey since it takes them a few seconds to steal agro from me.  <br />
<br />
So here I am, a 61 ranger with 12 aa points facing a staggering 33 points until EQ/AM3 is finished.  For 33 AA points I get to be a weak secondary damage dealer and use archery once per hour.   <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, my shaman continues to grow in power and desirability as he closes in on 60.  <br />
<br />
Refund please.</div></div><hr />

That happens to warriors, too.  Those frogs are just ass kickers because they hit hard, hit a lot, riposte a lot AND they proc a MEAN dot.<br />
<br />
One time my normal group and I tried that cave out with a warrior tanking.  He was level 60 at the time and I was level 62 or something.  We were laughing because his HPs would go down faster than mine if I tanked.  Of course I had more HPs when buffed than he did by about 100 or so.<br />

<br />
Here's a hint for you: Pull with snare.  This gives the enchanter or shaman plenty of time to land slow before the mob comes in.  If you have a warrior there you snare, wait for slow to land, let the mob hit you a little bit until the warrior has enough aggro then pop a little jolt.  If the frog heads for the slower cast flame lick or even better tangling weeds really quick on the frog.  Repeat until the frog is on the warrior.<br />
<br />
You can't be expected to tank too well at your level with little to no defensive  AA skills trained.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Ayochak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">A few days ago...<br />
/who all 55 65 lfg : 8 players, 5 rangers among them, all in PoP.<br />
<br />
This was a &quot;we sucks&quot; topic based on the fact that this player find groups anytimes with his Shamman but not with his Ranger.<br />
<br />
I see replies : &quot;ME I can find groups&quot;, &quot;ME I can tank&quot;, &quot;ME I'm ubber&quot;... Well k, nice for you. But we are not exactly talking about you, your friends, gear, HP and reputation...<br />
<br />
Fact is 95% of times it's not a ranger that gonna tank in a group.<br />
Stop being silly, if you don't beleive it ask around ppp.<br />
Yes I do play well enough so sometimes I will be remembered. but i'm only a ranger...<br />
Yes we good puller, snarers, aggro control...That's not the point.<br />
Point is, as it used to be before : SOME CLASSES FIND GROUPS MORE EASILY THAN OTHERS.<br />
You can't disagree with that. It's a fact. You can keep saying &quot;well, just try do this or that....&quot;....You have some wise advices...But just try to &quot;parse&quot; some /who all 55 65 lfg a few days...Try to see what class stay longer with the LFG tag....<br />
<br />
So, it's just a whine ?<br />
No. It's a fact.<br />
And it could be changed easily.<br />
If zones and mobs were REALLY different, for class balancing.<br />
I know it goes a bit beyond thread but here's my 2cp...<br />
<br />
In Umbral Plains I often find a group quickly : because nameds can spawn in various places and rangers can track and pull em quick.<br />
It would not be hard to make different mobs kinds in different spots with specificities...<br />
-Can be splited with Harmo &quot;only&quot;.<br />
-Run quick and have strange pathing behaviour so you really want a snarer.<br />
-Named will spawn in random spot but depop if not pulled in 5mn.<br />
-High MR resistant mob start nuking, it cannot be reached and must be killed with bows...<br />
<br />
I stop here but we could start a new thread with your own ideas.<br />
I listed ranger based things but we could imagine encounters or abilities requiring other classes....Well I can.<br />
<br />
If you try to see the situation of most Instead of saying &quot;well no I'm ok&quot;, agree together on some positive propositions, maybe we can change a few things someday, even if it's already a bit late.<br />
Rangers are great to play. They don't need much fix (except on LOS).<br />
Don't change em; change the mobs and encounters....<br />
I wish my english was better so I could explain my self more, but I think some of you will understand...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Medain Valacirca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Ayo I see your points.I agree that VI could add more variety to zone/mob encounters to favor the special skills and abilities of all classes.<br />
<br />
I dont think the people who are trying to share the good experiences they have had in PoP are trying to insult or make the ones having trouble feel bad.Quite the opposite.Many classes are in the same boat many Rangers are in now.There have always been &quot;required&quot; classes Holy Trinity anyone?This is not new.<br />
<br />
The point many may have been trying to get across is that you have to keep going.It does get better.55 to 61 Rangers witout AM3/EQ may not get the results they expected in PoP.Even with AM3/EQ you may not be the 1st class people look for when putting a group together.<br />
<br />
Keep trying.Talk to people.Dont be a jerk,whine,or otherwise leave a bad impression with the people you group with.Be rdy to do anything even if it seems like a suicide run.The crazy types are often the people you want to group with =) Danja Ranja is a title that will get yo on people friends list trust me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Tirronan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">Look, I ain't uber ( I hate that word with a passion btw).  Tirronan just hit 60 on PoP.  I've had my share of LFG for hours.  We all have from time to time.  Every once and a while I could not get a group all night (happened 3 times in 3 months).  I run about 1054 AC before buffs.  I haven't got my archtype AA points done either.<br />
<br />
Mostly I do get groups.  Its a matter of attitude and patience.  As folks get to know you they will ask for you because they know you add something to a group.  The operative word here is YOU.  Its often not class its what YOU bring to the group.  I've been in PoP since 55 because I couldn't find a faster way to level.  <br />
<br />
Oh one more thing, I've tanked in RCY in PoD, Hedge in PoN, ect.  I've been doing it since 55 so it can be done.  Its harder, its less mana efficient, but it can be done.  It isn't even that hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>shadowsmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">The LFG thing in PoV and PoS can seem a bit frustrating at times, but the XP gained is worth the wait. At the moment I am a 61 still working 90% AAs presently working on archery mastery 2. My lower level is good for AAs but makes it a bit harder to get into non guild-based groups.... at first. Once I have been in a group they tend to look for me and invite me first over other LFGs so it generally works out.<br />
<br />
There are all so many opinions as to what is better... level or AAs. For me, cause I miss solo game play, I have decided to go to AM3 EQ and then level up. Sometimes I think I should have done this when I could still get xp in JP. hehe<br />
<br />
Anyway, know the zones! know the mobs. Know how to keep aggro off. I am being used an awful lot as puller again and as an aggro kitter (a lot of work). And I am amazed at the offers I get from necros and enchanters for duos. I find that as a nice complement to rangers.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I found the 50s before PoP to be incredibly hard as a ranger and I almost quit EQ a number of times. The 60s on the other hand are a blast. Yes, I am sometimes the LFG queen... even yesterday about six hours sitting. So I read a book or whatever and then a group calls me and I get nearly two AAs in two hours.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Kaneras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">Hey just figured it was time for an update.<br />
<br />
Spent 3 1/2 hours in PoS with LFG tag on while fishing for storm salmon last night.  Abut 30 people in zone.  Only tell I got was from a rogue who wanted to know what minis were up.<br />
<br />
PoP has more or less made 1/2 the players in my guild quit, so they are not available for groups.<br />
<br />
I won't join another guild because I refuse to join a bunch of uberjerks, so I guess I'll continue to play my shaman and count the days until star wars.</div></div><hr />

nice to see you probably know how to play your class, but i was talking about tier2 planes, because i skipped tier1 and i have no exp with them. In tier 2 mobs hit not for 300, but for 600. So its cool you safe ench, or cleric, but you will die instead. Only way is root-snare parking, but again some mobs there are unsnarable-rootable.<br />
<br />
What you typed should work good in tier1 planes tho. wtg <br />
<br />
I survive quite well root-parking razorfiends, golems, giants.  The trick is to not stand around right next to them while you cast your spells; it seems they can't hit you when you're too far away, or something like that!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Rathaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">Umm, I couldn't be bothered to read all the other posts, but imo, rangers are more useful than ever in PoP.  I can pull great in an exp group, buffs are very useful, and alot of boss enounters really require ranged attacks, which we are the master of.<br />
<br />
You have to understand that PoP was created for the high lvls who were bored and had nothing left to do in the other expansions.</div></div><hr />

Can't believe you overlooked the most obvious thing there. He was 61 and the warrior was 60. <br />
<br />
Levels make a huge difference in PoP. Things just hit for less and miss more often, AA's or no</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Oiybuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">I will not repeat some aspects rangers have advantage over other classes because most have been already mention such as harmony pulling, attack buffs etc.<br />
<br />
One very overlooked benefit a ranger brings into a grp is CC.  Many times I have been the main CCer in many grps in various zones.  The advantage we have over the other rooters is our ability to withstand some damage while rooting and when root is off (something the caster and healer classes lack).  Once I was with a stubborn wizzy who wanted to CC and snare adds.  Obviously after the second root broke the wizzy went splat.  I took over and we had no problem afterwards.<br />
<br />
Kaneras, I would recommend to get to 65 or at least get AM3/EQ if you want to avoid having problem LFG. With those AA we are not the best at anything but we are sure one of the top in many aspects of the game.  We can nuke, CC, pull, have uber DPS, nice group buffs and depending on the gear you have we can even be the slower of the group!!.  I would say we are the most versatile class in the game.</div></div><hr />
