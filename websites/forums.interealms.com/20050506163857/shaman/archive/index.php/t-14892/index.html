<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Taken from the stat descriptions patched into the character creation screen.<br />
<br />
Strength<br />
Strength is one factor in determinin how much damage you do with weapons and special attacks.  It directly affects the amount of weight you can carry before suffering penalties.  It also increases your chance to gain Offense and Bash skill points.<br />
<br />
Tradeskills: If your strength is higher than your intelligence or wisdom, it determines how quickly you gain skill in Blacksmithing.<br />
<br />
Stamina<br />
Stamina increases your maximum hitpoints.  Different classes get more hit points per point of stamina than others.  Stamina also determines your maximum air supply when you are underwater or in airless one.<br />
<br />
Agility<br />
Agility is one factor in determining your avoidance - how often NPC's will miss when trying to hit you.  It also increases your chances to gain points in some combat skills.<br />
<br />
Dexterity<br />
Dexterity affects your chances for special melee capability such as combat effects and critical hits.  It increases your chances to gain points in most combant skills.  It is also a factor in determining how much damage you do with throwing weapons and archery.<br />
<br />
Bard Only: High dexterity decreases the chance you will miss a note while playing a song.<br />
<br />
Tradeskills: If you dexterity is higher than your intelligence or wisdom, it determines how quickly you gain skill in Fletching and Make Poison.<br />
<br />
Wisdom<br />
Wisdom affects your chances of gaining skill points in most skills, if it is higher than your intelligence.<br />
<br />
Wisdom is the primary spell-casting attribute for Paladins, Ranges, Beastlords, Clerics, Shaman, and Druids.  It affects how much mana these classes have, which determines how many spells they can cast before they must rest.  It also determines how often a spell will fail to be cast correctly (fizzle).<br />
<br />
Intelligence<br />
Intelligence affects your chances of gaining skill points in most skills, if it is higher than your wisdom.<br />
<br />
Intelligence is the primary spell-casting attribute for Shadowknights, Bars, Wizards, Enchanters, Necromancers, and Magicians.  It affects how much mana these classes have, which determines how many spells they can cast before they must rest.  For all except bards, it also determines how often a spell will fail to cast correctly (fizzle).<br />
<br />
Charisma<br />
Charisma affects how much merchants wil charge you for their wares.  It also affects the chances for charm, memory blur, mesmerization, and divine intervention spells effects to work.<br />
<br />
Bard only: High charisma decreases the chance you will miss a note while playing a song.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items of note:<br />
<br />
Notice there is no mention of Charisma and slow spells!<br />
<br />
Notice the &quot;Agility is one factor in determining your avoidance - how often NPC's will miss when trying to hit you.&quot; line.  So are they talking about the 75 agi barrier, or something else?<br />
<br />
I think this is the first time I've seen them say that agility affects how fast some combat skills raise.  Might have already been on eqlive someplace and I missed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Haven't the enchater community parsed out Charisma and found no changes to the effect of Charm etc?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">With regards to agility / dex, those are what they do.  What this doesn't mention, is that a 150 point increase in those stats yields about a 1% increase in your ability to avoid attacks, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wisdom determines fizzle rate?  News to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Similar to agility, wisdom does affect fizzles, but VERY slightly.  IIRC Casting skill level, specialization, and I think level of the spell vs. level of char have a much more noticeable effect.  Some spells, I believe, also have special fizzle rate adjustments also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm impressed with the new descriptions.  They are accurate, and clear.<br />
<br />
I do wish that they put in the bit about agility being a minor effect, but the way its worded is good: it says its a factor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm impressed with the new descriptions.  They are accurate, and clear.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Clear???<br />
<br />
Far too much &quot;one aspect&quot; and &quot;some&quot; vagueness going on for it to be clear...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I must agree with Slurm.<br />
<br />
I find nothing in the descriptions that is not accurate or does not correspond with my previous understanding.<br />
<br />
The only way to make things any clearer would be to provide quantitative descriptions instead of just qualitative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">With regards to agility / dex, those are what they do. What this doesn't mention, is that a 150 point increase in those stats yields about a 1% increase in your ability to avoid attacks, etc.<br />
<br />
Assuming that is true.  Then 150 pts of agility is about like getting 3 AAs and spending it on one level of lightning reflexes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I must agree with Slurm.<br />

<br />
Well, ok, I agree. They are clearly vague and clearly pointless :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Agility<br />
Agility is one factor  in determining your avoidance - how often NPC's will miss when trying to hit you. It also increases your chances to gain points in some combat skills<br />
<br />
What are the other factors? Which skills?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">yah, id say thats pretty clear.  It is not meant to be an explanation of skills or of how AC works.  Its an explanation of agility.  Now if it were an explaantion of AC, and all it said was that agility was a factor, then it would make sense to list the other factors.<br />
<br />
Take it for what it is instead of expecting a full treatise on how the game works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Wisdom determines fizzle rate?  News to me.<br />
<br />
Yeah it does.  Rangers did some testing on it years ago, it was only noticeable at the low end, sub 120 wis, iirc.  So like a shaman with 80 wisdom is fizzling a bit more than a shaman with 120 wisdom.<br />
<br />
I think it was long enough ago that it would have disappeared with the same boardwipe that erased the old crucible, but perhaps one of the rangers will chime in if there is a link to those old tests still around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>slownsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think this is the first time I've seen them say that agility affects how fast some combat skills raise.  Might have already been on eqlive someplace and I missed it.<br />
<br />
agillity affects how fast your defensive skills increase:  defence and dodge.  (possibley parry as well)<br />
<br />
dex is for all the regular offensive skills (offence, kick, piercing, 1hs, etc etc.) <br />
<br />
at least that is what i have always heard. (and observed)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">None of the descriptions came as a surprise.  We've known the true effects of stats for quite some time now.  All Sony did was confirm our confirmed stats: and type up a nice list for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">That wisdom affects fizzle rates is sorta surprising, in that my wisdom is a good deal higher now than it was in my 50's but I seem to fizzle MUCH more now. It could be that I expect to fizzle less so get more annoyed when I go on a &quot;fizzle fest&quot;. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I read somewhere a while back that fizzle rate was increased 1% for each point below 100 your WIS was.  Too lazy to parse, and my base WIS is 105 anyway =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">parsing does not help.. it's never been done correctly and it won't be done correctly because we are gamers, no one is going to spend hundreds of hours doing this stuff.. <br />
<br />
side note : a general in pofire everytime he killed me missed once and hit twice for 2965 (ca2 1100ac), my friend got missed 4x hit 3x for 2965 (lr5 ~1400ac + agi buff), other friend missed 2x hit 3x 2965x2 and 1196? x 1 (lr5 ac unknown +agi buff), last dead shaman :) hit x2 2965 he does not have CA and no agi.. what does it all mean? I don't know, but I religiously put agi on and I get a lot of misses.. RZtW missed the 1400 ac shaman 4x before hitting him, but he didn't miss me once (I didn't have agi buff or ca)..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Fizzle Rate is affected by several factors, how high is your skill level in that field? The second biggest is what level you are in relation to the spell, with your wisdom being the next.<br />
<br />
For instance if you are lvl 44 and you recieve the spell Blizzard Blast <br />
<br />
Say your evocation skill is maxxed for your level. You will still have a greater chance of fizzling with it when you try to cast it, than at lvl 48.<br />
<br />
I think its about 5% less of a chance of fizzling per level, with it starting out at around 80% of a successful cast when you first receieve the spell, with higher wisdom mitigating that percentage.</div></div><hr />
