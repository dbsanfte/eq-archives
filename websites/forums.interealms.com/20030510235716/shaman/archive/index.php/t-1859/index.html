<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>iamagator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am at the Black Dire phase of my Epic and unfortunately not part of a guild.  I am entertaining the idea of trying to solo Black Dire for the pelt.  My main concern is figuring out what level I need to be to be able to pull BD and NOT get his four furry friends.  Currently, I am level 51.  If anyone has an idea as to what level you need to single pull him or any other tips/advice on soloing him I would appreciate it.  Or perhaps I am just being suicidal for thinking of attempting this.<br />

If it matters, below is my equipment and vital stats:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Morkoraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">not to sure on exactl lvl, lil while ago i played a 60 sk to help a friend with his BD, levi'd,  run over to behind him on the ledge, agro him, invis, ran to zone then killed it their <br />
at a guess could maybe single it at 55+ ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1 trick is to trin him to zone he will stay there and you can zone back in and have him solo. But make sure the path is clear or that there is no one eals in zone with you do this</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>iamagator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the tips, I hadn't thought about pulling him all the way to the zone.  Was afraid of aggroing everything along the way - wasn't sure if invis worked on all the Dark Elves.  If BD stays close to the zone after I pull him, I can keep popping in and DoT'ing him and zoning back out to canni my mana back up.  Would think I could take him down that way if something doesn't go awry.  Thanks again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bad idea Bro you will not solo him. He hits for 200 Dlb and will resist just about every spell you throw at him. And has I recall he has 10K hp could be wrong tho its been a while. I would have the tank pull him and you be by zone invised. When all of the mobs fron the train clear you call the rest in and attak. Also if the tank can wait at zone till he actully gets to him that will help. So you can also clear the mobs on the way there to make the train has small has possable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zugugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I pulled him separate from the blood wolves at 53. The mistmoore trash still agroed on me though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I haven't tried this idea but it might work ...<br />
<br />
The black dire should be friendly to you until you either trigger him to attack, or attack him.<br />
<br />
So try killing the other wolves first - the dire shouldn't assist them, and they are much lower level should probably won't assist each other either.<br />
<br />
However, the people who said pull to the zone are correct, he does stay near the zone, and you can then send your group in to kill him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Morkoraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">hes very mr, i actually managed to slow him 1st try with the desease based slow which helped a tad =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shandora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've participated in this part several times.  I found no real need to pull him to zone.   1 group just fought to his area, had a 52+ tank single pull him, just short of his liar and melee him to death.   He is MR so don't even try to dot/snare/dd/etc.<br />

Good Luck!<br />

<br />
That's Magic Resistance. Disease and Posion resistant stuff would work on him. I know when I did this last night for my shaman, a friend ( higher shaman ) landed DR slow on him.<br />
<br />
Ah, I managed to single pull him at 60, but course, not much help. Sorry :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You can single pull him at 51.<br />
 <br />
- Bind at the zoneline.<br />
- Invis up and run to where the bridge going into Mistmoor is.<br />
- Walk over to the edge where you can see him below you.<br />
- Cast whatever you like and eat the 500-odd HT.<br />
- Gate back.<br />
<br />
He'll come striding up all alone. I did this twice in the same evening at level 51.  Cake.<br />

Good luck,<br />

Providing you or somebody else killed the Advisor. I had to that myself last night.<br />
<br />
Anybody need a new robe? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>iamagator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks for all the good suggestions.  I hadn't thought about just gating to the zone line.  In fact, if I'm gating from the bluff I pull him from, I'm surprised he would still path all the way to the zone line but since you say it worked for you I may try this.<br />
<br />
One concern I have is when I ran invis to the bluff last night and BD was up (someone else was killing him for the pelt) - I dropped invis and conned him and the 4 blood wolves.  The 4 blood wolves conned warmly to me but BD was indiff to me.  I have done every step of the epic up to this point to a tee.  Have not repeated any steps though.  I thought BD would con warmly to me as well.  I know conversation with him is not needed and to just kill him I just hope I have been raising my faction appropriately throughout all these steps.  I keep reading so many posts where turn ins were eaten at various points in the epic when they shouldn't have been.<br />
<br />
Now that I think about it, what would be the odds of EBolt-ing BD from the bluff then gating to the LFay side of the zone to kill any aggro.  Then invis and zone back in and run to the bluff area, find him and Ebot him again and gate again.  Keep repeating till he is dead.  Kinda sux to do it this way as it was not the way the encounter was meant to be done but as a last resort if I am forced to solo him.  Any ideas....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">how fast do mobs regen when they are not 'occupied' ?  I know that when a critter doesn't have anyone on it's hate list (ie group it was fighting is dead or zoned) it will regen health at an insane rate.  Dunno if it has to be back at it's spawn point before that kicks in or not.<br />
<br />
Pretty sure this was implemented to counteract the tactics you are describing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>iamagator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You could be right about the MoB regeneration, it would make sense - anyone have any personal experiences with this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">damn black dire was easy. myself (50 shaman) and my 60 rogue duo'd it :) think i could have done it without a heal actually just buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">To the person worrying about their epic faction:<br />
<br />
Don't get hung up worrying that a certain mob should have a certain faction. A lot of the people who post here saying that their hand ins have been eaten were trying to cheat the quest. Others have been hit by various bugs, but if you get hit by a bug, you can petition and hopefully get recourse.<br />
<br />
If you have done all the quest in order up to this point, there is no reason to go 'faction farming' of earlier stages of the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Providing you or somebody else killed the Advisor. I had to that myself last night.<br />
<br />
Aye, this is very true and my omission may have been confusing.<br />
