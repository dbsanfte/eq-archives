<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wolfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sigh...  I had heard the stories of people making advanced levels with their forgetting to train Channelling. Really never believed them, after all how can you function as a shaman if everytime a breeze blows you lose the spell cast. <br />
<br />
 Or so I believed until today. Grouped for a while with an Epicced, SS Armored, Level 60 Shaman who just today trained Channelling! I, I, well, was speechless.  The number of times I have relied on channeling through that mob wacking on me, whether the dreaded Orc Pawn, or some enraged giant... /boogle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">youd think that shaman would get a hint waaay before 60, but hey, hes 60, and im not, so im just gonna stop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>WhiteandBlack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There as a 60 SHM in my last guild that didn't know you had to train channeling, thus she went to 60 without it hehe.<br />
<br />
I really feel for people who don't read websites like Crucible; research out of the game makes ingame playing more enjoyalble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heheh, wasn't there a frequent poster on the Crucible that discovered it late in game life?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was into my teens before i trained channeling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually it seems to be stuck at like 213. What does it cap at for us?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aerroch Icedragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hahaha, I was 30, and back in Halas to train Specialization, and as I was scrolling down the list, I saw &quot;Channel&quot; and only then did I realize that we had that skill.  So yeah, I was about 26 levels late ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I hit 24 before I put my point into channeling...<br />
<br />
thats why we had slow right? <br />
so we didn't need to channel?<br />
<br />
<br />
Talk about root DoTing being your best option...making it to 60 without channeling is quite...ouch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>cepheusRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">But I was probably mid-30's before I realized that I'd never put a point into dodge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
[Wed Feb 20 03:20:06 2002] You have gained a level! Welcome to level 60!<br />
[Wed Feb 20 03:20:39 2002] You have become better at Channeling! (219)<br />
[Wed Feb 20 03:22:12 2002] You have become better at Channeling! (220)<br />
<br />
Hasn't gone up since.  Every level I got 2 increases within a few minutes of leveling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Shaman get channelling?<br />

Is it true you have to kill your guild master to loot a spellbook?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I met a level 34 Shaman who *insisted* that Shaman do NOT get channeling, and that only pure casters get it.  I was trying to give him an old Spine Chill spear I had, and he also said he didn't know how to use Loc, and had no skill points in Sense Heading.  I had to log off at this point as the whole interaction was way too bizarre for me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There's nothing wrong with taking awhile to figure out how to use /locs to find things. *cough* 59 levels *cough*<br />
<br />
I have met several higher level people with no Sense Heading skills, which I find a trifle bizarre...it was my first skill to hit 200!</div></div><hr />

Yesterday I duoed with a Level 51 Necromancer who, for the first hour or so we were grouped, thought that when I said I had &quot;slowed&quot; a MOB it meant that I had snared it. He wasn't aware that PCs had slow spells. I tried not to make him feel bad as I explained the difference between snare and slow, but I'm not sure how one makes it to Level 51 without learning such things. (Oh wait, as a Necromancer he probably just never grouped).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>WhiteandBlack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I never really use SH anymore, I do all my direction via /loc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bazrok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Monks get dodge at L1.  I didn't know that when I created my monk way back in Apr99.  Around L12-14 I saw dodge on a monk board and went and trained it.<br />
<br />
My roommate also never trained taunt on his ranger, because the ability button was there, so we both assumed that he didn't need to train.  He mashed taunt for 26 levels with no skill increase and little effect.  Finally we decided to have him try and train a point.  He ran out into Qey Hills from SFG and started taunting a gnoll pup.<br />
<br />
You have improved at Taunting! (2)<br />
<br />
While is may sound silly to not have trained it...that was the only skill he had to train to make it go up, everything else (2hs, 1hs, 1hb, 2hb, pierce, defense, offense, sense heading, track, forage) all went up on their own without that initial training point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I never really use SH anymore, I do all my direction via /loc. <br />
<br />
You must end up running in a couple of weird circles until you find the direction you want to be going. :)  I hit /loc to know where I am first, then SH to get the direction I want to go and then a combination of both (mostly /loc) after that to fine tune til I'm there.<br />
<br />
Just in case someone doesn't know...north is positive x, south is negative x, west is positive y, east is negative y.<br />
Where x and y are the values from /loc.  (x,y,z) [z being altitude and near useless]<br />
<br />
I've integrated SH and /loc into one hotkey thanks to the fine suggestion from someone else on this board, but I also have SH and /loc still seperate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">What?! Shamans have to train channeling? Really I dont remember ever training mine, but I must have cause its over 200 :p .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>eci_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I didn't even know there was a channeling until when I returned back to my guild at level 30 to train all my specializes. <br />
<br />
Then, low and behold I saw a channeling skill!  Yes, I felt like an idiot.. but luckily that skill seems to go up pretty well (at least for me)... I was 200 by level 40 (I think)...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>KiteForprez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It's a much different game now than it was when many of us were levelling up our characters originally. We had the luxury of being slow and thorough. We weren't twinked, or powerlevelled.<br />
<br />
Today, most lowbies are are levelling about 10 times faster than we were ever able too. Life isn't too rough when you've got your pet druid on autofollow.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I get on a kick, and I powerlevel alts. When my wizzie is pulling in 10 levels a day, for example, sometimes you forget to stop by the trainer.<br />
<br />
Its just one side effect of the modern, highly evolved EQ.<br />
<br />
That doesn't mean you can excuse a level 60 with no channeling skill, of couse. He's a dumbass )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">nobody, i mean nobody needs sense heading, go to your local gypsie and buy a 2pp compass, works exactly the same, cept no spam!</div></div><hr />

OMFG !<br />
you saved my litte ranger !!!!!!<br />
lucky he's just lv 6!(but my firend's is already 18!</div></div><hr />

Sense heading also doesn't stay on your corpse, and doesn't eat a main inventory slot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the first thing I do on all my chars. I then map that hot key to my right key, that way when ever I run any where I automatically train my sense heading.<br />
<br />
Another tip is to combine a /corpse and /loc onto one key then when you are draging a corpse you will be able to see where you last had it if you lose it...<br />

Because of that, he was probably one of the best 26th level rangers on your server... ;)</div></div><hr />

haha....now after reading these post I'm gonna have to go check next time I log on.<br />
<br />
This is too funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Whats Channeling??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Ryot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">i never trained that skill till my late teens.  and that only made me learn to cast at certain times and it helped.  But boy i love having it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">It's the ability to regain concentration and continue casting a spell.  For example, if you move slightly or get hit by a mob.  You've probably seen the spell message, &quot;you've regained your concentration&quot; (or something like that) that's channeling at work.  Considering how often shaman are slapped around my mobs, it's a really valuable skill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I constantly run into people that don't know how to use loc and sense heading together and who marvel at my ability to take a loc and run all the way across a zone in a beeline for it while they have to hug zone walls. I pity the fools. I'm not special or anything, I just read helper sites. There are lots of people playing at 75%, 50%, 25% of their potential because they don't read these sites.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Bloogbloog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Hah you had me so freaked and I wasnt sure if I did it or not so I ran home from work just to log on EQ and check it...sure enough it was at 102 (lvl20 orge) I was so worried cause I thought I would have to run all the way back homezone just to put 1 point in it...</div></div><hr />

<br />
And if you were to ask them, they would probably say that they have more fun that way (&quot;exploring&quot; :rolleyes: ). I guess constantly being lost, getting killed, and slowing down groups/raids is fun for some people. *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Umm guilty...level 57 before I trained channling! :-o<br />
<br />
I just thought it was a &quot;shaman class thing&quot; that everytime you got hit you were interupted. Finally, I got so annoyed I asked another shaman how he was able to JBB and get hit at the same time.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Wolfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I am really sorry, and more than a little amazed about the number of people who failed to train.  I learned my lesson back in the distant past with my very first char, a Monk that didn't go back to train from 4-8 or so.<br />
<br />
  Since then I have been a bit anal about keeping skills up. Well maybe more than a bit, with my Beastlord when I hit 30 they hadn't added the low level evoc spell yet, so I stood in a corner and nuked myself for 6 hours, not to mentiion the ~80 skillpoints and the plat for them... I would often pause after a ding and go cast, Sense heading and swim until I capped. Harder with weapons and Def for my shaman to keep up, but Off was right up there..)</div></div><hr />
