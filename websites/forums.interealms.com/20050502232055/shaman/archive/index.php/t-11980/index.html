<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Still haven't seen any copies of Torpor for sale on Bertox the last few weeks, even with research skills out.  And I'm a few levels away, but I thought I would start keeping an eye out for a deal.<br />
<br />
My question is, with Krags Mending and Stoicism, what would be an appropriate value for a copy of Torpor?  Do KM and Stoicism compensate for heals enough that I could get by without Torpor?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I payed 15k for Torpor on Bertoxx a few months ago. Up until that point I was using Kraggs. There is no comparrison. The 4 second casting time and mana efficiency difference of Torpor blow it away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm guessing the the research combines are working.  There were 5 each of topor and malo, plus 2 PoB.  One jackass was still trying to get 90k for it, even though the average price was about 30k.  This was on rodcet nife.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I had both stoicism and KM, and I paid roughly 40K in valuables for Torpor 5 days ago.  There is absolutely no better tool that I've ever used.  Since, I have sold both my fungi and my horse, and don't miss either one bit.  <br />
<br />
So even with the research option, it's still worth whatever you would be willing to pay.  Hell, I would've probably given 100K or more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hehe 4 seconds ?<br />
should be 3 sec .. get some aa's its worth it, trust me<br />
<br />
if i was looking for torpor atm .. i would grind out some exp and get to 65 .. youll see alot more copies of quiescence .. runes drop way too much</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So you would recommend putting up with KM or Stoicism for a while longer, Ceno, and just shoot straight for Quiescence?<br />
<br />
Would hate to put that much time and effort into raising the funds for Torpor, and then end up not getting my money out of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It depends on how hardcore your going to go for it. In the beginging your only going to get runes in Named kills in BoT on  the XP group level. If your guild is capable of getting a fair amount of runes and you know for fact you going to just power through  to 65 , then yes wait for Q. But if its going to take you a while to get runes ( remember it might take more then 1 rune turn in ) iwould suck it up and buy torpor. I dont think you will regret it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just skip torpor and buy a copy of Q from your local uberguild that's farming the elemental planes.  Level 65 spells are selling for less than Torpor used to cost, and the price of 65 spells is going down daily.  They are down to 50k on Brell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">it will be easier to pharm up some plat and buy the spell than to <br />
1) win a rune and get Q on turn-in<br />
2) buy/pharm up Torpor and then still have to look for Q later. <br />
<br />
Q is the everloving ****, don't misjudge it.  Q is to Torpor, what Chloroblast was to minor healing.  The difference in not having a snare/slow on your heal makes it a melee heal, which opens up all sorts of possibilities.  Also you can slap it on anyone, not just groupies . . . which is not possible with Torpor.<br />
<br />
Q is extendable thru AAs and one particular item from VT (Crown of Ambivalence(check my magelo *wink)).  With SCR2 and the hat, I'm getting a regular 1800 hps per cast.  If I bothered to do SCRM I'd get 2100 or better.  Trying to spruce up Kraggs with AA is trying to polish a turd.  Better to work on fixing up Tnargs Mending.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The main problem with the upper end research componants and thus the value of the spells, is that according to EQtraders, most of the componants that are needed for level 60 spells (Torpor, Malo, Moonfire, Sunburst, BoA, etc) drops in zones that most see as raid type places (Sshra Temple, ToV, Akheva).<br />
I have no experience in the actual looting, but have no reason to doubt the posts; if this is true, each individual componant can be legitematly priced at 5K maybe more, thus making Torpor a 20kish spell, maybe more if you need to factor in leg work and time sink needed for the torture that is research.<br />
As a side rant, what the heck is up with the componants dropping in these high level zones?<br />
Arguably people that can raid or exp grind in those zones either have acess to the spells via Uberguildness or have better from PoP and dont want to bother.<br />
/rant off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have not been able to find any of the components for Torpor in bazaar (E'Ci). Oddly enough, I haven't found any components for Avatar either, but I only lack Yaeth's 102 L in getting Primal Avatar. Where does that drop, 9th plane of Hell?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fleury Moistfeet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Torpor sells on Prexus between 30 and 60k but I have seen one copy for 80k. I'm hoping by the time I reach lvl 60, the market will have become more flooded with Torpor and Qui, thus reducing the price some  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">One of the Yaeth's pages for torpor is for sale in Xegony's bazaar all the time, and the other I looted in ToV.<br />
<br />
Not all pieces drop in raid zones, I've seen quite a few come from PoJ basement and surrounding area, Cazic Thule, and Fungus Grove.<br />
<br />
The reason you see research components drop in areas like VT is because research items rop from mobs of the spells level up to 5 levels higher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Bertoxx is weird. We have 4 copies of malos for sale at 75k but no copies of Malo. Torpor hasn't been on the market for a long time. The fact that your shaman is 54 kind of makes me think Q will be out of reach for some time. I'd shoot for the normal farming spots with the Jesters for Torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Reave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Same old Torpor market on Ayonae Ro as always, meaning it's never even for sale at all, let alone coming down in price.  I scan the bazaar many times daily for certain things, including torpor and the parts needed to make it, and never ever see them.  Quiessence is also rare, though shows up now and then.  Malo is a bit more common than Torpor, but still priced at 60k, no change from before the new research stuff.  <br />
<br />
It does seem like we have an unusually high number of high level shamans on A Ro, so maybe that's it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">55.... now :c)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">oh yes, Bertoxx is weird; the first element guild's mule sell lvl65 at very expensive price(800k for Strike of Sol for months !) and never sold, that lead to very bad lvl65 spell market. at same time most other server's good spell drop below 100k while this mule still sell multi copy of good lvl65 spell for 400k+<br />
<br />
recently 2nd element guild start put lots of lvl65 spell on market and price war start; and finally close to 100k range<br />
<br />
for Torpor, it is dumn rare, malo is little more common</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I got torpor for 32k, malo for 36k. This was before the research came out, but after it had been announced. I've yet to hear of any shaman who's managed to get all the components they need to research a level 60 spell, although I've collected a few from friends.<br />
<br />
I'd say its worth going for torpor unless you're in a strong guild that will be tearing through PoP and reaching tier 3 planes in the very near future. Torpor makes a massive difference over KM/Stoicism. I'd pay up to 40k or so for it.<br />
<br />
Malo I've found mainly of use on guild raids to HoT, where it makes a massive difference. If you've got another guild shaman with malo already, its not such a big deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">torpor is a myth . the spell doesn't exsist</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gaky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">found it in bazaar on test for 5000pp.  of course, test is always different than proddy servers.  anyway, i love this spell!!  i don't know how i ever lived without it before.  it is so worth it... get it if you can, and pay anything you can for it  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I've been taking the route that Ceno suggested.. I don't belong to a guild, and I doubt I'll be looting runes anytime soon.. But I am good at the ole buying &amp; selling game, and should be able to afford a copy of Q upon dinging 65.  Pre-PoP I'd have gone for torpor without a second thought.. but at 61 and a half I think I'd rather just wait.  In groups I KM for mana regen, but don't rely on channelling this loooong spell off while being hit, so its not as big a deal as you make it seem.. don't get me wrong, I want Q and would scribe torpor if someone gave it to me, but it can wait as far as I'm concerned.</div></div><hr />
