Rordin quitting EverQuest  <br />
Ever since this site has become popular, a small group of players on the Bristlebane server have been doing everything they can to provoke, ridicule and discredit me and this website. They attack me on a personal level in order to provoke response which they can then later use against me. <br />
<br />
I'm sure that this is nothing new to anyone who plays multiplayer games. You know the type of person, the ones who entertain themselves by causing pain or loss to other players.<br />
<br />
These misanthropes have been posting fabrications about me for quite some time, mostly on message boards. They are very good at fabricating lies and rumors based on semi-facts which make me look like a complete ass. Last week I learned of a website where they have been posting liable slander against me personally as well as my character Rordin for quite some time. <br />
<br />
Of course, I am above them and will not play that mud slinging game with them so I have not posted anything on their site. I just ignore them.<br />
<br />
But what's more hurtful is the players who do not even know me and have never grouped with me long enough to get to know me, who believe their lies.<br />
<br />
The other day I learned that someone posted my real life picture (from Fan Faire) to make fun of me.<br />
<br />
Yes, I'm not the most beautiful person in the world, but that gives no one the right to make fun of what I look like. No one should be treated badly because the color of their skin or how they look.<br />
<br />
What the GM's have been telling me is that I should ignore it. I've been ignoring them for quite some time now. But the posting of my picture and their very personal attacks on me actually hurt me quite a lot.<br />
<br />
I'm tired of the constant harassment from these people and people who they recruit. <br />
<br />
They win. I am quitting EverQuest.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what will come of this website. It mostly depends on how many players subscribe to Premium Content each month. <br />
<br />

<br />
If you happen to play on Bristlebane server, you can congratulate the following list of players who took part in the ridicule, slander and fabrications that finally broke me down and caused me to quit playing EverQuest. These people did a very good job.<br />

80% of Americans are overweight, not all of them are I would suspect are from the U.S. but you can probably estimate that this number will go for some other countries too, especially the more fortunate and more developed. I'm willing to bet some people from that list aren't exactly great lookin either. Maybe if a decent/polite/reasonable explanation came along he wouldn't have to have done this. If his site is able to stay up then that'd be great</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heh one of the people on that list posted saying he wasnt bad looking, another said that he thought he looked a bit like Rordin himself and two others are on it for saying that a guy in the background looked like his brother.<br />

<br />
You don't know HALF the story behind that.  He has made himself an *******, then he boo-hoos on his webpage.<br />
<br />
Trust me, he deserves everything he gets.  Numerous times his mouth has got him in trouble.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the fact he openly admitted to using ShowEQ, then tried to deny it later.<br />
<br />

Note no one ever made fun of the way he looks.<br />
<br />
Now, do some research before you blindly assume things in the future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've got no problems with the site at all - long may it live, you may notice he says the site will stay up if enough people pay for it. <br />

When you act like an ass in game and effect my game play then I will call you an ass. When you say a person caused you to quit when that person simply made a comment on a message board that actually wasnt that offensive then I 'm gonna mention it. I have little doubt some folks may have said things someone else found hurtful but if you paint a target on your forehead I've got little sympathy for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Andrewe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Oh, good lord... Rordin will be back in a week anyway. It's just a ploy for attention.<br />
<br />
And AFAIK, that picture of him at Fanfaire (which no one made fun of his look, pretty much just laughed at the fact that he had his name printed four times on his T-shirt) went up after he sent this tell to someone who left his guild:<br />
<br />
'dont come to the next fan fair bud i'll kick your ass'<br />
<br />
As a measure of how seriously to take his threats.<br />
<br />
Yeah, he's a quality guy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Megumi_BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Since you all feel the need to throw in your 2 cents without knowing the person here is a a forward of the post I made this morning to our lovely smut boards. <br />
<br />
<br />
***************************************<br />
<br />
disclaimer: all quotes I use in this post will be taken from the Man himself (off his website news section)<br />
<br />
My reasons on why Rordin needs help:<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  Ever since this site has become popular, a small group of players on the Bristlebane server have been doing everything they can to provoke, ridicule and discredit me and this website. They attack me on a personal level in order to provoke response which they can then later use against me.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Maybe some have, I can not speak for 5k   people that play on a server, but what I've done is this... I've listened to your speeches on everything from AE to RoV being the devil and not respecting anyone. I never told anyone about alot of the BS i've had to hear come out of your mouth until recently because I finally found an appropriate place to do it. I find it extremely amusing that some many others have been blessed with your lectures and speechs. At times you've voiced an opinion that was worth listening to, but you always follow it up with a Rordin-sentance(lecture/speech/whatever) that ruins your argument.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  Yes, I'm not the most beautiful person in the world, but that gives no one the right to make fun of what I look like. No one should be treated badly because the color of their skin or how they look.  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Yes, Rordins pic was posted. No, not one person called him a single name or ugly for that matter like he claims. I think everyone is beautiful, what tends to make most people in this world ugly is their mouths and what comes out of it.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  They are very good at fabricating lies and rumors based on semi-facts which make me look like a complete ass. Last week I learned of a website where they have been posting liable slander against me personally as well as my character Rordin for quite some time.   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Not once did anyone on this board alter a quote of his to change anything from his original blurb. Rordin is making it sound like we were making up stuff he's said to us in the past, when all we're doing is posting some of his non-sense for the rest of the server to see. The day I alter something you say, feel free to make psots like this, but no one has, so stop making up ****ing lies.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  I'm tired of the constant harassment from these people and people who they recruit.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Close your mouth more often and you wont have to deal with anyones comments.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   They win. I am quitting EverQuest.<br />
I'm not sure what will come of this website. It mostly depends on how many players subscribe to Premium Content each month.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Win what? The only contest that I knew of was the one to gain points for posting REAL quotes/stories. This section of the smut boards is like a documentary on you. If anyone sees something posted thats a fake or we know honestly didnt happen it would be made known and probably removed (unless it was part of the madlibs section, which I have yet to participate in)<br />
<br />
My advice to you Rordin (if your even reading this) is this.. Move your character to another server, change your name, change your race, and play EQ with your mouth shut. This will prevent you from any further abuse(if you can call it that). 99% of your problem is stemmed from comments you've made or plan to make. Think before talking. And remmber this is only a game, stop being so god damn serious about it, ITS ONLY A ****ING GAME. THERE IS NO AE COMMUNITY, THERE ARE NO DRAGONS, AND THESE GUILDS THAT YOU CLAIM ARE ALL AGAINST YOU (conspiracy theory) COULD ACTUALLY CARE LESS.<br />
<br />
I kinda feel bad you quit playing, but you need a break. Trust me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
as for the posts being lies, well... they're posts of actual encounters. I guess they're lies if you're delusional and looking for sympathy.<br />
<br />
It all comes down to *** do you care about what some goober online says about you? Why let it have an effect on your life? People have said way worse about me and I just laugh because I couldn't care less what some moron I won't ever meet thinks =P<br />
<br />
No one called him ugly or made fun of his looks. I think the worst was saying that his threats to kick someones ass IRL were amusing, that he didn't look like he could beat up a fly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hmmm, I read stories like this one:<br />
<br />
Well actually the item he wanted to roll on was the RBB (all/all haste belt) and he announced that before the raid .... which got him excused from attending. THEN he tried his &quot;i will get you banned by all wizzies&quot; line and actually asked VF wizzies to leave the crappy raid. As it happens an RBB did drop and a happy tank won it.<br />
<br />
and I think he's a big dork who probably deserves a certain amount of in game ribbing.  I do agree that real life appearance should not be a consideration, but I read the thread where his pic was posted and it was NOT cruel or abusive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>WulfTyger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">This is a good time for me to mention something that has been eating away at me..<br />
<br />
In my guild, there is a cleric named Megumi (she is the one who is posting in this thread). On this board, there is a shaman named Megumi. I always think it's her =/<br />
<br />
Anyway, uh... Rordin is a tard. His site is very nice and usefull, but that does not grant him immunity from the ridicule that tards deserve. He just couldn't take the heat.</div></div><hr />

I know I would feel very inclined toward physical confrontation if I was in his situation.  Though I would never allow my hurt feelings go that far.  <br />
<br />
Do you think that this is normal to devote your time to creating a web board then having everyone publicly post what they feel about this player?<br />
<br />
No - we do not think you are persecuting Rordin for being fat - we think you are persecuting Rordin for being Rordin.  Who cares what the reason is.  I do not like the metality of the board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gwayn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">&quot;I love the feeling of the gang mentality you perceive when you see all of these new posters come here to tell us how much of an ass this guy was and that he deserves to have an entire web site devoted to them bashing him.&quot;<br />
<br />
First off, it wasn't an entire website, it was a part of a message board that a group of friends (us) started a long time ago. The Rordin section didn't even get added till a week or two ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know I would feel very inclined toward physical confrontation if I was in his situation. Though I would never allow my hurt feelings go that far.&quot;<br />
<br />
When a member of Rordin's guild disbanded Rordin threatened to &quot;Kick his ass&quot; if he went to the next Fan Faire. Which is funny since he always claims it is US who threaten him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think that this is normal to devote your time to creating a web board then having everyone publicly post what they feel about this player?&quot;<br />
<br />
Once again, it wasn't an entire website, it was a small forum that was added to the already large board.<br />
<br />
&quot;No - we do not think you are persecuting Rordin for being fat - we think you are persecuting Rordin for being Rordin.&quot;<br />
<br />
No we are persecuting Rordin for being a liar, cheater, hacker, manipulator, greedy loot whore, for having a huge ego, and for having no respect for the other players on his server.<br />
<br />
Trust me, everything we said about Rordin is true and he deserves every single thing that he has gotten.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who cares what the reason is. I do not like the metality of the board.&quot;<br />
<br />
Good for you, we didn't make that board for you. We made it for us and for our amusement, so that all of us who have retired can still talk to each other.<br />

Wait... yes I can.  I ignore stuff like this, and generally couldn't care less (well, I could, but it'd take a lobotomy).  I've had toons group w/Rordin before.  Nice enough fellow, tho he did seem a bit of a goober.   Much less so than the folks I've put on /ignore, tho.<br />

I never told anyone about half the stuff I've heard him say in groups, but I did recently post some things to share some funny moments with some friends.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Salach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">It is good for us.  The point that is unsavory is you have an entire section of a weboard devoted to people bashing a real person - not just his character but his real person which you have pictures of as well.<br />
 And its nice that you say that it is only one section that is about him but the fact that your header of your web board has his picture and a quote from him associates your entire board to him.  <br />
I would also like to point out that I made these comments to us here at the Shaman Crucible which is our board and not on your web board.  If you had not come and posted all the replies this thread would be two posts long and be off the main page in less than two days.  In fact - the most enlightening thing I read was all the posts from your web board.  <br />
And you still do not get it.  We all have characters that we run into that are bad players, jerks, asses, rude, kstillers, loot mongers etc. who do it as a personality trait and probably have discussed them on our private guild web pages. But we do not start a thread on a public board that everyone can see bashing the person.<br />
<br />
That is it.  I do not want to know any more about him or how bad he may or may not have been.  I am sure Thantu will close this out or I hope he does as there is no purpose for this here.</div></div><hr />

You have a section of your board that slanders his character and person and seems to have caused him serious emotional trauma for him to stop playing a game he enjoys.  Wouldn't make a difference even if the things you have said were 100 percent true (which can never ever be proven - a screenshot of text is junk as evidence), by posting this in a public forum you have created a case for libel.<br />

Wrong, even a shred of truth to the stories (which are all backed up by screenshots and other evidence) makes a libel case rediculous. Do you actually know what libel and slander are or do you just toss those terms around to sound big? =)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Also the header on our board changes all the time, it just happened to be Rordin this week. But of course you didn't know that so it's best to assume. Right? =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Salach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">You are right.  I phrased my last part incorrectly.  I should have written this way.<br />
<br />
Wouldn't make a difference even if the things you have said were 100 percent true since  they can never be proven fully. A screenshot of text is junk as evidence.  And  by posting this in a public forum you have created a case for libel.<br />
<br />
That is better I think.  I was a little upset that those people had to pay money simply by stating that they did not like a particuliar web sites customer service or respone was it?  But none the less we live in a letigious society and people sue for everything today.  I did look up defamation of character and libel on a few law web pages to see if I knew what I was talking about which isn't always the case :).<br />
I saw that screenshots could be refuted,  that he  just has to prove that one or two things are incorrect for a lawsuit to be winnable out of all the things said (while you have to prove everything said is true) and that the actions of your web board would be considered maliscious in nature.  The bad thing here is that we all know that everyone who posts does not tell the exact facts as presented at the time of an incedent and that it is human nature to exaggerate.    I read the posts and felt that all the posters were stating facts and not opinions of Rordin and therefore must be completely true.<br />
 <br />
And you are right.  I assumed that the header was like that all the time since I do not read your board.  But everyone else who is not a fan of your board would assume the same thing, which is a wonderful point.<br />
<br />
I do get 20 hours of free legal advice from my company a year and we do have a lawyer specializing in defamation of character so I will ask him .  I am curious to what he thinks about this.  Especially with the laws being interpreted for the web.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Thundolfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Thankfully through the wonders of the Internet you can get all sorts (http://gsulaw.gsu.edu/lawand/papers/sp97/nguyen.html)  of free answers (http://injury-law.freeadvice.com/libel_and_slander/) about this type of stuff, it just takes a lil research. =)<br />
<br />
Basically to sum it up, the majority of &quot;slander&quot; (which doesn't apply on the Internet since it is oral) and &quot;libel&quot; laws or cases don't apply in cyberspace (let alone in an online game IN cyberspace). In fact much as the rest of the Internet, there really is no law for this sort of thing. There is a huge chasm between &quot;insulting and offensive&quot; and &quot;defamatory&quot;.<br />
<br />
Thankfully everything that was posted about Rordin is true (hence the name of the forum, why would we post made up stories!), so none of that really matters :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also I think you need to keep in mind that from that very same page, the definition of defamation - <br />
<br />
&quot;(5) caused actual injury to the plaintiff&quot;<br />
<br />
Since there was no &quot;actual injury&quot; to anyone here, the whole thing is moot anyway. Not being able to get a group in an online game doesn't count as injury in a court's eyes =) Otherwise everyone who ninjalooted something could claim they didn't and sue!<br />
<br />
You need real-world damages in a defamation suit. I think judging by the &quot;why is this here?&quot; &quot;I don't care!&quot; posts in this thread, it's pretty self explanitory =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not what the law says. Read it again =)<br />
<br />
&quot;To recover damages for defamation, a plaintiff must prove (1) the publication of a statement of fact which (2) was false and defamatory, (3) reasonably referred to the plaintiff, (4) was made with the requisite degree of fault, and (5) caused actual injury to the plaintiff.&quot;<br />

<br />
Um? That picture was taken at Verant's own EQ Fan Faire, by someone in the press no less. If he doesn't want people to know what he looks like or to have his picture taken, maybe he shouldn't go out? =)<br />
<br />
The guy had his name plastered all over his t-shirt (you can see it in the picture even!) and he WANTED to be seen. He shoved his way onto the podium so he could advertise his website and give out free stuff. That's about as far from anonymous as you can get. =)<br />
<br />
I don't see the relevance of that Intel case to what we're talking about either, but I suppose it's interesting.<br />
<br />
The bottom line again is, you don't play on the same server, you don't know, and you certainly wouldn't want to know Rordin. It's very easy to spit out legal mumbo jumbo to a situation that you're not apprised of. =)<br />
<br />
EDIT: My Significant Other (tm) has informed me that &quot;apprised of&quot; is incorrect because I am DANGLING A PREPOSITION. I would like to apologize to her wholeheartedly for this. Possibly while &quot;dangling&quot; my &quot;preposition&quot; in her &quot;face&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Right, it says very clearly on the site that I linked about the law in regards to being fired/resume tampering. That has no relevance as to what is going on here though. =P<br />

&quot;Rordin did not post that picture on that web site though.&quot;<br />

<br />
I am curious - if any of you were there at the fan faire, did you go up to him and tell him you were displeased with how he acts on the BB server and why he acts the way he does.  Then you could have the pleasure of waiting for his reply after you told him how you thought he was an ass at this or that event.  Maybe he would actually have something that would change your view of him.   <br />
<br />
I am angry over anyone who is being made fun of en masse like this.  <br />
<br />
Same thing here.  Why do you feel the need to come here and defend yourself over something like this.  Obviously,  anyone who has ever raided with him or even talked to him in-game must think he is a loot-mongering ass.  If you are so sure of your opinion of him then the only reason would be to try to spread the word to everyone to save them from Rordin.  Hallelujah.  Praise you.<br />

As for dealing with him at the Fan Faire, people did... I didnt, because I realized after hearing him preach on about how cool he and his site was (and the lame decals of his char name all over his shirt was a nice bonus) that NOTHING any one person says to him could sway his ego.<br />
<br />
Now he's a wannabe martyr.<br />
<br />
The guy is a jerk in game, has a complex about how he has supposedly made the world a better place with his website, and actually has the nerve to say &quot;Do you know who I am?&quot; when confronted about his attitude or actions........<br />
<br />
I, for one, am happy he's leaving... that's one less jackoff I have to deal with when I login to play EQ.<br />

But we all know he isn't gone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Thundolfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Actually this goes all the way back to my original point which is perfect =)<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? What's this quote from the very thread that you linked to?&quot;<br />
<br />
It's sarcasm. A parody in response to a tell he (Rordin) had sent to a former guildmember saying &quot;Don't come to the next fan fair, i'll kick your ****in ass&quot; (seen here (http://xzzy.org/bbsmut/images/tuffrordin.gif))<br />
<br />
&quot;Those boards are rants about hundreds of players - not a single one. You do not see the difference?&quot;<br />
<br />
No since each of those threads might contain something about an individual player. Which is exactly what ours is, they just happen to be about the same guy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Same thing here. Why do you feel the need to come here and defend yourself over something like this.

If you are so sure of your opinion of him then the only reason would be to try to spread the word to everyone to save them from Rordin. Hallelujah. Praise you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Because the thread was started here and linked so we responded. It is a public board no? =P<br />
<br />
I could care less what you think about Rordin, since he doesn't play on your server it doesn't affect you. =)<br />
<br />
&quot;We should take more advice from people who have their personal quotes as: President of the Lobber Club, My ***** loves Plastic, I got metal in my dick, and do not forget Sue my Ass, Plz.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;President of the Lobber Club&quot; - &quot;Lobber&quot; is the nickname of an idiot who came and spammed our board with garbage posts and got banned, then threatening to sue us over it. The fanclub is a joke =)<br />
<br />
&quot;My ***** Loves Plastic&quot; - This girl has this title because her cat likes to lick plastic bags. A play on words =)<br />
<br />
&quot;I got metal in my dick&quot; - The guy is proud of his Prince Albert, what can I say? =) (ow I guess)<br />
<br />
&quot;Sue my Ass, plz&quot; - another joke regarding lobber and his threat to sue me.<br />
<br />
The point of explaining the above is that to someone who is a regular on our board all these titles make sense. But to an outsider like yourself they seem offensive and stupid. Same with Rordin - anyone who actually plays on BB and has come across him knows what we are talking about - to everyone else we just look like jerks. =P<br />
<br />
Which is ok I guess. It was never our intent to go around to every board or community in EQ and proclaim our hatred of Rordin. It was a funny forum for a bunch of friends and it just happened to piss Rordin off enough to quit which caused him to make a lil speech on his website which caused our little forum to get linked a few places. It still doesn't change the fact that it's our board to make fun of someone that plays on our server and so the jokes would make sense to US only. It would be like if I went to your guildboard, where you might have a funny title, and questioned you on it. It only makes sense to those you play with. =)<br />
<br />
If you think we're the scourge of EQ, I'm sorry.</div></div><hr />

As far as determining whether or not Rordin is a dip****, I have to say he is.  I've seen the screenshots, and his claims of a &quot;conspiracy&quot; just make me laugh.  Partly because there is a conspiracy, and he is fully deserving of one.  IMO all those instances of him being a dumbass completely outweigh any instances of him being decent to someone.<br />
<br />
As far as the libel thing goes, no way would he ever have a successful case.  Maybe in England or some other European country, but not here in the US.  To win a case like that, you have to prove that the story was intended to cause economic harm... that they were defaming him in order to make him lose money, etc... just bashing his rep on the server, or even RL looks (which no one did) isnt nearly enough.  Take a look at your local grocer's checkout line, and ask if any of those people are suing.<br />
