<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yay, horray, it's OVER, thank god, etc etc etc :)<br />
<br />
I got my toothpick of fate last night. It's shiny. It's flashy. It smells of catnip and has a nice feather.<br />
<br />
I just thought I'd give you a report on the fight. <br />
<br />
My attack crew took time to assemble. At first, it was just me, 60 shaman, a 60 mage without epic, 60 necro, and a 60 cleric. No KEI. We soloed reavers with ease, took down Ghiosk, and popped rak. Then we ran to the other side of the courtyard and brought down Neh.<br />
<br />
At this point a 58 mage arrived, plus a 56 cleric, so we were now 2 mages, 2 clerics, necro and me. We took out Neh. She's doing some unusual tricks, compared to the fight we did on her 5 weeks ago. For starters, she mezzed me. Ouch. I was unable to do things for about 2 minutes. Then she healed herself. Not a cheal, but about a sup heal I think. If she wasn't doing it, then something was, we're not sure who, because her health would go up now and then. But she was beaten into submission, and dropped her diaries on cue, and, like clockwork, the torch for the mage epic needed by mage #2.<br />
<br />
I think this took about 5 minutes. She also tashed me. Oh boy :)<br />
<br />
This is the second time we've done neh for a shaman epic, and the second time she's dropped both the torch and the diaries. I turned in the diaries, dog humped my leg.<br />
<br />
Then mage #3 arrived, 55 mage. We didn't have a cleric for her (miscommunication), but we got everyone ready for rak.<br />
<br />
Mage #3 attacked rak... Ack! We all camped, except Mage #3 who died. Logged back in, rezzed mage #3, got everyone rebuffed and back into position. I did the turn in. Rak aggroed (thank gods, thank gods, thank gods). At this point, my autorun key got stuck (oh NO!) but the fire pets were engaged and even though I got pushed into the raid party, everything was fine. I got my client back under control... you know, this is the second CoM raid where this has happened, autorun being stuck on, it's very odd, and &quot;c&quot; would refuse to type unless I switched boxes in the UI.<br />
<br />
I had about 150 fr, and I had about 60% health when I got out of there.<br />
<br />
We had a pile of Mod-rods... yes, our last chance to use this tactic on Rak before Wednesday's nerf. I, still alive (yay!), healed the clerics while they chealed 2 of the 3 fire pets. the 3rd died quickly, and was resummoned 3 times because of the lack of healing on him, but the other 2, ageo'd and focused, survived the whole fight.<br />
<br />
Rak died in about 8 minutes, IIRC. We ran out of mod rods at the very end... gulp, mages and I OOM... but he died :) Dropped the scale and the MOSS. <br />
<br />
And here's my last bug from this buggy epic from hell....<br />
<br />
I turned in my scale.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have gotten experience!&quot;<br />
But no text message, nothing about the story. Now Kirn gave me his text, so did Neh and Rak, so this is the first story no-show. I checked my inventory... thank god, I have a spear of fate. :)<br />
<br />
So I feel a bit let down about the no text in the ending, but I'm glad it's all over. I ran into bugs on the test of patience, test of wisdom, had to do kirn 3 times do to his pet being up, lead a failed raid of 30 people to their death in CoM on our first ever reaver raid... and then had the resist changes on me... I was so scared of Neh and Rak being broken :) Luckily, they worked, even if the dog didn't. No, I wasn't invis for the turn in, either of them :)<br />
<br />
I'm very happy about my new toothpick :)<br />
<br />
Thank you all for your help, your answers, your encouragement, even when I wanted to give up on this buggy trip from hell :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
He is not that hard to do without the pets. <br />
<br />
I just got my epic and this is how we did the fight. <br />
<br />
1 and a bit groups : <br />
<br />
2 x 60 cle <br />
1 x 56 war - MT <br />
1 x 55 SK <br />
1 x 60 monk <br />
1 x 60 bst <br />
1 x 60 rog <br />
<br />
and me  <br />
<br />
Spawned Rak on bridge in front of the door to Reavers. Had healers hiding behind wall to left of the door, and MT waiting for me to do hand in. <br />
<br />
I handed tear in, then ran behind wall also to help with healing. MT attacked as soon as I handed in tear. SK attacked once MT had established agro and HT'd rak, then others jumped into melee. Only death we had was SK. Rak went down pretty quickly really. <br />
<br />
As long as you keep your healers behind the wall, they do not get hit by the AE, with me and 2 cle's healing (one of the cle's was two boxed with the monk) we had no real issues keeping heals up on tanks. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He really was not that hard to take down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pardon me, because I could easily be wrong, but don't you have to use the right key words with the spirit to get the final text?<br />
I honestly don't remember, it was awhile ago for me, but I got all the text.  No matter, congratulations on your Spear of Fate. :)<br />
<br />
Here's the text by the way, if it makes you feel better:<br />
Spirit Sentinel says 'What is this? The scale of Rak'Ashiir's father? Then Rak has repented his mistake? But why is the mantle still in place? If Rak has repented, then the mantle should have dissolved since he was the one who initiated its construction. But is its initiation the key? How could we have been so blind? Kirn said Rak'Ashiir had the blood of his people on his hands but that is false. Rak merely pointed to a path that would lead them to destruction. It was the people who chose to follow. <br />
You say, 'What is lost?'<br />
Spirit Sentinel says 'The mantle was the product of thousands of faithless individuals. Not the single shroud we believed existed. Torsis is now truly cursed for all eternity as a great stain upon the universe. Today is a sad day, indeed. However, some good can still come of this. Your sacrifice and spiritual devotion in this matter have become legendary. You have waited for us at the bottom of the ocean. You have rubbed out a mighty rogue spirit. You have endured the black hole of Torsis and entered the a bode of Fear itself to save a child from eternal suffering. It is only fitting that we reward you with our greatest treasure, the Spear of Fate.<br />
You say, 'What of the Spear of Fate?'<br />
Spirit Sentinel says 'The spear was constructed millennia ago by Thalger, the first human Heyokah.  One of the most destructive wasichu of Norrath, Miragul, as he is known, had been traveling the world searching out all known magic. Wherever he went, he discovered and experimented with all<br />
forms of dangerous magic. Most of the world cannot even fathom what the Arch Necromancer was capable of. He had haphazardly discovered a way to directly create a mantle of negative spiritual<br />
energy similar to what curses Torsis. He himself had willed into existence one of these black holes.<br />
You say, 'What of these Black Holes?<br />
Spirit Sentinel says 'Miragul often retreated to the frigid northlands to experiment in solitude. It was here that he created a black hole. Unfortunately for the small tribes of men who made the northlands their home, this new black hole threatened not only their livelihood but their entire existence. The mantle was so powerful it not only drained the spiritual energy of everything within its gaze, it also drained the life force as well. The tribes were threatened with complete annihilation. But one powerful shaman stepped forward and struck against Miragul's mantle. You say, 'What powerful shaman?'<br />
Spirit Sentinel says 'Thalger had been the first to pass our tests and the timing was lucky indeed. We supplied him with materials needed to construct a weapon that could pierce the very fabric of the cosmos. First, was the sharpened shoulder blade of an ancient lion matriarch. Then Thalger found a young sapling for the shaft and shaped it over the course of 45 days using nothing but his fingernails.  He then split the top of the flexible shaft, lodged the blade into place and bound them together with the tanned entrails of an ox. Finally, he adorned the spear with the magical feathers of a an aviak elder. You say, 'What of the cosmos?'Spirit Sentinel says 'Miragul's casting was strong but it was a force brought into existence. This force<br />
was positive in nature, the opposite of nothingness. Even though it worked like a void, it was still created by an imposition of will. We figured that if we could rupture the planar boundary and create enough anti-existence or non-matter, the mantle might destroy itself. Thalger volunteered immediately to pierce the mantle as no spirits could even get close to it. In one act of devotion and singular purpose, Thalger rode the wind far above the land and with one colossal arch ripped a breach across the planes.<br />
You say, 'What of the breach?'<br />
Spirit Sentinel says 'The tear in the fabric of existence created enough negative material to cancel out Miragul's abomination. Thalger's strike was so perfect that he cut just enough planar material to destroy the mantle and nothing else. Unfortunately, Thalger himself was lost in the process.  All that was left was the spear that fell from the heavens to the ground where we recovered it. We have kept it since then and now we wish you to have it. When you strike with it, you must have the same singularity of purpose as did Thalger when he defeated Miragul's mantle. Thank you, Heyokah.<br />
<br />
Congratulations, Heyokah! You have received your Spear of Fate!:<br />
<br />
There you are. :)<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks. But I didn't get the &quot;What is this? The scale of Rak&quot; text. :) Just &quot;You have gotten experience!&quot; <br />
<br />
:) I got the toothpick, so all is well. But that was kind of a freaky moment there :) I'm loving it, it's flashy, it smells of catnip, it has a feather, it glows, and it does &quot;kick in&quot; after a few seconds. :)<br />
<br />
It's a nice compliment to my jbb+horse+pet method of soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gorlain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Rak is easily doable after the change to mage fire pets resists. We did him a couple of nights ago with a 52 mage, a 60 cleric, 60 chanter and 60 wizard.<br />
<br />
The chanter runed intermittently. The wizard manaburned but wouldve been better off regular nuking, given the duration of the fight with this group. <br />
<br />
No deaths and I gots new staff 8-)</div></div><hr />
