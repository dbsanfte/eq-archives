<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mysticrhythms64</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A friend of mine purchased a used copy of EQ (all upgrades upto and including SoL), I mentioned to him that he may not be able to use his software if it's already been used and registered on someones machine (I seem to recall something to that effect as of 3 yrs ago, but maybe it's changed?). Can anyone confirm or deny this? He can still take the software back, but would hate to have to pay full price for it if he can avoid it (he's cheaper than me, and I make pennies beg for mercy!).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Minitiki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sadly you need a new CD key to make a new account, if you're just installing the software so you can use your account you're ok but you need a new CD key to make an EQ account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mysticrhythms64</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">OK thanks that clarifies it, I'm talking to him now on the phone and he says thanks as well.<br />
