<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Willowwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry about not showing to the MM romp for Thursday.  Shortly after talking with Morgrym when I logged off I had a major OS issue that I had to do some major troubleshooting.  I ended up having to format and wipe everything off my hard drive and do a complete reinstall.  Not to mention spending most of the day hunting down those seral key #s that you put away thinking you won't need them for a while :).  It happens.   &quot;Technology is nice until the lights stop blinking&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Morgrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No problem Willow.  We will hook up sometime and do this MM thing.  Any and all are welcome to come join us as we romp through the castle and play with trains.  Contact Willowwing ingame for guidance as this is his play ground.</div></div><hr />
