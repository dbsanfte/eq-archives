<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night i looted a prismatic scale, becuase i needed an earring upgrade and thought this earrings stats werre 65/65.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is what im currently using as an earring<br />
Dragons Tear Earring, MAGIC, LORE, NO DROP, Slot: EAR, AC: 10, WIS: 7, INT: 7, HP: 10, MANA: 40, SV DISEASE: 5, SV POISON: 5, WT: 0.10, Class: ALL, Race: ALL, Source: Magelo, URL: http://lucy.fnord.net/i/BHKU<br />
<br />
This is the earring from the scale turn-in quest that i thought was 65/65 or i wouldnt have looted<br />
<br />
Essence Pearl, MAGIC, LORE, NO DROP, Slot: EAR, STR: 10, WIS: 10, INT: 10, HP: 65, SV FIRE: 7, SV DISEASE: 7, SV COLD: 7, SV MAGIC: 7, SV POISON: 7, WT: 0.00, Class: ALL, Race: ALL, From: Quest, Zone: Sleeper's Tomb, Source: Allakhazam's, URL: http://lucy.fnord.net/i/AxuU<br />
<br />
I lose mana and  AC but gain 55 more hp+ some svs.<br />
<br />
Its a nice earring but im trying to reach a personal goal of 3200 hp 4500 mana unbuffed. yeh im crazy but so what.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway here is the problem. if i were to turn this scale into a range item id get this.<br />
<br />
Essence Lens, MAGIC, LORE, NO DROP, Slot: RANGED WEAPON, AC: 15, HP: 75, MANA: 75, SV FIRE: 15, SV DISEASE: 15, SV COLD: 15, SV MAGIC: 15, SV POISON: 15, WT: 0.00, Class: ALL, Race: ALL, Effect: Spell Haste III(Permanent/Unlimited), Zone: Sleeper's Tomb, Source: Allakhazam's, URL: http://lucy.fnord.net/i/AxuT<br />
<br />
and this is what im currently using<br />
<br />
Itraer Insignia, MAGIC, LORE, NO DROP, Slot: RANGED WEAPON, AC: 10, STA: 10, HP: 100, MANA: 50, WT: 0.10, Class: NEC ENC MAG WIZ SHM DRU CLR, Race: ALL, Effect: Flowing Thought II(Permanent/Unlimited), From: The Itraer Vius, Zone: Akheva Ruins, Source: Allakhazam's, URL: http://lucy.fnord.net/i/AxzG<br />
<br />
<br />
If i go for the range i lose 25 raw hp ft2 and 10 sta but gain 25 mana 15 sv all and al my spells will cast 15% faster without having to bother a mage to switch out my rings.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not really sure what to do.<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Groxb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Without a doubt, my vote goes for the Essence Lens.  They have excellent AC, HP, and Mana, and extremely good resists.  Combine that with the fact of Spell Haste III, I wouldn't even look back.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I say get the lens, and use both items.<br />
<br />
Just use the essence lens when you're casting spells. (IE: Group Focus.) When regaining mana, use the FT2 range item. If you want to use one permanently, go for the essence lens. IE: If you're casting Group Focus, you shave off 3.9 seconds with the casting time bonus. Sit down fast enough, and you'll regain mana as if you were sitting... easily out-doing the FT2.<br />
<br />
As for the earring... the essence pearl has no AC. I would not bother with it. (But hey, I love AC... that's just me.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hrrrmmm, to have such a dilemma.<br />
<br />
I actually like the idea of the earring.  You do loose the ac, but you said you're not as concerned with ac as with hp.  I'd take hp over mana, so the earring would be the better choice from that perspective.  You shouldn't miss the mana that much with FT2.<br />
<br />
Now the spell casting haste is another thing entirely.  That's such a nice effect that you might want to scrap the hp business.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>JenamdarAL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Chuk, just go to magelo and run threw the combos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd keep the earring for maximum HP, but I'm a HP fiend :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Go with the earring.  With mana regen of 13 + torpor I'm not sure why you are worried about having a high mana pool.  With that mana regen + bard + C3 + torpor/cann 5, you should never use up your mana pool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you really don't like any of those options, the scale can be MQ'd to someone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I really wanted an earring upgrade. Its really hard to find a decent earring with both decent hp and mana. We dont do tunare anymore so that avenue is out and Seru is currently unkillable so that option is out. The VT earrings have great mana but 0 hp. <br />
<br />
I might just go with the lens for raids and keep it in in the bag for exp or take Vaaxx's option.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">CT is the current place to get uber earrings.  But I would consider the new trade skill quest earring.  It arguably better than anything you got now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bah! With your equipment any change you make will only make a miniscule difference in your total stats - I wouldnt call that being in need of an upgrade :)<br />
<br />
The only thing that might make a noticable difference on your play is getting a new focus effect so I would go for the range item.</div></div><hr />

Thats one that I am shooting for currently. Good all around with nice HP, mana, and resists. Also, it doesn't appear to be too terribly uncommon in the drop table, so shouldn't take too many kills to see one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Essence Lens.  Swapping out Ring of Immobilization for Naki's you lose 30/30.  So add that into the Lens, giving you an effective +105/105, -2FT, and you keep your spell haste.  The earring upgrade isn't that exciting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I can't pop into any magelos for some reason so I am just going with the info you provided.<br />
<br />
With regards to the ranged item, if you NEED those extra resists from the lens then definitely swap out the Itraer.  If resists are not an issue, I would keep the Itraer ranged simply for the superior hp bump.<br />
<br />
Using the scale for the earring would give you a gain of 55hp and you really only lose about 22 mana, assuming that you are over 200 Wis already.  The AC loss is not even a consideration IMO and the resists are just gravy depending on what your current profile is.  Just shoot for balance and max those hp when possible!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I used essence ring.  8ac 65hp/mana 12 to all saves.  I think it is better than all the other essence items.  The lens is ok, but I have shard of unfathomable depths.   Earrings are already solstace and icecaster, so pearl would be a downgrade.  Good rings are few and far between, and I think this is better than just about anything out there.  Other ring is burrower ft2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">***I can't pop into any magelos for some reason so I am just going with the info you provided. ***<br />
<br />
I have the same problem .  Dunno about your situation but for me i would get empty profiles whenever i click on anyones magelo, including myself.<br />
<br />
Here is how i fixed that problem. click on a magelo. get the empty one, then click to one of your favorites or click back to the previous page. then click forward or click back to the empty profile and voila the full profile appears.<br />
<br />
Talamay, there are no less fortunate shaman in my guild, we are all pretty well balanced. Int casters ditto. the essence makes a kinda crappy weapon so the melees wouldnt want it either. <br />
<br />
The Essence ring sounds kinda cool but  im holding out for something better (please fix Seru V.I.).<br />
<br />
Seems swapping is gonna be the best bet.<br />
/em waits for patch day patiently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Janin2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I would not pick the range item. There can only be one range item for shamans, at least for those that have a vt key.<br />
The umbracite swarm orb is the best and since it is shaman only it should not be so hard to get. It may be a rare drop (of course) but how many shamans can there be in one guild.<br />
The earring from Blood of Ssraeszhia is decent as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">dunno how many shamans your guild has.. but my guild has about 50 active members, about 8 shamans :P     <br />
<br />
<br />
shamans &gt; all</div></div><hr />
