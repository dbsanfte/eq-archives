<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Do a search on reaver, I've posted several Rak fight guides.<br />
<br />
1) Don't fight in the room<br />
2) Don't pull Rak, pull Rak's reaver<br />
3) Use the safe &quot;pull&quot; spot</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For my epic, we fought Rak in the hallway behind the thrown.  This was because someone had killed his reaver and he had not depopped before the fight.  Also, another guild was working on reavers, so we couldn't go to the &quot;safe spot&quot;.<br />
<br />
To prevent an already spawned Rak from moving and wiping out your party, you should:<br />
<br />
1)  Have mages park their fire pets directly in front of Rak.<br />
2)  Be sure that mages know exactly when you turn in your tear.  Give them plenty of advanced notice.<br />
3)  Be as fully buffed as possible with hp and fr.<br />
4)  Slowly back away from Rak after the turn in to make sure pets have aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tharaon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Had a raid fail tonight, Rak tore through two lvl 49 fire pets pretty easily even with three clerics, so be careful and avoid losing yer tear like I did--guessing that the fire resist of caster thing that was mentioned elsewhere on this board is definitely valid, make sure the mages have low fire resistance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Apparantly the big joke at verant is to remove immunity and never mention a single word or give out a warning. I lost my tear today because of this bull****. When asking GM's in chat they tell me I have to find out if they are immune or not by my self(guess I just did). <br />
<br />
Thanks VI!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>txMaddog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Happened to me this weekend.<br />
<br />
Oh well back to Fear for another Tear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Numrum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Losing your tear completely sucks.  I feel for you.  However, a little research would have prevented it.  It's been known for a while that people have experienced sporatic problems with Lord Rak versus fire pets.  The general consensus is that if you buff the mages fire resist above a certain level, the pets lose their immunity.  In the fight that I had, I made sure nobody buffed the mages, and that the mages didn't put on fire resistance gear.  We had 2 49 fire pets and 1 55 fire pet.  After the fight, the clerics reported having to heal the pets only a few times, and never had to use complete healing.<br />
<br />
The posts on this board have been thorough and concise and have worked in every instance in the epic process.  You're right though, Verant should have spelled it out, but posts on this board did anyway.<br />
<br />
Good luck in your second try.<br />

We made the mistake of using a previously spawned Rak and pulled him out to the area beside the bridge.  Forgot he would gate.   We wiped.  We almost got rezzed and back up to try again, but some stupid cleric claimed we trained them and decided fair payback was to train our newly rezzed raid. :(  We managed to kill the 12+ adds, but by the time we finished, Rak was despawned. ;(</div></div><hr />
