=====================================<br />
<br />
Patch Message---------<br />
<br />
- Thought Destroyer has returned to the Plane of Hate. <br />
<br />
- Check with the Town Crier of your home town for news. There is information about the recent activities of the Wayfarers that should prove interesting. <br />
<br />
- We have made some improvements to the Plane of Air avatar rings. We have added a random interval to the respawn time of the Plane of Air avatar rings, placed apparitions at the avatar spawns so that it is possible to tell when the event is available, and the Avatar of Smoke will now respawn properly. <br />
<br />
- The Mujaki event in Plane of Nightmares was completely rewritten. It should now be a lot more intelligent about where it sends players. <br />
<br />
- Increased the number of items found at the end of a successful LDoN raid. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Skills and Alternate Advancement ** <br />
<br />
- Channeling Focus was not giving bards the proper reduction to the chance of missing a note. It is now fixed and gives messages to indicate when it is has helped. <br />
<br />
- Corrected a problem that was causing Alternate Advancement buff duration increase abilities and duration focus effects to negatively affect lull spells. <br />
<br />
- We have fixed a bug that could cause pick pocketed items to not show up on your cursor until you zone. This could also sometimes cause the client to crash. <br />
<br />
- Added /stoptracking command so that you no longer have to re-open the track window and hit cancel if you want to cancel your tracking quickly. <br />
<br />
- Activated AAs from Planes of Power were not working if the user did not have Shadows of Luclin registered. This has been fixed. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Spells and Pets ** <br />
<br />
- The Aura of Pain Recourse can no longer be removed by Radiant Cure. <br />
<br />
- When the character changes size (through illusion), other players will no longer see the mounted player separate from their horse. <br />
<br />
- Magician Pets will no longer attack the caster who summoned them. <br />
<br />
- Hitting your own pet while in a PVP area or while you have the PK flag on will no longer kill it. <br />
<br />
- Cataclysm of Ro has had its movement rate bonus removed to fix a stacking issue with the Selo's line of movement rate songs. <br />
<br />
- Cassindra's Chant of Clarity and Cassindra's Chorus of Clarity now lasts 3 ticks instead of being instant. <br />
<br />
- Cloak of Luclin, Cloak of the Akheva and Frostreaver's Blessing will no longer be overwritten by Call of the Rathe. <br />
<br />
- There are still some issues with Frostreaver's blessing being overwritten by some spells. We are aware of the issue and hope to get it resolved soon. <br />
<br />
- Protection of the Cabbage, Protection of the Glades and Protection of the Nine will block Temperance, Aegolism and Virtue. <br />
<br />
- Ice Flame of E`ci now has the standard 2.5 second recast time. <br />
<br />
-Reclaim energy should now function properly on the pet summoned by Child of Bertoxxulous. <br />
<br />
-Beastlord warders focused by Summoner's boon should now look as they should. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Interface ** <br />
<br />
- We have added the consider color to the Target window. The art used to display the consider color can be removed or edited via XML by custom skins. <br />
<br />
- We have also added a 3D target indicator. The ring color indicates the con color of the target. This can be turned off in the Options window. A new settings file in the UI folder can be edited by players to customize the appearance of the indicator, including different animated textures for each con color and other interesting settings. <br />
<br />
- Added /fontface command (usage /fontface , e.g. /fontface Courier). This will change, on the fly, the fonts used by the interface (and over character's heads). Fonts can also be selected in the General Options page. <br />
<br />
- Added /tell windows. Each time you get a &quot;tell&quot; from a new character, a new chat window would open. That window will only display &quot;tells&quot; from the particular character, and any message sent from the chat window would automatically be sent as a &quot;tell&quot; to that character. You can turn this option on and off in the Options window. If you have the maximum number of chat windows open when a new tell is received, the tell will go to the main chat window <br />
<br />
- Temporary pets will no longer send their buffs to the pet window. Generally they have none, and they would replace the buffs of any standard pet. <br />
<br />
- The buff display portion of the pet window will now fade. <br />
<br />
- The Auto-inventory area of the Inventory window now fades with the parent window. <br />
<br />
- The Dump button in raid window now creates the proper, non-blank, file. <br />
<br />
- We have also added time-stamp to Raid Dump output file. <br />
<br />
- Pop-up dialogs no longer close when you press ESC. This will prevent the rez dialog from being closed accidentally. <br />
<br />
- Lay on Hands will no longer &quot;gray out&quot; the Inspect and Open hot keys in the Hotbutton window. This was fixed earlier in the Actions window, but now it is fixed in the Hotbutton window as well. <br />
<br />
- Alt-tabbing in and out of EQ should no longer cause mouse issues. <br />
<br />
- Fixed a bug that sometimes left charmed pets health bar in the group window after the owner of that pet is killed. <br />
<br />
- Find trader can now be cancelled in bazaar. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Items ** <br />
<br />
- The Copper Medal of Rapture now gives a bonus to Int. instead of Wis. <br />
<br />
<br />
** For the New Player ** <br />
<br />
- Left-clicking on an NPC prints out a message indicating what type of NPC they are and indicating that you should right-click on them. This message can be turned off in the Options window. <br />
<br />
- New characters will now start with a bag. <br />
<br />
- Added a tip window that pops up when you invoke the Quantity window that explains the use of Shift and Control when selecting items. <br />
<br />
- All characters will gain a Sense Heading skill of 200, if it was below 200. All new characters will start with a Sense Heading of 200. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Miscellaneous ** <br />
<br />
- Explore mode works properly again. <br />
<br />
<br />
** UI Files ** <br />

&quot;** Quests, Adventures and Encounters **<br />
<br />
- We have added one more new LDoN raid to Stormhammer. This raid was created with Elemental capable characters in mind.<br />
<br />
- Changed the minimum required number of group members to request an adventure from 4 to 3.<br />
<br />
- We have increased the consolation prize on level 65 hard adventures from 19 to 26 to match the increase in reward points for success (raised from 76 to 105 with the last update).<br />
<br />
- Verrell Cogswin can help convert red dragon scales into green dragon scales.<br />
<br />

I hope they fixed this and just didn’t include it in their list of fixes.  If anyone can get into game and test this out, could you please post the results?  <br />
<br />
I’m glad they reduced the number of players required in a LDoN adventure.  I always go in with a full group, but I know of several lower level characters, in their 20s and 30s, who have a very hard time finding people to adventure with.  This should help those players out a bit.<br />
<br />
I’m also curious to see what the “3D target indicator” looks like.  It could make targeting each of the four skeletons that that were just pulled and are all jumbled together a bit easier.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Changed the minimum required number of group members to request an adventure from 4 to 3.<br />
This makes me happy, a bit. It would be nice to request an adventure with just the trio that I play with regularly but I remember from Beta testing that the difficulty of the adventure doesn't scale to the group size, just level average. Unless that's changed :( I really would like a reason to buy LDoN too.</div></div><hr />

Man, chill, its just sense heading, not like anyone didnt bind it to another key anyway.<br />
<br />
People will whine about any change in this game, but enough whining about whining.<br />
<br />
When are they going to fix the broken door in Rivervale  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The sense heading thing is trivial - with LoY maps, the compass, and navigating by zone familiarity or zone walls I doubt many people even use the skill.  Get over it.  Side note - leveling in EQ is considerably easier than ever before, as evidenced by the vast number of skill-free and clueless people you constantly see at 50+.  There may not be a &quot;press here for level 65 and all AA&quot; button but it surely doesn't take significant intelligence or ability to hit 65 or accumulate AA.  Gaining 65 and tons of AA is more about spending time than ability.<br />
<br />
I don't know about changing the group size thing for LDoN.  &lt;shrug&gt;  it's a social game, tons of people do LDoN, and if you can't find a total of 4 or better yet 6 people to do an LDoN run then you're not trying very hard.  Get crazy, get wild, live a little, and do something other than hang out with your only 2 friends in EQ.  Pickup groups for LDoN work great 95% of the time or more.  Idiots are amazingly rare and identified and avoided easily.<br />
<br />
I see nothing really remarkable in the patch notes.  The two things I'd most like to see altered are how the slots work for augs - particularly how none of the really good merchant augs fit into non-LDoN gear.  I'd also like to be able to shrink or tiny companion my pet but this is kinda trivial.<br />
<br />
- Increased the number of items found at the end of a successful LDoN raid. <br />
- Check with the Town Crier of your home town for news. There is information about the recent activities of the Wayfarers that should prove interesting. <br />

It'll be interesting to see what both of those entail.<br />

The sense heading thing sucks.  Sometimes, on really bad days, the only positive spin I could put was &quot;Well, my sense heading went up&quot;.  :p</div></div><hr />

Of course, doing something with 6 people that I can do with 3 is so much more &quot;crazy&quot; and &quot;wild&quot;. <br />
<br />
I don't like pick up groups. If 3 years of this game has taught me anything it is to expect the absolute worst of people.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kirisula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Sense Heading is obsolete anyways. It was probably just easier to give everyone 200 skill than do away with it altogether.<br />
<br />
I suspect the lowered group size requirement is to make it easier to do an adventure at lower levels. In my experience, there aren't always that many level 20s looking for LDoN groups, and its probably easy enough for a twinked out trio to do.  All the groups I've been in in the 50s have gone for a full slate of 6.  I suppose you'll get some level 65 powergaming hydras taking advantage of it, but oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">even worse than giving people a sense heading skill of 200 was the idea of implementing a system of maps they can pull up.  yeah, it's useful, but at the same time, they killed the thrill of adventuring.  the point of exploring new lands is the fact that you don't know where everything is.<br />
<br />
should have made maps quested in each zone - would force you to explore the zone before you were able to look it up at your ease.  just my opinion on that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ya good idea.  Make the maps blocked like an elemental plane until you do some quest that &quot;unlocks&quot; the ability to map that zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Howler - that's a really good idea.  I truly wish they'd done that instead.  I'm glad the LDoN group size was lowered to three, if only because it'll be easy to log on 2 accounts to get my druid into a LGuk mission so she can forage that @#(*&amp; vine!</div></div><hr />

Would at least make you work a little for it, or buy one if not No Drop.<br />
<br />
Sense Heading is obsolete, at least they recognize it. /shrug  Frankly, I never really saw the point of it in the first place.  I'm glad my twinks won't have to work on it now.  It's tedious, and adds nothing to the game.</div></div><hr />

People today miss out on alot of &quot;fun&quot; that used to be in the game.</div></div><hr />
