<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fastosus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok. First off i would like to say that i got from 49 (0% into the level to 51 in 1 day of about 6 hours game play)<br />
<br />
I stayed in echo caverns. The TM room killing the skeletons and the task master gives you roughly 1% per kill. <br />
<br />
You can also kill anything in the room before the taskpmaster and pick up small xp hits which will add up to 1-5% eventually =p<br />
<br />
My tactics consisted of...<br />
<br />
Alacrity and HoS my dog.<br />
Alacrity, HoS, and Cholorplast Myself. <br />
<br />
Mem: Those 3, Togors insects, and instill, and fury<br />
<br />
Those 6 are all you really need.<br />
<br />
Pull with slow, make your pet attack the mob before it gets to you. By doing this your dog will take the first hit which is normally the highest hit that you will take in this zone. After this move in and start melee. <br />
<br />
With cholor, KEI, fury, and HoS. I never went below 80% hp. Neither did dog. <br />
<br />
I got 49-51 here in 1 day of about...... 6 hours total<br />
_______________________________________________<br />
<br />
As a note: If you are looking for great XP at 44-49 Echo caverns is also a great place to go. With a melee partner. You can camp anywhere on the TM side of the zone, whether it be underbulks, fiends, or the room outside of the TM you will get geat XP. <br />
<br />
I got from 44-51 within about 2 weeks of moderate gameplay after school</div></div><hr />
