<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gandilain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if anyone did this much. I am still about a month and a half away from having these skills, but was just wondering if you can solo well with AM3 and EQ. I would assume that you can, as you have lots of damage and a pretty much never ending supply of it, but I can not think of any places off the top of my head atm where it would be profitable to solo kite. I have not had much expereince in any planes except PoJ and PoD so maybe places in other planes? I am really interested in this and any replies would be cool.<br />
<br />
P.S.- Its quite early right now and I didnt get much sleep, if the above post is hard to read/understand, thats why.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aroze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Several months before PoP came out a NToV equipped ranger friend of mine (with EQ/AM3) would solo snakes, including named, next to Ssra.<br />
<br />
He would start of with a snare, then root, and they would usually be dead before he had to root again.  He was doing 1 AA every 2 hours, which at the time was fairly impressive.  I have yet to venture into the planes, but I imagine the same tactic would work there, as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>StarGazeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It does help your solobility (is that even a word?) a bit, but its very slow going.  Still better off in a good grind group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aelias0fTunare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">How would it be slow going? Could you explain please? I would be under the assumption that it would be fast, considering you do limitless damage (infinite Mithril arrows?) and only rely on 2 very low mana cost spells (Snare and Root). Just curious why it's slow going.</div></div><hr />

I'd love to be getting 1 aa every 2 hours, as for soloing, I was in a karnors group with a ranger with EQ and AM 1 or 2, same thing, she'd snare, root, and if the root broke, the mob would be at under 1/4, if root broke, it usually owuld go down first, so I would *assume* that it would be faster =P</div></div><hr />
