<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Trubblesumm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I did a search but the last topic like this seemed ancient.<br />
<br />
Returning after a fair bit of time off and was wondering on what kind of setup people are running in thier hotkey banks nowdays.<br />
<br />
level 66 here, with a few AA (about 104 or so).<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance for your help.<br />

<br />
Page 3 has Call of the Wild, Find Path To PC, Group &amp; Raid HoTT buttons.<br />
<br />
My UI has Prim / Sec / 8 inventory slots in a line under the hotbuttons, so epic1.5 in inventory slot 8 is there for me to click.  I do all of my spellcasting except slows and heals with alt-#.  Anytime folks demand a social... well, they usually get a VERY rude response, but when it's appropriate I just type it in; I'm greased lightning on the &quot;%T slwo&quot; typing.  When I'm grouped with odd clerics, I usually try to slip in &quot;/g cnani&quot; in the 2sec cast.  Sometimes I don't, and then I yell at them for healing.  I'm a bastard like that.<br />
<br />
Oh, I also do &quot;/pet attack&quot; and &quot;/pet back off&quot; by typing, since hotkeys for that don't work while casting.  And shaman are -always- casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">here is my set up<br />
<br />
Group<br />
1 /cast 1(HoT with message)<br />
2 canni<br />
3 canni 5<br />
4 spell gem ( blast heal)<br />
5 pet attack or loot hotkey orany misc i would need<br />
6 VP<br />
7 AA hot<br />
8 my greaves slot Either root or pox<br />
9 assist 1<br />
10 assist 2<br />
<br />
<br />
Raid is the same except i change 5 &amp; use an /assist key for assisting the mob so i know who it is beating on so i can help heal &amp; #8 is my slow or malos message<br />
<br />
I alos use a 6 slot clicky that replaces the friends window. I would be lost without it. my 6 slots are<br />
<br />
1 epic<br />
2 ammo for drogmar<br />
3 chest slot ( for clicky haste)<br />
4 legs slot<br />
5&amp;6 inventory. I always have my other pair of legs in inventory for quick interchanging from root pants to pox pants. Other inventory has either my mod rod or my clicky invis</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">my hotkeys only vary by what messages are attached, save for one that has all of my activateable AAs and leadership hotkeys.<br />
<br />
1. Slow<br />
2. Quick heal<br />
3. regen<br />
4. canni<br />
5. HoT<br />
6. primary weapon (for epic clickies, works REALLY well with bandolier)<br />
7. slowed message (remapped to Q key)<br />
8. canni V (with cleric heart attack safety warning, was a court order after I killed 5 clerics.)<br />
9. sit<br />
10. SoW boots<br />
<br />
my first 5 spell slots NEVER change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lauron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">..another thing I don't see anyone metioning is the action window hotkeys.  I use these a ton also.   This is where all my &quot;%t slowed&quot;, &quot;$t malos'd&quot; etc etc are.  <br />
<br />
..my monk uses them for my 98623494836 different inc messages depending on situation, along with group commands, and raid commands.<br />
<br />
all the random &quot;info&quot; type messages/commands I put here.  <br />
<br />
you can't tie them to a &quot;hotkey number' that i know of, unless you put them in the 1-10 hotkey banks, but just leaving your cursor over them, and doing all your other targeting with hotkeys and such is what I do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Social hotkeys are for losers.  People should just be paying attention for pulls and have faith that I'm doing my job for slows and heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Social hotkeys are for losers.  People should just be paying attention for pulls and have faith that I'm doing my job for slows and heals.<br />
<br />
You're right. I have them because sometimes I do group with losers. Some mobs require a meatshield. Some mobs require a Cleric/Druid. <br />
<br />
Some losers can't figure out that the unslowed, rooted mob doesn't need to be offtanked. Sometimes you have to spell things out like that. <br />
<br />
Sometimes you take a loser and use small words.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually kinda funny, I always use my second keyset, even when raiding (first keyset I made for raids).<br />
<br />
Second Keyset<br />
1- Slowed 75%<br />
2- Malosed or Partially slowed<br />
3- Ancestral Aid inc macro and /alt act<br />
4- Ancestral Aid (so I can see when it's up)<br />
5- Massive Canni inc macro and /alt act<br />
6- Massive Canni (so I can see when it's up)<br />
7- /assist<br />
8- Sit/Stand<br />
9- VP inc macro and /alt act (so people know I'm rooting mobs away)<br />
0- VP (so I can see when it's up)<br />
<br />
Alternate 0- Epic 1.5 on raids<br />
<br />
I have toggle NPCs on F8, toggle PCs on F7, toggle last two mobs on CAPS LOCK, and toggle me and last target Tabs.<br />
<br />
I should post some pics of how my UI is when I get home.<br />
<br />
Edit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.raccoo.com/img/rac_ui.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Here's my UI&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lodidodi.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lodi Dodi&lt;/a&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">That's a great idea, Raccoo. I'm always looking for more efficient UI setups.<br />
<br />
My hotkeys are pretty simple. I tried to keep them relatively the same for raiding and grouping (once you get used to hitting 3 for your slow message, that's about all there is to it). I tried to keep little variation between my active banks (ie. slow on No. 3, resist on No. 6).<br />
<br />
Group, Bank 1<br />
1. /assist<br />
2. Spiritual Channeling<br />
3. /g Slowed: %T. (Generally only used on named and after a resist)<br />
4. Ancestral Aid 3<br />
5. /g Debuffed: %T. (Rarely used)<br />
6. /g RESIST: %T.<br />
7. /g Canni 5.<br />
8. Cannibalization Timer<br />
9. Virulent Paralysis<br />
0. Radiant Cure 3<br />
<br />
Raid, Bank 2<br />
1. /assist puller 1<br />
2. /assist puller 2 (or offtank/MA depending)<br />
3. /shaman channel, Slowed: %T.<br />
4. Ancestral Aid 3<br />
5. /shaman channel, Debuffed: %T.<br />
6. /shaman channel, RESIST: %T.<br />
7. /g Canni 5.<br />
8. Cannibalization Timer<br />
9. Spiritual Channeling<br />
0. Radiant Cure 3<br />
<br />
Misc., Bank 3<br />
This is where I keep my &quot;special&quot; hotkeys ... MGB, Call of the Wild, Group Inspect Buffs, HOTT, Find Path to PC, /corpsedrag, /corpsedrop, a macro for consenting guild and raid on death, that sort of thing.</div></div><hr />
