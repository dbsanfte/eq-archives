&quot;Another impending change that will make high-level players happy is more options for gaining experience. As we well know, Planes of Power saw the level range of mobs that players can get decent exp from shrink from 15 to 10, thus making all but a handful of zones useless for exping at 65. The level range will be opened back up again, giving players much more room to spread out. This should breathe new life into unfortunately abandoned places like the Temple of Cazic Thule.&quot;<br />
