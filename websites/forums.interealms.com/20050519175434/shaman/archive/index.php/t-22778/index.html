<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yesterday was in a SRO LDON (Normal).  Had 5 slots filled and we're looking for one more. The group leader (Cleric) asked, &quot;/g Shaman or Beastlord,&quot; and without a second thought  I replied: &quot;/g Beastlord.&quot; (Note I wasn't only one who replied that way)<br />
<br />
Now I normally look out and look for Shaman when playing my Enchanter. But instinctively I said BL because....(insert long dramatic pause)...they bring more DPS and near-equivalent slows to the table.<br />
<br />
If * I * pick BL &gt; Shaman, I know others are even worse.  And when the &quot;institutional mindset&quot; affects * ME * then I know it is bad.  Not saying Shaman never get groups, and a competent one can heal and slow in a normal, but ...I dunno....<br />
<br />
SOMETHING has to change for the better for the Shaman class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yeah ive talked to people and they said they would pick a BL over a sham too. sucks dont it escpecially when the BL is a hybrid of shaman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And if the cleric wasnt there?<br />
<br />
Would they still take the beasty? Or the shaman. <br />
<br />
Damage isnt everything. And if you were pulling 3-4 at a time The shaman would be alot more useful with Tigirs. And Rains. <br />
<br />
It is situational. Same exact group. Druid or Ranger. Or Sk or necro. What would you pick.<br />
<br />
The awnser is probably depends on if I knew em or not.<br />
<br />
Shot fights favor the beastlord sure. But multi fights or Harder more challenging fights just might favor the shaman. <br />
<br />
I know it won't be a popular awnser. But just because a beastlord is a better fit in some areas doesnt mean he is a better fit in all. Yeah Beasts are pretty damn tough. But so are shaman and shaman have more bredth of ability.<br />

So it took you 5 years to realize shamans don't stack well with enchanters?  <br />
<br />
Actually they stack very well.  It's just that (in a nod to Snoww) BL's stack better.  <br />
<br />
Speaking of healing, went through a normal LDON with a BL and a Ranger healing. (Cleric = ld).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Darjeelingx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually they stack very well. <br />
<br />
Only if the enchanter is charming (which isn't a whole lot of fun for the shaman) or you have no other healer.<br />
<br />
In your group you had 2 slowers and a cleric for a normal LDoN. Why would you be surprised or find it alarming that a shaman isn't needed?<br />
<br />
Most LDoN's i do are me + 5 melee. Goes faster with a bard puller, but isn't essential unless it's a hard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Beastlords do quite well on multiple pulls, tank one themselves and sick pet on the other while the group takes the third(and the pet can take two if need be).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kelinka_Xegony</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I admit the increase in DPS is nice with a BST, but as a shaman we are more than compentent enough to handle normal LDoN without problems..<br />
<br />
Hell ive healed an entire hard LDoN before on a 8.5k pally....i admit it was more about out DPSing the mobs, but it still was done feesabley...<br />
<br />
Had ornate arms at the time for healing focus and used kragg's mending/tnargs<br />
<br />
DPS wise, we can do AoE LDoN's pretty well, id just like to see an up in our burst DPS.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My regular group consists of a War, Bst, Shm, Rogue, Enc, and cleric. Maybe its just because we have played together for so long but we mesh very well. Maybe its not the very max dps group, but I feel more safe with this group then I ever have with another. I feel like the shm, bst, and enc stack fairly well because of the style we play. Usually in LDoN the warrior will pull 3-5 and I will tigir's. The BST will pull one off, put his warder on, then grab another and off-tank it. I slow one then sit to get aggro and pull it out. This makes it easy for the chanter to get all of them mezzed and never have to worry, plus everything is slowed.<br />
<br />
Like I said, maybe its just because we are all really good friends and group together so much, but I don't see a problem with any of the 3 in a group together. This game is about having fun sometimes right? :P</div></div><hr />

I can tell you as a matter of fact... we are way way way way behind beastlords at this point. It is a crying shame.<br />
<br />
Just from thinking about what enchanters can do for a group and what we can do... I think were way less desirable for a lot of groups compared to them too. Don't even think about bards...<br />
<br />
Anyways.. if your in a normal Ldon and have a cleric.. what do you need a slower for? :D More DPS would work out to being better than slows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I had a similar problem yesterday, was cruising around on my SK farming parts for Greenmist and was watching the local LDON channel, guy said NRO hard Looking for Slower, so I sent him a tell, what I got back was a no thanks, shamans suck at everything but slows, we need a bst or enc...his next yell was for a beast/enc.<br />
I really wonder how much of this is because younger/newer players have grown up in the game with beastlords being common. Old school players actively seek out shamans for their groups while he Luclin and new expansion crowds go beastlord for the most part.<br />
Its getting frustrating thats for damn sure.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Honestly, Shaman DPS is totally underrated in LDoN normal if they dont have to heal. For one, pet with Mage weapons is a solid contributer, and easy to bring with the new changes. Secondly, there are ALWAYS parked mobs in LDoN normal, and whats better than going to a rooted mob and finding it half-dead from a DOT. Now granted, BL DPS is better, pet is better, melee is better (well, I have a Sharky, so I compete with the &quot;average&quot; BL's melee output), but do not underestimate the power of Root-Rot in LDoN Normal. Generally, even when I am sole healer-slower, I STILL pick one of the mobs on a 4-pull and say &quot;This ones mine&quot;, drop Bane and BoS on him, and refresh as the others die. <br />
<br />
I guess it all boils down to whether &quot;more then adequate&quot; is good enough, or you want to look for &quot;totally optimum&quot;. The average Shaman is MORE than adequate in any LDoN Normal group, period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Actually they stack very well. <br />
<br />

Sorry to disagree, but Shaman stack damn well with Chanters in Normal. I actually have been known to YELL and enchanters in Normal for mezzing, not kidding. Personally, I think the BEST use of an enchanter in Normal is charm and buffs. See my post above. Root-rot has become a      very powerful weapon in LDoN normal. In a standard 4 pull, with a normal DPS group, I can get the last mob to less than 25% by myself, and that includes slowing all the others, and being primary healer. <br />
<br />
Normal is just too trivial. Its not even worth argueing about. In another thread, I mentioned that I had some friends of mine wait at the ZI while the Rogue and I went ahead and cleared some rooms. We cleared them easily, and I do not think I even used a single Tnargs. We got 5 drops of the collect in about 7 minutes from the first 10ish mobs. I had them so low from DOTs that once they broke root, one good BS by the rogue was all she wrote. 6 competent warriors can smoke LDoN normal. Is saving 3 minutes by choosing a BL over a Shaman REALLY that big a deal overall?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Color me obtuse Darjeeling, but how does an Enchanter Charming affect your fun?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mearis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">In LDoN normal, shamans shine as they can easily hold an entire group alive while chain pulling and two boxing, of course, if you have a dedicated healer then a beastlord is probably a more 'optimal' option.<br />
<br />
Shamans and enchanters stack very well, however, crowd control is absolutely useless in easy LDoN, as it is 'faster' to just pull the entire room and let it hit you and die on damage shields with a conventional group, if anything, an enchanter not using charm is the most useless class you can have in a normal LDoN group.  A shaman in my guild regularly duo's LDoN with her enchanter boyfriend, in 30 minutes charming, of course they are both great players so that helps, but its not particularly difficult.<br />
<br />
Finally, I honestly have never considered someone's class as an issue in a group, unless it was for particularly challenging content.  People 'invite' others to join their groups because of friendship with a person, not because they feel a beastlord is a more efficient choice than a shaman.  If we have a group with all the bases covered for the content in question, the last slot is going to go to whoever friend I have online that is available to come, I don't think I have ever used the LFG tool to find people to add to groups.  <br />
<br />
I do think that shamans have legitimate gripes about balance, but short of GoD content where Clerics/Warriors are mandatory, bitching about groups is pretty silly, as class is very rarely the determining factor for most people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Got to agree with Blazz on this one. I try to avoid taking enchanters on the (few) Normal adventures I do. It's just too boring on a multi-pull when all but one is mezzed. Enchanters on my server probably hate me ... I break mezz all the time when I'm bored. Even when I'm slower/main heal, I'm itching to give puppy his own mob, drop a BOS on the mob and take care of it. <br />
<br />
I've never been told a group would rather have a beastlord or an enchanter over a shaman in LDON, GOD, Sol Ro, or the EP's. Not once. I group with both classes pretty regularly, and find that a beastlord or enchanter DOES stack pretty nicely with a shaman. I always ask if one of them wants to slow (I find it funny) while I backup heal and DOT, and usually get a variation of the following answer, &quot;No way, man. Slowing is YOUR job. I don't want to die if it resists.&quot; In the three occasions I have been told they'd like to slow, I find myself taking over again when I get the variation of, &quot;Too many resists, this is pointless. You do it.&quot;  Not a problem.<br />

 my question is, what the hell is a chanter doing in an LdoN group? their dps sucks and you rarely charm =p i never get enchanters in ldon, i run mine there to buff teh group lol thats all they are good for as far as ldon goes.<br />
<br />
You might want to do some parsing of a charmed Enchanter pet in either normal or hard before making such comments.  And in a hard LDON - Mez &gt; root + slow.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I will add, I never understood the mindset of &quot;an unslowed MOB beating itself to death on your DS is better than a Mezzed MOB standing there.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Or if my wife is messing with the other comp playing bejeweled or whatever I dont have to keep the buffs up in the group. I hate buffing with single target buffs lol. Oh how spoiled we have become. I remember back in kunark when the only shaman buffs worth casting were single target and we kept them up well hehe...<br />

Correct. Which is what i posted.<br />
<br />
Not to derail the thread, but...<br />
<br />
Color me obtuse Darjeeling, but how does an Enchanter Charming affect your fun?<br />
<br />
Not just enchanters, also necros and druids. When your main role in the group is just to malos the mob on a charm break, and the pet is doing 3x the combined DPS of the group, i don't find it exciting. Maybe it's just me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I'd say 90% of the normal Ldons I do are myself and 5 melee guildmates.<br />
<br />
I spend most of my time casting tigirs and rains as we just rush rooms rather than pull. Healing is pretty easy, BoT and occasional daluda keeps up fine with 2-3 mobs beating on an EP tank. We usually win in under 30mins and have to wait for reset.<br />
<br />
If we have a cleric friend on we usually do hard Ldon, usually with no enchanter/CC ;) (we usually have a bot parked for voq/haste).<br />
<br />
I also agree with the other posters, when you are pushing the limits in hard content, enchanter and shaman can work beautifully together. Sadly my long term hunting partner enchanter friend has gone into almost total retirement :/ so we usually do 'our' hard content (ikkiniz/KT) with a bard these days.</div></div><hr />

about 40 adv. i was the only healer (never failed).<br />

the last one we did,<br />

and mage lv 65...............<br />

the magician had to leave after 5 min we went in.<br />

some said we can't do it we should restart a new one.<br />
i said no we  are ok imo.<br />
<br />
we did it and we won pretty easy.<br />
when i log on i got tells  from peps to join them for adv.<br />
<br />
i am not just a healer, i  usually cast rain  plus a dd (when there is not a chanter around to mez everything over one mob in camp :eek:   ).<br />
<br />
i don t really like to have a chanter in group = i can t dot free  dot on 2nd or 3 rd add.because they are mezzed,can t rain dd as well.<br />

<br />
Beastlords do not have 75% slow. They have a 65% slow at level 65. Prior to that, I believe their best is 50%. Enchanters can slow for up to 70%.<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Well, you ARE playing as one of the two classes that almost totally eclipses Shaman.  You can throw down the 70 percent slows and do EVERYTHING else that we do to the same extent or better, with the exception of healing (not counting DoT's here due to aggro and extremely limited use).  <br />
<br />
A group with an ENC/DRU, ENC/CLR, BST/DRU, or BST/CLR gains little benefit from a shaman.  And even IF those combinations do not exist... well, if one of the two out of those combos exist, it makes more sense to pick up a DRU/ENC/BST instead of a Shaman.<br />
<br />
This is a really dead horse, but the ONLY thing we have that is special is ownership of both Slow and Healing spells.  Since the difference between our slows and BST/ENC slows are marginal (talking about level 65's here... haven't met a BST yet who has stayed below 65 for more than a month), the only thing we have over them is our third rate healing.<br />
<br />
Quiescence is fantastic, don't get me wrong, but in content where we can heal exceptionally with it, you're better off just getting ENC for mez, or a DPS class to help kill, in under 15 seconds, the trivial mobs you are fighting.<br />
<br />
We either need something Unique, or we need to be more than a one-trick pony.  We've always coasted along on the most powerful slow in the game, but with other classes getting slows at 65/70 to our 75, that isn't enough anymore.  Beastlords, our HYBRID class, have a percentage number only 10 below ours.  Compare Paladin and Cleric direct heals and tell me if the gap is as small as it is between BST and SHM slows.</div></div><hr />

Maybe its the style of the people you are playing with. We are talking about LDoN here. Even on Hard, there is more to do that JUST malos the pet for shaman. On normal, if you are pulling 1 mob and letting the pet just kill it, then you are really just shooting yourself in the foot. Pull 5, put pet on one, tank on anyother, VP the 3rd, secone tank on 4th, and you and dog-dog clean up the 5th (after you slow all the others, that is). Its not hard, even with moderately geared characters and average skill levels. <br />
<br />
Granted, in other situations, like Vxed/Tipt trials, where the entire focus of the group is usually on maintaining the pet, being the &quot;malos when it breaks&quot; guy is pretty mundane, but thats a different thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Yeah, I've taken to intentionally pulling 2-4 at a time in normal ldons as the only slower/healer/puller.

Lately I've grouped with bards who upon inc say &quot;bard slowed 52%&quot; and similar. And I'm like What the heck, when did bards get that good a slow, I didn't realize it before. I felt useless in those groups, though of course I slowed and did my stuff anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've found that it's not worth the effort to browbeat the Bard into not pulling, or the Cleric/Druid into primarily doing damage - although in honesty, some of them just love it. Monks are easier to train to stay in camp hitting stuff. They seem to like that more, mostly.<br />

/shrug - there's no class that I won't take, I've even grouped with other Shaman, and had them on dot/cc/heal duty while I pulled with slow.

5) Monks are not allowed to single pull, again this is an exploit.<br />
<br />
6) Sanity is overrated, and therefore no sane player should come (this doesn't normally elliminate many people, as most people spend too much time starting at phosphorent dots...)</div></div><hr />

Ya sounds about right. Couple things recently in LDON that I have experienced:<br />
<br />
Joined a group with a shaman in it and he left group..refused to have 2 shaman in the same group../gasp! omg I have done LDONS with 4 shamans before what a blast it was.<br />
<br />
Was in a weak hard ldon yesturday and looted the last collect with in the last minute. Ended up root cooking the last 5 mobs because the tank had died so many times and the cleric was oom..chanter was our puller. Pretty exciting.<br />

<br />
If all EQ players were so open minded, the world would be a better place.  Yeah, BST vs. Chanter vs. Shaman, etc., etc., conversation for the 10,00th time is a waste of time.  A good player is a good player, I'll take any of the three depending on the situation, mobs and rest of the group.<br />
<br />
A group with a cleric and chanter IS better off with a BST, period.  Without the cleric or chanter, I'd take the Shaman.  I've never had an LDoN group wipe because I could not get the mobs slowed on a multi-pull, but I have been on a couple where the BST got us wiped because their slow bounced.  Yeah, they can grab a couple of mobs, but it's tough for anyone to tank, heal and slow in a multi-pull situation.<br />
<br />
Nuff said, just play, enjoy and be happy.<br />

I actually find the normal LDoNs to be more enjoyable than a Hard. I have more fun when there's 4 or 5 mobs in camp at a time than playing around in LDoN or GoD trials where anything more than a 2 pull is usually instant death.<br />
<br />
As for the original post, Enchanters are the class I'd be least likely to pick for a regular LDoN so it only seems fair that they'd feel the same way about shaman. :p Honestly though, I don't see where it matters. Pretty much any good group of 65s can finish a normal in under 50 minutes. <br />
<br />
If I'm using the LFG tool to fill up a normal LDoN group, the first class I look for is a ranger. Tanking, tracking, nice DPS, snare and root; what more could one ask for?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know my daughter feels that way - shamans are her least favorite class to group with.  Too many overlaps.</div></div><hr />
