<br />
that is what the char is currently equipped with ... looking for items that i can either quest or purchase ...<br />
<br />
well i replaced a few more items and still shopping around for some more ... a few peices i find to me seem to be to high in price for what they give ... any other reccomendations? or if it is a drop peice .. if its something i can snatch up on my own let me know about where or who drops it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KrintixXaneris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Immediatly begin working on hp gear.  Lose the helm, get a slime covered rubicite coif.  Replace the jarsath bracer with a barbed rubicite.  Replace the book in your secondary with a sarnak battleshield, UPGRADE YOUR SHOULDERS BEFORE THE WORLD EXPLODES, get an elder wolf hide or chokodai spaulders or an obulous if you can.  Get an iksar regen bp.  Grab an earring of twised leaves, get a shadel bandit ring or 6ac 65 hp ring.  Might want to straight trade out your GEB's for tribal war boots (btw, since when can iksar wear GEB's?) if you think you could use some rsts and ac.  Would be a good idea to get an enshrouded veil for some cheap hps, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Flea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ah thanks yeah my HP i want to get up majorly while still keeping my mana pool up to ...  i have a charred guardian shield but i swapped it out for the book mostly to get the resists a little more ... <br />
<br />
as for the boots heh i had them rotting away on another char and looked .. saw that they could be equipped so moved them over since they were better then what i had ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Mana pool is largely irrelevent for a shaman because of our Cann series of spells. You want HP over Mana every time. Trust me, makes a nice difference. If I could replace every armor slot  I have with armor of the same ac but with 100hp on it I'd take it hands down. HP &gt; Wisdom &gt; Mana pool.<br />
<br />
Think of it this way, do you ever go out of mana that often when using your Cann spells? Do you ever go out of HP that often when using your Cann spells? I'd imagine you run out of HP more often than you run out of mana just like I do. HP items and regen items help a ton until you hit 60 and get the spell Torpor.<br />
<br />
Chose HP, Chose life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Flea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">never really thought about it like that before .. i use my C3 quite often for extra mana ... and have invested 2 AA points into regen so far as well ...  ok is there a ratio to look for? like would 25 hp be better then 20 mana or 2 wis?</div></div><hr />
