I was soloing in Katta, and i had just seen the post about alpha dog, so i decided to give it a try ( ive been away for a while so didnt know about weapons thing)<br />
<br />
anyway, in the end i just sat there medding while my pet did all the killing! all i had to do was slow them, it was amazing compared to what my pet had been doing.<br />
<br />
the exp was about the same rate as when i do the usualy dot etc. but this prolly isnt as good when you have JBB and epic ( i dont)</div></div><hr />
