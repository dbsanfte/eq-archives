<br />
How often have you heard of a guild OR an alliance of guilds progressing through planar progression successfully on an NBG loot system?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Havnt.   <br />
<br />
Problem with NBG is it doesnt reward active raiders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Too easy to pick a system like that apart.  What people &quot;need&quot; depends on your perspective and a NBG system for EP+ gear can really run into murky waters because there are great casting foci on items that are also great melee items.  Loot councils and other NBG approaches eat up more time than a regular DKP system and you always are at risk of being accused of favoritism.<br />
<br />
There is far less inherant potential for bickering in a solid DKP system and you ultimately equip those who play the most the best.  Just fewer headaches IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">On EMarr there is a time+ guild named Resiliance that I believe runs on a loot council.  It *can* work, but it's certainly not for everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The term Need before greed is misleading as frequently people claim to need things they don't, it can often be a very greed oriented system, compared to simple points systems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">my guild use DKP + Call loot.   <br />
1. Send tell if interesting on item,   Highest DKP got loot first  <br />
2. Send tell with Equipment you using for call loot, for ppl without high or not enough DKP(might cause other problem,  -999 DKP ppl like me  take all rot items  :P)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I love our guild's point system.<br />
<br />
Everyone accrues points for attending raids. Active players must maintain a certain attendance percentage to stay active.<br />
<br />
When an item drops, it has a pre-determined OBV (opening bid value, typicaly OBVs are 2, 8, 16, 32). The guild does three rounds of silent bidding to officers, with round 1, round 2 bids announced. Highest bid on round 3 wins item.<br />
<br />
Bids are open to active guild members first. If no active guild members bid at OBV, the bidding is open to active/inactive/trials. Class only loot is determined by the class and the winner spends 2 x OBV (I spent 64 for my fabulous TA for example, a BARGAIN).<br />
<br />
I like the system because:<br />
<br />
* It's perfectly fair, you attend raids, you earn points, you spend them as you want<br />
* It rewards players with high attendance without penalizing players with low attendance. Even if you don't raid as much, you can still save up points to buy your dream item<br />
* Due to the anon bidding, it's hard to &quot;one point swipe&quot; an item, people have to bid what they think the item is worth to them<br />
<br />
Some problems we've had:<br />
<br />
*Debating if certain items should be restricted to one class (BoWs for example). We pretty much decided to let the guild use their conscience - most items best suited for a particular class go to that class first</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kiebler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We do officer allocation and I wouldnt have it any other way.  I have excellent raid attendance, but me rebuying gear doesnt really make the guild stronger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I guess the answer would have to depend on your definition of need before greed. Its fairly easy for 6 people to come to an agreement if someone needs something or not if something drops in a single group. On the other hand I shudder to think what it would be like trying to get 72 people to agree who most needs an item off say the rathe for example. Honestly the corpse would probably root before you could come to an agreement.<br />
<br />
If you mean loot council I beleive one of the top guilds on our server uses a method along those lines. If you'd count officer decided then my guild would count and we just killed quarm our last trip to PoTime. Heck Fires of heaven was officer decided if memory serves.<br />
<br />
Personally I beleive that there are weaknesses to any system you can come up with. Simply because nothing can ever fully account for all possible situations both in reguards to the canidates and in reguard to the item.<br />
<br />
It's easy to see and understand this when it comes to items. Does a Blade of war go to a warrior first for aggro since they benifit most from it even tho it's usable by a number of other classes? Most people i've run into say yes. Well what about an ifir? rogue's first. Most say yes. How bout Reinforced Mephit Talon. Has a pretty nice ratio and bs mod on it so makes a good rogue weapon right? Also has an insturment mod on it too so it's great for a bard. Who gets it or both? What about the symbol of the planesmaster. Clicky stun proc buff is great for melee's for aggro. The improved dot damage focus is great for casters. Not that uncommon for int casters but much rarer for wis casters. Same focus on same item but differing rarity depending on the class.<br />
<br />
Any hard system just can't take into account all these factors. I know from experiences as an officer in my guild trying to decide loot calls that it's hard to look at and balance all the very numerous considerations. The system will only work as well as those in it and thier support for it.<br />
<br />
Personally I'm happy with our system and while nothing is ever drama free we've done well with it in that reguard. I beleive it's also allowed us to keep ourselves progressing by allowing us to put gear where it's most needed at times. FT and mana on the clerics, AC on the tanks, nuke focus's on the dmg dealers, attack on the melee dmg dealers etc. Is it perfect? No but as I said I don't beleive any system can be.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Fires of Heaven was not on a DKP system, and I think they did quite fine for themselves.<br />
<br />
It has nothing to do with the system a guild uses for loot, it has everything to do with the people that make up the guild.   I don't care how good your system is, DKP, Non-DKP, hybrid, whatever, its the people in that guild that will eventually determine if you succeed or fail.  The loot system you use will only adjust the rate of your success or failure (speed up or slow it down) but it will not determine if you are successful or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Jara hit the nail on the head.  DKP guilds die out as much as NBG guilds climbing to the EPs and beyond.  Recruiting is nothing like it used to be for most guilds, there is alot of room for undesireables to get into quality guilds and tear them apart with their greed.  DKP backs up the guild and officers better than NBG when the whining begins, but in the end you still have to be a close knit group that should be happy when a guildmate gets an item and vice-versa.<br />
<br />
Ado</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My personal opinion:<br />
<br />
A guild where the guild leader decided who got what gear based on what best benefitts the guild as a whole, without any regards to personal feelings, friendships, or individual magelos, but based on current gear needs for the guild overall, can progress at a much faster rate than a guild on a DKP system, assuming all other things equal.<br />
<br />
Now thats not saying any non-DKP system will beat any DKP system guild.  But an officer/leader awarded system where you put gear on the members that get the most upgrade/use out of it is going to gear up better and faster than a DKP guild for the most part.  DKP guilds tend to have two problems: Rot and Minor Upgrades.<br />
<br />
Rot being a problem when an item could benefit someone but because of the DKP cost they won't loot it and it rots.  So instead of bettering your guild overall you end up letting items rot that someone could have used.  <br />
<br />
 Minor Upgrades being where members with already good gear but also have high DKP buy items over people with much lesser gear simply because they can.  So you have people that get very minor upgrades over people that would have gotten a massive upgrade.   Having a 10k hp tank buy an item that gives them a 20 hp upgrade instead of the 8k hp tank getting a 150 hp upgrade is an example of what can happen in a DKP guild.<br />
<br />
Now this doesn't always happen, but it can.  I think the problem with many DKP guilds is people forget that DKP is only supposed to determining loot order, who gets first choice.  Unfortunately many people feel that their points entitle them to not only get first choice, but 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or as many as they want without regard to others.<br />
<br />
<br />
You really need to decide what is best for your guild based on the people in it, especially your officers.  A non-DKP system takes very strong officers that have a strong backbone and are willing to make tough decisions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Rot being a problem when an item could benefit someone but because of the DKP cost they won't loot it and it rots<br />
Why would you let something rot that someone could use as an upgrade?<br />
That's the problem with fixed price DKP.  Items don't have a static price.  Focus effects make an item more valuable to some people than others (like why would an item with fire nuke focus be worth as much to an enchanter as a mage?).  Other mods make things more appealing to one class more than another.  The relative size of upgrade makes some items much more valuable to certain pieces than other people.<br />
<br />
That's why I like auction systems much more.  If something is uber, everyone knows it, and pays through the nose to get it.  If it's mediocre, but it's usable, it'll go for cheap.  Items with mods for certain classes find more value in an item than other classes, and thus item value remains relative.  For the betterment of the guild, wouldn't it make more sense to let someone loot the item that's an upgrade?<br />
<br />
As an example, if you've been doing Time long enough, then you'll have so many phase 1 bracers looted that you'll struggle to find people to want to loot one.  If you get a new recruit or guildmember raiding with you, is that item really worth X points to loot, when supply and demand for the bracer is practicly zero?</div></div><hr />

<br />
well said but let me give you the other side of the coin.. My guild started as a leadership awared..  and yes youd think equiping certain active tanks with most of the gear would make for great tanks to progress the guild ahead faster... until they leave for another guild.... which we had happen a couple times.  Hope you have better luck with your leap of faith.<br />
<br />
We went to DKP silent bids, and never looked back.  I can tell you nothing rots, if no mains want it the alts and trial members step forward...  true an SK only wep(ect.) might rot occasional because everyone has better but that would be the same in awarded/nbg/or dkp.<br />
<br />
Minor upgrades.. ya it can happen BUT, its really only bad when items have a set point value.. if its a bidding system, silent or not, then that 10k hp warrior is going to have to pay a lot if he really wants that 20hp upgrade... because I bet that 8k hp warrior is going to bid everything he has for such a big upgrade.<br />
<br />
If the 8khp warrior has a lot of points but is still outbid by the 10k... he deserves it..  but the next such item wil be the 8k's almost assuredly.  ....If the 8k has very little points then you have to ask yourself, why is that? 1. Hes new and deserving of little loot by any system.  2. He just bought a major item and you dont wanna give him everything do you?  or 3. He almost never raids so will never get the points others do... ya I can understand you wanting to give Items to friends and long time guildies even if they raid very rarely... but this wont help your progression much.<br />
<br />
just another opinion nothing to cry over...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My current guild uses officer award to get things done.  Yea it takes a bit longer, but in the end at least in my oppinion, it rewards the people who need it most.  Because the officer's are honest, they are able to fairly balance factors like activity and need etc. to determine who actually should get the upgrade.  Also if you get hardcore raiding guild, where it's basically requred to raid, inactivity isn't a problem, beucase people have either said 'hey um... i gotta go to Iraq, i'll be back in a year', that's fine, no loot for you :).  If you just stop playing for 2 weeks w/o warning, well you probably won't get anything for a little while /shrug.  <br />
<br />
Either method could work, IF you have an honest core of officers.  If your officer's are out for lots of personal upgrades, then you will have issues.  At least in my guild, officer's get about 1/2 the loot a member w the same activity would get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My guild is pretty unusual. We just random 200 for loot among those who would use it. Occasionally items are class restricted, but only for pretty obvious things (haste to melee first, mana preservation &amp; flowing thought to people with mana, etc.).<br />
<br />
We are very small though. A full raid for us is normally 3-4 groups. We are currently working on Bertox and Rydda Dar to advance in PoP. If we can beat those two then Mithaniel Marr should be easy and we are in Sol Ro Tower. We don't like flagging aliances, open raids, and things like that - so we are just planning to see how far we can get on our own.<br />
<br />
We are actually closer to having the guild Kod'Taz flagged than Sol Ro Tower flagged. :)<br />
<br />
We are a friends based guild, and only invite friends of guild members (so no recruiting is allowed by people that no one knows).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>takk the silent one</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I got a question and I'm lookin' for an honest answer:<br />
<br />
How often have you heard of a guild OR an alliance of guilds progressing through planar progression successfully on an NBG loot system?<br />
<br />
In alliance,  usually its NBG and lotto type loot. Selfdom do you win any real good gear and if you do, maybe its time to go to Vegas. Usually such raids in alliances are more interested in getting flagged than loot.<br />
<br />
In guild raids, NBG really doesn't work too well. Mainly because on a large raid (&gt; 50 people) not everyone will get any loot. But if you attend a lot of raids, you should have a better chance at getting loot. Surprising even with Earn points, it is not usually cut throat bidding. Usually, unless the object is extremely rare and someone has a lot of points, the bidding is moderate. Eventually even the higher bidding items come down because most people that need it have it.  One thing that prevented out of control bidding is to have the main character the first chance to bid , then  the apps and secondary characters. So if a person's main character needs its over someones secondary character, he gets it.<br />
<br />
In informal raid groups, we go back to NBG since they are not meant as major investment of guild members. People who need it tell the raid leader and they lotto the item. No earned points but everyone has a chance on the items (if it applies to their class)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My guild uses a unique system. We went through a lot of trial and error runs before finding one that seems to work well.<br />
<br />
We give all members one point per raid (or sometimes per target if we hit multiple targets in one night). We also give people bonus points for doing certain non-raid tasks. Right now to encourage people to get their VT keys we're offering guildmates extra points if they get their Emp keys by a certain date. In the past we gave points to people who farm fungoid sap for when we were preparing to take down Seru for the first time. <br />
<br />
Each point can be used to increase your random on an item.<br />
<br />
Standard rolls are 0-2000 for friends and apprentices (Guildmates who have been in the guild less than 30 days)<br />
<br />
For every point you use your random is increased by 100. So if someone was to use 5 points, their random would be 500-2000. The maximum points someone can use in a random is 18. Thus being 1800-2000.<br />
<br />
Points are only used up if you win the random.<br />
<br />
You can also buy items with 25+ pts. Before a random takes place the looter will ask those who are buying to send him a tell with how many pts they are using.<br />
<br />
The idea is to give everyone at least a shot at loot when it drops while giving the regular raiders a much better chance at getting the stuff they really want.<br />
<br />
We've had it going for about 8 months now and no complaints at all. Everyone seems to be pretty happy with it even though once in a  blue moon someone will come in and win a nice item on a 0-2000 roll despite a few people randoming 1800-2000. But it's not too common. <br />
<br />
And the 25 pt buy option guarantees even the unlucky rollers will win something eventually. :)</div></div><hr />

I love it!  Better than an alliance that simply asks for tells on items, and gives them out based on how often the raid leader THINKS they've been playing / contributing (No DKP, no nothing, just cross your fingers and pray).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">My guild uses a Loot Council. We based our policy off the one used by Blades of Wrath on Torvonillous. If I'm not mistaken, I believe BOW is in Time, and may even be raiding GOD content. I read it their policy first several months ago (when we were looking to upgrade from a /random system) and about fell off my chair ... really wonderful system. We tweaked it to suit our guild's needs and haven't looked back. Our Loot Council consists of our leader, our lieutenant, one officer, and five regular guild members. They link what we win off a mob, and ask for people to send in tells. In that tell, people must link what they'd like to replace and also say why the drop is an upgrade. Loot Council takes into consideration things like time spent raiding, time spent contributing to the guild, seniority, need, and a host of other things, and makes a final decision. We have had people from DKP guilds join our guild and say the Loot Council is the best thing they've seen since blue M&amp;M's. It's efficient, it's fast, and you are certain the loot is going to someone who needs it and who has really put time into the guild. We have had VERY few disputes over loot.<br />
<br />
As for DKP ... DKP does not take into account need. It simply awards items to the people who can raid the most ... and if you're like a lot of our guild members, it would leave you in the dust with no chance of ever outbidding someone and winning an upgrade. DKP might be a more fair system than a Loot Council system ... but it is not the best system for us. I doubt we will ever use DKP.<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Either a loot council or DKP type approach can work and really depends on the quality of the people in the guild and their willingness to work together to progress as a whole.<br />
<br />
When you get to VT level and beyond there is a real hurdle to jump though and that is the HUGE learning curve for everyone in the guild as to the equipment.  Prior to VT we all spent a fairly long time looking at what was available and were fairly familiar with the options.  When you get to VT and the Elements an enormous new range of equipment becomes available and especially equipment with focus/effects.  <br />
<br />
One quick example is the Intricately Etched Seashell that drops off Ofossa in PoWater.  It's probably the best shield for a shammy pre-time but it also has a focus of 30% to fire nukes which does a shaman no good.  As much as I would like one it's better for the guild for this to go to one of the classes that have fire nukes first.  In a DKP system I would hope the shammies would back off on bidding for this until some who can use the focus get it.  In a Loot Council system the LC needs to have done it's homework and know the relative value of this to the classes involved.  The problem is that in VT and beyond there are LOTS of these types of items.  It's very hard to know the relative values for all the classes.  Just looking at hp/mana doesn't give the true value anymore.<br />
<br />
This is a real challenge fo a Loot Council system.  The LC needs to maintain credibility that awards are based on equipment needs even if many other factors are involved.  If the LC doesn't know it's stuff then the awards look more and more like they are just personal whim that will encourage guild members to wheedle, whine, etc. to get loot.</div></div><hr />

It has nothing to do with the system a guild uses for loot, it has everything to do with the people that make up the guild.   I don't care how good your system is, DKP, Non-DKP, hybrid, whatever, its the people in that guild that will eventually determine if you succeed or fail.  The loot system you use will only adjust the rate of your success or failure (speed up or slow it down) but it will not determine if you are successful or not.<br />
<br />
I have to agree there.  <br />
<br />
It seems like the DKP system mainly rewards the people who raid frequently and if they attend X amount of raids without anything dropping for their class, it only means that they have more of an opportunity when something drops because they'll have so many points built up.  <br />
<br />
With the NBG system, nearly everything is going to be an upgrade no matter how many raids that person attends.  You can tell by your group interactions and magelos if the items are going to be a small upgrade for someone or a big one.  Hopefully, not everyone who is eligible is going to place their names into the roll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Open bidding is the worst thing in any loot system.  I was in a guild with open bid and watched people bid on items for the sole purpose of bumping up the cost.  <br />
<br />
My guilds current system is probably the best I have seen (but we all think our guild is the best).  It addresses numerous issues that DKP systems have.  It uses a silent bid useing fixed amounts (4 levels, 1, 3, 6 or 20+ points).  <br />
<br />
Rot.  Nothing really ever rots.  Since each item has no fixed amount, someone can always get for rot.  Even trial or untagged people can get loot.  Only class specific stuff like the ranger sword or bard horn in Ikkinz rots.<br />
<br />
Marginal upgrades.  If a item is a 20HP upgrade for a warrior and another warrior it was a 100hp upgrade, the other warrior should bid more.  People bid what they think it is worth.  If your being cheap, expect to not win items.<br />
<br />
Point Hoarding.  Because of the design of the system, someone can hoard 100+ points but high end items have a variable amount attached to them.  That amount is either 20 points (a person can go neg), a max amount of 100 points (it is rare for someone to acquire 100 points though), or a final amount which is there total points minus there raid level (1 through 4) times 2.  So if I had 30 points and bid on a item and am a full time raider, I would have 8 points left.<br />
<br />
Additionally, seperat scores are used for determining who wins lower point value items.  So the person with the most points wont necessarly win the lower value item.  <br />
<br />
Since our guild is heavy hydra based (when 2/3rds of clerics and 1/2 of shaman are bots) so we treat hydras at almost the same level of a main.  A hydra must have x more points then the next bidder where x is the value of the item.  Hydras acquire and pay the same amounts, just have more restrictive conditions to win.<br />
<br />
<br />
My main problem with a system that is NBG based is it doesnt take into account what a person has earned.  You have 2 rogues.  One uses a Talon from PoEb.  The other has a RSS from Ikk3 and a DoD.  A JTB drops in Time.  Now who should get?  The rogue who has the talon (and has a raid level of 2) or the rogue who has the RSS and the JTB would be offhanded (but they have a raid level of 4)?  The thing about the JTB is the proc is neg hate, so it is viable offhanded.  So who gets in a NBG vs DKP?  In our case it was the rogue who was a full time raider and was offhnding the JTB.  This player had more points and earned it.  I did not raid full time so a part time raider who needed more upgrades then me can get them faster then me.  If a person wants more loot, he needs to raid more.  If he cant, he needs to understand that loot will come slower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Realm of Insanity http://www.roi-guild.com uses a system where officers decide loot. Its been working fine, and there hasn't been any favoritism. And we just broke Tacvi, so I guess it can't be that bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Juror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Ask me in another month.  One alliance on our server is at MM / Bert right now and uses CAWU (can and will use) for loot.  Another alliance uses DKP (one point for each hour of participation with bonuses for first kills, coming up with new strat, or outstanding effort/performance... awarded by raid leader/officer) and is much farther (killed Fennin and Xegony, working on Rathe and Corinav; killed WM but hasn't done much in Gates because folks are working on VP quests and elemental minis to gear up first.)  Both alliances are made up of individual members (some guilded, some not; some powergamers, some casual.)  The first has few requirements while the second has several (level, AAs, spells, items, PoJ and Tactics flags.)  Based on my experiences with both organizations, it helps to have some sort of incentive to encourage people to raid and help each other more, especially when backflagging.  I have no doubt that the second will get to Time and start into Gates and Omens soon.  The first might but it will take a lot longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">My guild uses a loot council for awards.  We're currently in Txevu.  It takes a bit longer, but I like it better than a DKP where older raiders can dominate the system.  Of course, we have also tracked hours on raid, % attendance, time since last loot, items looted (for quality comparisons), and darn near everything else for close to 3 years now, so we can weigh a lot of factors.<br />
