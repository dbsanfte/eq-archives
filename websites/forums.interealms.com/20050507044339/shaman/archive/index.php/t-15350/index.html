<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Upcoming for August 6th, 2003<br />
It's been a little hectic around here lately, with all the Live, Legends and expansion work going on.  We're busy in that good way, where you get a lot done every day but tomorrow there's just as much to do.<br />
<br />
New adventure unearthed in Lavastorm!  In the depths of the Lavastorm mountains there is only one ruler.  But even his burning breath and power have their limits.  Rumor has it that there is wealth and danger in locations even further below the boiling lands than Lord Nagafen can reach.  These tales have been spreading like ripples on a calm lake, and their point of origin appears to be an upstart barbarian named Morden.  Some say that he's already delved these fabled caverns and taken what there was of value.  Other say that he couldn't have carried it all off by himself.  But most say that he's a rogue, a teller of tales, and not to be trusted.  Will you discover the truth and brave the heat, or will you sit beside your cozy campfire and listen to stories?<br />
<br />
We will be adding platinum to the Shared Bank.  In order to allow folks to transfer money between characters on the same account in the same way that they can now transfer items, we will be adding a spot in the Shared Bank for placing platinum. <br />
<br />
New filters and chat message options will be added.  We have separated pet melee messages into their own category.  You will be able to send them to whichever chat window you want, or filter them out completely in the Options window.  We have also added the ability to send /random messages to any chat window you'd like.  There is no option to filter these messages, however, to prevent any loss of the information in cases where it is needed (meaning, you can't claim that you didn't see the /random that you lost just to force a re-roll).<br />
<br />
New fletching recipes will be added.  We're adding a few new fletching recipes.  The resultant items will only be usable by Rangers that worship Karana, and will be comparable to their Tunare counterparts.<br />
<br />
Guktan Illusion will be implemented.  Yup, the long-awaited new illusions will be available.  While the old Illusion: Froglok spell is just as popular as ever, folks have been asking for an illusion based on the new Froglok models.  After our next update, both will be available.<br />
<br />
Adding summoned Burning Affliction items to the Magician's arsenal.  Four new summoned items with the new Burning Affliction focus ability will be introduced.  This rounds out the Magician's ability to create summoned focus items.<br />
<br />
/memspellset command will be added.  This new command will allow you to memorize the spell set you indicate (using the corresponding number) from the command line or from a hot button.<br />
<br />
Also, as a heads up to players that have created their own user interfaces for EverQuest, these are the interface files that we expect to change next week.<br />
<br />
EQUI_BankWnd.xml<br />
<br />
EQUI_BigBankWnd.xml<br />
<br />
EQUI_OptionsWindow.xml<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
My favourite bit:<br />
<br />
/memspellset command will be added.  This new command will allow you to memorize the spell set you indicate (using the corresponding number) from the command line or from a hot button.<br />
<br />
Cant wait for that =) Will make life much much easier on my laptop as well as just quicker in general (although I am running out of hotkey panels at the moment :P)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">mhm whats up in lavastorm then ? Najena been revamped ? Or new pocket dungeon in sol b ? any1 knows ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/random can be redirected to another chat window.<br />
<br />
Woot, no really WOOOT. /hugs EQ_DEVELOPER_01 (female preferred  :p ). Good bye casino spam. Sadly they can't filter it completely due to the probably massive whining and cheating during loot rolls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Woot more monkeydog borkage in SolC !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Now I can add my pet's DPS to my parses on those ridiculously long Aten  blob fights, and put those paladins to shame! Score!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yea, I'm loving the separate pet DPS. When I'm soloing I have battle spam on, I like to know which mob dog is attacking without having to press any buttons, but I turn spam off in groups, so it's a little more work (OK OK I know it's only one stroke of my /assist hotkey, but the less you have to do the better IMO).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Burning Affliction focus items...<br />
<br />
BUAHAHAH!<br />
<br />
*And a great shadow came across the Plane of Tactics, as Okotona asked the mage for the new focus items*<br />
<br />
I wonder if Mages will be our main supply for that focus now... No one likes PoTorment hehe ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">huh ? wheres the zone revamps they promised last month ? the delayed ones ... slackers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We will be adding platinum to the Shared Bank.<br />
<br />
WOOT<br />
<br />
Adding summoned Burning Affliction items to the Magician's arsenal.<br />
<br />
Double WOOT<br />
<br />
/memspellset command will be added.<br />
<br />
Triple WOOT!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Can't wait...finally another good thing coming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Woot on the new recipies :) Admit it, who is gonna have a stack of wormwood and a stack of froglock meat the day before the patch :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I seriously doubt they'll remember the illusion potion recipe for frogloks.</div></div><hr />

/memspellset command will be added. <br />
<br />
SWEET... DUDE...<br />
Now I can set up a listing of hotbuttons for swaping between Debuff, Poison Dots, &amp; Disease Dots that are only one button away.  Those 10 banks of 12 buttons are going to be getting a real work out in the near future.  Wont have worry if I should just have my debuffs up or which dots up.  <br />
<br />
Personal Note... Any one have listing of what number corrisponds to what spell in the INI fill?  Would be alot easier to edit change all those spell lists if I knew that.</div></div><hr />

bah that'a like slow mitigation, they did it so in the clutch you have to be quick with the memming.. <br />
<br />
quote:<br />
&quot;It was either random spell books closing or higher memorization times. We think this gives shaman a chance at memorizing a spell as opposed to taking it away completely&quot;</div></div><hr />
