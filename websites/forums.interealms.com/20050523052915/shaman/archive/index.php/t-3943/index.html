<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jestice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have determined the AC/HP vs Wis level that I am comfortable with for specific situations.  For groups where I find myself as the main healer I like to have my wis up to about 160 and often put on my bear suit to bump it higher.  For soloing I go pretty much the other way and get my AC/HP to their highest while dropping my wis down.  For normal groups  where I am the slower/buffer/backup healer I split the difference and put my wis at about 150.<br />
I also love to work on my melee skills - so often I find myself replaceing other items to make the difference.  So this leaves me with a full bag of gear that I swap out based on different situations.  This leaves me with a very full inventory prior to actually adventuring.<br />
My question to everyone is do you find that you keep a lot of gear on hand and switch out or do you pretty much have a set of gear that you use standard?  Looking at peoples magelo profiles I see a lot of people have bagged items - but how much do you use them, if at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I carry 2 sets of gear around--one bagged, and one I'm wearing.  I keep a HP/AC set, and a resist set at all times, as I never know when a raid might crop up.<br />
<br />
I have one bag and a couple of pieces allocated to extra gear.  When you can carry 7 or 8 10 slot bags, it's not that much.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I keep 2 weight reducing bags full of resistance and utility gear, with a couple wis items (I equip them while waiting to buff, then remove them for the raid, allows me to maybe get an extra buff off before chain canning).  most of the stuff is jewelry with 3 extra weapons and stuff.  I hold an inv spot for my black fur boots for sow and fighting outdoor debuffing mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have a bag (more than just a single bag actually) dedicated to resist items. As I get more resist all widgets, I'm slimming this down to hopefully use just a single 10 slotter (or less).<br />
<br />
I have a bag that is filled with food/water...sometimes 2-4 empty slots.<br />
<br />
I have a bag with miscellaneous stuff. Bat Wings, Fish Scales, Sebilis/Skyshrine/Charasis keys, Telescope, Pegasus Cloak, and 2 MR specific resistance pieces.<br />
<br />
I have a bag (not a 10 slotter) with my weapon swaps (Primal Cudgel, and Spear of Constriction).<br />
<br />
I need to get some more 10 slotters...2 of my bags are only 6, and it hurts me, combined with 1 main slot taken by my black fur boots, and 1 main slot empty (and which will stay empty). My bank account has never been up to the challenge of tinker bags, and I've never had any love as far as dragon bags. I hope to get a rallic pack soon, which will help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My shaman is a shameless twink, and I pretty much solo exclusively with him.  His equipment is mainly geared towards ac/hps, the only thing I really switch are his necklaces (medallion for normal use, amulet when casting buffs, regent symbol for snare if needed).  I carry a spear and shield around, but havent really used them much since lv 20 ish.<br />
<br />
My ranger on the other hand carries so much stuff he barely has a few slots free for loot hehe.  Most of it I actually use tho, the dex gear for archery, specific resist gear etc.  I always try to free up more room, but always end up thinking &quot;But what if xxx happens and I need it&quot;  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hrendra An'ei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">All of my characters have multiple sets of armor available. One reason is that I'm a tradeskiller, so I typically have very little available bank space, meaning I keep the &quot;raise INT/WIS gear&quot; on my actual person.  <br />
<br />
Probably the most gear dependent person is Hrendra, and she maintains both her normal AC getup and her resist gear. Keeping it in an Evil Eye bag is handy. She has very little room for loot, as she keeps spell components, sow potions, food, telescope, and so on with her at all times, plus leaving a main inventory slot free for CoS. I used to keep a variety of weapon types in there as well, but now that most of my skills are maxed or fairly high, I no longer do so. <br />
<br />
Hrendra having evil faction means I tend to travel with &quot;whatever I need&quot; because I don't know when I'm going to be close to a bank or city again. I suspect a lot of the evil shamans here are similar. <br />
<br />
Conversely, Hraina's the least concerned with swapping out her equipment. She has her optimal setup, and since she pretty exclusively quads for experience, she really doesn't need to change anything. If I ever planned to raid with her, I'd get resist gear, but for now she doesn't require it.<br />
<br />
Her bags are very easy to empty; if it wasn't for her carting tradeskilling stuff around, she'd easily have a bag of food, a bag of spell components, and nothing else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I keep a set of resist gear, two of some items depending on if I need CR/FR or DR/PR. I have a few Wis items in my bags I keep on me, but most of it I keep i the bank for when I make potions. I have my hammer from Overthere for when I need to gate, I carry around my mallet from Hate even though I know I'll never use it. I have one bag full of alchemy ingredients (DR, SoW, and Shrink) and a bearskin potion bag for combining them. One bag full of +1 wis food and bottles of milk, and last bag slot has black fur boots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I carry two bags. <br />
One is for Pve and the other PvP.  Now it really depends on how I feel if I want wis or AC.  My pvp gear has higher AC then some of my pve because of damn melees.  I use both sets and mix and match, just depends on the situation.</div></div><hr />
