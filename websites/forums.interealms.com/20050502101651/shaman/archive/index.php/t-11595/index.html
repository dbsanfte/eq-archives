<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Managed to solo a few guards and got my fangs, but they don't give stats in the ammo slot. A few people said they did before I went was this recently changed?<br />
<br />
While I was there I messed around soloing the entrance guys and guards. I bumped into Commander Zazuzh who HT'd me for 881 then him and his guard splatted me. I read he can drop a tan silk birdle so I may mess around and try to split him and kill. Other than this guy, is there anything else worth hunting solo in ssra?</div></div><hr />

Fang give stat only in range, never have gice in ammo.  Commander usully are for Emp ring quest, they drop differents item depending what camp you are.  Those snake hit pretty hard and run as th wolf, i know entry is easy to camp for a shaman, can't tell for the rest.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The bridle from comms is incredibly rare, on par with the CoF from Ixibat, I'm pretty sure that in the process of keying most of our guild for Emp, we havent seen a single one drop from him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>baddwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">All my Guild is Emp keyed and i never seen bridle drop once.</div></div><hr />

Seen one drop like the first 3 weeks luclin went live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I saw 2 drop at once off a comm2 I believe.  Out of all my commander camps however, that's the only time I've seen any drop.  Very rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My whole guild is Emp keyed and it has dropped 1 time.  Dont hold your breath.<br />
<br />
I remeber that the fangs used to give stats per fang so if you had a stack of 20 you got a huge stat boost but not sure if this worked in ammo or not.<br />
<br />
I do know they fixed that little bug</div></div><hr />
