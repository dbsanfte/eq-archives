<br />
Not bad for like 112 days played huh??<br />
<br />
But the real reason for this message is to tell you how excited I am about our new skill.  Bear Killer, Shaman Suicide Button, Cannibalize 5...<br />
<br />
and so it begins!  Ding AA point number 23.<br />
<br />

<br />
I am so happy!  12 wasted points on Mental Clarity.  So glad that is over!  Now, a skill I can USE!!<br />
<br />
45 minutes of judicious use later....<br />

<br />
Yeah, so focus faded.  With ~1800hps unbuffed...RH alone, just doesn't leave much of a buffer.  <br />
<br />
I laughed so hard I cried... and so did my friend who was with me at the time.  Fortunately she logged in her 60 cleric and rezzed me and gave me aego.  :)<br />
<br />
SO!!  How long did it take YOU to kill yourself with our Cannibalize AA skill.  Killing yourself on purpose doesn't count!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have yet to kill myself with Cann V. Then again I have the benifit of being over 1924 hps unbuffed even with res effects still up. Come pretty close a few times but never killed myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Think it was a week or so... then I killed myself 2x in one day. Never since then.<br />
<br />
1st time was NToV, we just started, I had wolf caller bp on instead of Vindi and buffs had worn off.<br />
<br />
Later that night in Fungus, I torpored and was going to Canni5 when I got full health, but I spaced it and did it at 60 health instead.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah there was another one where I had 2050 hp or so and pain and suffering hit me, but I'm chalking that one up to a bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The spirits, they are cruel.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure which ignominy is worse, Cann5ing yourself to death or being slain by a small mushroom. It was kinda a combination of both. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I just got Cann5 recently as well, and although I havent killed myself yet I can see how easy it might be to do. Now it is time for a gear overhaul to see where I can put HPs instead of wis, ac and resists. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">When I had Cann3, hitting the Cann macro (with /sit off) was how I stood up and moved around hehe.  Now that I have Cann4 that's quite a bit more painful to do unless you're really wanting to Cann at the time.<br />
<br />
Definitely have to break that habit before aquiring Cann5. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Havent killed myself yet, if theres mobs about I've gotten in the habit of torporing first too having gotten summoned due to low health aggro when getting used to the skill. I think I recall saying 'eep' but luckily it was one of those summon moments when the mob decides not to do anything once you arrive.<br />
<br />
I'm sure the first time it happens it will be a suitably naff mob that finishes me off :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah since my HPs in selfbuffs only are still pretty low I decided it would be best to torpor first always...which I did.<br />
<br />
........and still died.  lol.  at least it wasn't an orc pawn or something.  :p<br />
<br />
Gonna pickup some more HP gear this week, it's been in the plan just haven't felt the urgency until now.   And finish factioning chardok, the 2nd ring is waiting!<br />

No EQ for four weeks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vulgarr Disruptor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The absolute very first time i casted it, i had just zoned into ToV and started buffing..... Can5 took me to 1 bub of health and low hp got me immediately summoned and splattered. heheh too funny.... haven't directly killed myself yet, but low HP aggro is just as bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Batuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Jerry Springer got me killed!!  Seriously, the only time I died I got distracted because some strippers were on Springer or something...  I was in a boring camp and simply wasn't paying attention.  Canni5 got moved off my main page after that.<br />
<br />
Another thing I can credit Canni5 to is me totally going nuts over HP gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Lol That's so funny! ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Less than two bulbs + Angry slowed NToV Flurry across the room = low life agro + summon + judicious execution<br />
<br />
I've yet too actually kill myself in many weeks of use, but low life agro has gotten me at least once, I'm a lot more careful of it now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have a question for you folks.<br />
<br />
Does anyone ever cast the Lull/Sooth line on a mob after engadging.<br />
<br />
It is supposed to lower frenzy radius (The aggro you get on low health) to 1 foot.<br />
<br />
In otherwords no low health aggro. I popped Zenthiak with it on my enchanter a few days ago and even though She was at .5 bubbles she never got summoned. And Noone else did either.<br />
<br />
Try it. It seems to work. Clerics, Paladins, and enchanters all get the spell lines. And With a big mob properly debuffed it should land pretty easy.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hmm, messing with any large mobs aggro radius or aggro list when you're trying to keep it focused on one person is a bad idea imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I too, luckily can Canni5 without any buffs so I haven't killed myself yet. As long as I have my gear on, I am good to go.<br />
<br />
Just indirectly to low health aggro on the Aow using it is my only death I have to credit it with now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Canni BOOM BOOM!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Seredith,<br />
<br />
It isnt messing with thier list at all. Main tank will main tank still. It just causes the frenzy radies to be a foot.  If you are in that radius you will still get the frenzy (Low health) aggro but outside of that range you are golden<br />
<br />
<br />
Clear it with the main tanks. It isn't something that is well known because people all view the line to be worthless. Of course I remember a time when enchanters were all thought to be useless, and AC / HP gear got me laughed at on the Crucible.<br />
<br />
Try it. You might like having people think of you as a genious when it works.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Mallaur Bloodstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">So far I have been lucky :), I have had Canni 5 for about a month now and died once due to it. <br />
<br />
Was dotting a Named on a raid, and did a Torpor\Canni Boom (what I call Cann 5) went under 2 bulbs of health and summoned and promptly ate. LOL Laughed my arse off, first time I had aggro with it during a fight.  <br />
<br />
Just last night in DN I forgot to check to see if I had Aego on and did Canni Boom and knocked me to 32hps left reminds me of the good old days of Manastoneing to see how low you can get without dieing. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Krak0r</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Second day I had Can5 I hit it in the middle of a Vulak fight.  I got low hps agro and was flattened in half a second.  Good times, good times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Stonienogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">i killed myself with Canni5 twice, both times we were xp'ng in the plane of fear, both times i hit it after a run in with some glare lords or tentacle terrors and didn't think to check my buffs before i hit it. I don't have any screenshots here, but it sure was funny seeing...<br />
<br />
Stonienogg has been slain by Stonienogg!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sivilon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Just curious.. you take 1900ish damage from Canni 5.. how much mana do you gain?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Armageddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">1924hp -&gt; 1066 mana, if memory serves correctly.<br />
<br />
It has a 3-5 second cast time too, never looked at it, but it's not quite instant.  If you catch it, you can duck and abort, and the skill timer doens't even get fubared :)<br />
<br />
-A</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I got the skill and immediately put it on page 2 of my hotkeys, since then I've gotten quite handy with the Shift-2 keys . . . I check to see if it's up all the time when I'm hardcore exping.  It's part of my strategy to wind up at full hps, fully buffed, and ready to press the button when it ungreys.  If I'm currently tanking or expect to tank I'll have torpor on me by the time it ungreys.  <br />
<br />
HPs are the main thing I look for on gear nowadays.  I'm at 3975hps raid buffed lately.  Vindy bp added 164 hps to my total, man was that nice.  I've ditched so much wisdom adding gear that I'm below 200 again, operating at 190 unbuffed, which is ok, since KEI is nice and bearform is also good and total mana pool isn't that important when you're comparing it to whether I live or die by my own hand.  <br />
<br />
I've got a habit lately of carrying around a stack of dots for use in bribing lvl 60 clerics to aego me.  I'm quite the buff whore.   POTG is also nice, but harder to get it seems, and it doesn't add the same number of hps.    Heck, I'm even begging pallies for Brells when I can get it!  For some reason they are very generous with that spell, it gives me a warm feeling for those little blue boys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I'm always pretty careful with it...have about 3300 self buffed hp, so it's not that risky while solo'ing.<br />
<br />
Yet to die to it, had it for like 2-4 months (sense of time so small).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Shalara De'Tan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I have killed myself about a half dozen times.  /blush<br />
<br />
I've killed myself outright by simply not having enough hit points for it, and by getting low heath aggro (even though i cast torpor first 99% of the time!).<br />
<br />
Even though I have gone hp whenever possible, I don't have anywhere close to uber gear.  Without any buffs I have 1919hp. I've finally trained myself to check my buff status before hitting my c5 key, even when I am dual boxing. <br />
<br />
At least, I think I have trained myself, I haven't seen &quot;Shalara has been slain by Shalara!&quot; since the first week I had c5 ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Gikk the Unholy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Haven't killed myself, but....<br />
<br />
logged on a guildmate who has MGB and rebuffed everyone quick after an AoW screwup.  So i just stayed on him for the fight, and everything was going well until i forgot he has about 500 hps less then me....<br />
<br />
can5<br />
low health summon<br />
splat!<br />
<br />
We won the fight but uh, poor kaludan didn't live to see it =).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Kazlaaz Bonedust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">lol.. Sadly the minute I got canna5 I was making the hotkey for it and I somehow pushed it.<br />

*blush*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">heh, I managed to last a pretty long time without dying. First time I died I hit canni5 while fighting the king in chardok and he turned on me and kill me. Since then I've killed myself straight up with canni5 a few times, mostly when aego fades I don't notice :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Daeneil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">HAHAHAHAHAHA looks like I win this hands down.<br />
<br />
I died to cana5 within 5 minutes of acquiring the skill to test it.<br />
<br />
ALSO<br />
<br />
Died approximately 11 times one night in tov as solo shaman (no big deal there bcuz of slow aggro and flurry drakes BUT) 5 of those deaths were cana5 related and 1 OMFG<br />
<br />
1 of those deaths I was totally spaced out and got ressed back in and got spammed with buff requests instantly so went to hit can4 to get some mana to torpor myself and hit can5 instead.<br />
<br />
sooo what do I win? lol</div></div><hr />

Then I got res and since I wasn't kos to Kromrif I used cann skill, but apparently I didn't have my normal gear on and didn't have the 1924 hp to cover it. Boom. Curse that blue diamond resist gear I left on from the previous raid.</div></div><hr />
