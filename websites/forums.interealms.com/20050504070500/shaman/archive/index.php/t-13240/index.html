 Who knows where I can Find a Deep indepth History of Norrath? I'm not talking about the Trakanon prophacys and all that shiznic... <br />
not this stuff:  Norrath History (http://pub33.ezboard.com/f1stfistoflightfrm47)<br />
I want to know zone reasoning. Like why are undead roaming City of Mist? Why is &quot;Estate of unrest&quot; full of undead? Why is Kedge Keep in rewen? why are there no female Gnolls? hehehe (joking on that one). I think I know much of the history already but I don't know why some of the mobs are in the zone that they are in. SoE says that only 25% of the quests they put in the game have ever been completed. (There for only 25% of its History has been reviled... this is my guess.) But then again I hope that someone knows of a website that will tell me the complete history?   :confused:  :confused:  :confused:<br />

Thanks fellow shamans</div></div><hr />
