<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wereclown</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Are any of the guides advertised everywhere worth it?  I don't get as much time to play as I'd like, and a few legal tips on maximizing my time would be very welcome (and damn, I'm tired of being poor) but it seems to me that Verant would simply shell out the 20 bucks for these &quot;things that need to be nerfed&quot; guides.<br />
<br />
You are my fellow ShaMEN, guide me in this. :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In a word NO they are worthless. Those guides will not tell you anything that you do not already know. Like useing a DS when Pling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1. buy low<br />
2. sell high<br />
3. ???<br />
4. profit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wereclown</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Alas, I kind of figured.  Let me guess; the biggest secret is &quot;HGs in Rathe.&quot;  Oh, boy!<br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Most of the guides show things that used to work.  This is what others told me anyway, i've never actually looked at one.  You can probably find more useful suggestions doing a search on the board here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Alas, I kind of figured.  Let me guess; the biggest secret is &quot;HGs in Rathe.&quot;  Oh, boy!<br />

<br />
At low and mid levels, the biggest secret is farm trade skill components and sell em. <br />
<br />
At higher levels, the secret is finding a nice quiet camp somewhere that has decent drops to sell in the bazaar. ... but those spots only exist because people don't talk about 'em much. :D I don't solo much but I can think of a lot of places where a duo could average around 4k an hour by farming named mobs.</div></div><hr />

I put the link on the main page... (its in PDF format)</div></div><hr />

&quot;I know something you don't know, and I'm not telling.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heh.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">1. Collect Underpants<br />
2. ????<br />
3. Profit!<br />
<br />
That's how I did it.<br />
<br />
Meku, wannabe gnome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Meku = Underpant Gnome?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You are my fellow ShaMEN, guide me in this. :-)<br />
I guide you to correct plural usage of our class name!<br />
<br />
http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=shaman<br />
Inflected Form(s): plural shamans<br />
<br />
 :D<br />
<br />
And no, no printed guide will be worth a crap. Most of them aren't even accurate anymore because the game changes so rapidly, and they were printed before the expansion was on shelves most of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The best way to make money in the game is to make Tumpy's Tonics.<br />
<br />
And the easiest way to powerlevel is to do the shark meat quest in Kelethin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks for getting that Aselus.  I was about to, but then I saw your post.<br />
<br />
Shaman is not an english word, so it does not follow english pluralization and common rules.</div></div><hr />
