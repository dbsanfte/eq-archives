<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xawl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I heard some guy mention the other day that at level 53 he was hunting a place that only gave him 1/2% a kill and he complained that this XP was slow.<br />
<br />
What I want to know is, Is this guy nuts? I'm 52 right now hunting a spot where i'm getting constant 1/3-1/2% a kill and can pull them nonstop (one ebolt and dogdog does it). I consider this PREMIUM xp. Am I missing something? Is there some magic places where I can get 1% a kill and not risk mutliple deaths every mob?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xawl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">NOOOOO! Don't bury me under a pile of old threads!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">He's crazy, however if you're soloing and not hunting in pop zones these days, you may be hurting yourself.  Best solo xp I found non-pop was in HHK, but I'm pretty sure pop would blow this spot out of the water.<br />
<br />
However, if you only like to solo, and find group play repulsive (as I once did), by all means... solo onward my friend.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I tend not to measure XP per kill, but XP per hour.  When I soloed in POP in the high 50's I could get 2% per kill, but I'd have to med a LONG time afterwards and there was a large risk of dying.  I decided I'd be better off grouping and easily made 3-4 blues an hour grouped in PoN or PoD.  Not sure what this was per kill.<br />
<br />
The one other data point I remember having to do with XP per kill was at level 60, killing PoS desert trash in a full group.  I remember being amazed to notice that I was seeing almost 1% regular XP per kill there.</div></div><hr />
