<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shoa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, iv read a lot of postings here, some are really good and constructiv, but others are just whining around about Heals, Dots, Exp, Regen, the World, whatever.<br />
<br />
Has it become that bad? Do we never find Groups because a Bst is equivalent at Slows and does so much more dps? I really dont have problems finding a group.<br />
<br />
Sure there are some issues that have to be discussed, like where our Slow is going, faster damage (Disease Dots? Is anyone using them in regulation?) and Buffs that were very usefull at Kunark-Times but arent anymore now.<br />
<br />
But please stop whining around, it doesnt help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think it's helped so far. I don't always read the complaint threads, but they tend to prompt well thought out recommendations and petitions to Sony. And some of those resulted in changes to Q that I, for one, am very happy with - not to mention changing Plague of Daluda to Daluda's Mending.<br />
<br />
But if you don't like complaint threads... why did you start one yourself?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/em waits for the person to post commenting that the original poster is whining about whiners.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There goes their reputation points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shoa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">gnaa, got me :-)<br />
<br />
Your right, if recommendations result in changes like Daludas Mending or the Upgrade of Heal over Time Spells its a great thing. I didnt want to say that discussion or ideas from the community is a bad thing. I just dont want that the Shaman Community (which is good imho) will become what the Monk Community was some time ago.<br />
<br />
Now blame me and give me bad reputation points, i'v deserved it ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Shoa the community existed for years without too much complaining.  Oh certainly folks were unhappy about the fact that Buffs were not as important as we were originally led to believe or that Kunark spell drops were way too rare and caused our spells to be too expensive, but for the most the community was not too whiney.<br />
<br />
And as far as I am concerned the Monks are currently justified in complaining.<br />
<br />
One man's whine is another man's lobbying effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Its just a shame that the main board is a bit swamped with such posts, but I don't feel its without some justification. The changes to Daluda's mending, Nihil, Q, BoR etc are a case in point, as are the plans to give us some combat-effect type buffs rather than pure stat buffs in OOW.<br />
<br />
One thing mages have done is create a seperate forum specifically for class balance - not a bad idea imo. It would be nice to see the general discussion forum return to exactly that, whilst still having somewhere to discuss issues with the shaman class balance and usefulness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">But please stop whining around, it doesnt help<br />
- Balance of the Nihil was upped to 75% because of our whining.<br />
- Trushar and Quiescence were upped because of our whining.<br />
- We got a new heal instead of a new disease DoT because of our whining.<br />
- We will hopefully get at least a part of what this class needs because of our advance whining for OoW and our continued whining about GoD.<br />
<br />
If you want to continue to reap the rewards of our whining I suggest you do not interrupt our whining sessions with your whining about our whining.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Froggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Who else would like some cheese to go with all this Whine?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Previous poster answered how it does help, and it has helped tremendously just not enough.<br />
<br />
And getting groups is not the primary concern of shaman. Please read through the posts no one wants a bigger heal because of xp groups. We want bigger heals because of non trivial content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Actually getting groups is a concern of a lot of us, because it makes more sense to get a beastlord or enchanter than a shaman in even older content now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Froggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">FPick up groups anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I thought Shoa was saying that while some posts are &quot;good and constructive,&quot; some are just whining.  I read that as arguing that tone makes a difference.  It's not that the content of your post is verboten -- i.e. that we don't want to see a post arguing that shaman are under powered.  The point is that the tone of many of the posts is not helpful.  Some of this comes from months and months of frustration, and is understandable.  But it is counterproductive nonetheless.<br />
<br />
I'm not certain that I'd use the term whiney to describe them, as it does not capture the essence of why they are objectionable.  Whiney works as a description for some, but is off for many.<br />
<br />
Hence it is not responsive to say &quot;But our whining got us lots of good results, and we want more.&quot;  I'd presume that your *arguments* got you good results, in spite of the climate created by the &quot;whining&quot;.  Presentation matters.  Attitude matters.<br />
<br />
I support (and have suggested before) the idea of creating a separate section for Class Balance, Fixes, and Future Plans for the Shaman.  Might help lighten the overall tone in the general section, and place our many problems into perspective.   <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Warren Maguson Emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The question you need to ask yourself is, at what point does constructive posting become whining?  It's all a matter of debate and subjective opinion anyway.  Even the most constructive of posts can be interpreted as whining.  <br />
<br />
&lt;shrugs&gt;<br />
<br />
If it works, I'm just glad someone else did it. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Here's what it would take me to stop being upset with shaman deficincies.<br />
<br />
- Up Tnargs to 1500~ and Daludas to 2k<br />
- give us Khuras Mending (3.5k heal/75%/10sec cast)<br />
- make dogdog have innate duelweld and bump his HP so he would win in a duel with a lvl39 SK pet.<br />
- fix dot aggro, especially poision.<br />
- lower cast time on VS and up damage on poison nukes.<br />
- Have a AA slow with a heavy neg MR (-200+) but long recast.  This allows us to make sure that when something needs to be slowed now, the shaman will be the one to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Usually constructive posts become whines at one of 2 points.<br />
<br />
1) someone doesn't agree with it.<br />
2) the 1 line comments start flying.<br />
<br />
At either of those 2 points is where someone no longer considers it constructive, but whining.<br />
<br />
And regretable, there's always going to be some lump, that doesn't agree, just to be onery.<br />

Yup must say ive noticed this when playing my ranger people would rather get a Bst or Enc even for BoT etc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">i haven't noticed any problem with finding or getting groups whenever I want one.  I know that a few guildees have expressed that they would rather have a beastlord sometimes for mana regen, but not to the point where they would specificly not invite me to the group just cause i'm a shaman.</div></div><hr />

Difference is you're their guildmate.  I bet if you offered to bring in an alt (assuming that alt was at the same or better level of gameplay your shaman is) they'd prefer that.  I feel bad for SOME shamans looking for a PoE or LDoN hard pickup group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Only thing I want to whine about today is people calling us 'shamys'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The squeaky wheel gets replaced. =\<br />
<br />
I wonder if there are any openings in Kelethin for more drunkards?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I think that it is important to understand that the whining (and there is plenty of that), is very specific, very focused whining, and whining from a very specific segment of the Shaman community. It is important to bear in mind that the specific thing (or things) about whih they are whining may not effect you or your game play at all. And the fact that you do not think that you are being penalised by that about which these people are whining, does not mean that they are unjustified in whining.<br />
<br />
It is unfortunate, but demonstrably true that he squeaky wheel gets the oil. If the shaman community does not whine, nobody else is going to whine on our behalf. and those of you who think shaman don't need fixing, you will when you get to where the whiners currently are. Me - I am very happy with where my shaman is at, but so was the man who jumped off the Empire State Building, as he passed the 42nd floor, but the ground was waiting for him all the same...</div></div><hr />
