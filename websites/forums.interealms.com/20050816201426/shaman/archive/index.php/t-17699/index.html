<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The most recent patch indicates that there is now a message indicating when channeling focus has been used successfully.  <br />
<br />
Has anyone seen this message?  What is the text?  <br />
<br />
I would really like to know, so that I can check my log to see how often it works for me. I did a quick scan of my log, but not knowing what to look for (and the annoyingly frequent occurance of the words &quot;focus&quot; and &quot;channel&quot; in my log) made it something of a fruitless search.<br />
<br />
So:  Anyone know the text of the message?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Channeling Focus was not giving bards the proper reduction to the chance of missing a note.  It is now fixed and gives messages to indicate when it is has helped. <br />
<br />
Doesn't really make it clear if the message was just for bards or for everyone with channeling focus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Doesn't really make it clear if the message was just for bards or for everyone with channeling focus.<br />
<br />
think for bards only. the message is 'You almost miss a note but you recover just in time.'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That message makes no sense!  How do you almost miss a note but recover just in time?  The message should have said &quot;You miss a note but nobody noticed so you continue to play&quot;...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmmm, why for bards only?  Don't I as a caster deserve to know if my one-in-a-million chance of channeling actually occurs? (...so that I can go buy a lottery ticket.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We get one, its something like &quot;you regain your concentration and continue casting&quot;. That is the message we get when we manage to channel through something that had a chance to interrupt our casting. Everyone has a chance to channel through a possible interrupt but our channeling skill and channeling aa increase that chance.<br />
<br />
I am assuming bards did not get a message like that when they managed to continue playing their instrument through something that had a chance to interrupt them, now they do.</div></div><hr />

Thats a natural ability, i think they are talking about AA check bud</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you miss a note and recover in time, its called Jazz!<br />
<br />
One of my Jazz playing buddies described it as &quot;If you play a wrong note, smile and play it again, makes people think you meant it&quot;</div></div><hr />

Hmm Litgruv i think he could be right as when bards f%%k up it says something like their song is brought to an end by a missed note.<br />
There again who cares :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well reganing your casting in a natural ability, i think what some poeple were saying is that fro non-bards we should get a message that lets us know out AA focus check was hit.<br />
<br />
I might have read it wrong though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Basically what I was looking for was confirmation that our AA chenneling focus ability was visibly doing something.  While I'm aware we do get a generic channeling message, there is no way to tell if the successful channeling was because of the AA, or because of our natural channeling ability.  I'm fairly convinced that this ability does absolutely nothing for us.  I've got CF2, and I've not noticed any increase in the ability to channel (but its hard to tell, because even if it was working we'd never really know).</div></div><hr />
