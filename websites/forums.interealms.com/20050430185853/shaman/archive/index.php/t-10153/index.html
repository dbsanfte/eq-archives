<br />
I just dinged 52, and I have a question or two about duoing. <br />
<br />
Up until recently, my main playtime has been devoted to my 60 chanter, but I got bored with her and decided to re-create the shaman I deleted about a year ago when I &quot;quit&quot; EQ. My friend has a 55 wizard and a mid-40s monk. I've been mostly pairing with the monk, but I've sort of outlevelled him now so grouping in places that will give me decent exp but still allow him to be an effective partner has dwindled. Right now our playstyle is usually me tanking the mobs &amp; tossing dots while he &amp; dogdog beat on the backs of them. He doesn't seem to think the shammie/wizard duo would do very well.<br />
<br />
Soo.. my question is, which partnership would be the most effective in the long run? Should I hold back on my levelling and let him catch up with the monk? Get a few more levels and duo with the wizard? <br />
<br />
Anyone have much experience duoing with a wizzie in the 50s? <br />
<br />
Will a monk/shaman duo even work in PoP zones with the mobs hitting as insanely hard as they do? Right now I can solo in the 1st tier planes fairly well, as long as they don't touch me. Would we be stuck in old world/Kunark places like Chardok/Seb/HS? (not that I mind terribly, I still enjoy those places immensely) <br />
<br />
Would appreciate any thoughts/comments =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>malden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think you would do ok in Tier 1 planes with a monk shaman duo. I've gone with guild shamans with my monk to PoN before and had no problems. Of course that was a 56 monk and a 61 shaman. :) <br />
<br />
As for the wizard, shaman duo, I'm not sure how well they would work together in PoP but I think that there is always something that can be done.</div></div><hr />
