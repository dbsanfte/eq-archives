<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The first time I tried soloing in chardok was at 56 and the xp seemed decent enough. Nothing like CoM was in my early 50s but good enough to keep me happy when tired of grouping.<br />
<br />
This week I've been to chardok on 3 separate occasions and was amazed how god awful the xp is at 58 even though 95% is still dark blue. I soloed, duoed with a mage and trio'd with pally/druid and each time my xp barely moved after killing tons of spawns. When I was soloing I killed 2 sets of spawns up to the castle which is about 16 mobs and my xp moved hardly a pixel. Compare that to the hole where I can get 1/2-3/4 of a blue from killing two sets of 5 past the entrance(1 roamer, 4 static including the xp rich rock golem).<br />
<br />
Not sure what is going on here. Chardok is way under populated with PoP out and has a good XP modifier and most everything is dark blue. But man, at 58 the xp is almost non existent. The mage, pally and druid all mentioned the same thing. I was there nearly two hours with the pally and druid and I barely made 1/5 of a blue and we even pulled from the castle.<br />
<br />
This is all normal xp, no AA.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Go deeper.... thats the key.<br />
<br />
Go down and do the bank area, or near Niblik... thats where the bigger mobs are who give the juicy exp.<br />
<br />
Fighting the castle, where 90% of the mobs are 44-46 just doesn't give that much experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the mobs in the mines are 55 to 57,  gonna be  a good grp to survive down there!<br />
<br />
actually that the iksar skellie...the sarnak PH mobs were blue to lvl 55<br />
<br />
So yeah maybe a good spot, just pain to get down there!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yesterday, soloed the 8 mobs from zone in to gatehouse, about 60-75% blue at 59.<br />
<br />
4 hours gained me 4 blues.   Not quite group PoP experience but easy and soloable.  I was doing 8 fights in the 19 min 30 sec before respawns using hasted/harnessed Alpha pet (gnoll lariats) tanking for me while I stood back and used epic dot and jbb for damage. <br />
<br />
I only sat to change spells.  I would pull with slow, sic pet, epic dot, then alternate jbb and can 4, periodically I would kragg myself for mana regen, or the pet to keep it kicking.</div></div><hr />
