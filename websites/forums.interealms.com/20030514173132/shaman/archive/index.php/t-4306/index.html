<br />
I've got Black Dire's pelt in the bank, I'm about ready to buy the port to EJ (Would have already had them, but I absolutely HATE paying someone to take me someplace) to turn it in and get my boots. I've also been looking at upgrading my gear, and see a pair of JB boots for sale in the Bazaar for 700PP. Now I know the JB  gear has to be equipped to trigger the effects, but I thought I read in a thread that the Black Fur Boots just have to be in one of your 8 main inventory slots to be able to click and use. Can anyone give me confirmation on this, and advise me on buying the JB boots and having both, or just sticking with the Black Fur ones?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.<br />
