<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mimoza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just hit 62, and quickly scribbed my spells before I yoyo down :p<br />
<br />
now, Tnarg's Mending... 1300 hp for 450 mana, 3.7s, or Chloroblast (428hp for 175mana, 3s)?<br />
<br />
Tnarg is better ratio, and much faster than Kragg...<br />
<br />
where and when should I mem this? I really dont feel like having 4 heal spells memmed (chloro, tnarg, kragg and torpor)<br />
<br />
I always have torpor and chloro memmed. When I am the main healer in a group, I add kragg.<br />
<br />
where should I put tnarg?<br />
<br />
thanks for your advices )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slissia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Have never used chloro since I got Tnarg's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Swap out chloro for Tnarg's for the love of god! ;) hehe  Seriously, tnarg's is an awesome spell. Never again, will I use chloro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tnarg's replaces Chloroblast.<br />
<br />
Haste of Mithaniel brings Tnarg's casting time back down to 3.0, same as Chloroblast unmodified. It's enough to make you think that SOE shortened buff durations and lengthened cast times just to make up for our AA abilities. Rather than benefitting from AA, we just end up working harder to get the same effect we got for free before. Torpor is a nice exception though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i strictly use tnarg's.  especially with spell haste items/bor and improved healing aa/items its way better than the long cast of kraggs or the very weak hp gain (especially in pop) of chloro.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Try doing a HoT raid with a non-raiding guild of about 15-18 people, ranging from lvl 62-54ish, always short on healers and tanks. Me, main shaman, lvl 62 malo/slowing all mobs, usually main healer in group is a druid, and when I get aggro from a bad pull and slowing/trying to slow all mobs, I get aggro. Then, since I've gotten aggro the druid decides to heal me, since it's their job as main healer. Now they are lvl 60ish+, but why are they healing me with CHLORO instead of their lvl 58 heal spell??? <br />
I never understood this, but maybe they expect me to heal myself as their are 3 mobs in camp, and usually if I haven't slow'd it, I'm chain casting slows until it lands, starting with MT then moving on to adds.<br />
<br />
Use Chloro for PL'ing someone, but since it will take you about 2.5 casts of Chloro vs. 1 cast of Tnarg, I'd use Tnarg from now on. Especially if you have to play spot healer in emergency situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>thevolcanogod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wow, HoT with 15-18 people level 54-62 short on healers and tanks and you keep 3 mobs in camp?<br />
/boggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rebelheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">usually I load tnarg, Kragg, and Q if I am main healer; if I am<br />
back up healer I load Q and Tnarg, anything less just cant keep up PoP mob's damage</div></div><hr />
