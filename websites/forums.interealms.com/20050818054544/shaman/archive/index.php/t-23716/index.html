<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I looked at WoW, and well, wow.  But I'm just now starting to look at EQ2 as well, and even though I'm not satisfied with the state of EQLive, this game is just stunning.<br />
<br />
Many of the things I wanted to see in EQLive are in EQ2 and I'm just amazed.  If any of you get a chance to watch a few of the movies on the various websites, do so.  You'll look at WoW and it's cartoonish graphics and just shrug.<br />
<br />
Given that a good portion of us here on these boards loathe SoE at this point, it's not wonder that there is little information about EQ2 here.  So I just thought I'd toss this site (http://clanwhitestorm.com/eq2info/index.htm) out there to anybody who was interested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">&quot;cartoonish graphics&quot; - every time I see that I laugh.  One, because everybody uses exactly the same adjective.  Two, because I think EQ2 looks stark, entirely too clean, and soulless.<br />
<br />
The only thing I've heard about EQ2 so far is that you need a group to accomplish anything.  Won't get a chance to play it myself till this weekend, but it sounds like SoE is up to the same ol crap - focusing less on fun and more on control.<br />
<br />
With that said, I HOPE the game is fun, but I'm not holding my breath.  Especially since WoW is already a guaranteed buy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aekhold</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I advise you http://everquest2.station.sony.com LaughingWoman to make yourself a real opinion about EQ2 :)<br />
You're hearing false rumors, I'm on the beta since a bit more than 2 weeks and have hardly grouped 2 or 3 times, with friends. In EQ2 no chain killing mobs, making quests makes your xp bar increase much faster, solo quests, group quests, instanced dungeons... for now it seems really nice and fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't have any interest in a game developed by a company that considers the EQ1 Devteam competent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Considering that EQLive was developed over 5 years ago with the intent of lasting not longer than a year, it's incredibly impressive that it's held up this long.  Not to mention the fact that it has changed developers.<br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is this.  EQLive was not created with the intent to last as long as it has.  Combine this with the fact that there are hundreds of thousands of customers, all with different goals and priorities, and a small but important population of people who chew through content in a matter of months, keeping everybody happy while at the same time providing something challenging AND interesting is extremely difficult.<br />
<br />
We may hate Sony, but many of the problems today aren't so much problems they have created so much as they are problems brought about by an outdated overstretched game model - one that is unable to meet the many demands of its customers with the expediency and efficiency they desire, while still turning a profit for Sony.</div></div><hr />

An interesting comment. Brad McQuaid (Aradune Mithara) co-founder of Verant, the original producer of EQ, had a multi-year vision when game was first released.  Here's one of his web-chats that came out over two years after the game released discussing how it still has a lot of life in it: http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000242.html<br />

Here's hoping they're not going to rely on the &quot;outdated-before-it-originally-released&quot; SWG engine (which the screenshots for EQ2 look quite similar to).  The daily 2 hour shutdown of each gameserver to reset their poorly designed database engine cured me of Star Wars Fever quite quickly.</div></div><hr />
