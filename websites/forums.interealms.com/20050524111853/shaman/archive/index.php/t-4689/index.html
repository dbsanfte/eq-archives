<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Did a search on alchemy AND regrowth and got nothing useful, but I'm sure I saw it somewhere, anyway, here's the question.<br />
<br />
Do any of our alchemy made regen potions stack with our regrowth spell?<br />
<br />
I recently did a herbie camp in chardok and figwort was dropping like rain, so since its the most expensive component to a regen potion I made a few at almost no cost.  Too bad they were trivial :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They all do.  Darned short duration, though. <br />
<br />
IIRC Greater Rejuvenation potion is 40 points tick, drops STR (about 25) and has an atk slow component.<br />
<br />
It *is* cool, though, to get 55 pts/tick of regen.  You fungi-wearers with 70 pts/tick can go elsewhere to gloat please. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks Shandy.  Since the potion's basically only costing me 2 pp to make (as the expensive herbs came free), the duration isn't really a factor.  I was only hoping to lower downtime on some camps and this seems to do the trick.  Thanks :)</div></div><hr />
