<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ridgey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi Guys! :-)<br />
<br />
I play a female iksar that is just about lev 65 and I have noticed that my 61 pet keeps missing in the 2nd plus tiers. I don't just mean a hit, a few misses..  I mean it keeps missing. I've tried it with weapons, armour, buffs, but nothing is working.<br />
<br />
Just wondering if anyone else is noticing it and even more important if your an iksar. Possible bug with the race or something, I am at a loss.<br />
<br />
Thanks guys!  ;)</div></div><hr />

Pet is the same for all races.  Our pet just sucks at hitting things I guess...on LDoN hard missions my pet misses probably 75% of the time it seems (anecdotal).  I just summon him out of habit more than anything, he isn't going to make or break any fight or adventure.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is some pretty good info on our level 61 pet here and its usefulness here:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">One funny thing I noticed, you seem to see more misses in your chat box if you sit farther away from the fight. Move closer and you see more hits. I noticed this while soloing with my 49 pet. The mobs health does continue to go down with just the pet tanking even when you see lots of misses. I just wrote it off to a text bug. <br />
I'm using the 61 pet now and still *seem* to see more misses when I'm farther away. Of course the mobs he's tanking are much tougher to hit and it should be no surprise that our pets do not make as big a contribution as some other classes pets can.<br />
I got so used to it, I stopped paying attention. Maybe there's something to it maybe there's not. Be interesting to hear if anyone else noticed that too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye, the puppy can be inconsistent. To get it outta the way, I've got the 61 pet and I always give him 2 daggers unless there's a friendly mage around somewhere who'll summon toys for him. At any rate, growing him helps sometimes, whereas others, a cast of one of our cripple-line spells helps. Sometimes, regardless, it seems like it's just random. One DB mob he'll chew up and spit out, hitting max on his off hand and his primary ... other DB mobs (same mob, even) he'll miss the whole fight and come trotting back with a grin on his face. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>herkybevo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They put a Pet Misses Filter into our options yesterday.  Now we have the option to watch our pet miss or not.  Its found under  Options...General and should be the bottom button.  Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

Solo a mob, moving away and in, its a text bug.  Misses have a longer 'range' than hits.  Gotta be close to doggie to see the hits but you can see the misses from farther.   VERY annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ridgey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Maybe that is it.... I'm to far away to see the hits?<br />
<br />
Thanks guys I'll look into it further :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">With the introduction of the new pet misses filter, I found my setup had defaulted to &quot;pet misses&quot; being on, but &quot;pet hits&quot; being off.<br />
<br />
Thus, all I ever got was pet misses messages. Turning on the &quot;pet hits&quot; filter send things back to normal - and switching off &quot;pet misses&quot; radically reduced the spam :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The range to see hits, is shorter that to see misses.  As you get further away from pet, you will get where you no longer see hits, but still see the misses.  So at this distance, all you will see are the pets misses.  Just poor coding that they made the ranges different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">people play with pet hits and misses on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I turned it on for a day just like I did when the dot damage filter was put in .... its all turned off now .. .who needs more spam to the client =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shamus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">FA does wonders to increase the pets chances of connecting with a mob in my experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>dmuscat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Pet hitting from behind has a much better chance of connecting, tank a mob and watch your pet hit consistently from behind.</div></div><hr />
