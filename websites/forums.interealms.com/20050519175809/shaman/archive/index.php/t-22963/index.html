<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">1.  Fix Shaman healing! We need larger, more efficient single target blast heals to deal with GoD mobs as well as group heals (perhaps group HoT is more in line with our class) to help in raid situations (MGB Option would be very helpful).  [currently being evaluated]<br />
2.  Improve shaman DPS and burst DPS.  [currently being evaluated]<br />
3.  AE Malos or lose the insane recast delay on Malos. [currently being evaluated]<br />
4.  Make FA less of a hassle, 25 minute duration, 5 second recast.  [currently being evaluated]<br />
5.  An upgrade or addition to Cannibalization, allowing (at the same ratio), greater or more frequent conversions of HP to Mana. [currently being evaluated]<br />
6.  Add direct combat effects to all of our level 60+ stat buffs. [currently being evaluated]<br />
7.  Reduce DoT aggro!  [currently being evaluated]<br />
8.  Endurance regen buff.  [currently being evaluated]<br />
9.  Reduce the cost of alchemy components.  [currently being evaluated]<br />
10.  MGB Shrink.  [currently being evaluated]<br />
