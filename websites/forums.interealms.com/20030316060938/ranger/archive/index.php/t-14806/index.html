<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sarkaukar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How many rangers forgot they had WS after they became Warders?  About 25% used, whereas the other 65% would of saved me from taking an unnecessary dirtnap(due to bad pull/saving chanter/cleric aggro :) ), while the other 10% would not have mattered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Arthemis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">To be honest I am not so sure what you really want to say in that post, but anyways...<br />
<br />
I am happy to have  WS and I very much would like to see Trueshot and WS on a seperate refresh cycle. I can't see it unbalancing the game too much, because the refresh time would still be more than an hour. WS is very handy when pulling a mob, to give the MT and the clerics time to set themselves up in certain situations, and it saved my Ranger bum several times. All in all, we Rangers are only Speedbumps like my guildmaster says :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Taewedar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I love WS, saved me more times then I can count. I hate choosing between WS or Trueshot on raids as well. Hell I still think they should be on different timers and there should be an aa to reduce the reuse timers on them :)<br />
Then again I'd also like a melee discipline offensive disciplines so I would be useful when geometry fubars archery.<br />
<br />
&lt;== is greedy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sarkaukar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">(chuckles)  I did ask how many forgot they had it to use when they hit lvl 60.  Was wanting to hear others that had done the same thing.  The percentage is the number of times I have used it compared to when I forgot to use it and should of (numbers are not large ie 3x used compared to not using it, 8x when I should of been used and 1x when it would not have mattered.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Daesun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I used to forget on occasion, and kicked myself afterwards... :)<br />
<br />
Nowadays I have a nice big BRIGHT RED hotkey saying SHIELD that reminds me when it's really late at night and my brain's gone fuzzy....<br />
<br />
In times of trouble, press the happy red button.  The happy red button is good.  Give the button your love.<br />

:) <br />
<br />
hehe, aye.  Tis another reason for this post.  I had to kicked myself a few times too.<br />
<br />
(bootie still pains)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Feeldary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i can t forget WS coz i'm nearly always tanking</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've only been 60 a couple of weeks, and have yet to use it. Only took one &quot;dirtnap&quot; due to that, c'est la vie... (or mort, as the case may be).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Telloran Treehugger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've only been saved by it once. I'm sure the clerics in the guild appreciate the 18 seconds when they have to camp out after all of our tanks get mowed over on a raid though. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Medain Valacirca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Weaponshield is the real /disc. Trueshot just requires too many variables to be effective whereas WS does what it is supposed to everytime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>timcooper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i have weaponsheilded once dead<br />
AOW pasted me one and i hit disc, found my self at bind and then said disc ended /sigh.<br />
But to be immune from melee from the front for 20 seconds is awesome.<br />
WS + thurg gate potion = evac</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>zmek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">after hitting 60 over the course of the next 5  days i saved my life and that of my hunting party 5 times. That event caused me to obsess about WS.   I probably will never use trueshot again unless on some  big raid.  I cant count how many times it has save my life.  of course i had a big problem accidantly hitting when either tracking or sitting (because the hot key fell between those two). SO now i keep the window open where you make the hot keys and my cursor hanging over it.  I love WS so much that i am constanly /disc ing to find out if i have WS or how long untill it back.  Also the WS/gate thing has saved me a few time form nasty CR when soloing. So i pretty much never forget to use it , But hitting the disc a few seconds late and twirling my weapons at the soulbinder is a differnt story altogher HEHE<br />
<br />
Zmek</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Daesun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I set my weaponshield icon to look something like this:<br />
<br />
&lt;table border=2&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;b&gt;SHIELD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;<br />
<br />
Seems to stand out somewhat so I don't misclick.  I also moved it to slot 8 on all my hotkey banks, so even if I manage to switch banks (sometimes I mess up and press shift-6 instead of 6 when I'm trueshotting and strafing), pressing 8 will always trigger the magic wizzy-blades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tuvan Truearrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Heh...I used on my first trip to NToV and saved the raid!<br />
<br />
Somehow we pulled 2 flurry drakes down.  Somehow I was number 3 on the agro list for both of them.  Got them to forget about all the clerics camping and wizards running in circles panicing.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>sylvaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've used weaponshield more then I have trueshot once I got 60.  Just the other day me and an old friend who started a cleric were camping fragments and she got interrupted during the CH, i hit weaponshield as I had 4 hp left and lived.  Also during my trial in PoJ the tank died and celric was oom when the executioner was at like 15% hit weaponshield and gave the casters enough time to nuke him to death thus saving the trial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Nanashi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I am a big proponent of weaponshield but lately on raids I find myself using trueshot more and more often. We each have our jobs and ranger's is to cause as much damage as we can while requiring minimal maintenance. If you have to use /disc weap, your raid mates have failed in their jobs already. They have to learn, sometime the hard way. Those heroics do make up for some nifty screenshots, however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Furious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I use WS everytime I pull the emp in ssra, this is an amazing ability we have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Eldril Mystwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Believe me, Since dinging 60, I havent forgotten about Weaponshield. Once I see my health under 1 bub, my finger is over the WS button. I *DID* however swap my WS and TS buttons at one time. That only took 2 foul ups before I had it straight. 1st Foul up was fighting the Enraged Golem in fear. Pull was Inc, I had a clear shot lane, &quot;eldril deftly twirls his weapon(s)&quot;. /bonk. The 2nd Mistake was just the opposite. MA goes down on a raid, I throw a snare and a TW on the mob to take over as the MA... health gets down to 1 bub &quot;Eldril's bow crackles with natural energy&quot;. LOADING, PLEASE WAIT .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Delyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">hehe<br />
<br />
I used to forget and kick myself as well...<br />
<br />
Then I would hit it by accident at a stupid time when I was tired /sigh.<br />
<br />
NOW  (that I have had it for months lol) I don't forget it &lt;G&gt;<br />
<br />
It's saved my bacon (and guild raids and groups) on many occassions. /chuckle My favorite has been the time a Dozekar pull went wrong, the MT went down nearly instantaniously and I taunted him and engaged =) saved a wipe /cheer the rangers<br />
<br />
/hugs weaponshield</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Heliograz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I love Weaponshield sooo much. When MT goes down on an AoW raid and you are next on the hate list /boggle, its fun to stand there and brag that you are tanking AoW while another Tank taunts the big fella off of ya.<br />
<br />
All my toon's auto-riposte disc are named SHIELD and in the same number 8 Hotkey as my Ranger =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>SolipsisSaVatar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">One time in PoN we were camping the FD spiders and had one of the matriarchs, chanter went down ffrom a slow resist, cleric was lom and cut a cheal too close so MA died towards the end of the fight, then the cleric right after. Ends up being just me and our SK puller and he is dying faster than I can pull aggro off him and he goes down.<br />
Popped the WS disc and went to town on the spider, I had just barely 3 bub health left when it died.<br />
I got about 2 blue xp if I remember correctly.   I'm not sure because I was too excited at seeing the ding 61 message!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sarkaukar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Sweet.<br />
<br />
Well, to add to my original post, our guild was doing Statue in Kael when the MT went down towards the end.  Statue turned and enraged, taking out all the melees except for one warrior and 3 rangers,  two who hit WS (other one was using bow).  Talk about a rush, aye Elwin :)?   Especially after the spam of death messeges :) and we were still alive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Grimmace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Weaponshield owns.  I use it all the time, but only pull out TS for big raid style mobs.</div></div><hr />

Got a good laugh out of that one ;)  You're my new hero.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Celt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Weaponshield rules :P  From raid utility (tanking raid targets initially with high agro spells, until the support classes can debuff, then jolting off when ws is about to expire) to my own personal evac (weaponshield, keep mobs in front of you, thurg gate potion = every time unless you are getting nuked down), weaponshield gets it done.  I cant forget about the discipline, however due to some latency issues sometimes I do find myself deftly twirling my weapons in the Nexus after I respawn at my bind :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
*sigh* Your guild needs to learn that *everyone* turns off attack for a second or 2 when the uber_mob_01's hp bar hits 11%.<br />
The MT HAS to turn off attack and thus theres a good chance of some non-jolting-blades ranger or lazy rogue grabbing agro and turning the mob around and creating a spam of death messages.<br />
Keep your finger over the 'atack on/off' button right around enrage time. (My attack button is the 'END' button, right over the UP arrow key, so its real easy to turn on/off.)<br />
<br />
Oh, and back on subject..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Elwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Guild knew that.. as Sarkaukar said, the MT died very suddenly, hit Enrage and spun around. This all happened in a less than 1 second. Due to human reaction time differencies and latency, not everybody reacted quickly enough. I was one of like 5 melee classes that survived it. Sark and I thought no tanks were left alive, but alas one of our Warriors were still good. Weaponshield rocks. :)</div></div><hr />
