<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, please don't laugh at me but I just dinged 48 (My highest level toon), and at some point I think I may want to venture into the new Planes such as PoD or PoN. Can someone tell me how I can access these zones. I mean do I need to get flagged to access them, or can I just port in somewhere ? <br />
Any help would be appreciated. <br />
Thanks in advance from Storm, the scaly pimp !<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">With PoP, everyone is able to access the following zones without any sort of key/flag/quest:<br />
<br />
PoK - plane of knowledge<br />
PoT - plane of tranquility<br />
<br />
PoJ - plane of justice - to access, zone into PoT and run straight out from the building, up and to the left you will see a huge, golden scale on the wall, click the scale to zone in<br />
<br />
PoN - plane of nighmare - this one is complicated to describe, zone in from POT and go out of the building and left until you hit the water.  Follow the water until you reach a clump of buildings, then you have to wind your way through the buildings until you see a low, wooden sculpture, click it to zone in (get a guide the first time you try to find it)<br />
<br />
PoD - plane of disease - zone in from POT, leave the building and go straight and to the right, there is a big, brown, nasty looking, fountain looking thing, jump in to zone<br />
<br />
PoI - plane of innovation - as if you were going to PoN, follow the water until you see a huge windmill, go in the windmill and go to the back.  From the back, look forward and there are two huge gears, one is moving and one is still, click the still one to zone in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cateye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Access to those zones is not a problem, just take the portstone from PoK to PoT, from there you can access the 4 tier 1 zones.<br />
Your problem will be that you cannot solo there at your level and no group will take you... but good luck anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>WalkNot SoSoftly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">PoN and PoD require a quick little convo with some NPC's in PoT if I recall.<br />
<br />
Dont recall if PoI needs the same or not. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No they don't.  If those are the same ones I'm thinking of, those NPC's are for further flagging - Crypt of Decay, from the former Bloodsaber outside the PoD entry, and the Hedge quest from Thelon (which gets access to Terris Thule).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cateye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That conversation is not needed to enter these zones, it's only needed for events in these zones, Grummus / Hedge Maze (for TT lair access).<br />
In other words these conversations just generate pre-flags for bigger flag events.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hail,<br />
<br />
Don't feel bad dear!<br />
I laugh at my own ignorance all the time. :D  I had to ask these exact same questions my first time in Plane of Tranquility.  So do most people. :)<br />
<br />
You may want to look at EQmaps or EQatlas to get a better feel for the geography your first time in.<br />
<br />
Also, be ready to get laughed at if you try to find a non-guild group in any of the Tier1 zones while still in your upper 40's.  It is a sad truth that many people can be very cruel, and level-dependent arrogance &amp; snobbishness is very real in PoP zones. :(<br />
<br />
Stick to good friends &amp; guildmates in PoP would be my advice until you level up some.  Good Luck!  :cool: <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm not trying to go to these zones now, I was going to wait until 50+, close to 60 before I head to these zones. I just didn't know how to get there. <br />
Thanks for all the help though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">NOTE:  each one of these zones has a &quot;graveyard&quot; located close to the zone point.  If your corpse isn't rezzed within X time, your corpse automatically drops at the graveyard, making CR's MUCH easier.  In the first tier, that time is either 10 or 15 mins.<br />
<br />
Oh, forgot to meantion, that if your corpse pops in the GY, nobody can /corpse it out of there, even you....   So you have to look for a cleric at the GY or one that is willing to run to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Check out this map of PoT (http://www.eqmaps.com/m3/potranquility6.gif), courtesy of EQMaps.com.<br />
<br />
Also check out this flag guide (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/maps/Planes_of_Power_flags_1_13.gif) courtesy of .. uh .. *shrug* some dude :p<br />
<br />
The planes of Innovation, Nightmare, Justice, and Disease are all first tier zones, requiring no quest(s) to gain access to, and are good exp in the 50's grouped.  They are, however, similar to zones like DL and KC, so consider yourself warned.  You might want to solo to 60 and then work on getting flagged for Plane of Valor, an excellent exp tier 2 zone for 60-65, without the DL/KC atmosphere of tier1 zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The experience in PoP is awful below 55, for the most part. It takes too long to kill the mobs.  The only way it would be worth it is if you can get into a group of people closer to 60.<br />
<br />
I recommend Jagged Pine (bandits to 51, gnolls to 54), Scarlet Desert(bloodtribe to 51, sun revenants to 56), Sebilis and the Hole for the levels 48-55.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually I had my first group in the tier one planes at 48, and it was PoI no less.  And believe it or not i was able to slow most of the mobs easily with an average of only one resist if any.  Just make sure the main assist has aggro before you slow, because if you slow to early and get resisted, kiss your shammy arse goodbye.</div></div><hr />
