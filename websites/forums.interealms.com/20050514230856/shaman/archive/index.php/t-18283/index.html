<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">FF11 released and Horizons in 2 days and SoE announce no gimmicks!. In the past they announce gimmicks everytime a new mmorpg comes out. Maybe they will hint about the next expansion soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">SOE is too busy marketing LOE to come up with any new marketing gimmicks, unless anoying me to no end with the spam for LOE counts as a gimmick :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The melee revamp isn't gimmicky enough for ya? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">From what I have heard about Horizons, it is the best TS scheme around. Hard to qualify that since I don't play UO, AO, AC or any of the others slew of MMORPG's.(Lineage, FFXI).  There are 4 Monk 'prestige' classes. There is the potential to play a Dragon.<br />
<br />
What there is NOT however is content. (Or at least during Beta). Now quite frankly I'm not sure you can call Horizons &quot;the next great thing&quot; without content. (I'm persnickity like that).<br />
<br />
BUT, it will certainly draw some people away from EQ, and * IF * they can get decent content in there and have some sort of 'allure' or 'catch' ala EQ, they may make a dent in the EQ melee population.<br />
<br />
As was posted above, it's no coincidence that the &quot;Melee changes&quot; just happen to coincide with the release of Horizons. And as Crackerjack as the changes seem to be, well suffice to say, it didn't take them a YEAR to come up with that band aid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ah yeah the melee changes, forgot about them. Ok they did coincide a gimmick.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I'll find out on Tuesday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">From what I've been reading, I wouldn't feel threatened by Horizons if I was an EQ bigwig.  I wouldn't be threatened by FFXI either and it's probably exponentially better than Horizons.<br />
<br />
In my opinion the only MMORPG that's been released since EQ that is of the same caliber as EQ is DAoC...and they're different enough to coexist, with EQ being king of PvE and DAoC having a really cool PvP implementation.<br />
<br />
If somebody ever released a game that combined the best of EQ+DAoC they'd have an amazing product (EQ's massive PvE content, character development, loot, and magic system combined with a highly refined version of DAoC's RvR)....but it's unlikely to happen because recent history is proving that devs would rather attempt to recreate the genre and create crap rather than take and improve upon the best parts of the current successes.  Considering the time and resources required to develop and run an MMORPG you'd think devs would try harder....but noooo.<br />
<br />
(Again IMO,) every other MMORPG that's been released since EQ has either been utter garbage or been just has deviated a little too much from the basics of the RPG genre to be widely appealing.  For example AC1 is a good game, but it's a little different from your typical RPG rule implemenation and never achieved widespread appeal.  AO ended up decent after a harsh initial release (that hurt them bad since people were hungering for a new MMORPG when AO released) but the sci-fi thing doesn't appeal to as many as the fantasy theme (unless it's star wars).  I didn't even bother trying Shadowbane and don't know many who play it or enjoyed it more than a month or two if they did play it.  I wouldn't even consider SWG - just all around suckage there.  UO has kept a decent subscriber base forever but it's not exactly the same flavor as EQ since it's not 3D - and I doubt many people would want to shift to that type of graphical environment after enjoying something as rich as EQ or DAoC.  Other MMORPGs that've been released aren't even worth mentioning except in the history of MMORPGs under the section titled &quot;MMORPGs nobody ever heard of and few ever played.&quot;<br />
<br />
The only MMORPGs I see with the potential to drastically alter the MMORPG landscape will be WoW and EQ2 - and only if they have clean releases and offer really solid gameplay (which both should given their developers).  Blizzard generally produces great games and will likely add a nice twist to the genre.  The EQ2 team is looking to take the best of EQ, ditch the worst of EQ, and add a few twists (and hopefully the new twists won't be idiotic).  Both houses and thier approaches *should* finally yield new MMORPGs worth checking out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Horizons looks appealling because it is apparently meant to have dynamic content. Also its tradeskill system is supposedly &quot;fun&quot;!!. However, both Final fantasy and Horizons as far as I know both lack raiding content(not sure if this is correct?) which could put off some people. That isn't a deterant to me though if the game is good and it establishes a decent community.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">psst zhahz check out info on coh (city of heroes)<br />
it looks like it will be just as good as wow just different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If walking to a patch of materials and collecting it by pressing one key then walking to whatever apparatus is used to refine that material and pressing another key and then switching apparatus to make whatever it is you were trying to make is fun then Horizons is the game for you. <br />
<br />
Though, to be fair, you can batch process items based on the quantity of materials you have and you can dictate your success rate (use more materials to guarantee a success). It is a good core system but, ultimately, still a grind since it is level based like the rest of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Spite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The melee revamp isn't gimmicky enough for ya? <br />
<br />
I'm waiting for them to announce that you have to use a DDR pad with it.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sobe Silvertree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Only MMORPH that SoE should worry about would be (IMO) is WoW (Worlds of Warcraft). Blizzards reputation is solid when putting out a game; history has shown us this.. so there is half the battle.. but putting on a MMORPH will be a whole new ball game for Blizzard, though they have several models since EQ and I do not see them making the same mistakes. So far it looks pretty exciting, including the use of flying mounts, ability to morph and some pretty neat spell effects, of course those are what interest me.. some will find other things that interest them. <br />
<br />
Competition is good for us as gamers .. so .. all we can do is hope.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">From all the possible MMORPG's announced there are only 3 with the potential to majorly effect EQ.<br />
<br />
1) WoW - no introduction needed<br />
<br />
2) Sigil's baby - but nothing revealed yet so hard to tell and will be years into the future<br />
<br />
3) Warhammer online - grim, dark and it will be a hard world. <br />
<br />
I for one look forward to all 3 as EQ is getting stale, boring and SoE does nothing to keep it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It never ceases to amaze me how underrated FF11 is.<br />
<br />
Levels 1 to 10 suck horridly and the UI is somewhat tricky to get used to, but beyond that it strikes me as a superior game to EQ in almost every respect, and unlike other mmorpgs it actually has a monsterous amount of content and works fine (Mostly due to having been out for roughly a year in asia already).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Horizons apparently went against 90% of their BETA testers and implemented a rock, paper, scissors type combat program. There is also a couple of other posts that have surfaced on various sites where long time testers and accused 'fan  boi's' have done a 180.<br />
<br />
Caveat Emptor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I was in Horizons Beta for about 7 months.  It's not the game that it has the potential to be yet since its lacking a good bit of content, but it is a fun game for those that aren't hard core players and want to enjoy a game for a couple hours at a time.  It won't really compete at all with EQ right now except with casual players.  Given 6 months of adding content and it could draw a few more from EQ, especially if the next EQ expansion has the same problems others had.<br />
<br />
Sigil, imo, will be the one to release the next generation of mmo.  Take a look at their roster of talent they have working for them.  Its not only the best of who created EQ, but they've pulled some of the industry's best as well (they just added T.King to do the interface).</div></div><hr />

3) Warhammer online - grim, dark and it will be a hard world. <br />
Based on the track record of Warhammer games and their relatively poor transition to PC or console games, I wouldn't hold my breath on this one. IMO, WoW is the only real contender for Everquest in the near future.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't take this as a good thing.  These are the people who supported the hybrid exp penalty, and thought tiny shaman running around outdoors were absurd and wrong.  They had their pet player classes, and tried to get more ppl to play halflings by giving them a 5 percent exp bonus.  Add in the whole dikumud scandal as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Mamluke256</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I would place money that at least 75% of the eq population thinks that original kunark and velious were the best expansions.  These were all Brad's babies.</div></div><hr />

IMO i shouldnt post at 3 am. I thought IMO was a game i didnt hear about  /bonk self</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Galnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">FFXI is already breathing down Everquest's neck already, last month they announced that they have 400,000 players already, last I heard eq has about 420,000 but that is probably closer to 460,000 now.<br />
<br />
Also some of thier game mechanics are a bit wierd, for example the whole server choice thing when starting, but once you get into the game players generally report that it is superior to everquest, the USA launch of the game went very easy on them, I heard of no problems at all.  All classes also get 'disciplines' that they can fire off once every 2 hours even as newbies these special attacks tend to do alot of damage, there are also much more common techniques that you can do, and when one person fires off a technique, a window is opened, if another party member does another technique in that window it is even more effective, and if someone else follows that one... that is what is called a 'skill chain' which helps make combat alot more interesting.<br />
<br />
The class/level system definately sounds like a winner,  in a nutshell you can change your class any time you want, of course the new class starts out at level 1 and you can again group with newbies, at level 18 you can do a quest that will unlock the ability to dual class, the 2nd class is capped at half the level of your primary class, but you must level that class up as well normally.  Say for example you were playing a level 15 warrior and decided to try out a thief, you would go to your house, change class to the thief and play.  Now, later on, if you decided you didnt like the thief and went back to your house and switched back to warrior, you don't lose any levels at all in that class.<br />
<br />
So with that big of a paying population, you definately cant dismiss it as small time.<br />
<br />
As for a few links... <br />
<br />
http://www.shadow-dragons.com/index2.htm is a guild site in ffxi at the bottom of the page is a TON of screenshots, on the left is a bunch of game info and more along the top.<br />
<br />
http://www.playonline.com/ff11us/multimedia/wind/ is a gm controlled camera that can either be placed somewhere or automatically sails thru different parts of the game so you can see what the world looks like, really amazing looking locations too, the camera is on one of the play servers, so you will quite often see people fighting casting spells, or hanging out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Agreed, FFXI is turning out to be the sleeper hit, its had zero hype that I've seen and it still doesnt even have a UK release date on any platform.<br />
<br />
But everyone I know whos played it and made it past the level 1 to 10 boundry is enjoying it a ton, myself included.<br />
<br />
A group I had last night showed just how fantastically refined the games mechanics are, basically 3 english speakers, and 3 japs, none of the english speakers knew kanji, and only 1 of the japs spoke english to any useable degree, the answer this problem?  Autotranslated speech generation!  After about 15 minutes of playing around with the tool we had a solid battleplan and renkei chain up and running, we pretty much proceeded to chain 200+xp per kill mobs for several hours without a single hitch.  And above all it was an enjoyable and intensive grouping experience for all of us the entire way.<br />
<br />
I think the last time I grinned like a chesire cat playing EQ was my guild's first AoW killing =)<br />
<br />
Add in the fact it has an amazing amount of content and things to do, its pretty much bug free (Although the winkey and the games inability to go into a window or loose windowed focus are an issue for some), and as a whole it runs several times faster and smoother than EQ whilst looking and sounding massively better.  Loading times are always in the order of seconds and the games method of loading additional model data on the fly and NOT going into a wait state until its ready (The main cause of EQ and many other games stuttering) is nothing short of fantastic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">What is the DikuMUD  scandal.<br />
<br />
From what I have read, much of EQ and EQ mechanics are based on an old MUD, Diku. The similarities are so obvious that the folks who did Diku MUD were considering suing Verant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Experience with DIKU MUDs is why when I came to EQ it was an easy trasnition. They are that similar. There was a whole section of the DIKU website with copies of letters and whatnot sent to EQ regarding the coding similarities. In the end, after an &quot;investigation&quot;, the creators of DIKU were satisfied that the code was similar but not the same and that EQ was as it was due to the influence of that particular MUD code.<br />
<br />
I keep reading that Final Fantasy is &quot;the game&quot; to de-throne EQ. It sounds fun and all but as a serious non-fan of the anime genre as a whole it is still wait and see for something new for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">White Mage is pretty cool in FF11, You get the best heals, slow, haste, rez, the only group ports, and your melee stays significant for many levels.  It's everything a priest should be.  FF11 is a pretty fun game.<br />

DAMN DRUIDS!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The debuffs are definately one of the better ideas FF has, rather than 1 debuffing being basically the single main one to a huge extent (slow), pretty much ALL the debuffs are equal.<br />
<br />
Slow is only 20%<br />
<br />
But para also reduces a mob's melee capacity by a similar amount although its much more inconsistant.<br />
<br />
Blind lowers a mob's accuracy by a similar figure.<br />
<br />
Even the cripple clone (Dia) does actually make a difference in how hard you can hit a mob and it has a small damage over time portion too.<br />
<br />
Add in fairly erratic durations and omgs, multiple debuffers are actually not a hinderance.<br />
<br />
What race are you though?  My melee (admittedly using a club, not a staff is fairly pathetic, although I'm a taru which doesnt help)</div></div><hr />
