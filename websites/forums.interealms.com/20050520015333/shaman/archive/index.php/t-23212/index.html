<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I went surfing class boards and found a surprising amount of shaman support that I'd like to share.  Please note a couple things though:<br />

These quotes are out of context.  I've included the URL's of each thread so you may read all of it.  I've also tried to include every comment that mentions our class, good or bad.<br />

The community is assuming this is a druid spell.  As you know, everything is subject to change.<br />

Seriously, if SoE is going to give another class a Rez spell/AA, it should be Shamans, not Druids. Druids can do so much already.<br />
--<br />
A great move IMO. Now they should add it to shamans too...I think it IS better to have more classes around that can rez (or at least call back the fallen to their bodies, even if not with exp restored). <br />
--<br />
I don't see such a big problem with this, assuming they give something similar to shamen as well. I think this isn't so much a class balance thing, it just makes general gameplay less of a hassle.<br />
--<br />
Are you guys sure this is for Druids and not Shamen? It says class none, and I read that Shamen were trying to get a rez since they are the priest class for the wild races.<br />
--<br />
I really hope this goes to shaman.<br />
<br />
It really makes no RP sense at all that druids can rez. They tell us all the crap we can't have because it would unbalance things. They tell us they are removing summoned flags from mobs because it doesn't make sense RP-wise. They tell us our 'elemental' charm and mez don't make sense and are a mistake.<br />
<br />
You know, they sure as hell make up a lot of excuses to take **** away from us. Yet the druids whine about a rez for 3+ years and now they are going to get it because they whine...and this makes RP sense???<br />
<br />
Shaman should have always gotten rez. I never understood why they did not get it. But if the druids get a rez and Shaman don't, that will only prove that money talks with SoE. <br />
--<br />
As much as I would like to see another rezzing class in the game I really don't think Druids should be it. I would be all for Shammies getting it but seriously Druids? Druids have it all already, why give them even more utility? <br />
--<br />
I have no issue with either druids nor shamen getting a res, as long as the exp returned is significantly lower than the current res classes. Just another alternative to getting people back to their corpses; even if its with a fairly major hit to exp. That cuts down on the recovery time when playing, but still gives you strong incentive to have another res class too.<br />
<br />
That said, if it goes to one class and not both I hope shamen get it. I also don't understand why they never had it, although I think it should be a lesser res.<br />
--<br />
I think both druids and shaman should get a low % rez. I've been in many groups in which we've been deep in a dungeon (Sol Ro comes to mind) with no CoH available, druid healing and many see invis mobs between us and the guy who just died. I think this is a good thing, assuming that shaman get their own AA version. <br />
--<br />
I will say that in a RP sense Shamans should get a rez spell, as they are the wildmans priest so to say. <br />
--<br />
if this game wanted to be more instant group friendly and less holy trinity i alwyas believed this game should give all the priest classes a form of rez. i always though cleric 96, shaman 75, druid 50%<br />
--<br />
I don't see any issue with the druids &amp; shaman res.<br />
<br />
If you don't like it, don't accept it.<br />
<br />
There are others, however, who see a time and need for such a thing. EQ has a tier 1 res level for the clerics. It then has a tier 2 level for paladins and necros, with a reduced exp return. If they add a 3rd level offering a further res with an even lower exp return - how does that hurt Mages? If you don't want it, don't click on it when a druid or shaman offer to help you with death recovery.<br />
--<br />
I'm glad druids are getting rez. It should have been a shaman spell, but I can deal with it being a druid thingy. <br />
--<br />
This is one of the key points why EQ is failing atm: because we have too much CLASS dependency. What we need (and what EQ2 will offer) is more ARCHETYPE dependency. It should not matter wether you take a cleric, druid or shaman...they all should be able to heal, and be able to rez. They are priests after all! <br />
--<br />
my hubby agrees with that..since shamans are a primitive cleric and druids are just...well...druids...<br />
<br />
i hope that gets changed..that sucks<br />
--<br />
If the res they give to druids has little-none exp return to it, that would be ok, as people would still want the better cleric res. Shamans on the other hand I think, should receive a decent res, they are as many others have said, the wildmans cleric, makes more sense for them to get it, even more sense that they should heal better than a druid too, I don't see why they don't to this day, other than having slow in their lineup.<br />
--<br />
Druids or shamans getting a res is fine with me. If you don't like it, you go fight your battles any way you want. My point is clear though, if you are so against another classes new abilities, then don't play them and don't accept those things when cast on you. Other people are not against the changes, its fine for us to say so.<br />
<br />
And if clerics don't like another level of res, they can fight that fight. Me? I am happy with more res choices since there are far too many times I would have liked any res at all, just to save the run time back to corpse. If I am worried about exp, I can get a cleric res, or paladin. If its important to get back to the action faster, then any res will do.<br />
<br />
There is absolutely a place for this sort of thing in EQ, and it isn't the end of the world any more than EQ shut down the day Paladins got their res.<br />
<br />
Druids and shaman both heal, they are wisdom based classes, they could both be candidates for this res. <br />
--<br />
I would have no concerns about shaman get a rez for the simple fact that that beastlords are completely stepping on shaman toes right now. With mobs that mitigate slow, a beastlord can do almost everything a shaman can. More DPS, less healing, more mana regen for party etc.<br />
--<br />
But I agree that if any other priest class gets rez it should be shamans.<br />
--<br />
Gonna be funny when there are as many Shamans as Mages around ain't it? <br />
--<br />
From a roleplaying perspective, shaman is only class i can see getting a rez in addition to the existing ones. <br />
--<br />
I have no problem with druids getting Rez.. but then Shammies should have it also and the restictions on CoTH need to be removed from all these freeking zones. <br />
--<br />
Think shamans could make a good candidate for a summon to corpse <br />

Shamans are the ones that should be pissed if druids get pseudo-rez.<br />
--<br />
I don't see the problem with druids getting a 0% rez that allows later cleric rezes<br />
<br />
though I agree, it probably would have been better to give it to shammies<br />
--<br />
If you give it to one, you almost have to give it to both, especially if shammys gain ground on the healing front. If it had to be one or the other, shammys would probably be a more logical recipient though.<br />
--<br />
It says you regain experience so in my book that is a rezz and not a call to corpse. SoE would give a porting class a rezz before giving one to the SKs? I would think Shammy would get a rezz before a druid would.<br />
--<br />
I think it makes sense for all the priests to have one version or another of res. If they're going to give it to somebody, it should be to both Shamans and Druids.<br />
--<br />
If shaman got a form of rez, it would probably be an alchemy potion, that would produce a no drop rez potion. Probably cost like 250pp to make, with about a 50% failure rate. That wouldnt be too bad, but knowing SOE, it would required 3 components that are foraged on top of the vendor bought stuff.<br />

rumor has it this is for druids...i can see shamans getting a 50% rez, that would be cool. but druids???????? bah /rude<br />
--<br />
just so everyone knows, this is nowhere near a certainty...just one of those things that could be in the future. personally, i would much rather see this go to shamans...they are, after all, primitive clerics, are they not?<br />
--<br />
It would be more in keeping with the shaman as a priest class but I think druids are &quot;bundled&quot; in too (Ive no idea Ive never grouped with a druid ever due to my server rules).<br />
--<br />
 It seems like it more of a shaman spell but who knows. It may not go live since alot of clerics would be bitching but alot of players would be happy to see more chances of getting rezzed.<br />
--<br />
paladins are cleric/warrior hybrids, so for them to get a low exp rez would make some sense...shamans are primitive clerics so a low exp rez for them makes sense...but druids already have it all, just about...nukes almost (if not as good) as mages, dots, buffs, snare, root, aoe, transport, i mean come on!<br />

I like this idea - I'm not entirely sure why druids would get it instead of shammies, but whatever. And I still want invis<br />
--<br />
I agree its odd that druids get it instead of shaman.. from a RP perspective seems like shaman are more intune with the spirits and so forth. then again, druids have teleportation, so its not too far of a stretch for me.<br />
--<br />
I have to agree that it fits and sounds more like a shaman spell to me.<br />
--<br />
Personally, I say, if the developers have decided to go this way, then give druids and shamans 96% rez ( heck even give everyone else a summon target to corpse [with a very long reuse] - I liked that in Guildwars ), and then add something to clerics. <br />
--<br />
Shamans are best slowers in the game best buffers in the game so why when we do GOD trials, exp groups, shamans are ONLY asked if they cannot find a bst. It is because Bst bring a LOT more to the group then just slow and buffs.<br />
If anyone could have benfited from a getting a AA rez its shamans because they have fallen behind badly in the game getting unwanted in guilds because bst stack shamans don't, and bst are better in groups then shamans. I have lost tons of shaman friends who have quit eq or rerolled bacause bst have replaced them. Why are druids getting yet ANOTHER boast they did not need???????<br />
<br />
It will NOT matter if we have the best heals because druids can heal in almost any group we can. The only thing that has not turned us into rez bots or people who are only wanted in raids is because our healing power edge out druids and we can rez without needing emeralds like necros. Do not sit back and say its not so bad if druids get a rez. THen they can share mana regin buff, snare, track, heal, nuke, sow, inv rez and leve the group, toss in tiny bit more extra healing power and a rez then All we will have to look foward to is raids because after raids nobody will want anything to do with us other then to symbol their group with the druid or get bugged 24 7 for exp rezes from groups that did not want us because the druid brought more to the group then just heals but wanted us to rez them at GY after group is over . I do not intend to sit lfg and answer any we got 0% rez can you come rez us after group over tells.<br />
<br />
I accepted that I had to fight to put groups together while druids sat in pofire maxing out their AA kiting because I was still the top dog when it came to priests. I did not make my cleric to just be a raid bot, and giving me another crap hammer would not make up for Sony screwing us again.<br />
I do not want us to get pushed out of the game like shamans are. Druids are to clerics what bst are to shamans our offical replacements. Where are clerics inv, sow, group mana regin buff track port hell anything??????<br />
I am sure they have another nifty hammer waiting on us<br />
--<br />
BST --&gt; slow + dps<br />
Shaman --&gt; slow<br />
<br />
Sony's solution is<br />
<br />
Shaman --&gt; slow + heals<br />
<br />
As BST dps is primary melee, I for the life of me, can't understand why Sony didn't jack up shaman DoT, albeit with low aggro. So shaman would become better soloist as a result, fine, and still be handy in groups, fine. Take away the shaman/druid heals and I don't care how good soloist they are, and I suspect neither would anyone else.<br />
<br />
But no Sony needed to sell an expansion so they created a shaman with DPS than shaman with no DPS. And now all the 'old' shaman are now stuffed by the younger class.<br />
<br />
What I don't understand is why Sony, and apparently many shaman, expect the cleric class to pick up the tab.<br />
<br />
The explaination given by Sony is that they don't want people not having fun because of lack of clerics, yet what have Sony done over the last 2 years to make clerics more fun to play? Giving them a nice furry pet that delivers 50% dps of the class, nope. Removed buff costs, nope. Increased our utility as a non-box outside a group, nope. Given us an easy soloing abilities so we are not bored when LFG, nope. etc etc<br />
<br />
Nope they have and plan to, hive off our key attribute to two other classes.<br />
--<br />
If they really wanted to fix the shaman class properly they'd change the way slow mitigation worked.<br />
<br />
If a mob mitigates slow 50% then instead of a beastlord and shaman both slowing him to 50%, the shaman would slow him to 85% of 50% and the beast would slow him to 50% of 50%, and they'd just adjust the mitigation caps a tad. There's no reason for slow to mitigate like it does now, all it really does is in end game content is turn beastlords and bards into the equals of shaman and enchanters at slowing.<br />
<br />
As for shaman and grind group problems. If you really want to fix shaman, adjust their DoTs too. Give them less aggro and a ton more dps on their dots. Change them to be 3-4tick dots for alot more/tick. The other issue is grind mob fights are to short and malo+slow takes a while to cast. Cut the cast time on malo line to be more in line with tash line cast times.<br />
<br />
As for the rez to corpse thing it's probably both shaman and druid, but maybe not. If it's one or the other give it to the shammies.<br />
--<br />
Anyway, put me down as hugely in favor of anything that makes a death not effectively end a night's adventuring. 0%xp &quot;rezzes&quot; for druids and shamans would be cool.<br />
--<br />
Let's see, we have the shaman class, a pretty good class that does fine until you reach the upper game where there buffs are worthless because most melee have maxed stats, and there slows are migated away, possible because of the sheer unbalancing of slow in the high end game. Result lots of customers happy trot along having a fine time then zip, sfa, nada. This is very bad for revenue.<br />

I could see this causing a lot of anger among the Shaman community...<br />
--<br />
If it's like Divine Resurrection where you can only use it rarely, I think it would be a good thing actually. But if you are going to give it to druids how could you not give it to shaman?<br />
--<br />
Shamans get slow.<br />
<br />
So shamans have a group spot as backup healer and slower. Fair enough, they have their problems, but fair play to the druids, they needed this one. They still prolly need a 1.5ish sec heal but it's a start.<br />
--<br />
Druids are fine as it is. Shamans are the healers seriously in need of some love.<br />
--<br />
I could give a flying @#%$ about my ress. But druids seriously don't need this kind of new line at this point. Give it to shamans.<br />
--<br />
I don't see it as an issue, Experience rezzes are a neccessity in the game, especially in zones that are hard to return to. To be honest I would have thought the Shaman would be the one to get the rez, for RPG reasons, but in actual Practice it makes good sense for the Druid to have it, and for several reasons that make it so Druids would capitalize on that more then Shamans.<br />
<br />
Druids can Port, SoW, Invis, Snare and Harmony and that zone hopping ability (Igress??). This basically means in the event of a Wipe, the Druid can go in and get the rez done unsupported in many cases, whereas the Shaman would need Support (at the very least a port to the area.)<br />
--<br />
Giving Druids a resurrection is exactly what I hate SOE doing. They shouldn't give classes new skills that don't address class balance. If this was given to Shamans I might let it go because they are weak in their priest role but Druids?? So not only do I see this as a &quot;dud&quot; skill, I see it given to the wrong class. *sigh*<br />
--<br />
Really interested to know what the clerics and shamans feel about this.<br />
--<br />
If I would be a shaman I would be really pissed...<br />
<br />
Their slows are already nerfed in PoP and GoD (the partial thing)<br />
<br />
Most I know feel like a Focus buff bot.<br />
<br />
And the most of them still cannot understand why BSTs got this nice MGB heal/manaregen and they not.<br />
<br />
And I cannot understand it too...</div></div><hr />

As far as the issue is concerned, I would love to see Shaman get a rez, and honestly, I think if any priest class deserves one its us (and only because druids get ports, which have also declined in usefulness, and evac-succor, which has always been a nice option).<br />
<br />
I am actually optomistic about the future of this game. I am pretty sure I will be able to squeeze another year out of it at least. 5 levels, new stuff on the horizon, the game continues to evolve. Sometimes for the good, sometimes for the bad, but never usually static. <br />
<br />
Certainly is nice to see other classes sticking up for us too. I have endorsed lots of non-Shaman issues that have come up over the years. This really is a community game, and not just class-specific. The most annoying people in the world are the ones who don't wish to make ANY concessions in their play whatsoever, even if it benefits a lot of other EQ players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My only real problem here is that I don't really see this sort of rez as genuinely making spots for shaman in groups: lets face it, if I was a warrior, I'd make myself a shaman bot, and just have him /follow to the place the fighting will happen. Camp shaman, invite priest to group (and probably BST too). Shaman becomes the &quot;get out of Jail free&quot; card; if group wipes, warrior logs on long enough to rez the cleric with the shaman, then logs warrior back in for rez.<br />
<br />
Thus, cleric is the only member of party that loses exp from the rezzing, which shafts the cleric bigtime.<br />

I think it will &quot;add to our package&quot; and make us more equal to BLs, and with another small bump in another area (healing or DPS) we would actually be a &quot;solid&quot; option again. Currently, despite the fact that we can function, we are NOT a &quot;solid&quot; option. Rez would just bump us up on the scale, not make us do-or-die.</div></div><hr />

I am a big big believer in giving us a 0% summon back to the body so that you can leave a corpse to later be rezzed up by a cleric.<br />
<br />
I also am trying for the life of me to figure out what RP value they could give to druids for this ability other than they want all priest classes to use it.  I'm cool with that.  But giving to druids and not us makes me shake my head.  <br />

Druids always say they are a jack of all trades but master of none.  But Druids are like the smart dude in school that bitches because he got all A-'s but no A+s.  And then says he should be as good as Shaman because we get straight D's but rock at Wood Shop.</div></div><hr />

i can see it now.  sitting at an LDON camp, not only am i asked for the few buffs we have that help, but i will be asked to run over and rez people too.<br />
<br />
give it to druids, they can atleast port around to rez people.<br />

My major concern is for the clerics really.  I was initally against us getting a rez.  Now the idea is growing on me. :p   Give us a limited use 100% rez even.  Put a 0 delay gem refresh but a 15 minute re-use timer on it.  Guess what we've just become?  Cleric's best friend. :D   If we only get a 50% rez, guess who is taking that 50% rez 9 times out of ten?  The cleric or pally with a 90% or 96% rez to bring the rest of the group/raid back to the zone.  I'd be pissed if I was that 65 cleric taking a 50% rez just to come back and click everyone else with a 96%. :mad: <br />
<br />
I'm FREQUENTLY either one of the very first to die OR one of the last ones standing in groups &amp; raids that wipe.  If I can survive the inital aggro from slowing ambitiously, I'm generally one of the last ones to drop when things go South.  An AA 100% rez w/ a half hour or hour recast delay would let us add a bit (we'd still need other boosts to raid stacking) to raid functionality.  <br />
<br />
Either make it a 0% call to corpse we can use all the time, or a cleric'ish quality spell with a long recast (*but zero initial cast delay.  None of that wait 10 minutes to cast Spirit of Cheetah crap).<br />
<br />

Honestly, I have to disagree with this perspective. Hot rezzing the warrior while the Chanty or Bard has a mob mezzed is actually HUGE. <br />
<br />
I really like the idea of spreading specific &quot;specialized&quot; abilities around a little, providing more options for group make up. Rez is a part of that whole package, along with the other considerations that are more or less important like tanking, healing, DPS, buffing, etc. It gives us something to compete with BLs and Chanters for that &quot;slower&quot; spot in groups. If we get this ability, the Slower Class Packages look sorta like this:<br />
<br />
Shaman = Slow(10), Heals(5), Rez, Buffs(6, FoS, regen, billy)<br />
Beastlords = Slow(8.5), Pet(8), DPS(7), Buffs(8, SD, Vig, Paragon)<br />
Chanters = Slow(9), Mezz(10), Charm(10), Buffs(8, VoQ, VQ, Runes)<br />
<br />
The main problem we are having, as a class, is that our &quot;exceptional&quot; ability, slow, has been severly compromised over time by other classes and mob modifications. Shaman slow = 10, but Chanter = 9 and BL = 8.5. However, with healing, Cleric = 10, Druid = 7.5, Shaman = 5. <br />
<br />
Actually, this is probably not a bad concept to compare a classes relative desirability in the various types of gameplay EQ provides. Take each class, and rate them on their ability in specific areas (i.e. Shaman - Tank=4, Heal=5, Slow=10, Buffs=6, CC=8). Then plug that into what is &quot;needed&quot; for the differnt possibilities of what is happening, Raids, Groups, Soloing, Farming, Questing, etc. Hmm, anyone want to put some time into this? Samanna maybe?</div></div><hr />

I don't know about anyone else, but I'm usually the first to go down right after the tanks because I try to keep the cleric up as long as possible.  But if the whole group wipes, what difference would it make between a group with a cleric and a group with a cleric and a shaman? I can understand if it was say a fast cast thing, so if the cleric goes down, you can toss him a rez quick before you die, wait a few minutes and cleric can take the rez and get to rezzing the rest of the group.  But other than that, I don't really see the use.  BTW, druids getting this is preposterous.  They don't need it, and they shouldn't get it.</div></div><hr />

One problem facing shamans in my observation (and it's basically the same problem facing SK's) is that you can't seem to agree on what your class is/needs at it's core.  <br />
<br />
Many people (including the vast majority of non-shamans) view shamans to be a priest class (I.E. heals/curse/buffs/etc.) yet many of your number seem equally/more concerned with complaining about dots or wanting bigger nukes than fixing the heart of the class.  Your role as debuffers is largely complementary to the &quot;priest role&quot;.  <br />
<br />
SK's are in the same situation.  We're fundamentally tanks, with a secondary role in pulling.  We can't seem to get unified on what we need to fix this, though.  We spend as much time arguing about necro rez, SK's wanting slow, and spell casting subtlety or complaining about our DoT's and DPS that we never really get anywhere.  But I digress...<br />
<br />
Assuming that shamans are fundamentally a priest class, a rez spell is very much in order, as it is for druids.  (See above linked post.)  No, it won't fix you, but it's part of the &quot;priest package&quot; that would definately help.<br />
<br />

(And for the record, most of the SK comments from the original post were mine.  ;)  ;) )<br />

Druid rez bashing , gotta love it. Here's my view on druids getting rez capabilities :<br />
<br />
I think all priest classes should get a rez, as simple as that. But to say that druids shouldn't get the rez is insane. In fact! <br />
<br />
I think ( = opinion) a druid should have more right to a rez than a paladin. Why? Because it's ridiculous that a fighter class should have more rezzing capabilities over a caster class.<br />
<br />
Give druids and shamans 96 rez and there should be no problem. Oh sure, the clerics will whine to no end, but what does it matter. Seriously, if you think about it...! What I see is beastlords getting picked over shamans (which is logical -- they slow, they can do SD AND are good dps. Yes, that hurts. But yes, it's the truth :( Same goes for clerics vs druids when it comes down to it, although it's a bit less apparent after people have seen in LDoN that druids CAN actually replace a cleric 99% ---- except for the rez part.. that is)<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but clerics won't get groups then!&quot; Bullsh*t. They said that when druids got their &quot;CH&quot; spell, but that wasn't true. If you want to talk stunted class - go to the warrior boards and read about the complaints about their inability to hold aggro - at all , unless they're uber geared / augmented.<br />
<br />
In all seriousness though - If they'd give druids , say, a 30% rez, or even a 0% rez it'd be a great improvement from a druid-centered xp group suddenly coming to a complete halt just because VI at the time decided &quot;druids shouldn't be ubar&quot; (talking about POST Kunark era, ofcourse!). It's unfair druids don't get rez, but DO get a CH line, ever thought about that? That's like giving someone a Ferrari with Ford wheels (or no wheels). Sure it can drive, but if it breaks down, you're screwed. Hmm. Maybe bad example. Good car without a spare wheel (rez) then. You probably know what I mean :)<br />
<br />
I don't know what it's like on other servers, but on AB , the serious druids know - druids are better healers than clerics - because we can't afford to screw up (loose statement, not ment to bash clerics).<br />
But if something bad happens and we need someone back in action, we have to beg a rez from a cleric, who will condescendingly snicker a bit and rez ... if you're &quot;lucky&quot; , that is. I don't like it. I don't like it at all.<br />
<br />
Shamans however, are typically not used as main healers in groups (level 65 avg groups I mean - and yes, exceptions exist I'm fully aware of that). So the argument that shamans should get a rez over druids is totally void. That's like giving port spells to a monk.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">One of the biggest reasons shamans should have access to the pseudo-rez is for situations where they are backup healer behind a cleric in a group (a position both druids and shamans, in addition to additional clerics, often fill in GoD), thus the bit about shamans &quot;not being used as main healers&quot; really doesn't hold much water.  <br />
<br />
The assertation of &quot;we [druids] already have a role so we need an upgrade more than you [shamans]!!!&quot; is utterly laughable at best, though, and I'm not even a shaman.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, I didn't realize that the AA lists ripped from Test weren't posted here already.   You can find them at Graffe's or many other boards, including boards here.    The Lucy information was wrong (a carryover from the previous template).  Druids and Shaman are getting CoW as a summon-to-corpse AA ability.  No other details disclosed yet.<br />
 <br />
I only propagate information on this particular ability because it has become public, and because it is such a potentially divisive issue.   Keep in mind, please, that the information you see is still preliminary, without details, and is very likely to change.  It is a BETA, remember.<br />

San Diego (AP)<br />
<br />
Today Sony Online Entertainment released to the world their upcoming Alternate Ability and Spell List for the soon-to-be-released expansion, Omens of War.  Included in this expansion is a heretofore unattainable ability for two classes (Druid and Shaman), the ability to rez a fallen compatriot.<br />
<br />
In keeping with traditional themes, the Druid version will be available at level 66 off of a vendor in every starting city for a nominal cost.  Additionally, to ease the strain on Druids (given their loss of income due to the incoporation of port stones), their version will be nominally priced (&quot;Think Gold and Silver,&quot; said SOE spokesman Brenlo), require a fire beetle eye as a component and be useable  ad infinitum .<br />
<br />
However, for Druids who can't be arsed to spend their hard earned money, the spell is also available as an Alternate Ability at a cost of 1 AA point.<br />
<br />
In contrast, the Shaman spell version will be available at level 70, require a sub-quest that &quot;Should tax the current Time-enabled guilds to their fullest extent,&quot; further require an alchemy combine with a trivial over 250, and additionally require casting components that drop in the last zone of OOW.<br />
<br />
Should a Shaman decide to purchase the ability via AA, the cost is a nominal 70 AA points. (&quot;We like the symmetry between level obtained and AA cost,&quot; said one unnamed developer)<br />
<br />
When asked why the disparity of ease of acquiring, Sony co-spokesman Rytan said:<br />
<br />
&quot;Two reasons - Stat buffs and slow.&quot;<br />
<br />
A collective sigh and chambering of a round was heard from the Shaman community.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Um, the post right above mine?<br />
<br />
Hey..  believe what you want from people that don't know what they are talking about.  Believe me when I say.. it's on the list for both of us and has been since day 1 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">If your main isn't a druid, Erikochan, I'll eat my hat.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I see tons of people saying it's okay to have a no exp res and that it will be a lot of use, but to be honest, most people die and want EXP resses.  About 15 percent of people will even reject a 90 percent res (WTH?!).  This will be even more the case with people actually NEEDING that lost normal exp (on their way to level 70).<br />
<br />
They could give this ability to anyone, and I doubt players will accept it when it is cast upon them... unless it doesn't block other resses (which would be icky, cuz you'd still need to stick res effects on the summon to corpse for obvious reasons).<br />
<br />
And as far as Druids being picked to Main Heal and Shaman NOT being picked to main heal, this is an anomaly.  Shaman were balanced to be able to main heal after they landed slow on the opposing mob.  Since slow mitigation, druids have become much better healers than Shaman due to the dual-pronged force of mitigated slows and shorter fights.  Comparing a monk getting port to a Shaman getting a res is laughable.  Monks are not casters, and are not classes associated with travel.  Shaman are one of the three PRIEST classes, and are in tune with the SPIRITS.<br />
<br />
So you take your second best nukes, second best heals, and endless utility, and your alleged incoming res ability.  I'd like to see what y'all find to complain about next.<br />
<br />
P.S.  Scirrocco is the Druid correspondent?  Hah!  I could think of no one more fitting.  Also, I read the dr00dman's thing about the AA being summon to corpse with allowing exp res later, so I think that's nifty.  I also like how he took his name from a spell!  I should name myself Turgur, Malo, or Winterrs Rorr.  Or maybe &quot;Omens_Shm_StatBuff&quot; would be a more applicable name.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Given the news I am just glad we will get the ability. Why?<br />
<br />
1) If only druids had it this would be the death of me as secondary healer in tipt (GoD).<br />
<br />
2) On high end encounters where the cleric dies due to a silly slip up, at least i can now quickly res the cleric, or battleres the tank as required.<br />
<br />
It's going to be very useful, but I would much rather have seen a big upgrade on our slow (or nerf on mitigation of shaman slows) instead.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I know. I am not sure where Griz got his information, he is usually pretty reliable, so I trusted what he said, since I am not in the beta. I was mistaken, as he was, and I am happy to see that both the other priest classes are getting the new rez. Mistakes happen, you know.</div></div><hr />

May seem ****ty to some, but to be perfectly honest, class blurring is one of the best ways to address a lot of the class balance issues currently plaguing the game.  <br />
<br />
Frankly, we have way too many classes for there to be &quot;unique class abilities&quot; to not be given away.  When you have 16 classes, especially considering that the base group is only 6, you simply have to have a degree of class blurring.  You can't have &quot;required abilities&quot; that are unique to a class; for true balance, you can't have 16 required classes in a 6 man group, and you can't have some required classes and others only optional.  <br />
<br />
For true balance, archetypes should be relatively well-defined, and each required.  The classes that comprise each archetype, however, should be interchangable, however.  They can have different advantages and different means of achieving their role, but one shouldn't be universally superior to the others.  <br />
<br />
Now, with the way EQ has developed, achieving that in a pure sense is practically impossible, particularly because of warriors and to a lesser extent, clerics, but that doesn't mean it's not a good concept. Any opportunity to reduce the extent to which one class is required over other members of the same archetype should be embraced - this pseudo-rez is one such opportunity.   <br />
<br />
But I digress... I guess writing 4 paragraphs in response to one sentence might not be the best idea. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This abilitiy, while it may not single-handedly fix Shamans (or Druids), is certainly a boon.  It's not necessarily ideal, but it's certainly a very useful ability that will help with a common problem in current content, and add to the desirability of both classes.  Sure, Shamans still need healing improvements to be more in-line with clerics/druids and to help set them apart from being a low-DPS beastlord, but that doesn't make this any less beneficial...<br />
<br />
Just because something doesn't fix your class all at once doesn't mean it's not a good change.  SK's seem to have a problem with that idea too...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And to post #55: You can still be XP rezzed after being summoned to your corpse with this ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Zillanex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Think i might be able to give a 90% to someone below 20,<br />
but other then that :( Had a guy in PoK asking for a rez for like 20 mins when i offered my 90% rez he told me no thanks i need a 96% like the difference is that huge.<br />
<br />
And i would also make rude remarks if the group that didn't need me now came asking me for a rez.<br />
<br />
As for rez and druids, now they only lack feign death and i would not be surprised if they get that to :)<br />
<br />
Since my shaman is only 26 this skill is not much use for me anyway since i doubt it will be for the low levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Lanadena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">If it's a summon corpse or a rez, I think I'll like either one.  As a priest class, this makes perfect role-play sense to me.  <br />
<br />
As a raider there have been a few times when I've been one of the few last standing individuals and it would have helped to be able to call the clerics back in or give one of them a rez so they can start clicking before bodies pop to the graveyard.  <br />
<br />
As a casual player, it would be nice when it gets late or I need to leave quickly to summon my body to me or do a rez and log for the night.</div></div><hr />

Quite right hoss.  Let me see, as a Shaman I want Druid Dots (since they heal so much better when once we were tied), Cleric HoT (since they have a nice hammer to deal out damage and we're BOTH Priest classes), Pally Nukes (With their improved healing - they're  25 %  Cleric not 50%, and I'll think of a couple more.<br />
<br />
IOW - I want to be where we WERE. A meleeing, DoT'ing, Healing class, that is respectable in each of those three categories.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">&quot;Shamans however, are typically not used as main healers in groups (level 65 avg groups I mean - and yes, exceptions exist I'm fully aware of that). So the argument that shamans should get a rez over druids is totally void. That's like giving port spells to a monk.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thanks for making the argument that Shaman have and continue to be utterly shafted in healing power despite the fact that we are priests.  Oh, you didn't remember that Shaman were priests too?  For shame...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Timbi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Let me start off by saying that I am BIG into roleplaying. With that in mind you have to remember that I probly think a lot differently on most things than a normal person. I think about thinks like...this class should have this because it fits in thier lore/history. I think more in terms of Roleplaying than in we lack this or it should be better to help us out.<br />
<br />
All that in mind this is my take on the situation.<br />
<br />
Druids need NO REZ of any shape, form, or fashion. It simply doesn't fit. Druids serve one purpose...protect and uphold nature. Isn't death a part of nature that shouldn't be tampered with. Druids shouldn't want a rez. Death completes the circle of life....bring things back from the dead and you break that circle...the opposite of what Druids are trying to do.<br />
<br />
Shamans deal with SPIRITS...yep, the very thing you stick back in a body to bring it back to life. Need I say more? This also fits in well with thier buffing/debuffing/healing....wich should be the main focus of anything needing fixing about them.<br />
<br />
Clerics are divine healers. Basically they please the gods and the gods are the ones acctually doing the rez so to speak. Paladins...same thing really. I tend to see it as the Clerics/Paladins just sort of open a void to allow the gods to bestow healing/buffs upon others, sort of a middle man if you will.<br />
<br />
And now we come to the last class with a rez, Necros. They have one of the most concrete reasons to have a rez. They seal a soul in a gem...and release it at a later time....why not?<br />
<br />
(just so  you know everything about Druids bugs me. Just too goody goody for thier own good. Got more than they need but aren't happy with what they have. They should learn to use what they have before they ask for more.)</div></div><hr />
