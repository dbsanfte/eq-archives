<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brabba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello.<br />
<br />
This is my first post.  I have been reading this sight for about 3 weeks, as I started a Shaman one month ago.  It's an awsome sight.  I don't get much time to play and am now level 25. <br />
<br />
This sight has a lot to read (I havent' read it all yet), but I haven't seen an answer to my question yet.  Yesterday I was fighting with an Enchanter, so I had the role of tank.  There were times that the mobs would aggro on the Enchanter.  Is there a spell at level 25 I can cast that will have a good chance of drawing aggro away from others?<br />
<br />
When I play my 43 Ranger, I can cast snare and many times it will result in me obtaining aggro, at least for a small amount of time.  Usually one hit when I play with my warrior friend.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Use your lowest level poison dot, or drowsy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Foradce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Best ways I've found to get aggro are your low level poison DoTs, Disempower (low level cripple) and slow. Also if the chanter is really getting pounded you can just root the mob and step right in its face.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brabba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Use your lowest level poison dot, or drowsy.<br />
<br />
I didn't thought one of the benefits of the dot is that it doesn't pull aggro.  I will try it though.  I know I was casting drowsy, but I doubt it was after the mob aggro'd my partner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well, a benefit of disease based dots is it's limited agro.  Unfortunately (though ironically fortunate in your case) our poison base dots really !@#$ off the mobs.<br />
<br />
At your level I had some stupidly twink gear and I could WAY out meet tank most the melees I grouped with, so I MTed quite a bit.  I would slow on the pull, then drowsy twice, then start swinging.  Rarely would I be out agroed after two drowsies, but if I was I would just root and get up on the mob.<br />
<br />
I didn't know about the poison dot agro by then, so I never really tried it, but by about 34 I started grouping alot, and I learned quickly that I couldn't use my poison dots in a group unless the tank could pull some serious agro.  I'd easily peel mobs of decently equiped SK's at that level range after one slow and my dot, so I am pretty sure your level 24 one will do just fine.<br />
<br />
At that point, if all that doesn't work, it's most likely the chanter who's tactics need evaluating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At your level, I'd root and step close to the mob. You don't have the mana to toss around with low level stat debuffs that barely affect the mob if at all, your mana would be better spent for immediate affects like healing, damage or root, rather than a hopefull chance that a cripple spell might pull aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Disempower, or Tainted Breath if you KNOW the mob won't need to be mezzed.  Rooted mobs always attack the closest person, so if all else fails root it and stand on its toes.<br />
<br />
Chain-casting Disempower on a mob really pisses it off though. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, aside from rooting, your best bet on taking and holding agro is Blind.<br />
<br />
A blinded mob will attack the closest player if in range, very simmilar to a rooted mob.  Using blind the only time I ever lose agro is if I get out of range and the &quot;run&quot; aspect of blind kicks in.  That, coupled with Root, are surefire ways to keep and maintain agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">cast disempower a few times, works great</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Chain casting tainted breath I don't think even the knight classes could take aggro back for long.  Poison counters = uber taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hordza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I found when i was low level and sometimes now if your right in mobs face and want agro, Flash of Light always :) sure its lil funny if mob isnt on you and runs off cause its blind but its real great taunt, and easy on the mana and fast cast time.Just make sure mob in close melee range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I agree with Thorzion, at the low levels blind was great for agro control. Cheap and very fast casting. Even at level 25 it seemed root and debufs would still take too large a chunk of mana to be throwing around too much. Blind was great for taking or loosing agro as needed. Just be VERY sure someone is in agro range or they run and go get friends. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">A blinded mob will always pound on the nearest player in melee range, step in close and use Flash of light as recommended by others. Has the benefit of raising your divination skill too which is always underused.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">use your lowest level slow spell(level 5, Drowsy) to keep agro. It's an insane amount of taunt, and will pull agro off just about anything if chain cast. It's also a very low mana cost..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ok, question about drowsy. If you have a higher level Slow on it you of course get the &quot;will not take hold&quot; message, but do you still get the aggro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">yeh I'll have to agree, disempower spamming is probably the best all-purpose way to get aggro. Tainted breath is nice, but it has a longer cast time I think, and can break mezzes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I tanked in PoV last night for my group.  To keep agro I'd pull with slow, then Malosinia to land spells better, and then Cripple and then Blood of Saryrn.  That pissed the mob off plenty to stay on me until it turned to walk away at low health.  BoS would wear off right when the mob died.  Wasn't too intensive on mana either so we were able to chain-pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Drowsy and sit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yes, if you get the spell does not take hold message, you still get the taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Wow, I did not know that.  Very nice, I'll have to try chaining Disempower after Cripple to gain aggro from enchanters on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'm not so sure about that. I seem to remember the only way to keep agro with low lvl slow is to not have the mob slowed basically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Also look at what your chanter partner is doing.  Most early chanter DD seems to draw a lot of aggro.  Might be more efficient to have the chanter control aggro and let the mob die slightly more slowly than to have to cast all sorts of extra spells to keep aggro.  That said, the suggestions here so far are excellent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">chain cast disempower..its fast...aggros like hell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">As many have said before me, chain-casting Disempower keeps aggro like no other.  I have stolen aggro from paladins and SKs using this tactic in the low 50s.</div></div><hr />
