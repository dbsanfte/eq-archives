<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Swiftkique</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">how do you make a signature or put it on i made one and have it uploaded to site but dont know how to put it on this board</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you're using EZ-codes, for EZboards, this isn't an EZboard messageboard, so you need to use HTML.<br />

so it should look like <br />

and if you want to link Magelo, should look like this<br />

XeroOmega.<br />
Im shocked just looked at your Magelo and although most of your gear is better than mine you have about 500 less HP than me and youve got 2 levels on me.<br />
Then i noticed no ND and only 34 AA's.<br />
Quite shocked actually to see a level 70 with only 34 AA's.<br />
Not an insult just that im literally shocked you only have 34 AA's at level 70.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah, I was a casual player in a family guild, so I got to the 50's fairly slowly, but after the 50's I ground to 65 very fast, was only there for a couple of months (more helping with low-level raiding than anything)<br />
<br />
OoW came out, I decided to grind to 70 before I did any more AAs, and now that I've hit 70, I'm back on AAs, but now I'm also raiding alot more and hitting higher-level zones, I have about 5 AAs banked atm, and grinding for AA rez, it seems to be my most needed ability lately.<br />
<br />
AA's don't make the player, I've always said that playing a shaman (note I said playing, not botting) is a class of skill. gear and AAs help survivability in those situations where things don't go exactly right, but some of the best players have some of the worst gear, and some of the worst players have some of the best gear.<br />
<br />
so my AAs won't be so low after a few more days...lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">vB Code works. Your precise code from your sig (minus the carriage return) works for me:<br />
<br />

<br />
Although it's a bit big... and you'll get tired of changing the level all the time until you hit 70.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeap, vB code definitely works. My sig is a combination of vB and HTML. Samanna brought up a good point. See about making yourself a more generic signature, that way your level won't push it out-of-date so fast. Changing sigs can get real annoying if you have to do it a lot.<br />
<br />
Also, check the size of your sig ... I think the Crucible's limits are 250 pixels long by 100 pixels high, but I'm not real sure. Anyway, my sig is close, if you want to compare for size.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">SIGNATURE RULES:<br />
Size: no more than 100 pixels high, approx 250 pixels wide.<br />
LESS THAN 25K in File Size.<br />
NO java, flash, shockwave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">NO java, flash, shockwave<br />
<br />
Thought Flash and Shockwave were the same? Or at least similar?<br />
<br />
&quot; &lt; img src &quot;  <br />
<br />
Is that 'C' or machine code or something else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">HTML, Web Page code, I tend to write out HTML, as I'm used to writing out pages on Notepad, takes time, but gives me a degree of control that the quick page building programs don't.<br />
<br />
the &quot;img src&quot; portion is code tag for images. read as &quot;image source&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heh. I still use Symantec VisualPage, which they discontinuted just after Win98 came out. No fancy stuff, but I can insert whatever code I want. Wonderful product, I can't imagine making tables by hand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
HEh, when I first learnedHTMl.. years ago, against my will, I was given notepad and uhm.. notepad. didn't know anything about html or the WYSIWYG editors.. learned to make tables by hand.. terribly fun experience there... *thumbs down*  Course the knowledge is handy later when ya wanna merge table cells, and the editor doesnt have that option, but will read your code to make it work :)</div></div><hr />
