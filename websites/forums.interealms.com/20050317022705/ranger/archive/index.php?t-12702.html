<br />
Speaking as a ranger for Karana, I read from SOE a description about the planes before PoP release and they described the PoS as (paraphrasing here) &quot;Help Karana regain control over the Plane of Storms&quot;. Does this mean I will be able to quest for Karana as suggested?<br />
<br />
Also, will a 55 ranger be able to complete the trial (is it lashing?) with a full group of 60s to gain entrance into PoS?<br />
<br />
Thank you!</div></div><hr />

At 55 i thinky ou will have a hard time contributing to the group.  The trials allow a max of 6 people in them at a time, and yo have to optomize groups to produce the maximum DPS. When i did trials we were setting them up as Warrior, Cleric, Shaman, 3 DPS. All levels were 61-64 people. All extremely well geared. And even with that we still found a couple of times we were cutting it close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shooteneq1</div><div class="date">10-27-2002, 12:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">did the trials myself with a 62cleric, 61bard, 60wiz, 61warrior, 60warrior and me 61 ranger. took 3 tries to get it. we wernt optomized dps but we figred *** why not try =p anyway it wasnt overly hard but if you cant kill mobs in 30 seconds flat its over. at 55 you will be hard hard pressed to do this unless you had alot of friends that were powerfull helping you. <br />

Myself, I did execution, but only cause that's the first one we beat...kept trying anything that was open =p</div></div><hr />

Most people are trying the easiest of the trials and still getting wiped on a regular basis.</div></div><hr />

In other words, does every person in the guild need to successfully complete a trial?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ueauvan</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 05:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">and this expansion is for 46 to 65 characters?<br />
<br />
killing 4 mobs in 1 minute isnt gonna happen if you sub 60 or under geared, i know servers are top heavy but if 5 o6th plane you cant get too sorta bums me out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malevant Faeshadow</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 05:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">aoenla, everythign I have read so far seems to indicate that yeah, you have to all be flagged for the plane to get into it.  For PoJ that means getting everyone through the trials, and for other spots with larger allotments (raid level rather than group level) it means getting everyone on that raid at least once.<br />
<br />
I can't confirm this myself, I am still trying to be on at a time when I can get some guildies over to hammer through the trials.  I am a bit low, but we have a fair number of 61s, and I am hoping we can work out a strategy that gets the lower folks a chance at getting flagged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dage</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hopefully, us karana rangers can get some nice quests from the plane :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elindel</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's noteworthy to mention that the trash mobs in PoS hit as hard as Tunare muahaha :)<br />
<br />
The storm giants and other &quot;sentient&quot; types all were KoS to a karana ranger and did give faction adjustments.  I'd say killing them is a bad idea at this point for Karana worshippers.</div></div><hr />

Nice move Verant, nice to know you are holding up the old tradition /rude.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinuvian Mistwalker</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 03:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually it's cos of uber people that we have seen tier2 so far. As people level up to 65 and get more planar AAs, you'll see the trials etc get easier.<br />
<br />
The trial of execution was challenging for my guild. Took us a bit to figure out our strategy, but we got it nailed down. We were all 60/61 at the time. At 65 it'd be easier.</div></div><hr />
