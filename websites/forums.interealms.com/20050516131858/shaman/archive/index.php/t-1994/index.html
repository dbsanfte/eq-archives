<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How is it done? Ive been using a pretty ghetto method for a while, which is casting the buff to be timed in myself or my pet, then refreshing it on my group when it runs out.  But i believe this to be a very mana consuming method, so how is it really ment to be done?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can either keep 3 or 4 timers by your computer, rely on them to tell you when their buffs have dropped, or use yourself or dogdog as the timer.  These are the only options I am aware of.<br />
<br />
I prefer to use meself and Dogdog as the timer.   You're a shaman, might as well run around in a full set of buffs.  For the most part, you won't need them.  But there have been plenty of times when the heal hits you with just a few hps left, or you are able to run with few hps because your agi stayed high enough, or the extra AC let you Shaman Mez(TM) a couple of adds.<br />
<br />
Unless I am doing a lot of melee, I use myself to time the HP buff (Kragg, or Harness, or Focus), the stamina buff, the AC buff, SOW, regen, the strength buff and the agility buff.  Dogdog times haste and dex.  Before I had group versions of all of these buffs, I used to space them out aproximately 12 minutes, so they wouldn't all drop at once.  <br />
<br />
If you have Harness or focus, you can space them out even more.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, I tend to keep myself in Harness, Stamina, and Agility at all times.  During down time, I tend to do tradeskills, so the str/dex helps.... and then I always run into folks I know, so the hp are helpful for the extra mana... <br />
<br />
As far as timers go, I no longer rely on my buffs.  I frequently find the buffs on others wear off (still!) before mine do.<br />

Pretty simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I wish they would just put a little timer on the damn things (ok im lazy) :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mairi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm trying to train my tanks to send me tells when their buffs wear off. Not only do I have enough to do with my other responsibilites than keep up with who needs which buff, the new ablility we have to use /rt makes it MUCH easier to find the specific tank who needs the buff. Especially since we are now doing raids with 2 or more groups in Luclin, and I tend to keep my pc names turned off to reduce lag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bloogbloog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If I am duo'ing with my friend  I cast buffs on me and use that as a timer. In groups if I am main healer I dont buff myself and use tanks as timer and just wait till they start noticing buffs are missing. I always use myself for a timer for haste if no chanter is around...I dont like melees that take 5 min to tell me that haste is gone.</div></div><hr />

exactly :)<br />
<br />
What  do is i just give buffs to everyone, then things like regen and haste to 1 guy about 30/45 seconds before i do to anyone else.  I get the first guy to tell me when they drop, then i buff him, and repeat</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don't like to leave it for the tanks to tell me.<br />
<br />
First, they notice at the most inconvenient times.  Far better for me to notice on my own and to have a few to select when to cast.<br />
<br />
Second, I try to space my buffs.  The tanks will often not notice until several buffs have worn off.  This creates problems with my mana supply, and then repeats itself every hour or so, because now all their buffs are wearing off at once.<br />
<br />
Third, I draw enough aggro that the buffs are useful to keep on myself.<br />
<br />
Finally, I do not recommend attempting to time buffs on a raid, u<br />
nless you are just responsible for one group's buffs.  It will just drive you up the wall.  In those circumstances anyone who wants buffs must be responsible for keeping track.  <br />
<br />
It is not difficult to keep track of buffs once you train your mind to do it.  I find that it is much like slinging hash -- you are not aware of memorizing the order, or of keeping track of what everyone's drinking, but when the time comes to bring the pitcher back around, or distribute the food, you find that you know what goes where.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i never time anything, i got better things to do :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I never time my buffs either, people just tell me when they need them. If they don't notice, tough. The majority of my time spent buffing is done in raid situations, and I'm usually kept too busy doing Malo / Slow and backup healing to worry about checking a timer. I find it odd that a couple of you keep so many buffs up; I only ever use Khura's Focussng and Talisman of the Brute. When soloing I'll only use Focus of Spirit and Riotous Health, and Regrowth when I remember to. All other buffs imho are a waste of mana, unless you're fighting mobs that you need resist buffs for or are very close to an AC step (eg, 990 AC unbuffed / 1020 AC with Voice of the Beserker). Agility / Strength / Dexterity buffs are of miniscule importance I find =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've used 3 different systems, non are perfect.<br />
<br />
1) wait for tanks to bitch.  IMHO, this isn't a good way to do it.  For one, you might get caught with your kilt down and you might be LOM, other than that many tanks don't notice and don't even know what dropped.  I don't have the time to review the list on a raid or multi-group encounter.  Finally its a matter of principle, I find that tanks have a perception that a buffer who updates stuff before its finished flashing is some sort of god.  I specifically enjoy the sacrificing of the virgins.<br />
<br />
2) Use pet and self as a timer.  Problem is sometimes pets die, and timing on buffs seems somewhat flakey.  Durations are sometimes longer on pets than PCs, sometimes buff fade messages don't pop up (I've scrolled back for them, they are not there), LD kills a pet ... you get the point.  I sometimes go LD and that messes up the buff timers, also I HATE casting some buffs on myself as they are wastes of mana and I have little mana to waste in a full tilt exp bender.  I will not celerity myself unless I'm soloing.<br />
<br />
3) Macro sheet in Excel.  In my test environment this worked great, BUT I noticed that when the HDD went into sleep mode the macro timers stopped and got messed up.  I had to disable sleep mode and power save settings on my second PC, have not checked since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">More often than not your group would be just as well off without your buffs (if you have a chanter for speed that is) so I usually wait until someone asks for a certain buff.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have recently been spending time as the second shaman on some raids (Hate, Fear, CoM).  I have been on buff duty, so I have gotten pretty used to doing nothing but buffing.<br />
<br />
I have a laptop up on my desk beside my main computer and I run a utility called EQ Timer.  I got the link from a thread on here, but I can't seem to find it right now.  I use it for a spawn timer (ie. Gornit) and buff timer.  It is far more reliable than buffing myself or my pup.  It allows you to have up to 12 count down or count up timers.  Its not perfect, but it works well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I let them tell me.  If they need it, then they will notice.  Otherwise its wasting mana on something they do not require.  I am not there to babysit someone else, they need to share some responsibilities as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Cerdle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well, using group buffs, like cat, brute, group regrow, you know they are out when you are.  Then I reapply.  Single buffs I tend to hit myself up and time with that.  If there are just way too many people, I give everyone the buffs, and if they really want it again, they will let me know.</div></div><hr />

/cackle<br />
<br />
and you know what?  After a while they stop noticing... then you don't have to buff them anymore.  :P<br />
<br />
But seriously, things get MUCH easier with group focus and grp sta/agi/regen.<br />
<br />
If only there was grp haste.  :(<br />
<br />
In exp grps, I buff during fights, when I have time.  I hate sitting somewhere, then buffing, then sitting there somemore waiting for people to get mana.  People get haste first, then regen, then grp focus, then BP RH.   Then other crap like acumen... when I have time.<br />
<br />
I have always had 2 computers at my house.  When I was a younger shaman I used a program called Timeseeker to time spawns, buffs, etc.  It was pretty helpful I could see when buffs were wearing off in conjunction with spawn times of the room/area in the dungeon we were fighting in, etc.   Made it easy to see exactly how staggered the buffs were and if I would have enough time to rebuff and canni back before respawn.<br />

For easy exp grps I just buffed myself, then waited a few minutes and buffed everyone else.</div></div><hr />
