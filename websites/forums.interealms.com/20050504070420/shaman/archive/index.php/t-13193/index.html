<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been tooling around with Trip's Magelo Wish List, looking at items I can get for her at 60+ without a raid force. Now, I know the importance of getting AC to 1k, which won't be a problem with Paladin buffs stacked atop Shaman buffs, so I've been looking at HPs-vs-Mana. I want to keep a good balance, so I do want some FT as well. (I'm assuming Ornate Chain Bracers, Solstice Earring and Broken Skull Symbol of Leadership are more than enough, which would bring me to FT9 with MC3, FT12 if I tried for Boots of Flowing Slime.)<br />
<br />
How much Mana is enough? And how many HPs? At what point should I stop focusing on one and focus more on the other?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">0 Mana can be enough. Enough hp/ac that you dont visit your bind point is also enough, and those numbers will vary widely depending on how well you play and what you fight. Getting a solstice earring incidentally adds ft, but when I got mine it was for some added hp. Cannibalize &gt; FT by a pretty large margin, and I never missed not having any.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haimon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A goal I shot for was 1K+ AC unbuffed, 2100+ HP's unbuffed and 3K+ mana unbuffed. This was accomplished also without raid forces as I am in a casual, small guild. I feel it's a comfortable level that allows me to rarely go OOM and affords me a slight sense of security that I won't get decimated so long as I'm careful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">mana is importance, you know it suck when casting spell during CR, you can only cast 2 heal when become OOM ! for me, I use lvlx500 mana , lvlx400hp and lvlx1.5ac ; that is at lvl60 with 3000mana+, 2400hp+ and 900+ac<br />
<br />
Cannibalize &gt; FT is true , Cannibalize + Torpor/Q = FT30 , so having FT15 is like 1/2 canni5 ; I love my canni5, and hardly think extra half-canni5 is not in top want list.<br />
<br />
really, I don't agree HP &gt; FT, try click off your KEI (=FT14) and compare to click off some HP buff(FoS,BmB,Virtue) to find out the fact; and get xHP = FT14 for youself; I give pretty high value for X , but everyone have their own measure value</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">How did you decide that HP was better than FT?  You need a balance of course, but FT is very nice and should be a top priority.  I've got FT10 and I love it.  It noticeable increases your mana regen, which means you don't have to canni so much.<br />
<br />
As for mana... Mana is nice.  It is nice to be able to fire off a lot of blast heals without having to stop and canni.  Due to cannibalize, we do really well in healing over a long period of time, but if the **** hits the fan and you don't have time to cast kraggs or quiescence, you're going to want a nice mana pool.<br />
<br />
I'm at about 3k hp, 4k mana, and FT10, and it is perfect for my playstyle.  The focus of that statement is &quot;MY PLAYSTYLE.&quot;  Asking questions like &quot;how much mana should you have?&quot; is really really pointless.  I don't understand how you think we are supposed to answer this question for you.  Just PLAY THE GAME and you will get a feel for what you need more of.  Right now I do not feel that I am lacking in any particular area, except focus effects.  I need more of those, but my numerical stats are perfectly balanced - I just need more of all of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I for a while had around 3800-4k mana and ft7.  and it worked very well.  its enought aht you can do anything you wantand not have to worry a ton.  i seriousy find that the worst part about a bigger mana pool is getting it back. i am up to arund 4300 now and its annoying cann5 does abotu a bub of mana.  when it used to do 1/3 my mana pool.<br />
<br />
but really it depends on what ou have available.  can do anythign you want at all with a 3600ish mana pool and just everyting else is focus.<br />
<br />
and wanna echo what jinheim said.  it doesnt really matter.  sure hp is &quot;god&quot;  but a wis shaman still can do all the stuff, just maybe not the same way, and will take a bit of flak from this board.  but your stillg onna be effective if you know how to play yoru charecter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I only agree to a point on this topic.  Once u have about 3500+ unbuffed hps u can use Can5 in most situations and avoid low hp agro, after that FT starts to become more important.  Additionally in PoP Uber mob fights many of them are short and their is simply no time to use cannablize, u will simply be chain casting because the mobs die fast.  In these scenarios FT and Manapool become alot more important.  <br />
<br />
Never forgot that these things all stack, there is no reason to sell ureself short, by upgrading ure gear thats strong in one aspect and weak in another.  If u stick with gear thats a good mix of everything be it focuus effects, hps, mana, ft, regen whatever in the end ull find the most use out of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Once u have about 3500+ unbuffed hps u can use Can5 in most situations and avoid low hp agro<br />
<br />
Certainly you mean buffed, I currently only have 2300 unbuffed and around 3k buffed and have yet to get low HP agro from CannV.  And with any other classes HP buff there is no chance Ill get agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Heh, nah I actually meant unbuffed.  But when I say most scenarios I mean just about anything under the sun, meaning u dont need to be full hps to supercan, can have just lost agro from a mob that hits for 1k+, etc heh.  Realize that if u have to wait to be full health to supercan, every tick u have to wait u are losing ~ FT30 because ure next supercan will refresh that much later.  Being able to supercan at basically anytime is really key and makes a large difference in ure ability to function.<br />
<br />
Certainly depending on ure situation some of these scenarios might not apply to u and u could have less hps and still have it work out for u most of the time.  For example if ure not in a raiding guild, or perhaps not doing PoP raids, etc.  When I say 3500+ I mean from an overall perspective, at that point ure able to tackle just about anything in the game and all stats like focus effects, regen, ft, hps, resists, manapool, etc are important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Shaman are a melee class.<br />
<br />
Shamen don't have mana, work on HP and AC, but most of all a good weap, because shamen are melee.<br />
