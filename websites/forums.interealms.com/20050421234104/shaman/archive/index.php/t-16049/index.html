<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kiksis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I started a shaman a couple of weeks ago to have fun (which I am having) and to group a lot. Up to 25 I have been blasting through the levels (FOB, Kurns, Paludal) - with blasting I mean gaining near to 1 level per hour in a good group.<br />
<br />
Now since I have left Paludal, exp has dropped dramatically. I have had full groups in LOIO fort - slow exp. I went to Mares Seru as some posts here suggest - did full group, duo with warrior and solo and exp has dropped to gaining about 1 yellow per hour in all cases. <br />
<br />
Is this normal ? Should I get accustomed to this rhythm now ? Maybe I should, but the difference compared to Paludal seems huge. <br />
<br />
Do you have other suggestions/hunting grounds to try out (taking into account that I am a big evil troll) ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No, you're not doing anything wrong, just that the experience rate in Paludal Caverns is very high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hehehe You think that is slow? What until you get to the higher levels :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">do the shrooms in dawnshroud if you can handle them (might be a bit low ....)<br />
<br />
exp is awesome!  Nothing beats puadal for exp though.  I was getting a level every 30 minutes in there the other night on a twink :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes, Paludal creates very unrealistic exp gain rate expectations.  Stick to dungeon zones if you want higher exp bumps per mob - but also expect that every 10 levels or so, exp gain slows down dramatically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jahvah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The goblins in HighKeep are always fast experience.  Level 25 is perfect for the guard room, 28-34 you can move into the warrior and raider room.  Be warned about the Warrior room though, It can be tough without a full group and a bad spawn/wall agro from the raider room can kill your group quickly.  You can get a level every two hours there. <br />
<br />
The guard room and raider room are pretty safe, although the spawns are slower.  For some reason I always seem to get killed in the warrior room though.  It doesn't really bother me too much because the experience comes so quickly there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kiksis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't you need some good faction to hunt in highkeep ? i thought trolls were kos to the guards there...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jahvah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Don't you need some good faction to hunt in highkeep ? i thought trolls were kos to the guards there...<br />
<br />
For some reason I missed the Big mean troll part.  You're correct, the guards don't like trolls much there, but if you've got 20 platinum for  a couple of insta-click invis potions, or a friend to invis you, they won't bother you. Once you get into the basement beyond captain Bosec it's safe for evils, they don't wander into the goblin area.<br />
<br />
The other option, which is becoming increasingly popular, is to join a group that's killing the highpass guards. Good exp and loot there.  I haven't done it, because I'm a tradeskiller and good highpass faction is important for certain brewing recipes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Snooters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i went from 27-29 in a weekend at LDoN. i'm gonna LDoN until 34 when i get my pet then soloing becomes a much better option</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Pitter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">IMHO if you enjoyed LDoN for those levels , i would suggest that even when you get to 34 unless you love soloing or are not on during peak hours I find the quickest way exp wise to level to your early 50's is LDoN all the way !<br />
<br />
If i remember right it was something like 40ish easy LDoN's that took me from lvl 40 to 52 so certainly worth you trying that if you are looking for great exp.<br />
<br />
Only downside to LDoN is that unless you have a regular group of friends to adv with then groups will tend to suffer from people leaving , however shammys tend to always find it easy to get a grp at these lvls =)<br />
<br />
During off peak etc remember to keep your combat skills up though by soloing a few mobs.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cp from my experience, hope that helps =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bumbkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">yea just hunt a bit in Highpass to get faction up to dubious then hunt in HHK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Level 25 requires 1,891,050 xp to complete which is about 40 even con mobs, or 32 mobs that are 3 levels above you (red con). The link below is not as accurate as it once was because it does include hell levels. If you don't know what a hell level is count yourself lucky!<br />
EQ Experience tables (http://www.geocities.com/sstair/EverQuest/) <br />
<br />
At 25 HHk is likely the highest ZEM you will find but even today it tends to be over camped, atleast on Vazaelle. Mistmoore is good with the &quot;hotspot&quot; revamp of the ZEM. You can also explore some of the forgotten zone out there like Najena, Sol A, Split Paw, and Kerra Island. Dalinar and Keasor will be good once you hit 30, so will Tower of Frozen Shadow from Velious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zillanex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Did my first ldon last night with shaman, my second total so far.<br />
started with 10% xp or so ended the adventure at 68% xp at lvl 27, was pleasantly surprised at the xp, gained 27pp to from the split.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">MM or sol a till 35.<br />
<br />
zem is not far off paludal lvls.<br />
<br />
then move to COM.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>ribeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Definitely go with LDoNs until the 50's.  Not only are you getting nearly as good of xp as you would otherwise, you're also maxing out your charm (which is difficult to do later) and you're getting points towards your ldon spells.  After mid 50's, it is quite difficult to find LDoN groups...at least on my server.</div></div><hr />
