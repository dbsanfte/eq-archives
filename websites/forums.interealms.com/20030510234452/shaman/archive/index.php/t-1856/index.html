<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Togor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If you are looking for a quite place where you can solo dark blue singles all day long, East Karana may be the place for you. I was tired of looking all over for spawns in Oasis when lots of other people were doing the same thing, so I decided to move on. In East Karana there is a camp of gnoll reavers that wander all over a hill and so are easy to single pull. Just run to the right of the bridge from Nk to EK as you enter the zone. At 17 all of the gnolls were dark blue. At night undead reavers spawn. These were dark blue as well but were a little tougher but still doable. If you are careful, you won't get adds. If you do just run to the zone.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>sikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">EK is a Great solo place at even ealier levels. Basically you can easily do 9-20ish here.<br />
<br />
Start out with carrion crawlers and carrion spiders as well as the various lions, then graduate to spirit stalkers and the other hounds in turn, then reavers, then crag's post 20's. Its slow, but rewarding soloign as long as you take the time to pull to a safe spot, as mobs are very plentiful in this zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">what do you guys think is the safest method of soloing these guys?<br />
kiting or root/rot or other?</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't think so, in my 20's most were still red to me.</div></div><hr />
