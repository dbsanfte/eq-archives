<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Deian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I got 2 copies of cripple in guard in seb last night. Should I vendor them, give to someone, try to sell? What does it sell for, does it make sense to auction the thing?<br />
<br />
I'm asking because I'd hate to vendor 2 copies of a spell that's rare when I could be giving it to a friend shammie or selling them somewhere...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sell in gfay for about 100pp or just give to shamans.  We have a quest where we turn in copies of 1 of 4 spells and get 1 of 4 different spells back.  Cripple is one of the spells to turn in, so we need every copy we can get.  Thanks :D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Worthless post here: I'm just agreeing with everything Jinheim said :-P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I disagree. Doing the avatar of war, cripple is crucial to the event. As any guild that can do it, and they will tell you the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Read the thread again.  He asked whether the spell scroll itself was worth anything (as in pp), not if the spell itself was useful.  Cripple is definately an important thing to cast on big mobs, but it is a very common spell and not worth much as far as pp goes.  I've paid anywhere from nothing to 200pp for my copies :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Farbzilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think the issue is the monetary value of extra copies, not the worth of the effect it self...<br />
<br />
although i could be wrong</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree ... it's a pretty common spell. As a shaman, I would give any spare copies I had to other shamans, or use them for the spell turn in quest. I wouldn't pay more than 200pp for a copy, but as noted above it is a very useful, if situational, spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mwinda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If I found someone willing to pay more than 50pp for that spell I'd be tempted to give them a great deal on my little vacation house in Kith forest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bubar pays about ~19pp for spells in that level range.  It's fs in paper form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Cripple is also an enchanter spell, and a turn in spell for them to get Clarity 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My bad, please disregard my post. I've been out of the loop for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You can turn in Cripple in FV or the outpost in Kunark for higher-level shammy or enchanter spells.  I'd suggest doing that and then trying to sell the result, it'll be a higher-level spell.</div></div><hr />
