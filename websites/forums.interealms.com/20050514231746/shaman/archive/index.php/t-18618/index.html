That shuffling sound you hear is 10,000 bards lining up to kite just about anything they wouldn't quite manage before.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehe good point.  In all honesty, I would rather see the overnuking wizard just get summoned and die, rather than have the mob running all over the place chasing his stupid ass down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Though I'm not quite at that level of play yet, I'd imagine the ping-ponging would really piss the melees off.</div></div><hr />

You have NO idea.......makes rogues go ape and all other melees see red for days, especially on big mobs they have spent 2-3 min cornering or walling to prevent moving/decrease adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">haha but summoning is wikid.<br />
Specially when it's at 7% and kills afk rogues and rangers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">PoWater is bad enuf without that kinda crap.  I guess summoning has its usefulness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>enarcheos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I guess feign death covers that =p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">And don't forget, the mobs that are perma-rooted and summon, if you could resist their summons, would cause all sorts of havok.<br />
<br />
And don't get me going on Ping-Pong mobs. I've called melee's off a mob, that was being ping pong'd. I figured if they wanted it so badly, let them have it. And once they are all dead and done, we can continue with the raid.<br />
<br />
I was not a very forgiving raid leader. And I've the empty bottles of Jack and Aspirin to prove it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">On a related note, there was talk from SoE a while ago about adding spells for wizards to prevent mobs from Gating.  A sort of Anchor spell.  Boy am I glad that got added.<br />
<br />
Course, I never saw the list of pronounciations for Norrathian cities, people and such that Absor talked about once.</div></div><hr />
