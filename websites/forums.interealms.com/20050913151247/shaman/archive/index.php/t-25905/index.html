I dunno why, but I got a warm fuzzy when I saw that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">By the way it looks, the &quot;Bandoiler&quot; is the Devs answer to our TA / epic 2.0 problem.  I personally think that its a very stupid resolve, due to not only keep on hitting more hotkeys then I do already (I am casting non-stop as it is), but it would also mean that our focus effect on our epic would never be used on our slow spell. (not to mention the extra time it would take to hit all those keys)<br />
I kind of figured the devs would come up with some universal answer to most classes problems, that would not really resolve our problems.  And now, im sure our TA/epic problem will never be addressed again.  I wonder what they have in mind to address our DoT duration problem?  Oh wait, they did, Substitute ALL of our DoTs for the Buff proc. (No, this doesnt acutally resolve the problem, but it looks to be the answer they gave, so &quot;love it, hate it, learn to deal with it&quot;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Epic focus excludes slows anyhow.  It's meant to cover us somewhat in our secondary roles.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hasn't happened yet.  According to the party line, it's the big project this year for live developent, sorting out how all the classes fit in groups and raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Herger_Athach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have always enjoyed being a Shaman but have become increasingly frustrated with what seems to be the trivialization of our class. I came across a neat depiction of really what the shaman spirit is:<br />
<br />
I was reminded of the days when a shout of &quot;Inc MANY!&quot; would come from the raid pullers. Or worse, &quot;Opps!&quot; and then &quot;Incoming!&quot; and our four or five shaman on the raid would stride forward to engage the rising storm of mobs.  We were going out there to die, we knew it, the tanks knew it, but everybody knew that because we stepped into that meat grinder to take the edge off the attack that the enchanters would be able to mezz mobs without being resisted unto death, the clerics would be able to heal the tanks faster than the mobs would hit, and entire raid would survive to revive us back into their company.<br />

I sure hope the developers consider stuff like this. I hate the idea of being considered a 'buff bot'.  :(</div></div><hr />

Its called <br />
<br />
Vindictive Spirit (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5400&amp;source=Live) <br />
<br />
That looks like the specific type of event that spell was made for, and yep with the 100% chance of death, 5 shaman striding forward to PBAOE slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have my doubts that *anyone* could die from Vindictive Spirit ever, unless they were soloing.</div></div><hr />

I have, a few times.  Of note the north Tacvi snake spits out adds at intervals and the adds got me a few times while using this.  They hit really hard and sometimes if they get too spread out the chanters will miss one.  Gotten me killed a few times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ok, let's say that it takes quite an effort to catch aggro from it. You can basically only draw aggro and risk to die, if one or more mobs are not &quot;tagged&quot; by anyone.</div></div><hr />
