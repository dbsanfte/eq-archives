We've all seen it about a billion times.  However, someone out there made a parody of it for EQ druids and for EQ shamans.  Anyone have links to the parodies?  Will delete thread once I get them, thanks.<br />
<br />
(It came up on my guild board and I lost the links!)</div></div><hr />

Real Ultimate Power<br />
<br />
Hi, this site is all about dr00ds, REAL DR00DS.  This site is awesome.    My name is Robert and I can't stop thinking about dr00ds.  They are cool; and by cool, I mean totally sweet.<br />
<br />
Facts:<br />
<br />
1.    dr00ds are a55holes.<br />
<br />
2.    dr00ds train other people ALL the time.<br />
<br />
3.    The purpose of the dr00ds is to train somebody and steal their camp.<br />
<br />
 Weapons and gear:<br />
<br />
dr00d Sword                                    <br />

 <br />
Testimonial:<br />
<br />
dr00ds can kill-steal anyone they want!  dr00ds train other players ALL the time and don't even think twice about it.  These guys are so fawking annoying they whine ALL the time about their class.  I heard that there was this dr00ds who was like &quot;Camp Check&quot;.  And when some dude said &quot;Ancient Wurms&quot; the dr00ds trained him with a Chromodrac, THEN Petitioned the GM. (Cuz dr00ds are cool like that).  My friend Mark said that he saw a dr00d totally train a zone just because the dr00ds wanted to.<br />
<br />
And that's what I call REAL Ultimate dr00d Power!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
 <br />
If you don't believe that dr00ds have REAL Ultimate Power you better get a life right now or they will train you!!!  It's an easy choice, if you ask me.  <br />
<br />
dr00ds are such arseholes that I want to crap my pants.  I can't believe it sometimes, but I feel it inside my heart.  These guys are total fektards and that's a fact.  dr00ds are whiny, overpowered, complaining be0tches.  I can't wait to start puberty next year.  I love dr00ds with all of my body (including my pee pee).    <br />
<br />
(As you can see dr00ds and those who love them have issues)<br />
<br />
Q and A:.<br />
<br />
Q: Why is everyone so obsessed about dr00ds?<br />
<br />
A: dr00ds are the ultimate paradox. On the one hand they are a very powerful class, but on the other hand, dr00ds whine like 5 year olds who missed their nap every time they perceive another class is approaching them in abilities. <br />
<br />
Q: I heard that dr00ds are always cruel or mean.  What's their problem?<br />
<br />
A: Whoever told you that is a total liar.  Just like other mammals, dr00ds can be mean OR totally awesome.  Like when they port you for cash - they're awesome. When they want your camp, or quad train you - that's mean.<br />
<br />
Q: What do dr00ds do when they're not training or kill stealing?<br />
<br />
A: Most of their free time is spent whining on dr00d message boards about how underpowered they are, but sometimes they troll on other classes message boards too. <br />

<br />
You must be the stupidest piece of **** on this damn planet. You make a site about 'REAL NINJAS' because they are 'TOTALLY SWEET' when in fact you dont know bull**** about them, you make this **** up off of the top of your deformed head, and you even tell ppl damn screwed up lies. you call this **** factual? damnit you probably have no ****in idea what a shuriken is. ninjas don't flip out. they dont play guitars. they dont use crap like lasers. you have no idea what a pirate is. go look it up in a ****in book, i mean a REAL book. how the hell can you publish this sort of ****? ninjas CANT FLY. they CANT USE MAGIC. they dont kill whoever they want. they are really peasants trained to use stealth and to kill, using REAL weapons, such as shurikens, darts, etc. their targets were NOT pirates, they were usually important political or military figures, often they killed high ranking samurai and the like. go learn something REAL about REAL NINJAS, then you can publish that.</div></div><hr />
