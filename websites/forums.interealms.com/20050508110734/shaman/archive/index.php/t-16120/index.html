<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I was bored today, and decided to wander over to Grieg's End with a ranger guildmate and see how they changed it. The two of us zone in invis and go around the first corner and see 2 mobs in the first room. I con them, and both are dark blue to me (at 65). Interesting, since most of the stuff near the zone was green and light blue to me the last time I'd been there and I was 60 or lower then. <br />
<br />
I tell the ranger to hang back, I'm going to root one and see if I can single them so we can see how tough they are (ranger was only level 54). So I cast root and here's what happened:<br />

Nice revamp there, guys.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well we went there as well. Level 52 Cleric was able to pacify so we could get singles. just pulling that first room, you will get 3 not 2 mobs without some sort of agro-reduction spell. Worked to that first courtyard area and set up there before rl took me away from rest of group. Exp seemed decent enough at 58. Killed a named that dropped a decent 10 AC + stats shoulder item</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had the same thing happen to me as happened to Steelbear.  I can't load his pictures, but I'm assuming he tagged a mob in the first room and had every mob in the zone essentially come blasting toward him.  <br />
<br />
I went to check it out, saw a couple of blue mobs in the first room and tagged one, thinking I might get 1 or 2, or even three.  Instead, I had SCREENFULS of aggro messages and I got smoked before I could take one step by 20-30 mobs easily.  <br />
<br />
Totally botched aggro in Grieg's.  <br />
<br />
I did /feedback it, and I assume they are aware of the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Steelbear, I notice you are bound in Gunthark. I am too, and it sucks when you die soloing.... every time it happens I mean to re-bind but keep forgetting. Hope ya got a rez. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/boggle<br />
<br />
Glad I got my philosopher's stone before the zone became &quot;funner&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was able to open Steelbear's pictures by cutting and pasting the link into a new window.  Nice!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">HAHAHAHAHA!!!!  Oh man, I gotta go do that, just hope to SS the mobs before I die.  That would be so priceless to beat my ranger friend's train.  He trained (WAAAAAAY back in the day) what looked like 75% of the zone mob population to the zone in back in unrest.<br />
<br />
Sorry about your poor choice in bindpoints, Gulf of Gunthrak (sp?) to GE ... nasty.</div></div><hr />

This Thread (http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=13506.topic) on the Safehouse boards explains what they think causes this.<br />
<br />
Their theory is that if you agro one of the mobs near the zone in then leave Grieg's End, that the mob doesn't reset properly. It will return to it's spawn point, but the game will spawn another one underneath it. So, you end up with a whole bunch of mobs stacked on top of each other, innocently looking like one wimpy one.<br />
<br />
SURPRISE!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jindaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The same can occur with the Wraiths down in the PoJ basement jails.  Several levels ago while douing with a Paladin he innocently thought he was pulling 1 Wraith and about 10 came down the hall right on top of each other - stacked so close they appeared to be one.<br />
<br />
The Wraith is spawned when people walk over a point in the floor, perhaps the same occurs in Grieg's?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Probably never happens on test server either...  hehe.   Makes ya wonder if they even patch the same files from test server to live servers sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I smell 6 wiz going in there to AE the whole group....<br />
<br />
6 wiz each casting at the same time with an AE would net a couple AA in a matter of seconds.  I wonder if there is a way to intentionally get them to stack like that....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks for the warning. ouch dude.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Heres a suggestion for those of you that bind someplace like LoY that doesn't have easy access to a PoK stone.<br />
<br />
Bank a second spirit stone. Hit the bank in loy, get your spiritstone out, and click back to someplace near a PoK book. The stones are not lore and I've kept one on me and one in the bank on both my characters for a long time. As long as I'm bound anywhere near a bank I'm a click away from a PoK book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Darkpaw, that is a gem of an idea. I do have a spiritstone but it is always on me, thus the dilemma when being bound at the Dulak/Gunthark zoneline and dying somewhere. I will go get another one of these tonight and bank it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Same thing happened to me in GE recently.  Me, 58 shaman and a 62 cleric gonna have a little fun.  He pacifies 5 mobs in first room.  Says he is gonna pull and WHAM, 12+ mobs all over us.  And yes, when you look that the mobs &quot;names&quot; they do seem to overlap lending credibility to the safehouse theory.  The zone is botched for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>arfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Had two groups in Giig's last night. Another guild was there when we zoned in. They were pulling the multi mobs and aoe mez or stun then zone out while others stayed in zone invis, slowly keelin the laggers o fthe train. We were impatient and together the three groups did the pbaoe thing with melee wailing away. Was ever so much fun. Went on to crawl the zone, and got good xp, modest loot. Very nice break from bot.</div></div><hr />
