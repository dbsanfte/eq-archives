<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I killed Alex McDarnin today for revenge  :p The bastard wouldn't ever let me buy my own spells as a young Shaman and I wanted to find out why. He's the Shaman turn-in spell quest NPC in the Barbarian hut on the dock in FV. My Iksar has max Firiona Vie faction but this one NPC still threatened me. Well it's because the boneheads of Verant put him on Merchants of Halas faction. He lowers 3 Halas factions when you kill him, doesn't drop loot, respawns fast after death.<br />
<br />
Merchants of Halas faction:<br />
Alex McDarnin - quest NPC<br />
Broawn Goshart - merchant<br />
Dorg McMerin - merchant<br />
Rafron Brandin - merchant<br />
<br />
Firiona Vie faction:<br />
Marlyn McMerin - merchant / quest NPC<br />
Shelae Wolfkin - the spell merchant</div></div><hr />

You keeled muh homey in FV! *grrrr* LOL ;) I've always wanted to keel Tundra Jack, myself, but  haven't been able to bring myself to do it. I know faction is irrelevant for the most part these days, but it would just feel too weird to go whack guards in my hometown. I'm just an old softie I guess. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tundra Jack can be annoying, but I always wanted to off Iceberg.....   Even when I'm a bearclothes, all he does is growl at me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>uklugh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I still havent bothered getting all my kunark vendor spell due to that bastard. I hunted goblins for a week at level 47 to get my faction high enough to be able to get spells for myself. Was pretty disappointed when i noticed i was non kos everwhere but in the shaman hut =(</div></div><hr />
