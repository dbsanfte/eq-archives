<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cloaks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am considering creating a shaman to play with my boyfriend. But we want to be sure we can duo successfully at higher levels. So I wanted to know how well shaman dots will stack with necro dots? I know there are nukes and much more. But I have seen little info on how well shaman dots stack with others. Thanks for any information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They stack unless they are of the same name. I.e. you can't have two plagues/ebolts on a mob at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kalrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Some of my best grouping has been with a necro in my guild.  We can fear kite or slow and mele.  And as long as he knows that I am using EBolt, he pulls out a different one and usues that.  He has many more DoT choices as a necro than I have as a Shaman.  Go for it!  It is a great combo.</div></div><hr />

I specifically worked a necro up (running 2 puters) so he could PL me to 60 on my shaman. You have to be a HP/AC shaman to do this really but in the high end game its not that hard. I just tanked while the pet beat his ass down (no pet taunting). In chardok with the necro 53 rogue pet I could clear the hall and the front casltle and a few side spawns out of the side tunnel before repops (this was at L59). <br />
<br />
At lower levels you will probably be fear/dot kiting with necro/sham pet.</div></div><hr />
