<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm slowly working my Shaman's levels and had my eyes on factioning/leveling in Nurga/Droga. What would be the best level to start hunting there? My Paladin has AEd in Chardok so much I'd keep the faction turn-in items for him, but I figured poking the MoB a few times to help my Shaman kill it will work his faction up along the way as well. SWCs are an amazing item and I wouldn't getting a pair--one for Kryss and one for Trip. For those that have done the factioning there, do you think staying there until the MoBs green out will be enough for Chardok Quest faction?</div></div><hr />
