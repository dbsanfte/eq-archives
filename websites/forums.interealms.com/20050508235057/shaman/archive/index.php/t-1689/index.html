I agree with this, I'm personally going to get 60 before I put any points into AA.</div></div><hr />

My axp path was -<br />
3 run,<br />
3 regen,<br />
3 mental clarity,<br />
mass group buff,<br />
cann5.<br />
<br />
Hindsight being what it is, I think any shaman with torpor and 2k unbuffed or more hp should get cann5 first.  It helps immensely.  MGB is great too.<br />
<br />
Next for me is gunna be rabid bear for some fun... Then back to trudging for the more usefull stuff (aka - spell casting mastery).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I did run3 at...56 I think, then regen3 at 58. Why? Because leveling gets boring, especially when you're not much more powerful than you were before. I needed something to break the monotony and make me more powerful in a tangible way. Maybe it's psychological, but one thing is certain: run3 will eventually save your ass if you're as insane as me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>bearknukl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">call me silly but im going for the 10wis points using up 5 points<br />
and then im putting 3 into regen.  yep its 8 points as apposed to 6, but all i can say is oh well. <br />
<br />
I'm only level 55 and i've gotten one of my points already.  but the way i figure it, there are tons of people with many high level alts and not one character at 60, no one says much about it to them, so i figure i wouldn't mind seeing the word Baron pop up infront of my name.<br />
<br />
anyway<br />
<br />
I want the 10 wis points so i can start switching wis gear for AC/hp gear.  Starting with at least one of my 7 wis rings.  I figure...i've never been in many dungeons in which im not with guild or not with a cleric.  I've never been in a dungeon where I've run to zoneline to escape mobs (maybe once or twice in velks but thats not a far run), well not since level 30 anyway.  At 60 i'll have torpor and snaring myself left and right.  With me its stand and die fighting on you're way down, running is for the bards.<br />
<br />
was also thinking about putting 5 points for 10 sta, considering as how that seems to be the stat that everyone is swearing by this month.  may be doing this completely wrong, but since im having fun doing it i don't much mind :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Velarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yeah go for what you like, not what someone else &quot;dictates&quot; you to do.... <br />
<br />
Personally I've put mine into Runspeed 3 and Innate Regen 3 all at level 52, cause I wanted to do some more naggy and vox raids before I levelled.<br />
<br />
I've also saved 6 points up for Mental Clarity at level 55, cause I'm the explorer type, besides I really don't wanna get a level and not have my spells to scribe, so I'm also getting my spells before I level... but that is just me hehe<br />
<br />
Getting spells is the difficult part as many our level 55 above spells are not easy to get, but I know that Focus of spirit drops on PoG and Bane of Nife and Tirgirs Insects drops in Jugs in Seb (places where I got mine)<br />
<br />
Khuras Focussing I got from my brother and Torpor also drops off Gore which can be killed by a single group.... hehe and that is a fact....</div></div><hr />

ugh, dont get your hopes up.  RB is like finding a dollar bill in the pocket of your winter coat.  Hey thats kinda cool, then 30 seconds later, your back to doing what you were doing beforehand.  those are 5 points i really wish i had back :mad: <br />

On sullon zek there was a guy who quad-comped 4 inkie wizards (yes he had 4 chars going at the same time. Probably two comps each running 2 eqW's or something similar) <br />
<br />
I think the guy quit after a while, alot of people loved him alot hated him. He was a proffesional gamer, he even claimed to invent alot of the &quot;Strategies&quot; for lots of stragetic games like Civ and AoE, and he thought he was all that a bag of potato chips.<br />
<br />
Just thinkin tho.. if this guy's still around imagine the havoc he could cause. Even when he was lvl 20 i remember him killing whole gangs of people at a time.<br />
<br />
Anyone still play on Sullon and seen/heard of this guy? the guy was Samdaman.. dont know the characters names but that was his message board alias. Maybe one of the chars was named Samdaman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Ive been reading all these posts about getting to lvl 60 before doing aa exp and was sticking to that myself. But than i got to thinking about the fact i am in a small guild that seems even smaller atm since so many people are m.i.a. Might be hard for me to get people together to do spell hunts like in juggs and i dont have the money for em yet so instead of getting to 60 without a chance yet to get the good spells figure i may as well at least get 6 points of aa exp and make some cash at the same time. Seems like a good idea but am i missing something? <br />
<br />
Maybe more pickup raids out of guild or just with friends for getting spells? Just atm seems like no rush to get to 60 when i wont have the torpor , malo etc or even bane of nife unless i buy them myself or change guilds but i like my guild even if its small atm and dont want to leave just cuz i want spells.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Some of you will loath me for this, but with summer almost here, I'm wondering how many AA points I can get in Soupy/Krones place. I'm a barb tho, will I be trashing any faction that I relatively need? I'd give up faction to lvl/AA that freekin fast. As long as it isn't THAT bad on the faction(s). Now, the questions...<br />
<br />
(1) What lvl do I need to be to do this without worry of being slaughtered should something go wrong. Like, what lvl will the spells be sticking on a normal basis, should their MR, PR, CR, DR be normal like other joe shmoe mobs?<br />
<br />
(2) Any special piece of gear I need to optimize my abilities while there? I can sit at the IGs for a few days farming cash if I know later on I'll be leveling/AAing like a madman. I'm thinking JBB, maybe even a cheapo-ghetto horse.<br />
<br />
(3) How often is it camped?<br />
<br />
Garf</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I personally did it at 54 with JBB, Fungi and Epic.  With that lot I could just about keep all the spawns clear indefinately.  I would definately recommend the JBB for this, the others are luxuries that without you will prob have to stop once in a while just to restock on some health and mana.<br />
<br />
The camp is excessively easy.  Closest I came to dying was just after I dinged 55 when at half health and about 20m me dog went for a wander and brought back 2 bards, issabella and 3 guards.  I wouldnt have survived that without root/epic/fungi, but that was the only problem I had there in doing half of 54 and 6 aa points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Even safer 2box'ed with my 53 warrior and 54 shaman except one thing. Isabella spawns in the same room as the 2 bards. She will start walking about a bit and makes a right out of the bard room and the next left into the dinning room. Well i had been set up right where she paths through in the dinning room which was fine when i was killing all the spawns but i dinged my first point with my shaman and my wife was throwing the frisbee for our pup so i went afk few to join them without moving from there. I came back in and had forgot after awhile your con drops with isabella i was at glaring and she pathed into my shaman. She was halfish health with the dog beating on her i was under a bubble of health and luckily channeled a heal off. There are safe places to afk there but the inbetween the doorways of the dinning room isnt one of them lol.<br />

I never had a JBB for this camp, so it's not necessary to the camp, it's simply a tool for getting VERY fast experience. <br />
<br />
At any rate, here's my immediate path:<br />
<br />
regen3 (obtained prior to nerf)<br />
sta5 (HP is king)<br />
mc3 (no choice)<br />
canni5</div></div><hr />

/shrug - each to their own though :)  I'm currently level 55 and I have AA at 50%, my personal goal is to be a Baron this level, then I might get 56, then some of the 55 AA abilities ... I'm in no great hurry to hit 60 when I have no hope of getting the higher level spells.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>lokinoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Sombody explain to me again the benifit of having Run3?<br />
<br />
Seems to me that I hardly if ever have to run in a dungeon.  Seems like the few times when you might (only in Seb have I have I ever done this) need to run it's not worth the points you put into it.<br />
<br />
Could just be me...<br />
<br />
regin3<br />
wis(or sta)3<br />
MC 3<br />
then lvl 60<br />
<br />
I figure that grinding to lvl 60 will seem better if I gots the skillz first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Run3 is the AA bargain deal of the century... 3 points for indoor jboots speed at all times. Most of the time I'm indoors and never have sow, making run 3 priceless. It's saved me numerous deaths as well.<br />
<br />
I don't recommend doing any more than run3 until level 60. Regen 3 is pretty minor, and MC3 is a total waste of 12 pts IMHO until you spend the other 5 and get Cannibalization.<br />
<br />
For me:<br />
Level 60 (was 60 before Luclin came out :)<br />
Run 3<br />
Regen 3<br />
MC 3<br />
Cannibalization<br />
SCM 3<br />
Either Quick Buff 2 or Mass Group Buff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Gathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I did...<br />
<br />
Run3.  Do not kid yourselves.  This skill is incredibly nice to have.  Today I was farming for Lucid Shard in akheva, and our spoony bard managed to trigger like 4 traps.  I was running in circles with 75 hp left or so and 12 mobs chasing me for 2-3 seconds before evac went off.  That was just an hour ago.  2 hours before that, it let me get far enough away from a mob that resisted slow twice and had it fade to root, torpor self, and reslow.  It saves my life several times a day.<br />
Regen3.  Lack of anything better to put it in, really.<br />
Mental Clarity3.  Very painful 12 points, especially so early on in luclin, as JBB crit'd with spell casting fury back then.<br />
Cannibalize 5.  Easily worth the 5 + 12 points it required.  I'd've paid twice that.  It's just a great skill, every shaman owes it to themselves to get it asap once they hit 60.<br />
Quickbuff1.<br />
Rabid Bear.  I got impatient, and I like to pvp.  Not that useful, but it's been fun.<br />
Quickbuff 2 and 3.  Got this ages before focus items.  Kinda regret level 3 now, just a kick in the teeth how useless focus items make it (after focus items patch I logged on with spell haste 3 and enhancement haste 3), but still, 3.0 torpor is nice.<br />
Working on Reinforcement now, couple points til level 3.  I mainly want it for avatar, regrowth, celerity, and rabid bear - not focus, sta, etc.<br />
<br />
I'd've done SCM3, but I simply do not have mana issues.  I can't spend it as fast as I get it back when I have kei (which I almost always do).  Same reason I didn't get mass group buff.  9 points to save myself 75 seconds on a raid every 2 hours or so?  No thanks, maybe after I max healing adept or innate cha.<br />
<br />
Debating between SCM (despite the above...it's still nice to have more mana I guess, just no real rush) and Channeling Focus next.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Level 60 (I wised up) Mental clarity 2 (Bye bye 6 points)<br />

Pissed off in Umbral plains because I could not heal the warrior with stinking chloroblast properly, I blow 2 points on healing crits.<br />

700 point Chloroblasts are fun, and Lifetap healing from werewolf proc for 140 cant be beat with a stick. (Combat fury proc for the initial lifetap of 70 and critical heal doubles that to 140. Wheeee)<br />

Then I got Torpor. Spell casting reinforcement 1 had to happen.<br />

(And Neverwinter nights is calling as well. And this damn real life and its booze and women, and movies, and women, and women at movies drinking booze is death on good xp gain... (Sigh)<br />
<br />
Oh well at least I don't need to kill anymore of the damned Guardian wyrms, unless I want to.   Bastards!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Athame</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I did:<br />
<br />
- level 60<br />
- run 3 <br />
- regen 3 (= Baron)<br />
- mental clarity 3 (= Venerable)<br />
- canni 5<br />
- rabid bear<br />
- pet discipline<br />
- mass group buff (= Elder)<br />
- healing gift 1<br />
- casting reinforcement 1<br />
- casting mastery 1<br />
- channelling focus 1<br />
- retire<br />
<br />
If I hadn't been retiring I'd prolly have tried for either quick buff 3 (18 total) or casting reinforcement 3 + casting reinforcement mastery (20 total). Those two both rock in their own way. Mainly for torpor, and remember focus items won't help for torpor.</div></div><hr />
