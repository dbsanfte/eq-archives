<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wampaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Finaly got epic at 58 and was looking for some tips on hunting grounds. I havent soloed much since 48. Spend most of my time grouped in KC, then OS. First night with epic I did giants in Kael and WL for faction. Last night I tried the grey and boy was it fun! No down time at all. I parked doggy, pulled a single mob with slow. Pulled to camp, added epic dot and let doggy chew down. Re-aaply epic when needed and occasionaly a cold nuke(no jb) I had Zero downtime! With OBS and regrowth and cann i was fm after every fight. I havent got exp this fast in ever! Can anyone else recoomend a few other spots when I get bored in the Grey? Only bummer was I got summoned by a small train of these little rock guys and pumeled to death. ive been hunting in a corner and pulling iksar slaves and rock guys. Any other suggestion will be appreciated. I prefer outdoor zones and warrior type mobs. I hate casters or mobs with special abilities. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm doing Katta now at 59, that's nice, outdoors and always warriors. Downside, it is very heavily camped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zalaton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">try Katta.<br />
It's boring, but dedicate a week there, you'll get 60.<br />
I've never seen more than 2-3 campers there on fennin, and theres easily 6 spots in zone you can fight if others are taken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">On MT Katta is very undercamped. I have never not found a place to camp there , usualy its just me and some passerby's. I always get my Vampire guard camp :)</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Camps in Katta include:<br />
<br />
1.  Back of bank, pulling both tunnels<br />
2.  Front of bank (&quot;Courtyard&quot; on The Tribunal), pulling 6 statics in courtyard and the guard up the first stairs.<br />
A well equipped shaman will be bored doing just the courtyard, but will not really keep up with both tunnels and the courtyard, so on my server it is usually treated as two camps.  A 60 monk/necro/mage can do both of these.<br />
<br />
3. Nathyn's guards (two sonic wolf guards - no negative faction to Katta)<br />
4.  Twilight Sea sone in - 6 statics and 2 roamers, easy to split the statics.<br />
5.  Tunnels - zone in from twilight and go right, follow walkway to first tunnel.  pull on line of sight - if only one guard can see you, only that one will come.  a roamer, 5 static, and another roamer from zone in if no one is killing them.<br />
6.  barracks - or &quot;the other tunnels&quot;  go left from twilight zone in.<br />
<br />
7. graveyard\gargoyles.  the gargs are higher than the guards, and much more resistant to poison and disease.  better for level 60, but not necessarily for shaman.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of guards on the upper level (around zone in from tenebrous).  I have seen wizzies quadding up there.  Not usually called as a camp on my server.<br />
<br />
Go - look around (nothing sees through invis).<br />
