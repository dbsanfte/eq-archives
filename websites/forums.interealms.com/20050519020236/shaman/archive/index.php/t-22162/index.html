<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So - let me make sure I have this right... &quot;we&quot; want:<br />
<br />
1) Improved healing - to rival or nearly rival a druid's power and for that level of competency to remain permanent through whatever expansions are yet to be introduced.<br />
<br />
2) Better Nukes - faster, harder, or cheaper - or all three is even better<br />
<br />
3) Better DoTs - faster, bigger/tick, less agro - we want them to act faster for more damage and less agro<br />
<br />
4) Useful buffs - despite the fact that every single person that argues this point will state that people don't need the stats even if they are NOT capped, we still want better buffs.  Despite what is coming in OoW, we still don't feel like we're getting enough in this category - bigger HP buff at a bare minimum.<br />
<br />
5) Group versions of some things - Group Quiescence and FA for starters - regardless of people not &quot;needing&quot; FA we still want a group version - despite a group HoT coming in OoW (iirc) we still need to hammer this home<br />
<br />
6) Better melee ability - we should have melee capabilities equal to a cleric since we're both priest classes.  Make Rabid Bear clickable every 5-10 minutes.. or less even.  Oh! and Bash... we need Bash.<br />
<br />
7) Upgrade to OUR slow - but nothing to any other class's.  We need a fast cast, low resist slow.  Wait - we have that... I mean we need a slow with the full capabilities of Malos built in - which I guess makes it unresistable?<br />
<br />
8) We want all racial exp penalties taken away.  We want to keep the racial abilities but we don't want to pay for them any more.<br />
<br />
9) We want our pet to shrink.  Can't forget this one - despite the fact that our pets suck and are so rarely used on raids anyway.<br />
<br />
10) Oh Pets!  We need Beastlord-quality of pets with innate dual-wield, riposte, another 2K hitpoints, and a snare proc.<br />
<br />
PLEASE remind me of other things we're complaining about.  There are just too many whiney bitchy threads on these boards that I just can't keep track of them all... and I KNOW I have overlooked SOMETHING that I'm supposed to be crying about.<br />
<br />
Oh, and for the mentally-impaired, this is sarcasm.  This, however, is what everyone is seeing... thread after thread of DEMANDS and complaints and argument.  Each day someone creates a couple more threads to complain about something &quot;new&quot;.  It's gone from being a cry for help to just crying.<br />
<br />
Gloriana and the other mods - I respectfully ask you to create a new forum for these kinds of posts.  I, for one, am tired of coming here - it's nothing but this crap now.  If you don't feel like making another forum, I understand... just as people are saying to SoE &quot;fix it or I'll leave&quot;, I'll just move along from this place as well.<br />
<br />
It's time for shaman to stop already.  I'm pretty damn sure SoE has heard our issues at this point.  We would have been 10x more effective to have focused on a single (or maybe 2) issues and really driven it home.  We've been labeled now, and it's our own fault.  We're not the squeaky wheel begging for grease any more - we're now viewed as the three year old child that is throwing a tantrum so loud that it's deafening... and that's just plain embarrassing to be associated with.<br />
<br />
And before some idiot posts saying that I don't know what the hell I'm talking about - I agree that we are defficient as a class.  I would even agree that we need work in some combination of those things listed above - my point is that on any given day we see more belly-aching about them ALL.  It's unconstructive and has done little other than to alienate us from those people who could help us.</div></div><hr />

I am sorry you personally dont like to wade through posts detailing how we would like to be fixed.<br />

Granted its the op's choice if they wanted to move it all to a sub board.. but I for one like it just as it is.<br />

Very good point, Mcroc - but I posted with more than a desire to ridicule... I am hoping that maybe we can funnel this &quot;energy&quot; into a new forum so that the rest of the board isn't constantly besmirched with it.  It leaves people a place to go vent if they need, but doesn't disrupt things like it has recently.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh, We get bash  :D  or maybe its slam I forget, but large races get this if they have a shield if I am not mistaken.  I know this was sarcasm but man know your class before posting sarcastic things about abilities that we alread....oh what the hell nm  :p  /jk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Beriah, you're out of line. UgZug is a respected poster who has contributed a hell of a lot to these boards (please check out the alchemy section).<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I firmly agree with our &quot;request&quot; threads. For the first time in my memory, we actually have developers asking us directly what we would like. Hell yes, we're going to tell them. My delight in my shaman is lessened all the time. Unless we get some fixes QUICKLY, I'll be gone and I know I won't be the only one.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to hide those posts in a forum that isn't easily found by those who the posts are intended for. The posts are pretty easy to avoid, if you don't want to read them.</div></div><hr />

I agree totally. For those who do not want to see the complaint threads it means at worst having to click once or twice more to get to the buried posts.<br />

It isnt the fact that he posts more than you. It is that over the years he has contributed more than you. <br />
<br />
When you meet someone for the first time and they are cursing like a sailor and foaming at the mouth do you stop to carry on a conversation. Now people that you have known for a long time and they rant and foam then you naturally club em over the head a few times (Wait Not a barbarian in RL excuse me) Umm where was I... Oh yes when thier pisstivity level is past max you try and calm em down then see what you can do to help or at least defuse the situation.<br />
<br />
I am tired of the whinging. But you know what. I am much much MORE tired of not having the fun that I used to have. And this lack of fun is directly laid at the developers feet. I still have fun in older content. Even though I have done it lots. In older content I am a valued member of a group or a raid. And So Since I started playing again I am doing the older content that I have done lots before.. But is that going to keep me playing? No it will not.<br />
<br />
Thier choice really. Fix shaman and or the content. Or watch many people walk. I walked once I can do it again really easy now cause it really doesnt hurt. I came back because friends begged me to. But even friendship is strained when you are doing the same thing that you have been doing for years. <br />

It has nothing to do with his post count, but the fact that he has contributed a lot to the site with good knowledgeable posts.<br />
<br />
@UgZug<br />
<br />
I agree with you, the boards just seem to be full of unhappy campers at the moment. It's not just our board but nearly all the classes. Yes I know that sony dropped the ball when they released GoD (The most aptly named expansion yet, because they've had nothing but discord from the userbase since it's release.) but even so the Crucible has really gone to the dogs.<br />
<br />
I always thought that Kelly Flock was a bit of a twat when he said this in an English magazine article back in 2001.<br />
<br />
&quot;When asked if he takes into account consumer input Flock is dismissive, relying instead on the expertise of his staff. &quot;No, we never talk to consumers – they just f**k us up. Someone asked for a copy of our market research which made us take the decision to do EverQuest. I said we hadn't done any market research. Had we done, the game would never have been made. We never focus on them. Gamers don't know what they want. We just want to know if they have a valid credit card.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm begining to see what he means though now. The devs are doing a good job of breaking the game, but if it was left to the users between the classes we'd screw it up good and proper.<br />
<br />
It's a shame but for me EQ has lost its shine, and I doubt that there is much that can be done to fix it.  :(</div></div><hr />

Yeah, Gloriana, this is the second time I've seen you base the validity of someone's opinion on whether or not you've heard of someone before, and now, basically post count.<br />
<br />
Please quit using criteria such as this to deride people that aren't deemed as uber as you or anyone on these boards.<br />
<br />
For the record, the first time was when some poor person mentioned they responded to the post on EQ Forums for the correspondent position... you're response &quot;who are you again?&quot;<br />

I mean really, we all know the saying, opinions are like a-holes... everyone has one and everyone else's but yours stinks.  So sure, if someone's an idiot, call them out, just don't use the fact that someone has a gazzillion posts on these boards as some sort of sign that the person is an unrivaled genius.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">That first post does point out one of the bigggest hurdles we face as a class. The simple fact is that there are many many different ways to play a Shaman, with subtle yet disctinct differences in all of them. And it will be impossible to please all of the people all of the time. <br />
<br />
I dont mind the rants so much. What bothers me is the redundancy of them, and the fact is, I do it myself. Its hard not too. Most of the issues are very real. Personally, it wont take much to keep me happy. I love the game itself, and can always manage to find a niche. <br />
<br />
As far as some peoples opinions having more value, I do not think anyone bases those opinions on post count. I think quality of post is the basis MOST people use. Some of the opinions I respect the most are not the highest post count guys. And some of the opinions I pretty much ignore have BIG post numbers, heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He did not, if you read it carefully he is mocking us.<br />
<br />
Basically to illustrate his point that he thinks we are whining and asking for WAY too much he exaggerated his list on purpose.<br />
<br />
I am sorry in retrospect that I insulted him directly and therefore everyone gave me bad rep pts.. *SOBOMGMYREP* but I honetly was pissed he was mocking the fact that we are asking to be fixed.<br />
<br />
If he thinks we should shut up.. fine thats his opinion.. but to go out of his way to write up a list to mock us was not very nice IMO.<br />
<br />
And I am the one with bad rep pts.. go figure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Just adding my 2cp about several issues this thread brought up. If my low post count hinders people from taking into account my opinion, then so be it. Not everyone signs up an account here on the same day their character was created. Anyway...<br />
<br />
About the various &quot;request&quot; posts. I think that unless people communicate what they see as problems AND attempt to offer solutions, things aren't likely to change. For example, complaining about healing and offering possible alternatives for consideration are more likely to be received better than just the complaining. Whether your alternatives are acceptible to the community at large or to SoE or not, at least you're trying to offer something constructive. And it helps to rule out other alternatives. I think such posts DO have a place where they can be seen by the community and by SoE, should they deem to visit here. And if not, someone should take the good ideas to them! :)<br />
<br />
Second, I agree that everyone has different ways to play the shaman class. And to be honest, that's one of the things I love about the class. It CAN be played different ways and as such it is easy to love the versatility. Are there problems with the class? Of course. ask any of the classes in EQ and you will get a list a mile long of things they'd like to see fixed or improved with their class. This morning alone, I was hunting with a high level paladin with a good reputation who was speculating about OOW spells for his class, and thought it would be great for his class to get Complete Heal and Virtue. Are they necessary for his class? He didn't think necessary, but thought it was next in the line of progression for paladins. Mages are often lobbying for some form of mob control (used to be root, but now I think they have their guns set on snare) to help them when pulls go bad to assure less dying. These are examples; every class has them, and more. As such, while SoE is addressing various class issues, they have a lot of issues to sift through. Patience will be needed. I'm sure eventually the shaman class will get some SoE loving. Whether it's too late for most people, or too-little,-too-late I am uncertain. But rather than putting down other classes for gains they get, we should be cheering them on, just like we'd want them to cheer us on whenever we get some changes.<br />
<br />
I'm not a big fan of whining. I try to post only when I feel I have a point to make, or to seek clarification or advice. Yet even I get upset from time to time. After all, despite being trolls, ogres, vah shir, iksar and barbarians in game, we are all human on the inside and prone to having feelings and passions about things, especially a game like EQ.<br />
<br />
As for the initial post, it was a few lines down (#6, I think) that I was saying to myself &quot;he can't be serious about wanting all these things!&quot; I'm glad to see it was done in sarcasm (might have preferred in jest) and not a serious post. The seriousness of his post was after the list, not the list itself. <br />
<br />
Enough of my rambling. Gee, I get long winded sometimes. For those still reading, thanks for hearing me out...<br />
<br />
EDIT: for spelling changes....I want people focusing on the content of what I said and not my typing skills.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Many of the posts about us wanting some balanced were well documented, well written, well thought of. Yes, there are some 'bad sheep' who whine all day, but most do not. We have issues, we raised our voices, what else could we do.<br />
After some time now we begin to repeat ourselves. Most has been discussed to shreds now, so maybe we should sit back and watch what will happen. Don't get me wrong, I am not very optimistic about the future of the shaman, but talking about the same stuff again and again is just flat out boring.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">This seems to be a running thread with our class, our greatest strengths are also our greatest weaknesses. <br />
<br />
We have slow, and SoE uses that as the reason not to address our healing issues.<br />
<br />
We have Canni, and SoE uses that as the reason not to address our mana cost issues.<br />
<br />
We are a very versitile class, and we cannot agree on what needs to be fixed, because of all the different play styles our class can and does use.<br />
<br />
Each style has its own issues that need to be addressed, which creates a huge problem for us when presenting things to the developers. That problem is the size and scope of what we are requesting. I would not be surprised to find out that some one is taking one look at our list of issues and just shaking thier head with a comment along the lines of &quot;They want all that?&quot; At the same time, no style of play that works is any less valid than another. To address some styles and exclude others is not fair and we know it. <br />
<br />
There is one issue that needs to be addressed before the fixes though, and maybe we can come together as a community on it. The vision of what a shaman is. We had that with Brad and Company running things, and they stuck to it very well. We were a very good class while that was in effect. The current vision statement, and I use the term loosely, on the SoE site is not as clear cut. That lack of clarity has resulted in the Dev team making rote changes to our class, which may look good on paper, but do not function well in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Warren Maguson Emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">In deference to you, Gloriana, whom you know I respect enormously, Ugzug's tone simply sticks in my craw so to speak.  <br />
<br />
<br />
He makes a post insulting anyone he considers whining and as we've been unable to determine what the base line for whining is, we can simply assume he's insulting anyone who's posted their opinion (&quot;Request&quot; threads) in the General forums.  <br />
<br />
Anyone who can make a broad based statement like that can stand to bear up under some scrutiny and frankly it also stinks as much as he claims whine threads do. <br />
<br />
My objection derives from the fact that it's easy enough to avoid a undesirable thread, no one forces you to read it.  People making statements, rants, complaints, whines about other people making statements, rants, complaints, whines is about as equally non-productive and insulting.   They get to reap the benefits of any productive &quot;whining&quot; (as many people pointed out, SOE seems to respond to the loudest and most vocal of posts) while maintaining a pristine image of, &quot;Hey, I didn't whine about it.&quot; and be smug.  It's a poser attitude and I simply don't like it (as in people getting away with it).  Especially in the face that I've contributed to my fair share of 'whining' recently which I'm more than willing to own up to.  I know for sure my real life friends are  sick of me bringing it up but at least they're educated on Shaman issues   :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Anyways, a bit of mutual respect for each other is what I would advocate and if I wanted people to tone down the 'whineplay' some, I would politely ask as opposed to simply thumbing my nose at everyone who has expressed an opinion so far.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Joril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">WEEEEE my turn!<br />
<br />
He is tired of all the ranting and moaning, so he posts another thread doing the exact same thing?  why couldnt he just reply to one of the innumerable threads that already have such non-sense.<br />
<br />
if you have played this game for any length of time you know two things... <br />
<br />
ONE...the more you bitch and moan about something the more likely it is to get fixed.  this is a fact.  not an opinion, not an observation.  just saying something is broken and waiting accomplishes nothing.. alchemy isnt working right...... years later.......  you see my point<br />
<br />
TWO... spells as they are on test is how they will appear on the 'live' servers 90 precent of them time.  again this is a fact based on SEVEN expansions worth of history.  the time to rant and rave (see point one) is BEFORE the expansion goes live.  the developers are moved off fixing things and put to work on the nexty expansion...again another fact.<br />
<br />
you dont like the bitching and moaning, then dont do it.  complaining is the ONLY way to get things fixed.  why do think they had that recent dinner farce?  BECAUSE EVERY CLASS was bitching and moaning, and more importantly LEAVING...see the couple major guilds that left bascially enmass.  <br />
**** yes a couple minor things came out of the gathering, but nothing that wasnt already on every class board to begin with.  i havent seen one major item that was asked for implemented.<br />
<br />

Ah I remember your name, I have to admit that is a fantastic guide and served me well when I was doing alchemy. <br />
However, in reference to this post I do think you are being overly dismissive of the concerns of shaman and concerns of the different staged people, ie the concerns of a new person is likely to be different than that of a player that has played more.<br />
<br />
I mean seriously, if it was not for what is perceived as whining, there would be little change to shamans as several posters have mentioned. I did this example once, this shopkeeper sold only 2 flavours of crisps, he was not aware that people wanted more flavours. If any request by consumers to sell more types of crisps is perceived as whining then it does nothing to satisfy the customer or boost the shopkeepers sales.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you had read everything I wrote, you would see that I agree that our class has problems.  You would also see that I would encourage discussion about it.<br />
<br />
What I am ashamed of is that EVERY day a NEW post is created.  EVERY day there are NEW complaints.  EVERY day the squalling is louder and more UNfocused.  My point was two-fold:<br />
<br />
a) We should have focused on one or two MAJOR issues and worked to have those addressed.  The shotgun approach only works if you hunt ducks or bar flies at closing time.<br />
b) Since we did NOT do a), I feel we need to get control over the rampant lynch mob mentality.  My suggestion was to create another forum where all of the rants, flames, and complaints could be stored and the people who choose to feed off that anger and malice could hang out there.  Thus preserving SOME semblance of what these boards used to be.<br />
<br />
For those of you criticizing Gloriana saying that she weighs my opinion greater than yours - also please notice that she disagreed with me and agreed with those of you who see value in this multitude of threads.<br />

<br />
If you can't see that from the way people are responding to you then i think YOU should double think your stance or at least your approach.<br />
<br />
<br />
This attempt at sarcasm just belittles everyone who posted in an opinion in some form.  Perhaps its whining but so what?  Last I checked in America it was one's God and gods given right to complain.  If people don't like hearing the 'whineplay' they just flip the channel and tune it out, also a right.  <br />
<br />
Out of respect for Blazz's opinion of you and courtesy for you, I'll refrain from making personal attacks against you but I really take exception to your approach at trying to get people to stop whining.  What you did was only insult a lot of people who are simply trying to vent or be heard.<br />

You probably don't want to censor these folks, or round up their posts and ship them off to some dimmly-lit, never-read side board. But it seems like that's what you're asking for. If all we're supposed to post about is sweetness and light (subject to your imperial approval, of course), it's going to be kind of a dull board. Not to mention that if the steady stream of folks leaving EQ continues, a quiet one. (Oh, I know you're going to post a reply saying that you don't want censorship, you're just arguing for self-restraint, and a seperate forum, but the next logical step is asking the moderators to move all the inflammatory threads over to the ghetto forum, and what's to prevent SOE folks from reading the ghetto forum - after all, they don't have to read this one).<br />
<br />
And for your quote &quot;we're now viewed as the three year old child that is throwing a tantrum so loud that it's deafening&quot; - are you an employee of SOE that you know what they are thinking? How do you know what they are thinking? If you have this miraculous insight and influence, why don't you use it to get some of the minor problems fixed - by next Weds or so would be great - thanks! &lt;that was sarcasm, btw&gt;. I'd suggest string with your speciality of alchemy, which is still hopelessly gimp (other than making an occasional gate potion for non-caster-friends) - but most folks gave up on the tradeskills long ago (other than tradeskill PLing for the Aid Grimmel quest).<br />
<br />
It would be nice to believe that SOE is going to fix these problems without folks yelling, but that's not the way things have worked for any class. Things are getting better, and SOE seems to show signs of occasionally selectively listening, but there's still a lot of room for at least minor corrections.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">No I don't work for SoE - but anyone with any measure of objectivity can sense precisely what Brenlo, Kyt, and the others who post on shaman forums think of us right now.<br />

Regardless - Gloriana has made the call - the posts will remain where they are.  You guys have a field day working each other up into a frenzy and wallowing in the &quot;misery&quot;.  I hope at the end of the day that all of your suffering leads you to a better place - in game or out.<br />
<br />
As far as Alchemy goes - you're exactly right... the tradeskill leaves a lot to be desired... but contrary to the modus operandi on this board, I approached it in a constructive fashion instead of just throwing my gut around and shouting to the heavens of the travesty that had been foisted upon me.<br />
<br />
If you guys can't see the difference between constructively working towards a solution and spasmaticly squawking for justice, then you will have no way of understanding the point I am trying to make here and you will continue to fill another thread full of more of the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Honestly, I do not think this thread is about the presentation of Shaman problems or complaints about the shortcomings of our class. This thread is a satire of the SHEER VOLUME and AMOUNT of such threads, and how even the most un-related threads tend to lapse into a rant on the issues facing Shaman in EQ.<br />
<br />
I will admit he has a point. I will admit that I DO IT MYSELF! Heck for kicks, I did a history of my own posts, and I saw at least 10 on 10 threads saying the SAME EXACT THINGS!! This is what Ug is pissed about folks. And honestly, if you just look at it objectively, without taking anything he says personal (it would have been easy for me to think he was talking DIRECTLY about me, since I am guilty of the charges) you will notice what he is trying to say. <br />
<br />
I guess what I get is:<br />
Lets stop starting new threads to say the same exact things 10 other threads already say<br />
Lets refrain from posting every single tiny issue we have in every single post we make on every single thread we post on<br />
Lets see if the results we have seen will continue to propel our class back to playability in the current &quot;new&quot; content.<br />
And finally, lets keep the threads thata ARE designated for ideas and complaints free of incessant whining. <br />
<br />
I am guilty on all charges and will be the first to admit it. I am going to go out on a limb and say Uggy isnt the only one who feels this way, either. This board used to be a place to come for some nice social discussion and debates, good advice and solid information. Now I am seeing far too many &quot;Shaman Suck and Heres WHy&quot; threads, and even the &quot;What AAs should I get&quot; threads end up degenerating into &quot;Make a BL and get Paragon instead&quot; types if de-rails. <br />
<br />
Don't stop posting Ug. I respect your opinion IMMENSLY, and if anything, I need the checks and balances you  and people like you provide. We CAN get out of hand when we discuss our issues.</div></div><hr />

You think it's obvious what they think of us at the moment?  Want us to make it perfectly obvious what we think of them?  Would you like a description of their ability to verbalize, answer questions, communicate, analyze, and (more to the point) repair.<br />
<br />
Now, how exactly would you like to constructively work on a solution.  I know--let's sit down and talk with the . . . oh.  Wait.  They're not talking to us.<br />

Okay, let's post a list of problems with data behind it . . .oh.  Wait.  Done that.  Nothing happened.<br />

Let's have a summit where we can have Glor's concerns summarily dismissed by that ass Rytan because he is too arrogant to rethink any decision he makes, especially when the other side has reams of proof he's wrong.  Check.  We've managed to discover the tin-god aspect of his personality.<br />

Now, perhaps, we'll go with the Ugzug approach.  Let's sit quietly and hope they upgrade us like we've been doing for the last 4 years.  (After all it's worked so well to get us where we are now, right?)<br />

If lashing out at me makes you feel better Chutoi - go for it.  I'll be honest with you - when you first started your crusade you were constructive and attempted to present yourself in a respectful manner.  Today, though, you are finding your posts deleted or edited on the EQLive boards and you're being called out by the mods there.  Why?  Because you are incessantly attacking people at every opportunity.  I would encourage you to take a step back and have a few minutes of deep breaths to regain your composure.  What you started was excellent - but how you act today (specifically on the EQLive boards) is worthy of ridicule and it is obvious that you are no longer helping our situation there.<br />
<br />
I'm sure I'll get negative bumps for this post as well - since you are the champion of the &quot;scream till we're nursed&quot; crowd... but you see?  I'm not here for popularity.  I'm here to play a game... which is something that you have obviously lost touch with.</div></div><hr />

Personally, I think that everyone has their opinion, and everyone should have the opportunity to voice their opinion without being blasted for it. I have good and bad comments in my user CP from the few posts that I have added to this forum. And each person that wrote the good and bad posts have the right to voice their opinion of my opinion. But, please, don't flame me for wanting to be part of this family.<br />

I actually took a look at that checklist of things to do for all the classes, and it looks like the only two classes that are happy are the Berzerkers and the Beastlords, because they don't have anything that needs to be fixed on them.<br />
<br />
Yes, it absolutely SUCKS that we play a class that has bugs in it. But, guys! We are one of the best classes on the game. And we're not the only class that has bugs. Yes, we have problems with our spells, and we can't barsh worth a crap (See, I used Troll in this post! I R Smurt!) but I'm happy to log in and be with my friends and play! I recently found PoEarth (YAY me) and I have found that YES! I am useful once again!!!! I'm sure that will fade as well once everyone else gets into the EP's, but malo, slow and my pet's attack are my only concern right now. If Malo and Slow would stick a TEENSY bit faster, things would almost be perfect. (See, I SAID almost) They are still pretty resisty in POEarth. Especially those darn armadillos. And those big alligators. But I find that everyone is resisted almost equally. <br />
<br />
I'm sure my newfound glory and the fun-ness level in this game will fade after I've been here for a while. But please, don't gang up on each other here! We are all Shamans, and we all are family in a sence. YES, we need to keep an open communication with people to keep the reminder that YES, we do need work! But please, don't flame each other. <br />

If you guys can't see the difference between constructively working towards a solution and spasmaticly squawking for justice, then you will have no way of understanding the point I am trying to make here and you will continue to fill another thread full of more of the same.<br />
<br />
First off I want to say that I respect UgZug for his contributions, as a newbie relatively speaking to this forum, I've learned quite a bit from UgZug.<br />
<br />
In the past, the Crucible community has worked constructively, with minimal squawking, to present SoE with well-reasoned explanations of issues that concern the shaman community.  These proposals generated very little response from SoE, and the response that it did produce was generally &quot;no&quot;.  It did seem like SoE only reacted positively to shaman concerns after the volume and pitch of shaman complaints was ratcheted up to shrill levels.<br />
<br />
I hate use the &quot;squeaky wheel&quot; argument to justify being shrill when expressing ourselves, but it did seem like SoE only reacts to shouts and screams, and if a quiet, humble request is made to them, it will be dismissed out of hand.  <br />
<br />
I agree with UgZug that the repetition of issues that already have threads, or that were hashed out last month can be tedious and messy.  Maybe we do need a specific place on the forum to discuss shaman balance concerns, but from past experience, SoE does seem to have an attitude that things are not important, unless players are either squawking about mass protests and account cancellations, or are slinging personal insults at Brenlo.  Either way I don’t expect much from SoE in reaction to things posted here at the crucible.<br />
<br />
I suspect we need a few outspoken “elder” shamans presenting us on the SoE forum, with a clear declaration that they represent a consensus of shamans from the crucible, and then limit squawking amongst ourselves here on the crucible, perhaps in a dedicated area.  That is one thing that I think the druid community has, a very unified front, which shamans do not seem to have.  We do not always agree on things here (since the class does lend itself to various play styles), and I do think this squawking amongst ourselves looks like chaos to an outside observer.<br />
<br />
Can folks here think of was to present more of a unified front?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Ug, I did read what you wrote.  My usual method of posting reponses involves have a second window open and the article/post/thread to which I am responding up for ready reference.<br />
<br />
I honestly can't imagine that you are suprised at the respons you received.<br />
<br />
You want us to sit back and wait?  Have you looked at our OoW spells?  Does that look like they're listening?  Sure they know we're unhappy, but unless they continue to know we're uphappy they're not going to change a damn thing.<br />
<br />
You might think that I am simply frothing at the mouth since I have been edited on four (yes, four) posts on the SoE board.  However, they have actually had to go edit them.  That means they are reading them, and whether you want to admit it or not, that means they have to understand that I am criticizing them, and (I hope) probably understand WHY certain people are being criticized.  Of course, they also overmoderate, but that's a different question.<br />
<br />
I may be getting edited over there on a few posts, but I can guarantee you that I intended for it to happen.<br />
<br />
If you're here to play a game, go play.  I was here to play a game until they took steps to make it as tedious as possible.  Now I'm here to find out if I'm going to be playing this game in the future.<br />

<br />
these boards are now source of jokes when chating with the shamans I know in game &quot;Go whine on shaman boards !&quot;, or the &quot;Man, this guy whines like a magician&quot; is now replaced by &quot;Man, this guy whines like a shaman&quot;. Complaining for a valid reason is OK, keeping mass whining after your point has been made and acknowledge makes you lose credibility.<br />
<br />
To the idiots that say to UgZug to leave these boards if he doesn't the like the mass whining going on for a few months now, well, that would be one less major contributor whose input is like x100 their insignificant bandwagon following whines. UgZug's alchemy guide is probably the only reason why half people come here for the first time.<br />
<br />
If you need to complain and bash the EQ dev. team to be a respected member of those boards, that's sad. Obviously shaman class has issues, but certainly nothing that justify the 100+ threads about it about this boards. most shamans I know stopped visiting these forums because of the whining.<br />
<br />
I am very surprised that nobody complained here already about how shamans are screwed compared to druids, wizards, magicians and necros concerning mobs inate resistances in GoD. *<br />

Yes, the squeaky wheel gets the grease, but I think Ug's main point is that the abusively annoying wheel MIGHT get stuck into the garage forever. <br />
<br />
There is a difference between voincing our opinions, and ranting endlessly. I think SOE knows full well what we think, what we want, and what some possible solutions are. How can they not, we never shut up about it. <br />
<br />
Maybe they arent listening. Maybe they have put us on the back burner. Maybe we are DONE being &quot;balanced&quot;. Who knows? But honestly, is MORE AND MORE screaming gonna get us heard? I really dont think so at this point. They gave us a band-aid, and now they have moved on to other issues. <br />
<br />
Why doesnt everyone step back and objectively look at this whole situation from SOEs perspective. Read the other class boards. Guess what, they are bitchy too. They are loud, redundant, monotonous, annoying and won't shut up either. Look at the general boards. There is still tons of stuff people want fixed. My god, people are moaning and groaning about BATTLE ANIMATIONS for crying out loud.<br />
<br />
What do you fix first? Whats second? How will it affect other classes?  How long will the fix take? Is it worth fixing now, only to adjust later? There arent any magic-code wands you know. They cant just say some spell and ABRACADABRA Shaman are fixed. <br />

Sure, they have been dropping the ball at SOE for years. But I still play, and so do most of you. Sure they are gonna lose customers if they continue to delay. But most will come back. Lots have already. I want answers too. I want stuff fixed, and my class balanced, and my friends class's balanced. But ITS A PROCESS NOT AN EVENT. Some people just do not seem to understand that, and think THEY are the only one in line and THEY must be heeded or &quot;else&quot;. Or else what? You will pull your 13 bucks a month? Bye. I won't. I will hang out. Its a good game. It will get better. It not completely dreadfully horribly unplayable, you know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Bendarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Agree Ug.   I dont come here nearly as often as I used to, admittedly as a lurker most of the time, because I see little good info and more posts about how broken we are.<br />
<br />
I enjoy my class (65 levels, elemental flagged).  I enjoy playing.  Squeaky wheel, druid...  I dont want to be a druid, so I am not.<br />
<br />
Could things be better?  Probably.  Take the &quot;Woe is me&quot; to the new Sony boards so we can get back to shamaninity here and less bitching.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">I think the whole melodrama people are making it out to be is kind of interesting.  <br />
<br />
Where is all this whining anyways?  Where is all the screaming?<br />
I see people stating problems and some people discussing solutions.  Once in a while you get the dramaqueen announcing the begining of his retirement and stuff, and some people are gung ho and use stronger language, but do people really need to expend effort to get people who are trying to come up with a solution to stop it?<br />
<br />
How many threads do we really need decrying the need for people to start having fun again?  Ever think that maybe they want to have fun again, and are trying to convey ideas across the internet haze in the hopes that things will change for the better?  <br />
<br />
I know this isn't the first poster who ever started a thread requesting to stop these discussions, and pretty dam sure this won't be the last one started, but really, if you don't want to take part in the discussions, you don't have to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">They are in league with satan, did you not know this?I'm sorry, but that was just damned funny.<br />
<br />
ROFL!<br />
<br />
Good one Litgruv.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Ronax - do you really need me to go and quote a few dozen posts in a dozen different threads?  Really... c'mon now.<br />
<br />
Anyway - here's the deal:<br />
<br />
I made my statement and asked for a special forum.  Gloriana made a ruling - I accepted it.  For those of you who disagree with me, fine - go back to your business.  For those of you who are as tired of it as I am, then I don't know what to say; keep on plugging I guess and try to pull the good info out of the trash.<br />
<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>AgrajagGarrgravarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">There is a difference between voincing our opinions, and ranting endlessly. I think SOE knows full well what we think, what we want, and what some possible solutions are. How can they not, we never shut up about it. <br />
<br />
Maybe they arent listening. Maybe they have put us on the back burner. Maybe we are DONE being &quot;balanced&quot;. Who knows? But honestly, is MORE AND MORE screaming gonna get us heard? <br />
<br />
<br />
You're right--who knows?<br />
<br />
That's the major problem here.  Here's the way our conversations with SoE typically go:<br />
<br />
[Brenlo] : You're never going to get anywhere bitching and whining.  If you want to sit down and have a civilized dialogue about shaman class balance, let's do it.<br />
<br />
[shaman_01] : --insert long, thoughtful post on shaman balance issues here--<br />
<br />
[Brenlo] : silence<br />
[Brenlo] : silence<br />
 --- crickets chirping ---<br />
<br />
[shaman_02] : ARRHRHGG!!!! WHY WON'T YOU LISTEN TO US SoE SuX0rz!!!!!111!!!!  GOODBYE EQ HELLO CoH!!!<br />
<br />
[Brenlo] : You're never going to get anywhere bitching and whining.  If you want to sit down .....<br />
<br />
...<br />
...<br />
...<br />
<br />
ad nauseum, ad infinitum.<br />
<br />
The thing about dialogue is that by definition it's two ways.  Lots of well thought out posts about shaman (and other class's) issues have been completely ignored by SoE, both here and on the EQLive forums.  Eventually all of these degrade into flames and personal attacks because of a COMPLETE LACK OF FEEDBACK.<br />
<br />
Please SoE, explain to me why our suggestions are totally retarded and will f**k up the game because we didn't think about how it will affect situation X.  No crap--I'd really like to know so we can stop wasting time thinking about them, and focus our energy on coming up with new ideas.<br />
<br />
I can't help but think if we had some real DIALOGUE with SoE, most of the crap that we see cluttering up the Crucible would go away.<br />
