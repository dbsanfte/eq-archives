In addition to the added spells, we'll be trying out the Bash skill for Clerics, beginning at level 25. <br />
<br />
How about giving us Ikky/kitty shams bash too =(<br />
<br />
This also has implications with the new shield enhancements, from the looks of this, Clerics will be the only priests to get the benefit of this =/</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lately, we've been working up some changes to help balance out the cleric class. This is important to get done before Planes of Power, as it's the foundation for the growing role of priest classes in the future of EverQuest. The goals behind these changes are to: <br />

It does say priest classes. Maybe they will throw us a bone too,or take one away:(.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Very nice.  I'm a big fan of the militant priesthood.  Glad to see them getting something to help them fight.<br />
<br />
Now, maybe we can keep pressing for double attack?  I don't want dual wield, but double attack (get it at about 25, capped at 100-ish skill) would be very nice.  Maybe a teensy bit higher dodge?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Screw bash, up Dodge. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would LOVE double attack.  Like poster state above, maybe cap it at 100.<br />
<br />
I'd be pullin out my 2 handers a lot more often and throwin in some shammy uber melee ;)<br />
<br />
Question though.  Since Beastlords don't get double attack, you seriously think they might even consider giving it to us shaman?<br />
<br />
Granted they do have dual wield.  /shrug<br />
<br />
Just thinkin :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gorg Grimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">With the introduction of some better raid-level heals for shamans and druids, clerics can be assured that we're intending to give them more versatility and greatly improve their group and solo roles. It should be possible to have any priest class function as an effective healer, but if you want the best and most efficient healing you'll always get that from a cleric.<br />

Heres the bone I guess.  Found this on the test server  message dated the same day.<br />
