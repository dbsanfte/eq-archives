<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am going crazy trying to find this information. I could swear I saw it yesterday, but 30 minutes of searching three boards has gotten me nothing but more confusion and a slight headache. I managed to blunder my way around some last night, but all I remember is:<br />
<br />
Lavastorm Mountains - Broodlands - Stillmoon Temple<br />
<br />
Can anybody help round out the chart (or point me toward one)? Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>redribbit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't quote me on this but the new map may have the zone connections (or at least a better idea of what connects to what. I was curious about Halas myself. I remember reading on the patch message that things have changed from Lavastorm to Halas????. Curious as to whether the way to Thundercrest may be in everfrost or Halas. I was in Halas and Everfrost yesterday with no luck finding anything. If any of you find this (frozen zone) that they added pop on and share the info :) They have frost giants now so I can only assume it connects to Velious or Everfrost/Permafrost some how. (probably near Vox which would make sense).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Boondowk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thundercrest at least on beta was located in broodlands. take a right at the lake and look for a yellow dot on the ground by some pillers. Inside still moon up the stairs and down one of the left halls was the ascent. But again these are all from beta, I dotn have DoN on live so dotn know if they changed them or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>redribbit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ah ok thanx Boon. I will check that out after the raid today :).<br />
<br />
I was kicking around in The Ascent with a few guildies yesterday. Pretty much a sprial walk up a mountain :). The graphics are unreal and give a sense of one heck of a hike. We were killing things to the top but got tagged by a Kirin and 5 spiders near the top. Couldn't do much about it LOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't have the new map feature. I think it has something to do with my UI (I use the Tablets Future Blue); so perhaps I'm stuck waiting for an update to the UI.<br />
<br />
It looks like:<br />
Lavastorm - Broodlands<br />
Broodlands - Thundercrest and Stillmoon Temple<br />
Stillmoon Temple - The Ascent ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>redribbit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would load your default for now. You will be missing out on a lot of stuff if you don't. I loaded my default until Delta is updated. SUX but gotta do it to see the new features and such. The map is pretty nice, and will be handy for telling someone in another zone how to get where you are LOL.<br />
<br />
Not sure if the potion belt or Bandolier will work correctly for you with that UI either :). I'd say Bite the bullet and use the default for now (as hard as I'm sure it will be)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, the potion belt and Bandolier work, and so do the mission vendor windows and the Task window ... though I don't know why I can use those and not the new map. Also, the in-game email function is lost on me, and I think that's because I don't have a new window selector that includes that button. /whine @ default ...</div></div><hr />

Strange.  I have been using Delta4 (the original one, before the zillion OOW Delta4 mods came out), and each tie the UI changes, it's usually a pretty minor fix...this coming from a guy who knows jack and squat about XML.  Only thing I have to fix with my Delta4 UI is I need to figure out how to make a dump box for Ebon/Radiant crystals, and a Reclaim button.  Oh, and I need to horizontalling flip the bard song window due to screen size and 20 buffs.. aside of that, it's held very strong =)<br />
<br />
Probably be a buncha delta fixes before I can fix the Inventory window, since im leaving on vacation in like.. 2 days heh.<br />
Aside of the Crystals/reclaim button, thats all I *have* to fix for this expansion. I can't argue much..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>redribbit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I noticed with Delta that the Map window is Fubar'ed. You can't seem to scroll down inside the map window, so that needs to be fixed. I'm not sure of the potion belt or Bandolier since I didn't even bother trying those :). I'll just use the default until they pop on an update.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dementhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Assuming the zones are in the same locations as beta, lavaspinners lair is also off of the Broodlands.  The entrance was down a pile of rocks into the big crack with lava in it, and then into a tunnel.</div></div><hr />
