<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently switched guilds and my new guild is aligned with Kael. Previously I had done a great deal of giant hunting including several arena raids &amp; numerous exp / faction camps in Kael. I now have the items needed for several pieces of Spirit Callers gear sitting in the bank waiting for me to &quot;recover&quot; from being max-KoS with all 3 giant factions. I've been on a few raids in ToV West and have done some faction raids in Skyshrine, but until this weekend I had not made a strong push to raise faction. <br />
<br />
I decided to spend this past weekend working diligently on Kael faction. I started on Saturday by spending a few hours killing in Icewell Keep. When that group dissolved, I switched to slaughtering every dwarf &amp; coldain wolf I saw in GD and collecting heads. Eventually I moved on to killing dwarves in EW (2 camps as soon as each popped). I managed to collect a total of 86 heads before I finally reached dubious faction with Kromriff on Sunday evening. Once dubious, I turned in 34 of the heads to the recruiter in Kael at the EW zone line, and achieved max-ally status with the Kromriff. I turned the remaining heads to Slaggak and continued to raise Kromzek faction. I did not turn in heads to Captain Bvellos because even after all of this work, I still conned &quot;scowling&quot; to him. After every couple turn-ins, I ran over to check my faction with Bvellos so that I could switch to his head quest (which I hear gives larger bumps and also improves Tormax faction), but I still haven't even reached &quot;threatening&quot; with him. <br />
<br />
I'm really starting to get a little frustrated with this effort. Do any of you have any advice for me? Am I missing something? Am I just being impatient? Is there a better place to be hunting for faction (exp would be nice, but is not necessary)? I checked around on Allakhazam for quests, but it doesn't look like I can do any of the better faction quests because I'm still KoS to most of the quest givers. I'm not looking for an explorer-knives type exploit, just any ideas that you might have to help me speed this process. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">when u see guilds doing dain see if u can tag along and tag dain. Those raids are good for the faction u need</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">OMG  don't give any more dwarf heads to anyone but Bvellos.  Go kill in West Wastes or in Skyshrine.  It will take you FOREVER killing dwarves alone if you are trying to get Kromzek.  A day in Skyshrine should get you out of Threatening with Kromzek, or kill a few WW dragons.  It takes 27 coldain heads to Bvellos to go from dubious to ally with Kromzek, will take a lot more for Tormax.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, I was really regretting that after I did it... Was frustrated &amp; hopeful that the heads would at least let me break into dubious with the 'zek.  I figure I'll go buy 30 heads when I finally reach dubious with Bvellos.  We do WW dragons fairly often, so hopefully between that &amp; some SS / Icewell faction raids I'll be ok soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ouch. Honestly you took the long route.  <br />
There are much easier ways to get Spirit Callers armor.  Let me explain. <br />
<br />
Firstly, the faction that is easiest to get is Kromzek.  Oddly enuf, this is also the faction that you have yet to get to a reasonable level.  Even more strangely, this is the faction you need to talk to the quest giving giants for Spirit Callers armor.  <br />
<br />
Let's put it like this, if you know a mage with CoH who has decent faction with all three giant factions, you only need to get kromzek faction to do the quests.  The quest giving NPCs are in a hall that is set apart from other giants.  You can talk to them and get the quest armor without ever coming into contact with Tormax or Frost giants.  Well, if there is a mage in your guild . . . which I think is quite possible.  <br />
<br />
Go to WW, WToV, and Skyshrine.  Get on a decidedly unfriendly term with dragons.  Kromzek will love you in no time at all.  Then get your mage friend to CoH you into the room, do your quests, and be done with it.  <br />
<br />
Kromzek is one of the easiest factions in the game to get.  Specially if you have a guild that can do WToV and WW.  <br />
<br />
Leave the dorfs alone less yer on a dain raid or something.  It's just not worth the effort to obtain a faction you might never use.  Frost giants seem to be ally to you anyway, and that's not an easy faction to raise.  Tormax is even harder, and is really not worth it unless you win a Dain head and want to turn in for a belt.  Otherwise, there is no point to having it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ya try and get on some dain or Yeli raids.<br />
<br />
Remember though on Yeli you have to actually hit him physically with your weapon or spell(s) to get the faction hit. Unlike some other places where simply healing someone gives you a faction hit.<br />
<br />
3 of either will take you from KOS to Ally basically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Maboun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Lan was pretty much right on with the Zek faction with one exception. Our Quest NPC sits between kelorek d'tar and frozen jesus (whatever his name is hes a badass). Not in the room with all the other class NPCs, so while you can get a CoH to the area you cannot do the quests with your NPC unless the Tormax factioned ass kickers are dead or you can find someone to train them out. Note it is really hard to keep both mobs out of room while you do quests with FD. See if someone can DA train them out while you do hand ins.<br />
<br />
FYI I am in same boat just moved servers and changing faction again back to giant is easy for Zek , other 2 are much more time consuming. Royals in Icewell seem to be best source for + Tormax unless you get lucky with a Dain or Yelinak hit (They will automatically take you from KoS to Dubious or high threatening usually).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Part of my problem is that I'm not just interested in doing the armor quests - I need a new base of operations when hunting on Velious.  Until Saturday, I was welcome anywhere inside Thurgadin or Skyshrine, but I am now max KoS to both (Coldain &amp; CoV at least).  I want a place to bank, buy, sell, etc. without porting to luclin or hammering my way back to OT.<br />
<br />
I was previously under the impression that I needed to increase Kromriff faction to a suitable level in order to do the quests necessary to raise Kromzek &amp; Tormax factions.  That's why I started with the dorfs first.  We're going to ToV-West tonight and I'll spend the next several evenings killing in Skyshrine when we don't have a raid scheduled.  Hopefully between that and upcoming WW hunting, I'll be OK soon.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the feedback so far guys - if anyone has anything to add, please keep the info coming :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've been working on giant faction, but have a different problem.  I'm amiable at the moment on Kromzek faction and want to do the Girdle of Reflection quest.  But I'm still scowling to Kromriffs.  Our guild has been doing NToV, and I've done SS and WW a couple of times.  So I can turn in heads to Captain Bvelos without any problem.  However, a couple of times, the wandering Kromriff greeny that paths by the bank senses me and attacks me.  Once this happens, the whole bank is after my butt.  Fortunately, I've always had SoW up (and also have run3 in case).<br />
<br />
I'd like to increase Kromriff to at least dubious so I can do a couple of quests.  I also have some dragon heads, so I'd really like to up Tormax as well.  So I guess Dain or Yelinak are what I need for faction hits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Get every faction hit you can tonight and you'll be at least dubious to Kromzek tonight alone.  Hunting in WToV is a good +kromzek faction hit, that is why giant-aligned guilds can kill Vindi/Statue/Tormax and get their faction back fairly easy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gardeltron:  If you don't care about Dwarf faction just turn in Coldain heads to the Recruiter at the EW side of Kael.  You'll be liked by Kromrif fairly quickly.  Invis trick works on him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That's what I'm confused by - tonight will be my 4th or 5th trip to ToV-West.  My CoV faction has slowly drifted from max-ally to apprehensive at the end of my last ToV-West session.  The only times I've not gotten the +/- faction adjustments is when I'm sitting outside of Chardok at the end of the fight ;-)  Like I said in my first post, maybe I'm just being impatient...<br />
<br />
I can't imagine that I'm not getting close though - perhaps I'll finally break through tonight.  Thanks again everyone for the help :)</div></div><hr />
