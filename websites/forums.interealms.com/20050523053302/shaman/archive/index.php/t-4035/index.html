<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How many times have I seen a good thread, going strong when someone posts &quot;it's Shamans, not Shamen?&quot;  Popular usage sets both Connotation and Denotation in English.  Take, for example the word &quot;nauseous,&quot; this means &quot;one who makes other nausiated.&quot;  However, popular usage makes this word mean the same thing as nausiated and we have to live with it.  Shamans sounds clumsy.  Shamen is popularly used all over the EQ community.  Personally, I prefer the title that MUCH better fits us in the endgame;  Shabears or Shabby's for short.<br />
<br />
So, let's put this to bed.  Forget if Shamen or correct or Shamans is correct, it's definately the small stuff.</div></div><hr />

a)  I agree, lets put this to rest.  Now if you will just get everyone to stop using 'Shamen'...<br />
<br />
b) Shabear is kinda goofy, IMNSHO.<br />

c) Shabby is worse than 'shammie'.  /shudder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Considering the word shaman is Siberian, it is completely illogical to treat it like an English compound word such as &quot;fireman.&quot;  It is not sha + man, it does not follow the English rules of pluralization.<br />
<br />
I don't mind pointing out every now and then, that the correct plural is shaman or shamans, people might not know.</div></div><hr />

Plurals in English are weird, just deal with it.  I /agree Gloriana and go with 'shaman' myself out of respect for the word origins, but I don't stress over it.</div></div><hr />

I'm very aware of the origins and proper pluralization of Shaman, but I don't think we should waste too much time on the re-education of the EQ public.<br />
<br />
Ans as far as Shabear and Shabby go, the first is in reference to the change that's occured in my character since he got Bearclothes.  He no longer thinks of himself as a Barb, and when he's dead or zoned, it's just an illusion.  The second is just to show that I don't think that we should take ourselves so seriously.

And the pompus elite will always find something to nitpick so they can reassure themselves of their superiority.<br />

When I compare the value of a mispelled post with information that improves my game play... against a nitpick spelling correction and an innane statement such as &quot;kill faster&quot;...  I am reminded that there can be a huge difference between intellectual... and useful.<br />

Anyway, I agree with finaljustice in that, in the grand scheme of things, it probably means about as much as a snail relieving himself in a flower bed.<br />

As far as the &quot;cutesy&quot; names for shamans, I could care less.  &quot;Shammy,&quot; &quot;shabear,&quot; &quot;shadr00d,&quot; etc. does not bother me in the slightest.</div></div><hr />

Not like it matters. If I want to fluff my posts correcting someone's grammatical conventions regarding the plural of the word 'shaman', that's my choice. Now and again, everyone here makes the occasional silly, useless post. Heck, I do believe one of the first few posts in this thread was a silly, useless post.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Yes, there is quite extensive documentation on the origin of the word.  &quot;Shaman&quot; is both singular and plural although &quot;Shamans&quot; is less popular it is still legal.<br />
<br />
Fishes, by the way, is an uncommon but acceptable plural form of the word fish.   While I'm on weird and obscure plural (origins of language is a hobby) -en suffix is an old Germanic plural form.  This is why we use Oxen instead of Oxes.  There are a couple of poems I recall that had lines such as &quot;As I laid my eyen upon the tree&quot; and that always amuses me when I see examples like that.  It's funny that the hacker/computer mod culture use &quot;boxen&quot; to describe their various computers.<br />

<br />
First of all, you flamed me, ya jackanapes. Check your history. I'm not the one who called you an elitest nitpicker or a Nazi. I stated that using 'shamen' rather than the correct pluralization was ignorant. It is. Ignorance isn't a bad thing. It's not an insult. I'm utterly ignorant about computers. When it comes to errors in Windows or RAM faults or frammistan beamer-frame jams, I revert to my toon, chanting a bit and, if that doesn't work, hitting it with a hammer. Socrates said that self-knowledge was the most valuable knowledge. <br />
<br />
Except in your case. You choose to use 'shamen' on purpose, to make a statement. You're a rebel. Like James Dean or Luke Skywalker. I can dig it. I do wonder what Socrates'd have to say about a denial of self-knowledge, though.<br />
<br />
A search on &quot;snare&quot; and &quot;runner&quot; returns<br />
<br />
Why would that return anything useful? Your question had nothing to do with 'snare'. As a matter of fact, your question had to do with the very opposite. A lack of snare. Searching for 'snare' does nothing to help you. If I want to know how best to solo if I can't afford a JBB, my best plan isn't to do a search for the terms 'afford' and 'jbb'.<br />
<br />
I'd search for you myself, but think of this as a skill builder. I do specifically recall twice recently where people stated that they needed stun or snare to stop runners in response to 'what do shamans need in caster rebalancing' threads, and others helpfully offered them ways to stop runners that didn't involve snare or stun. I recall this, at any rate. Perhaps I'm simply going crazy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Originally posted by finaljustice <br />
Take, for example the word &quot;nauseous,&quot; this means &quot;one who makes other nausiated.&quot;  However, popular usage makes this word mean the same thing as nausiated and we have to live with it.<br />
<br />
<br />
You are comparing apples and oranges.  As far as I know, you may use the adjective nauseous in 2 ways.  Describing something that causes nausea or disgust.  Or describing someone that is affected with nausea or disgust.<br />
<br />
1: These green beans are nauseous.<br />
2: I feel nauseous.<br />
<br />
Both are valid.<br />
<br />
and &quot;nausiated&quot; is spelled: nauseated<br />
<br />
Shamen is simply a mispelling.  It is not a word.   It's just like the way that Germans is the plural of German.  Not Germens.<br />
<br />
Have you ever visited the safehouse board?<br />
We sometimes correct people who say &quot;Shamen&quot; here.  You should see the frenzy they can get into when people call them &quot;Rouges&quot;<br />
<br />
It's exactly the same thing, a misspelling.  hehe :)</div></div><hr />

I would expect that someone so wound up with proper grammer and spelling would not confusing calling someone something with impcation.<br />
<br />
If I want to know how best to solo if I can't afford a JBB, my best plan isn't to do a search for the terms 'afford' and 'jbb'. <br />
<br />
<br />
I would also expect that any proponent of the board search engine would know that anything + JBB is a poor search because JBB is 3 characters.<br />
<br />
I'd search for you myself, but think of this as a skill builder. I do specifically recall twice recently where people stated that they needed stun or snare to stop runners in response to 'what do shamans need in caster rebalancing' threads, and others helpfully offered them ways to stop runners that didn't involve snare or stun. I recall this, at any rate. Perhaps I'm simply going crazy.<br />
<br />
<br />
I maintain that this topic hasn't been covered in a single thread.  Your vague recollection doesn't disprove that.<br />
<br />
A search for stop runners yields:<br />
<br />
 Shamen, Shamans? Let's get real final<br />
 Shaman FAQ: Full Rough Draft done  <br />
 How do the non-snare shamen handle runners<br />
 The spell I will ask for at Fan Fair first!<br />
 Thinking of rerolling my 25 shammy so I can have this:Regent Symbol of Innoruuk <br />
 Poll: If you were starting over... <br />
 spell slots<br />
 Soloing the Hole zone-in? <br />
 Howling Stones for xp/fun and a challenge... <br />
 Dot Comparison ((Sparked by Druids Petition for a New Dot) <br />
<br />
The FAQ only mentions runners underneath the regent symbol topic... go figure.<br />
<br />
The fan faire topic had 2 posts that offered the advice of soloing mobs at their bind point, don't worry most classes are even more helpless... and oh, the infamous monks can do it...  (never mind the much higher dmg output and feign death if it goes wrong... those are exercises left for the student).<br />
<br />
In the end, I doubt you'll see the difference between communication and proof reading.  So here is the compromise.  I'll go back summarize the information on stopping runners and submit it to the FAQ thread, and you can submit an eloquent explaination of why Socrates wants us to spell shamen correctly.  And we can both feel like we have made the world a better place.<br />
