<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drolgin Steingrinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sometimes, you trip over the words of a person who seems to have a special rapport with you - with how you feel, what you think etc.<br />
<br />
Well...I'm beginning to think Steffen Brandt from the Danish band TV2 spends half his life inside my head ;)<br />
<br />
First it was this (http://forums.interealms.com/koe/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3808) thread where I posted a translation of one of his songs that struck a chord with me.<br />
<br />
And now I've found another one! Again, this is my rough translation and it doesn't really do it justice - but somehow I think a Knarlzlation (tm) would be a little out of place...<br />
<br />
<br />
It's night and it's storming and hailing and snowing<br />
and I freely admit it, I can't take anymore<br />
The barometer's hit bottom, all the creditors are lined up<br />
There's a deficit of at least one thousand millibar<br />
<br />
It's been a while and I don't remember<br />
ever feeling so unreasonably abandoned<br />
who said I was ready for the great cold shock<br />
who's cut the connection between darkness and light?<br />
<br />
There are plenty of chances but no matter what you think<br />
just save yourself all those fancy words<br />
it's your back against the wall and not even the funniest line<br />
can do anything against the irony of the story<br />
<br />
In any decent popsong a girl would walk in<br />
sneaking kind words into my deranged mind<br />
float away in a slowmotion moviefantasy<br />
in a puff of paintbox and new technology<br />
<br />
But there's static on the line, it's pure white noise<br />
and the dream has sought refuge underneath warmer skies<br />
The sound of her wings leaves no visible trace<br />
the compass is wavering around the icy cold north<br />
<br />
And I've had it up to here, I've figured it all out<br />
it's too much, it's too little, it's too cruel, it's too harsh<br />
I yell at the skies and I swear by God<br />
This is not how my life was supposed to turn out<br />
<br />
And then it happens that I finally come home<br />
and find you waiting again and again<br />
you're not saying anything but I can see it in your eyes<br />
we need to act fast before we slide away<br />
<br />
It's not very much, but sometimes it's enough<br />
just sitting, saying nothing till the sun it comes up<br />
Tomorrow becomes today and I belive that I know<br />
that someone needs to go out and shovel some snow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>wassabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Look into my eyes - you will see<br />
What you mean to me<br />
Search your heart - search your soul<br />
And when you find me there you'll search no more<br />
<br />
Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for<br />
You can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for<br />
You know it's true<br />
Everything I do - I do it for you<br />
<br />
Look into my heart - you will find<br />
There's nothin' there to hide<br />
Take me as I am - take my life<br />
I would give it all - I would sacrifice<br />
<br />
Don't tell me it's not worth fightin' for<br />
I can't help it - there's nothin' I want more<br />
Ya know it's true<br />
Everything I do - I do it for you<br />
<br />
There's no love - like your love<br />
And no other - could give more love<br />
There's nowhere - unless you're there<br />
All the time - all the way<br />
<br />
Oh - you can't tell me it's not worth tryin' for<br />
I can't help it - there's nothin' I want more<br />
I would fight for you - I'd lie for you<br />
Walk the wire for you - ya I'd die for you<br />
<br />
Ya know it's true<br />
Everything I do - I do it for you</div></div><hr />
