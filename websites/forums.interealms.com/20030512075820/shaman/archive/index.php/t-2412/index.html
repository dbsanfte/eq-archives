<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've heard a rumor that shaman can run the Mage Focus Item quest(s) from the Temple of Solusek Ro and get one of the Mage focus items with Reclaim Energy.  The rumor is that although shaman can't equip them, these items work from inventory, so I can actually get mana back from a nearly dead pet.<br />
<br />
Has anyone actually done this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zugugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes. It works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So our pet can be used as a personal mana pool? :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hardly... You'll be lucky if you get more than a tenth of the mana cost of your pet back. But it's stilll better than no mana back at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They do work from inventory. Anyone can use them from inventory. You will NOT regain substantial amounts of mana from it.<br />
<br />
The mana returned from Reclaim Energy is 1 point per 10 HP the pet has at the moment you reclaim it. <br />
<br />
There is no Shaman pet that will return enough mana to break even on the casting cost (even with a Summoning Efficiency III item), let alone come out ahead.<br />
<br />
Consider it to be a way to recover a little bit of the mana you spent when it comes time for you to log out or otherwise move on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This is only really usefull at the lower lv's when haveing a blue or even con pet can really help. At the higher lvs all of your pets are green con so its hard to tell a good one from a bad one. And if your in so much trouble that you have to reclame your pet for mana. Odds are you/ your group are about to die anyway so the wasted cast time isnt going to help you at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was thinking more about the situation where you've decided to move zones, or you have to go sell stuff and come back, and could top off your mana pool before you leave.<br />
<br />
If it's 1 mana per 10 hp, then we're only talking 70-100 mana back, I guess (depending on whether HP buffs count).  Not really a big deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, the mana return is pretty pitiful, unfortunately.<br />
<br />
My broom sits in the bank now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That's depressing. I hate it when I get to a zone, summon a pet, buff it and then after I've scouted around for a while, realize the place is over-camped and have to zone. All that mana gone. :( Still, with canni it doesn't take _that_ long to regain it. :)</div></div><hr />
