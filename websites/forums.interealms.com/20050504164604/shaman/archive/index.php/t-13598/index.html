<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heyas,<br />
      Ok, this is a question for those who have played, or still play a warrior (2 boxed, or whatever).  Are they super easy and mindless to play, or is there some straregy involved besides hit, hit, kick, and taunt?  I don't mean to belittle the class; I started one, thinking it might be fun to be a main tank, but I couldn't get past the monotony!<br />
Was I missing something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First off, the hardest part of actually playing a warrior is paying attention and being on your toes.  Other than that, no, playing a warrior is not very difficult, and is not very exciting unless you are main-tanking for a raid.<br />
<br />
Secondly, the hardest part of being a warrior is upgrading your gear.  If you just slap some gear on him and start playing, you'll be kinda gimpy compared to a hybrid or any other class with the same gear.  As a warrior you have to be prepared to work your ass off to make sure you have good gear, or you'll never amount to anything.<br />
<br />
Good luck with your warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not tough at all.<br />
Get as close as you can to the mob, watch positioning, auto attack, and hit kick/taunt/disarm whenever they pop up.<br />
Throw in disc's and shielding when appropriate.<br />
Bash/slam for seasoning.<br />
Choose a race that can have cultural armor, preferably RZ. :)<br />

<br />
to play a warrior, just hit autoattack, kick/slam now and then, and taunt.<br />
<br />
to play a shaman, just cast slow, heal now and then, and buff.<br />
<br />
(the point is, both classes are as 'easy' as you make them -- when I play my warrior, it's a full time job and I'm wiped at the end of the night.. when I play my shaman I get time to chat..)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh, Im exactly the opposite.  Playing the shaman keeps me busy as all get out.  Buffing, canni, mal, slow, cripple, cani, dot/bracer, heal, etc..  Its more work on the fingers than my bard ever was, but more fun IMO.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I never chant while playing the shaman.  When Im on my SK twink I get to talk all I want, and it is  a very easy session.</div></div><hr />

If you are creatign a warrior to 2box and nothing else, you'll be bored...if you create a warrior to MT hard mobs, its the funnest encounter ever.  Everyone else during a raid just sorta hits auto attack and makes sure they don't get aggro (meelee wise).  MT has to make sure the formation around teh mob is correct so it doesnt' get pushed too much, find a corner to back into so everyone can whap its but, and generally is a good leader for the mob in question cause they see what happens.  Seeing your screen fill up in red with &quot;so and so hits you for 1100&quot; is pretty neat...and watching your hp bar yo yo is pretty cool also :)<br />
<br />
Otherwise, its mindless...you don't even have to hit any buttons besides auto attack...my highest kick as a warrior i think was 30.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My main is a warrrior, and I don't think there is a class more rewarding to play.  In a normal exp group, it is not difficult(hit auto attack, kick/slam when it pops, taunt if you loose agro, watch positioning, /shield if needed), but it does keep you on your toes.  The only difficulty in playing a warrior is knowing when to hit taunt, or /shield, watching for positioning.  Oh, and chasing down mobs every time that cloth wearing caster overagroes and runs around like an idiot(still happens 60 +, think they would learn).<br />
<br />
Another post got added while I was making mine...<br />
<br />
As long as you are close enough to hit the mob...does it matter? Do you do more damage if real close? And what level do you warriors get disc? <br />
<br />
Being closer to the mob makes it easier to hold agro.  Mobs tend to like attacking whomever is closer(I believe ther eis some sort of modifier to the hate list for range from mob).  Warriors get their first disc at 30(resistant), and gain disc's from 51 to 60.  If I remember right, warriors get /shield at 45(not sure on that, and too lasy to look it up at the moment).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Shaman is my main. Made Warrior when my small guild had 3 45-50 Shaman and only a 42 Monk  as a tank (Try not to laugh please :)) Warrior leveled up and I still play him at 55, but I'm again lone Shaman at top of guild, so I find I'm more useful as Shaman, since we joined an alliance of guilds and more tanks are available, combined with need for a slower in PoP.<br />
<br />
Shield is available sooner. I think it was 30 also, but could be 35.<br />
<br />
You don't want to mash your taunt key everytime it refreshes. Once you do have something beating on you, taunting it does absolutely nothing to increase your hate on it's hate list. Keep taunt up for when the mob turns to someone else for whatever reason, then hit it. A sucessful taunt will move you to the top of the hate list +1. An unsucessful one is a waste of 6 seconds, the time it takes for taunt to refresh<br />
<br />
Warrior is fun to play, but also frustrating at times, like when I have to deal with Paladins that say &quot; I have to cast stuns, it's what my class does&quot; As things stand now, Warrior taunt and ability to hold agro compared to Knights is horrible, but there are rumblings that it might be looked at in the future. Agro is not only the Warriors job, but managing it is everyone in the groups.<br />
<br />
You stand as close to the mob as possible to get proximity agro, and hope that the other melees stand at max melee range. Nothing more annoying than almost standing on some rooted mob's toes and still having it turn and take whacks at the Back-stabbing Rogue. Damage and defense are the same regardless of your proximity to the mob, so if you're tanking, stand on it's toes...if not, take a step back and get away from it's body odor<br />
<br />
Warriors direct the fight, prioritizing which mobs to kill when more than one in camp, so they need to know which mobs are unslowable/unmezzable. They have to keep an eye out on the rest of their party in case they have to use their shield disc.<br />
<br />
If your Warrior is dual wielding, you can &quot;Ghetto bash&quot;. Keep your inventoryopen, or bag if you have a UI that has your primary/secondary slots added to the bag window. Watch your battlespam, and once your offhand weapon has swung, quickly switch in your shield, hit bash, and switch back to weapon. You can do this in the time your melee attack recycles, Bashing with the shield deals more damage than kicking.(Bash damage is based on the AC of the shield you use. At lvl 54 I had a 90+ crit with bash. Biggest kick crit I've had is 62) Under level 55, bash can also stun and interrupt spell-casting mobs, and even after 55, when kick has a chance to stun, it stuns less often than bashing does.<br />
<br />
I always love the feeling of finishing getting hit by multiple mobs at the same time and still be standing at the end, be it the whole camp of Orc 2 in EC at level 8-9, or a courtyard train at the entrance to karnors at 50-51. Course, I partner with my g/f's Cleric, since soloing is almost impossible unless you're massively twinked after about level 40 or so.<br />
<br />
And I don't know why everyone says Rallos Zek armor is the best. Helanic Tundra has a ton more stamina, which translates to more HP, with same AC If I remember right. Only advantage is there are probably more high level smiths that can make RZ armor than Helanic Tundra.<br />
<br />
Any class can be easy to play I guess. I suck at multi-tasking, so I don't do a whole lot of outside chatting in group or guild when I'm in exp group, I need to keep watch on too much when I play either class<br />
<br />
Maybe it's not for you though. Whatever the case, don't worry about min/maxing things and just have fun. Good luck</div></div><hr />

Its the subtle things that make the difference, knowing how to use taunt rather than just mashing it, popping /shield when it counts, watching the mobs position in accordance with nearby geometry as well as the other melees and casters, and adjusting your angle of attack to compensate.  Theres a lot more to it than just facing a mob and hitting autoattack, you just have to be alert to see it.</div></div><hr />

Who has a simple easy job on raids? Think about it, the real question is who has a hard job on raids as a class.<br />

<br />
Sorry to disagree, www.fohquild.org the guild is 60 ppl strong I belive? but anyway leader is a warrior (boo hisss) and he doesn't trivialize anything. When acrylia b opened up, I went to get my shard and it was our guild mt who told me and the guild that the shard now drops in acrylia b, only a few hours after inner was opened to everyone. <br />
<br />
On raids even though our guild leader is only a paladin (what do they do stun mobs that are on the loose, root, mez tank and heal?) our warriors generally give us tank lineup, and tell us what the general strategy is. You know why? because if a tank messes up, the raid WILL wipe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kumeldar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I agree with a lot of the posters here. Playing a warrior isnt too hard, but being a good warrior can be an awful lot of work at times. Also if ya dont like dying, then dont try playing a warrior. A big part of a warriors job is to sacrafice themselves so the casters can get away.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Also a warrior is probably more dependent on gear then any other class. But it still takes a lot more then gear to be a good warrior.</div></div><hr />

Best thing btw, you can ever ever do, is time your tuants. Nothing like seeing a shaman slow land and mob agro him...when you JUST taunted and have to wait for refresh.

<br />
You will get people who will say things like:<br />
Thats really why I hate taking orders from warriors. Their job is simple and easy <br />
<br />
who obviously have no  idea what they are talking about.  Knights have basicly agro at the push of a button with their spells, a warrior has to work at it.  After doing everything you can to keep everyone alive, the caster who overagroes never fails to ask &quot;Are you taunting?&quot;.  Far eaiser to blame others than learn to do your job well.<br />
<br />
That said, I still think there is no more rewarding class to play.  It seems simple, but the more you learn, and the more effort you put in, the more rewarding it gets(probably true for all classes).</div></div><hr />

It's actually a lot of fun, and I should play him more.  Playing a warrior well is easily has challenging as being a shaman, although there are periods where I'm not doing what I would be doing as a shaman (chiefly clicking canni).  <br />

Nothing about eq is especially &quot;hard&quot;, but being a warrior is not mindless unless that's just the way you play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Playing a warrior is easier only on the level you get SOME downtime between fights. As a shaman, if you do, you're probably doing something wrong. If nothing else, cannibalizing is a full time job.<br />
<br />
Beside that, I noticed that computer performance and lag are much less forgiving while playing a warrior... i.e. you can't just utrn your back to the action and such. During the fight themselves, warrior are just as busy as any other class, if not more, especially at the higher levels. Keeping agro isn't just a question of hitting taunt when it pops up. It making keeping track of where you are vis-a-vis the MOB, where the MOB is being pushed, who is it turning toward, switching weapons if needed, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Any idiot can hit autoattack and press the taunt hotkey whenever it ungreys, but playing a warrior *well* is much harder than it looks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jikuliz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Discs are usable way before 60 in fact the last disc is gained at lvl 60. First is /disc resist, which you get at low lvl, 30 or 40 i dont remember, my war is 59 now, and i havent logged the war in in along time. At 52 you get /disc evasive, 53 is charge, 54 is mightystrike, 55 is the allmighty Defensive disc, 56 is furious, 57 precision, 58 fell strike, 59 fortitude, 60 is aggressive. Casters realms Warrior section has a detailed list of what they do, altho id ignore the commentary as most of those people dont know **** about them.<br />
<br />
Edit* One thing to keep in mind, btw, and you will realize this reading up on them, is that most of the Discs have a side effect, almost a double edged sword so to speak. I.E. While disc defensive, for the 3 or so minutes it lasts, you take less damage, but your dps is lessened.</div></div><hr />

Yes the disciplines with longer durations have negative effects along with the bonus you get. According to Prima's Ruins of Kunark strategy guide, &quot;Evasive allows the Warrior to be hit by his opponent by a factor of 35%, the Warrior will also hit his target less, but only by a factor of 15%.

      Ok, this is a question for those who have played, or still play a warrior (2 boxed, or whatever).  Are they super easy and mindless to play, or is there some straregy involved besides hit, hit, kick, and taunt?  I don't mean to belittle the class; I started one, thinking it might be fun to be a main tank, but I couldn't get past the monotony!<br />
Was I missing something?<br />
<br />
I played a warrior to 57 on FV server during my hiatus from my Shaman on Tunare, with my hubby playing a shaman.<br />
<br />
There is a LOT of responsibility and pressure involved in being MT on a raid. I did it twice and never wanted to do it again, I discovered that I prefer the role of a shaman at the high end game, so I'm back playing my Saraei heh. <br />
<br />
Its not as easy as you would think. Big time responsibility knowing when to call assists, keeping aggro, /shield, etc..  I have great respect for warriors now after playing on in the high end, I try to bring my experiences as a warrior with me when I play my shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">More of the warrior's job is done BEFORE the fight - investigating gear, figuring out the camp, camping the gear, etc.  Knowing which weap to use to hold aggro and which to use to do the most damage.

<br />
taunt if you lose aggro? when to hit taunt? Maybe this is why warriors are so terrible in exp groups. you should be constantly taunting. just because its not attacking someone doesn't mean you have sufficient aggro. If I knew all warriors stopped taunt when it appeared the mob was only attacking them I would get pretty angry. That must be the reason why I have to stand for half of the fight.</div></div><hr />

Ahhh... no. Taunt doesn't give X points of agro. Taunt simply puts the warrior to the top of the hate list. Hence, you taunt to gain agro, you don't taunt to build it. It's pointless taunting if the mob is already on you.<br />
<br />
A good warrior will not taunt all the time, he will save it to taunt the instant he loses agro, to regain it that much quicker. If he's taunting every time the button ungreys, it's likely that when someone gets agro from him, he'll have to wait a few seconds to regain it.<br />
<br />
A good warrior will choose his weapons wisely - it's not important for him to do lots of damage, but it is important that he can hold agro. So it's worth it for a warrior to drop his DPS a little if it brings him more taunt. Even if they have a fairly low budget, they can work with it, you don't need Enraging Blow weapons to be effective. For example, mid 50s, a Silken Whip of Ensnaring is a better weapon than a Lamentation off-hand. A nice new weapon from LoY is a Barnacle Covered Axe. It's only 9/21, but the proc adds hate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the link given that is the only concrete thing that I know of that SoE has said on how taunt works.  The most relevant thing from here is the statement:<br />
<br />
Taunt makes a creature hate you just a little bit more than it hates the next guy on the list.  In other words, multiple successful taunts, or taunting a creature that is already attacking you doesn't do anything extra.  <br />
<br />
To help you understand Penny, if I just mindlessly hit my taunt button every time it refreshes, I gain NO additional agro.  The only thing I have done is grey out my taunt key for 6 seconds, and those 6 seconds can feel like forever sometimes.  And since taunt can fail(far to often), if I mindlessly press it what will happen, at some point is this:  mindlessly press taunt, caster overagroes, wait till taunt refreshes(with caster taking beating), press taunt, fail skill check, caster still taking beating while I either wait 6 more seconds, or use my AE taunt(15 minute refresh, 100 % successfull taunt) to regain agro.  If I choose to use AE taunt, I then no longer have it available for 15 minutes, so that next time a caster overagroes he will simply have to wait.<br />
<br />
 Maybe this is why warriors are so terrible in exp groups <br />
<br />
Warriors are not terrible at exp groups.  We take a beating better than any class in the game, which is our role in an exp group.<br />
<br />
That must be the reason why I have to stand for half of the fight. <br />
<br />
No, the reason you have to stand half the fight is because you have not:  A) bought a horse, and/or B) learned to manage your agro.  Do not blame others for your shortcomings. A quote I heard once sums it up well:  &quot;Any fool can pull agro off a warrior, but only a fool would want to&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Heres how i see it from playing a shm high end but not a war...I would take any tank over a war...wars have horible aggro <br />
<br />
I always wait for the mob to get down 20 pct before i slow by then the tank has built up enough aggro that i wont get beat on<br />
<br />
but then i get &quot;Is this slowed????&quot; &quot;Slow it as soon as possible plz&quot;<br />
<br />
soo i slow it as soon as i can then bam i get beat on  :mad: <br />
<br />
I dont know maybe im just used to bad wars that cant play their character or whatever</div></div><hr />

hehe so true...<br />
<br />
playing a warrior is EASY.<br />
playing a good warrior is HARD.<br />
<br />
something touched here, but not really explained is picking targets..<br />
<br />
the warrior is the guy that choses the targets mob when you have more than one imcomeing... a good warrior will know what mobs are immune to mez, immune to slow, restant to whatever, ect...<br />
<br />
The 1 second he takes to pick the target out of incomeing mobs is critical... <br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
<br />
<br />
4 mobs inc...<br />
<br />
1: highly restant to mez and slow<br />
2: Immune to mez<br />
3: Immune to slow<br />
4: Cleric mob<br />
<br />
which do you target?<br />
<br />
times up.<br />
<br />
btw, did you even know that the mob with the name XXX was immune to mez? .. did you know that mob XXX was a cleric  (or that it was even a caster?)<br />
<br />
there is MUCH more to a GOOD warrior than most people realise...<br />
<br />
but a bad warrior is super easy to play.<br />

Who has a simple easy job on raids? Think about it, the real question is who has a hard job on raids as a class.<br />
<br />
Kinda curious Penny, do you have a warrior you've had extensive experience raiding/exping with to base your opinions on?<br />
<br />
I disagree unless you're being sarcastic =] we do malos/malosinia/tash/skdebuff/grummus/turgurs chains all the time =] and btw in xp groups the warriors I know I can cast malosinia/turgurs on incomming and they keep aggro..</div></div><hr />

Well in that case I did misunderstand taunt... and it really makes me think that SoE needs to reassess the skill, because to be quite frank it just doesn't cut it when lined up with the stuns and hate spells that add raw Hate.</div></div><hr />

In that situation, I think I'd fire the puller. :)</div></div><hr />

I agree with ya here for sure, the warrior picks the wrong target and a lot die.. the mezzer mezzes unmezzable (instead of the mezzable one), a lot die.. slower slows too early and tank switches targets.. slower dies :) .... really the difference between good players is they have experience with the different mobs and have had to step up in situations that required them to become better players or just sit there and do nothing.. <br />
<br />
Really an easy class to play is the BeastLord in raids.. &quot;Send tells for SD please&quot;... =] but I don't have much experience with them..</div></div><hr />

If you take a few minutes time out and head over to  The Steel Warrior (http://steelwarrior.xwarzone.com/forumdisplay.php?forumid=1)  you will find about 20 threads all on just that topic.  Over there we disagree with how to fix the problem, but we all agree that the difference between warrior agro and knight agro is simply broken.  You will also find that anyone who complains about warriors not taunting enough hits a nerve fast in the warrior community.  We are a bit sensative about the subject(well, I am anyway, and I don't think I am alone).</div></div><hr />
