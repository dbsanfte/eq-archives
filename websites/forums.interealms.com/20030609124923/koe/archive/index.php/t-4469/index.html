<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aaeamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Temple of Veeshan - Halls of Testing <br />
Where: Temple of Veeshan, HoT Staging Area. <br />
When: 8:00 PM Eastern, Tuesday, Decmber 18 <br />
Level Range: 54+ <br />
Requires: Dubious or better CoV faction. <br />
<br />
This raid will be limited to Four Groups. Though the level limit is set at 54 and up, I am willing to be flexible with appropriate resists and depending on space.  We will rotate people in on a standby list as people leave. The raid will likely go until after midnight, but we will keep going as long as we have a capable force. <br />
<br />
Requirements: Attendee's are encoraged to bring some DoTs for Symbol/Rune. Able to commit to at least 3 hours. <br />
<br />
Resists: CR/FR near 100 unbuffed should be your target. MR is a secondary resist to look at as well.  This assumes you are at least level 55.  If you are lower level, especially lower level Melee, you need to be looking at unbuffed resists at about 150+<br />
<br />
Objectives: The main goal here is to move to the Halls of Testing and pull MoBs for challenge and loot. <br />
<br />
If you cannot make the start time, please sign up anyway, but include the time you will be able to get on. We will rotate people in and keep the raid going as long as there remains a viable force present.<br />
<br />
NOTE:<br />
I have made some changes to the format I run these in, so read over the description a bit.  Also, in the past, the DoTs have been supported by just a few people.  Please try and help defer those costs.  If ever participant brought a stack to a raid once a quarter, that would probably be more than enough.  That would mean a cost to you of 200 plat once every three months, instead of weekly costs of 200 - 400 plat supplied by a few members.  Try to keep that in mind.  If I ever end up with a glut of Dots for the clerics/enchanters, I'll let you know.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Arsecn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I thought we moved gimp night from wednesdys to Tuesdays a while back becasue ToV raids were on those nights...  but then ToV moved to Tues nights ...and as i recall conflicted with our next generation nights...  hence i had missed a few of those.  We have recruits and lowbie friends that usually join us on those nights, so unless Tues night younger generation is called off, i will not be there... but i cant speak for the other younger generation players.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, I forgot that tonight is my daughters birthday!  ( Not as bad as it sounds, we celebrated it with their friends this weekend)<br />

I likely won't be on at all tonight, and it will be late if I am.  Good luck in ToV, Keepers.</div></div><hr />
