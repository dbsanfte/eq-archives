<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ludane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok. This is my highest level character. I just got some new items from a very friendly cleric that helped get my wisdom over 109 :)<br />
Ok. I just wanted to know if i am totally laggin behind equipment wise, and if i am. is there any single or few items in the low price range that can help out.<br />
I only have about 200 pp, so i can't just go out and buy every little piece of equipment that i would like. <br />

Those would be quite nice for you :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sentok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Another thing you can keep an eye out for is Ulthork arms. Should be right around, or a little less than 200p, I think.<br />

Will go nicely with your other gear (I loved that shield, used it for a long time, it looks cooool!) in your attempt to achieve the charisma of a troll :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For some free stuff, you could pick up a strawspun belt and a lumberjack cap in Frontiier mountains, and a bracer of scavening in Warslik woods. <br />
<br />
Someone already mentioned the ivory imbued earrings and necklace, if you know any jewlers, imbue some ivory and see what they'd charge you to make it. <br />
<br />
A rygor group in Eastern wastes might be doable at your level, rygor would upgrade all of your main armor slots. Tattered mantle for under 200p would be a nice shoulder upgrade. ... or maybe save up a few hundred more plat and get a decent piercer for 400-500.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Do the Totemic quests!  Especially the Helm!<br />
By lvl 30 I had a full set of totemic.  I quested all the pieces myself.  For the harder mobs (GRizzleknot, Grifenne, Lancer swordfish, Centaur Charger), I often had help from other people in the zone.<br />
<br />
The key for me was hunting in the zone where the drops were.  Every now and then I would OOC that I was lokking for  no-drop item X from mob Y.  That way I never stopped XPing but still got the drops i needed.<br />
<br />
For the mobs that I didn't get help on, I learned some good EQ survival skills (how to pull, dungeon pathing, solo techniques).  I'm not saying that I'm better than any other player, but I am better than I used to be!  :D  I still pick the brain of most higher level shaman I encounter</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm at level 32. And let me say even though it looks like you need a new everything. I would maybe look into getting a new weapon ASAP. If you are lucky you can get a slime covered harpoon for 200pp or less.<br />
<br />
But if you are going to hang out in groups then a new weapon may not need to be a priority. <br />
<br />
You want free good armor. Hang out in KC. Ask nicely for Jarsath Scale armor. It rots in this zone by the ton everyday. Find a high level friend to take you there if you can. Word to the wise this place is very dangerous. You will die atleast once. So be prepared.<br />
<br />
I myself am upgrading (but I am preparing for lvl 40). I went to KC and got a Jars BP. <br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Totemic is the way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Takk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Tometic is the way to go for the first nifty looking armor. The BP and the helm are usually the bottle neck since the bear for the helm is usually on a 7 hour or so timer and the mob for the bp is on  an 2 or 3 times a week timer. However, since most tometic was &quot;old world&quot; armor, many people don't seem to do it any more so you may find it alot easier than I did.<br />
<br />
 Another alternative is go to karnor and ask to loot the &quot;jarcrap&quot; armor. It makes you look like a newbie but its stats are pretty decent. Plus most people at karnor just  hate  the stuff (no drop). The only downside is that most of the mobs are extemely red to you and you have to be very careful when you pick up the stuff.</div></div><hr />
