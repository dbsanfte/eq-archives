I saw this advertised on allakazam's or something like that. Tells you the price of what stuff is going for.  You need to pay to use the nicer features, which I'm not going to do. Prices are fairly accurate, better then I've seen elsewere, not bad to use if you just want to check the price on item X you just got see if people are paying money for it, or not get ripped off too much.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I saw it when he was doing a beta some months back.  Kind of nice.<br />

I am assuming that SoE used a similar program to originally set the Tribute Points on items as most were close to the current (at the time) Bazaar value.</div></div><hr />
