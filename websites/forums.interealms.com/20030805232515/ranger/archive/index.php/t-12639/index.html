<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tulouis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone else feel that the situation with this is utter Bull****?<br />
<br />
You have to buy PoP to use /raid? Sorry, but that is not new content. That is a new feature, which really should have come with Kunark, or the Planes, when it really would have become usefull. <br />
<br />
It pisses me off to no end that they are trying to force you to buy PoP from so many angles. New spells are NO DROP and seemingly quested as well, so if you don't buy PoP you can't get the spells. And now the /raid feature, which was supposed to be free, got yanked back at the last minute and made PoP only.<br />
<br />
Which means 1 poor bastard without PoP can screw the whole raid over (as far as /raid goes).<br />
<br />
Just pisses me off how ****ing transparent VI is. You can smell thier greediness like the scent of a skunk, from miles away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Noggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Exactly how I feel.<br />
<br />
...and as such, I've put EQ on until-further-notice not playing again. I think I'm waiting to see wehre the harmony replacement comes in... if they decide that should be PoP-only for some reason, I have a feeling that unless some very close friends start playing again, that after three years I'll be finally through with EQ for good. They've never been this bad before... though then again, the game is run by almost entirely different people. It's a shame. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am pissed that they yanked it. Seriously pissed. That is an awesome feature and should be available to everyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Huh? Explain this to me. Wouldn't this hypothetical person just be excluded from the experience gain? How does this screw the entire raid and not just that one individual player?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>The Lone Ranger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Maybe I'm wrong but doesn't the raid feature make it easier to buff in some way? Also, they wouldn't be able to communicate with the rest of the raid.<br />
<br />
Thus, forcing everyone to use a /channel to communicate. This would destroy the point in having a raidleader moderated channel where only he could speak, or only selected individuals could. Same with looting, corpse wouldn't open up for him until the timer wears off. Making it pretty useless for everyone else to use /raid.<br />
<br />
What I would really be upset to see is that one person being shut out of raids for not having this feature. Or people refusing to let anyone join w/o it.<br />
<br />
Imagine you are looking foreward to a raid and just when things are getting down you get sent home cause you don't have the freaking raid function. <br />

Dev team sucks more and more lately.</div></div><hr />
