<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Saldaora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it still worth getting Run3 considering that we can now cast Spirit of Shrew???<br />
<br />
We have a monk/shaman duo, and both are considering skipping run3 for other stuff such as regen (i think we can get regen early enough, with castersrealm we can't check).<br />
<br />
Is run3 as critical as it once was, would you get a different AA first nowadays?<br />
<br />
And a good tip for other duo's out there that like to stay the same level: the human monk has been at 10% AAXP since turning 51 thus leveling off the exp penalty that the barb shaman has.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dimleelit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">shrew is not as fast as run3, and you don't need to stop, mem spell, and cast.  With run3...you just...err...run :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Spirit of Shrew - Infravision, cheap spell, almost same speed as Run3, castable indoors.<br />
<br />
Run3 - Innate ans always there, won't wear off when you need it most, cannot be dispelled, ***does not take up a buff slot***, only costs 3 General AAs (Not that there really any general worth getting - Run3, Regen3, and metab3 until you start doing TCs), and did I mention it's never down, cannot be dispelled, doesn't wear off ... etc?<br />
<br />
I have shrew. I got Run3 anyway. I wou;dn't trade Run3 for anything, as it is, by far, the most useful general AA I have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Shrew is wonderful if you don't have run3 yet, or are at a level where many of your groupmates won't have run3. <br />
<br />
But run3 is still fantastic. Still, IMHO, a must-have for any L 65 character (and maybe earlier). But if you're NOT going to buy Run3, what other AA's are you going to get? All the other basic AA's, except regen, are virtually worthless garbage (IMHO). There's nothing else worth spending 3 pts of AA's on, and you need to buy basic AA's to get to the archetype and class AA skills. <br />
<br />
What else are you going to get? Reduced food consumption to save yourself a handful of plat a day? That's NOT better than run3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Innate &gt;&gt; buff , just like I hate to buff myself with acumen all time and really miss true sight item<br />
<br />
anyway, there are very few choice at general aa, so unless you like 6wis or 6stama; metab3 is same useless since it basical help you save 10pp/month on Halas pie/Grobb drink</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Run3 &gt; all other 1st tier AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Run3 is invaluable.  Just remember...you don't have to be the one that runs the fastest when trying to escape after a bad pull.  You just have to run faster than the slowest person in the group.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have run3, and don't plan on getting shrew. Of<br />
course, I dont' have the night vision problem. ;D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Saldaora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Interesting, thanks for ample responses.<br />
<br />
I didn't realize most of the 1st generation AA's were mostly crappy.  But I think I will still pump first 3 points into regen, then probably the next three into run speed.<br />
<br />
Still important in the end, but the urgency of the matter has been reduced thanks to shrew.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">metab3 is same useless since it basical help you save 10pp/month on Halas pie/Grobb drink<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, unless you have a thing called a mount that likes to mow through your expensive stat foods and drinks like homer simpson at an all you can eat buffet(I know I use misty picnics and qeynos tea, which are a *tad* more expensive to keep up than halas pies and grobb drink).<br />
<br />
Metab3 isn't as useful as run3, but it is definately second best from the general aa's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The question to ask is &quot;Is it still worth getting Spirit of the Shrew considering that it is identical to Run3?&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everytime I open up my inventory and see that my food supply hasn't budged much at all, I smile and go, &quot;good ol' innate metabolism 3!&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't go &quot;good ol' hastened rabidity 3!&quot; when my rabid bear refreshes. :)<br />
<br />
Innate metabolism is certainly one of the lesser AAs to get, but it certainly makes me happy :)  (and I don't even use stat foods, lol)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Single version is useful on LDON rescue missions for buffing the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Metab3 isn't as useful as run3, but it is definately second best from the general aa's.<br />
<br />
Metab3 might save you some stat food and drink, but in the long run it's not a major major impact....<br />
<br />
UNLESS, you happen to be a kitty shaman.<br />
<br />
Kitties eat and drink twice as much as other races (innate metabolism racial trait; double food and drink consumption, but kitties burn out poison and disease twice as fast).  Put a kitty on a horse, and you can open your food pack and visibly watch your food and drink disappear.<br />
<br />
I'm a kitty shaman, and on a 6 hour grind in BoT, spending the whole time mounted, I go through about 6 stacks of drink and 3 stacks of banquet-sized meals.  Fuzzlecutter can reduce the drink consumption, but it's cheaper to buy 6 stacks of milk or water than 3 stacks of Fuzzlecutter...you just need open inventory slots.  ;)<br />
<br />
I don't have metab3 yet, because I'm still a Baron and my precious AA points need to go to MC, SCR, SCM, and ND.  But when I have 3 AA points to spare, they're going there.  Sometimes it gets old loading up on food and drink when I know I'm going to be spending my time on a horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Codlugarthia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Without Run3 You're shrewed.... errr screwed...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ran alongside a young run3-less monk.  I shrewed her, then dropped shrew on me.  We were neck and neck.  Are they not both 30% increase to base run speed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Each level of run speed is 10%, so Run 3 is 30%. From Lucy, Shrew is also 30%. So, the speed is identical. I guess they decided that since we already have 30% indoors now, a spell to do the same can't really break the game. :)<br />
<br />
I would still prefer Run3, since it doesn't take up a buff slot, and doesn't drop at inconvenient times.<br />
<br />
However, you can get it before you get Run3, so it's still handy before you hit 51 (or whatever level you decide to work on AA) and for casting on lower level friends indoors.<br />
<br />
For dungeons, I usually do billy just before we go in, and with SCRM that usually lasts for most of the dungeon, if not all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'd definitely say Run3 is still worth getting. Innate, always on, can't be dispelled is really nice and as others said there really isn't much else to spend it on. Regen 3, Metabolism 3 and Run 3 are pretty much it unless your into trade skills for new taanan's.<br />
<br />
Innate stats are a waste. You can easily cap almost any stat you want with half way descent gear especially with Augments from LDoN. Innate resists aren't bad but something for when you have alot more aa's and are in the elemental planes and such =) Lung capacity and a whole  mess of other aa's there aren't even worth discussing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I stopped at 51 and earned my very slow 3 AAs for run three.  If I had it to do over again today I’d do the same.  I stopped at 54 and got run three on my beastlord.  I love run three and very much miss it on two other characters I play a lot, even though they both have SoW.  <br />
<br />
I’m still working on Canni 5, so I don’t have AAs to spare, but I spent AAs four through six on Metabolism III.  As someone else mentioned, we kitty shaman tend to consume our weight in food and drink every hour and we naturally have to feed our mounts at least as much.  So I’m perfectly happy I spent my points on metabolism instead of regeneration.  I’ll most likely pick up regen as soon as I buy Canni 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I got so frustrated when i acidently ate one of my Bristlebane Party Platters, so i went ahead and bought Metabolism 3. Havent eaten one since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">One use of Shrew I can see is for buffing pets. I'm going to get it as soon as possible since I'm too low to get AA's yet. But I imagine that pet classes can have problems in a fast moving dungeon when everyone's got run3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I will get shrew.  I can see uses for it.<br />
<br />
I would not give up my run3 for it... not by a long shot.  My alts either have run3 or are getting it as soon as they can.  Having your sow run out is like getting snared -bad when a mob is after you, and just plain anoying when you are trying to keep up with the rest of the group.  Run3 never drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Spirit of shrew costs like 20 points or something at the Guk camp.  It's worth having in case you need to buff someone who doesn't have run3 and needs to keep up with u on a long indoor journey.</div></div><hr />
