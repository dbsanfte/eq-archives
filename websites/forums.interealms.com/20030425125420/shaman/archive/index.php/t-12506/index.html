<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Munkh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been using a Jade Chokidai Prod, but last night my mage picked up a Spine Chill Spear.  <br />
<br />
I was wondering which one I should use? Is one better than the other?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, I'm looking for a REIF, but I use a Spine Chill Spear right now.  It procs for about 38  points of damage, and has decent stats. Heck, I like it, but if you have both, give each a try, see what you do better with.  Sorry, but I'm at work and cant check out Mag's, or I would have better info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Munkh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">what level does it start to Proc?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmmm, well, I got mine at 44, and it proc'ed right off.  I'm guessing low 30's though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kaab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think it procs at 40.<br />
<br />
Try to hang on to your jade prod. You need it for your HS key</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Can either of those go in our range slot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tikcuf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">neither the REIF nor the Spine Chill will go into range as for the Jade I don't know as I never got one...  If you can afford it the REIF is the better weapon by far then either of the others...</div></div><hr />
