<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BleezardTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi a couple weeks ago I soloed the Black Dire in Mistmoore and this is how I did it .<br />
Dire was not up so I had to kill the Advisor to get him to spawn. So i bound myself in Mistmoore just at the zone line. Invised myself and headed to the Advisor's room. Cast plague and Envenomed Bolt on him and channeled off a gate whit getting beat on by the other mobs in the room with him. Waited at zone til I got his death message, then zoned out to clear aggro.<br />
I then zoned back in, invised up and ran up to the platform just at the entrance to the castle. From there you can look down on the Black Dire and are far enough away from the other mobs not to get aggro when you break invis. I cast slow on the BD and it actually landed! Then i gated back to the zone line and waited for the BD to come to me. When he got there I zoned out and waited a few minutes.Zoned back in and there he was all by his lonesome.<br />
I summoned my shiny new Drogmor. Summoned my dog. Buffed myself with HoS and regrowth. Dog got HoS, regrowth and alacrity. Sent dog in and cast slow again just to make sure. Tried to cast DoT's on the BD but he resisted them all so I then just sat back and watch while my dog chewed away at the BD, throwing in heals as needed and reslowed the BD about half way through the fight.<br />
Ended up taking about 5 minutes to put him down. Had about 60 mana and full health at the end of the fight.<br />
