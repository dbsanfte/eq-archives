<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>chouka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello Everyone....<br />
<br />
I often hear about: SHAMAN NO DROP ARMOR... I am close approaching the level range where I might be able to find such armor... Could anyone tell me spcifically what armor and where? I already know about our planar armor but I was told that other amor drops in other zones too...  Any help will be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you dont know what armor you are looking for, how do you know you are close to the level range? :)<br />
<br />
The sets that come to mind are:<br />
<br />
Plane of Hate (Rune Etched and Scaled Heirophant)<br />
Plane of Growth (Spiritweaver)<br />
Kael (Spirit Caller)<br />
Skyshrine (Wolf Caller)<br />
Thurgadin (Runecrafter)<br />
Plane of Mischief (Shamanistic Shanannigan)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>chouka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the armor list. This will give me some stuff to look at in order to maximise my chance of getting those. To answer your question about how I know Im getting to the right level. I am hitting the mid 40s and I will soon be able to join raids... Hence, right level range! And, as time passes, I will get closer to the range still (I just beleive in doing my homework before levelling so I know what to expect next ;) ) Once again thanks for the info and if anyone knows of any other places that have no drop shaman gear, even if its not uber planar, let me know.</div></div><hr />
