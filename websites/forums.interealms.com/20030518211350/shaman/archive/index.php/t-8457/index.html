<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">At my present level, with a jbb and a horse, I find myself not meleeing much.  What would folks recommend as a good primary hand item for when I'm not meleeing?  Something to tide me over until I get my epic.<br />
<br />
My magelo is in my sig.  If you notice that there are any gear slots where I can make no brainer upgrades, please also mention those.<br />
<br />
I'm working on the solstice earring quest at the moment, otherwise I don't have any particular plans for immediate upgrades pending unless someone has a really good idea.<br />
<br />
I can spend up to 100kpp, but figure I should be saving that for spells when I hit the higher levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Prelates Lantern is kinda nice.<br />
<br />
+15 wis +30 mana +30 hp +6 sta<br />
<br />
Goes in Prim/Sec (shame its not ranged).<br />
Also a shame no AC /lol.<br />
<br />
Costs around 7k-ish on Tribunal or Torvon.<br />
<br />
Bash stuff over da head with your Uber-Lantern-of-Death (TM).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Whatever you do, best not be a book. I see a Shammy carrying around a book, and I think he should have rollled a Dr00d :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you're willing to quest a bit, the spear of fate is a rather nice main hand weapon.  No AC on it, but it does have great stats, resists, and a clicky DoT (albiet fairly short range).<br />
<br />
At 53 you can solo everything you need to do the spear up until Rak'Ashiir himself and the child's tear.<br />
<br />
Do the quest up through test of patience, then do the test of wisdom (killing Talbien and Glaron in Rathe Mtns) over and over turning in Woe, Envy, and Marr's Promise to the wandering spirit until you're max ally.<br />
<br />
Then all you need is to turn in your child's tear (or find a shaman still able to MQ it with you), bring a mage friend or two and a cleric and tag along with some folks hunting reavers in CoM  (or bring more folks if you wanna kill the reavers yourself).<br />
<br />
Once Rak spawns, park a couple fire pets beside him (make sure mages have low fire resists beforehand), turn in the tear, take the first AE, mages /pet attack, and you slowly back away to a neutral corner once no-longer agro, then when sure not agro, make your way back to the rest of the group.<br />
<br />
Kill Rak, loot scales, get spear.  Not too hard, takes a day or so for faction, then whenever you can set up a MQ tear or fear raid to get one, and ever how long it'll take for Rak.  In my opinion, for the level of difficulty in obtaining it, it's easily worth it.<br />
<br />
If you already have a child's tear, you can finish your epic within the week if you can muster the 3 or 4 folks it takes to help kill Rak.  I'd suggest holding off on spending more money and go ahead with the epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">FYI Rak has been screwey for a couple of months now.  Mage fire pets have some issues with resists now and it may be wise to take additional support ie clerics and more mages.<br />
<br />
May have fixed this by now but I dont know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Rak's not screwy.  When they made the pet resist buff changes a couple months back it changed the way pets' resists worked vs. him.  Pets use either their own resist or the resist of their master, whichever is higher... however, fire pets get an invulerability that isn't considered if the pet uses the master's resist.<br />
<br />
If the mages summon their pets with high resists (and/or possibly buff their resists later), then the pets will use their master's resist rates instead.<br />
<br />
Therefore, before summoning the fire pets, and during the fight, just make sure that mages have very low resists so the pets will default to their own natural resists and Rak can't hurt them with his AEs.  You'll still need to heal the pets from melee damage though, so make sure the pets are hasted, muzzle'd, symbol'd, HoS, etc.  Load 'em up and turn 'em loose.<br />
<br />
I got my 2nd shaman epic the other night (maybe 3 weeks ago-ish), and we took him with 2 mage pets no problem at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
*cough* I've started using a book (Writ of wisdom).<br />
<br />
Mind you my book saves me 10 percent mana on 61+ buffs and non-heals.....<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hey, I was in the same situation as you.  Just got my JBB and a horse and don't melee anymore.  However, I still choose to tank for my pet cauz my AC is pretty decent (1000 self buffed I believe)<br />
<br />
And guess what I chose to put in my primary slot....... i know its sad..... but I've got a book.<br />
<br />
History of the Dizok (AC 15 HP 35 MANA 35 +2 WIS)<br />
<br />
I couldn't resist the 15 AC, especially since I'm the tanker.<br />
<br />
Cost me 500pp in the BAZAAR.<br />
<br />
Chow Chow for Now,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was in the same boat.  I tank, but don't melee sitting on my horse clicking my JBB.  I decided that I wanted something with AC and the wis would be nice as I have low starting wis due to a character creation mistake that I am too embarassed about to go into details here.<br />
<br />
I picked up a Paw of Opolla.  I hate carrying a doll, but it has decent AC and wis.  In fact, I still carry my spear and quickly put it in my primary whenever I go to town to sell and bank.  :o <br />
Its not as good as the Dizok book mentioned above, 15 AC would be great, but I have never seen one of those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Fear is not currently a simple matter for my guild (just lost most of the highest level people to other guilds), so I'm stuck on the getting the iksar child's tear step for epic at the moment.  I've done everything else.  I think the guild will be able to do fear in a few months.<br />
<br />
I'm just looking for something to tide me over until I get the spear.  I'll keep my eyes open for good deals on the stuff folks have mentioned so far.  Thanks everyone!<br />
<br />
Self-buffed, I'm hitting just about 1000ac.  Think the AC from a history or paw would matter?  Or should I go for the other very nice stats on the lantern?<br />
<br />
Probably, I'll just end up grabbing whatever I can find a good deal on, but can't hurt to have a goal.</div></div><hr />
