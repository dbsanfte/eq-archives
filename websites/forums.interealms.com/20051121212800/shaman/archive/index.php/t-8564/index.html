<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Although people might be surprised based on my current uberness *cough* I actually started EQ as a roleplayer.  My first guild was a roleplaying guild, the Order of Ascension where we were required to be in character at all times, speaking out of character required comments to be prefaced with OOC!   My favorite roleplaying character was Amalthea, my vain, foolish, spoiled, pampered, silly high elf cleric with a huge daddy complex.   <br />
<br />
My roleplay guild loved to write, and we had a huge storyline we constantly added to.  This was Amalthea's &quot;introduction&quot; to that guild, and she later went on to have great adventures, including a starring role in an Apocolyptic storyline called THE PROPHECY and a doomed love affair with an evil dark elf who was ultimately redeemed by her love /swoooooon (he still died, though :p).    She was great fun to write, and she's still only level 29 but she remains my favorite character...<br />
<br />
So, without further ado, here is a story I wrote 2 years ago (I can't believe it's been that long!) which laid the backstory for Amalthea's personality:<br />
<br />
************<br />
My dearest Papa,<br />
<br />
I am deeply sorry it has been so long since I have put quill to parchment, but it has been a rather trying time since I left the convent.  I miss the convent with every fiber of my soul…its cool marble walls, strict sense of order and the emphasis placed on study and learning.  I know I was the best student having the finest penmanship, adroit skill with the needle and the clearest singing voice.  I was undoubtedly the most brilliant scholar.  It was my duty in the convent, to help those of a less scholarly persuasion attain my level of excellence.  I made it a point to correct all inaccuracies and mistakes by those around me as well as passing on the wisdom I have collected.  Why, just before the Mother Superior told me I was destined for a life outside the convent, I corrected several mistakes she made in her sermon before the Arch Bishop!<br />
<br />
I was most surprised when the Mother Superior informed me of a vision sent to her by our Glorious Goddess, Tunare.   In this dream, Tunare told the Mother Superior that I must take my brilliance and magickal abilities into battle and serve her as a battle cleric, helping warriors fight great evils upon the land. I know, of course, that I shall excel in battle skills and healing and the Mother Superior assures me that great glory in the service of Tunare awaits me on the continent of Antonica.  I overheard the Mother Superior tell the visiting Arch Bishop that Odus would have been ideal but Antonica was at least a good start, distance-wise.  I know that the Mother Superior has great faith in my battle prowess because I heard her tell the Arch Bishop that she greatly pities any orcs that I happen to come across.<br />
<br />
I embrace the great honor of Tunare’s choice of me as her beloved Avatar upon the land, responsible for dispensing the awesome blessing of her healing and potent magickal forces.  Of course, I’m sure it was not difficult for Tunare to choose me, aren’t I the loveliest and cleverest elf-maid of my generation?  I do find myself wishing (very rarely!) that I might have been a little less beautiful or a little less clever and had not been selected for this great honor.   I sometimes wish I might have stayed in our lovely convent forever, embroidering beautiful altar cloths with golden needles and raising my sweet voice in song.<br />
<br />
I find traveling most unpleasant; the rain, the heat, the mud, the stinging insects, the endless struggle to stay clean.  I nearly weep when I see the state of my hair and complexion! How Nanny Pickwick would be horrified if she could see me.  I hate sleeping outside, and I most certainly do NOT like moldy iron rations and milk that has been kept in my travel bags too long.  Endless walking has rubbed blisters on my dainty feet and wielding a morning star has raised calluses on my formerly milk-white hands. I know how you hate sniveling, papa! I shall follow my duty and bring honor to the Goddess and our house, never fear.<br />
<br />
Most unpleasant are the loud and uncouth beings that roam the continent of Antonica: vile dark-elves, half-breed elves, hulking ogres and loud-mouthed humans.   I have no experience dealing with the lesser beings, so I try to follow your wisdom and teachings.  I struggle to remember my deportment and attempt always to remain a fine lady like dear Mama.  Nanny Pickwick always said she was the finest and most gracious of elven women and her image is a model for my behavior.<br />
<br />
I am ashamed to admit, papa, that I am terrified in battle.  The war cries, howls of anguish, clash of weapons and gibbering of the enemies makes me tremble.  I swing my morning star with as much strength as I can muster, clench my teeth and endlessly repeat “I am the holy Avatar of the Great and Glorious Tunare, I work her will on Norrath!”  My only joy is giving Tunare’s sweet blessing to those in need.  How their eyes light up when I heal them, how their gratitude to the Goddess makes my heart sing! I have never known the pleasures of being NEEDED, of helping others, it nearly makes all my sacrifices worthwhile.<br />
<br />
Papa, I fear I have written far too long.  The second moon is nearly fully risen and I must wake my companion, Jered, for his turn at watch.  He is a half breed, mixing pure elven blood with lowly human and a vagabond minstrel to boot, but I find him a fine companion.  He made me dreadfully homesick for Nanny Pickwick’s fine baking. Like myself, Jered has an appreciation for tarts!   I miss you dreadfully, papa, and you are in my thoughts often.  Know that I strive to exceed the high goals and expectations that you have for me.<br />
<br />
Yr loving and obedient daughter, <br />
Amalthea<br />
<br />
**********<br />
I have several other &quot;Amalthea&quot; stories if anyone ever wants to see them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Oh what the hey, I was just reading over them, and I like them!<br />
<br />
I'm not posting all the stories, but there were several that proceeded this one...<br />
<br />
A Healing<br />
By Amalthea<br />
<br />
Aching with exhaustion, Amalthea entered the gates of Freeport. She walked quickly, eyes forward and head high, avoiding the loud, uncouth townspeople. Wearily she approached an inn, hoping the contents of her purse would be enough to ensure a room and a bath. Smoothing her bedraggled hair with a none too clean hand, she entered the dimness of the inn and walked through the noisy tavern area to where the innkeeper pulled steins of beer. The human innkeeper squinted at her as she approached, a sullen look on his face until he saw her mace and lowered his gaze to the amulet of Tunare around her neck. He reached up and took his small round cap off his head and twisted it nervously in his hands. “Be you a cleric, lady?” he stammered.<br />
<br />
The high elf regarded the innkeeper with cool violet eyes, “Yes,” she answered with an air of hauteur, “I am the Lady Amalthea Dawnglory, the beloved disciple of the Great Mother, Tunare, her Avatar upon the land, her chosen one.”<br />
<br />
The innkeeper regarded her with awe and without daring to turn his head, he shouted, “Vimi, a cleric of Tunare be here! Fetch the lad, quick.”<br />
<br />
A small human woman, clad in stained and rumpled clothes entered the tavern room from the kitchens. A small cloth wrapped bundle was held tightly to her chest. Catching sight of the battle worn cleric, she straightened her apron abruptly and swept into a low curtsey. “Please, yer ladyship,” she said in a low voice, “it be my boy, he be sickly, his lungs are weak…’e don’t cry or eat no more.” Vimi’s voice trembled, “I be worried about ‘im.”<br />
<br />
Amalthea lowered her cool gaze to the infant in Vimi’s arms and was taken aback at the evident misery of the child. He drew breath painfully, his face flushed with fever and seemed too weak to cry. “Hand him here,” Amalthea ordered imperiously, extending her mail-covered arms for the child.  Vimi anxiously placed her precious burden into the aloof cleric’s outstretched arms. Gazing down at the baby, the high elf was moved by his small, snub-nosed face. His eyes were bright with fever but he gazed at her without fear, his small chest laboring with effort for each breath. Running her healer hands over his chest, she quickly determined the baby suffered from pneumonia. “Tunare loves all her children,” she reminded herself silently, “bear cubs and wolves and even human babies.” Chanting softly she let the healing magic move through her and into the child. Nearly instantly, the baby began to breathe easier. Smiling, Amalthea quickly added the protections for cold, heat, disease and poison.<br />
<br />
With a glad cry, Vimi sprang forward to regain her child. Emitting a healthy wail, the baby protested the abrupt movement and Vimi began to weep with joy. The innkeeper fell to his knees before Amalthea. “My thanks, milady, ‘ow can we pay ye?” The cleric smiled graciously, “I can accept no payment for the work of the Mother, it is her gift to her children.” The innkeeper rose and placed his arm around his weeping wife, one finger caressing his son’s cheek. “Then ye shall have me best room in the ‘ouse and me finest dinner for let’s say, 5 sp?”<br />
<br />
Amalthea inclined her head regally, “If you will add a bath, Sir Inn Keeper and allow me to pay 5gp, I will call it more than fair.”<br />
<br />
The innkeeper agreed immediately, “Fair enough, dinner be mutton or griffon pie, ale and brown bread.” He raised his voice towards the kitchen, “Belron, Omell, ye ‘eard the lady, a bath in the front room, start heatin’ the water, and carry it to ‘er room when its good and ‘ot.”<br />
<br />
The blonde high elf shuddered at the thought of eating flesh, “I shall pass on your fine meal, Sir Inn Keep, if I may just have bread, cheese and well water, I will be content.” As her hands brushed her bag, she thought of the berries collected for her by Zalan, “and cream if you have it.”<br />
<br />
Entering her room, Amalthea was pleased by its simplicity. A small, narrow bed, fireplace, bureau and chair, all scrupulously clean greeted her. The sparseness of the furnishings made her pleasantly nostalgic for her small room in the convent. With a wide smile spreading over her face, she ran pleased fingers over the rim of the huge tub resting before the fireplace. At that moment, two scullery lads began to bring bucket after bucket of steaming water to fill the tub. While they filled the tub, the tired cleric reviewed the fighting tips Zalan had given her that day. “Step, swing, follow through, dodge, don’t forget eyes, groin, knees…” she thought to herself. When the scullery lads were at last finished, she threw the bolt of the door behind them and began to unbuckle and remove the bulky chain armor and the leather pads beneath it. Rummaging through her bags she found the small vial of scented oil. She carefully poured 3 small drops of the precious stuff into the tub, the smell of rare zantha flowers filled the room with their spicy scent. Stripping off her linen undergarments, she daintily put one toe into the oil-slicked water.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, she felt eyes on her and her flesh pebbled with chill. She glanced quickly around the room but she was alone. Exhaling slowly and chalking it up to the fervor of the day, she gently eased down into the hot water. Amalthea gave a long sigh of pleasure, sinking in the water to her chin and letting the warm water lave the day’s bruises and dirt away.<br />
<br />
On the rooftop across from Amalthea’s room, Brinven watched her bathe from his perch in the shadows. His gleaming eyes never left her window as he drew a sharpening stone down the length of an already finely honed blade. “I have heard,” he thought to himself, “that sometimes a healer, desperate to save a wounded person, will give so much of their-life giving magic that they actually give a part of THEIR life, a small piece of their soul that they leave behind.” He pressed his lips to the blade, “I do hope so.” An evil laugh escaped him as he resumed his vigil.<br />
<br />
Rinsing her hair five times before she was satisfied that it was clean, Amalthea finally rose from her bath. Wrapping herself in a drying sheet, she quickly washed her clothes and spread them on a chair in front of the fire. She took a polishing cloth and began to brush the dirt and debris from her armor, remembering Zalan’s lessons. “A rusty spot is a weak spot and weak armor can kill you,” she recited dutifully as she cleaned her armor carefully. When her linen under garments were nearly dry, she put them on and set a kettle of water over the fire for tea. Fetching her mother’s ivory and pearl brush, she began to give her honey blonde hair its nightly 100 strokes.<br />
<br />
Rising smoothly to his feet, Brinven swiftly removed his breastplate and upper armor, wrapping it carefully and stowing it behind the chimney on the roof. Nimbly, he slipped down the side of the building and made his way across the darkened street to the inn where he would find his prey. The tavern was loud and raucous, the celebrating innkeeper buying round after round for the drunken townspeople and adventurers. No one noticed the slim dark elf as he moved swiftly through the common room and flowed up he stairs to the second floor like oiled smoke. Pausing before Amalthea’s door, he pressed his ear to the wood…hearing only a soft humming from within, he took a deep breath to ready himself.<br />
<br />
Taking the shining blade from its hilt, he turned the point towards himself. Steeling himself, he plunged the blade into his belly and viciously dragged it upwards to his chest. Groaning, he pounded on the door, the pain terrible, “Lady,” he begged loudly, “Please, I need your help!”<br />
<br />
Startled by the sudden pounding on her door, Amalthea dropped her brush. Standing quickly she rushed to the door, a voice in such desperate need could never be ignored! Stopping to drape the bed sheet around herself for modesty, she slid the lock of the door back and to her shock; a dark elf warrior tumbled through her doorframe to land in a quickly spreading pool of blood at her feet. Horrified, she leapt back, aghast at the thought of a dark elf in her chamber. He lifted his head, gazing at her with soft, pain-wracked blue eyes, “Please, my lady, I am sorely wounded and need your help,” his dark hand stretched out and gently grazed her bare foot. “Please, for the sake of our mother, Tunare.” Blood like scarlet ribbons ran from his mouth.<br />
<br />
Amalthea bit her lip in indecision; she knew the most noble and gracious Mother loved all her children. Did she love dark elves as well? Could she chance being wrong? The puddle of blood at her feet was growing rapidly and her trained healer senses could feel the dark elf’s life ebbing. She kneeled down at the warrior’s side and with trembling hands turned him over. Raising her hands to her mouth, she gazed in horror at the protruding blade. The cleric looked at the dark elf, “The blade must come out, but if I pull it, you may die,” she said softly. The warrior reached for her white hand with his own dark one and gently brought it to the hilt of the fearsome blade, “Pull, lady, I trust thee.”<br />
<br />
Bracing one hand on his chest, Amalthea pulled the blade with a steady, sure motion and quickly concentrated her healing energies. Dark, heart’s blood gushed out of the dark elf’s mouth and more poured from his wound as he slipped into unconsciousness. Using the bed sheet to staunch the flow of blood she raised her voice in prayer to Tunare, beseeching her to knit the flesh together beneath her hands. Feeling his life fade before her, she threw herself more fully into the healing; she was the chosen Avatar of Tunare! She would not lose this battle! Fully immersed in her desperate fight, wave after wave of blue healing light spilled forth from her hands until the skin beneath them was whole again. Shaking with dizziness and fatigue, she murmured, “he will live,” before falling forward into an exhausted swoon across the unconscious warrior’s chest.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Evil Comes to Call…<br />
By Brinven (this story was written by one of my good online friends, many people contributed to the &quot;Prophecy&quot; storyline!)<br />
<br />
Brinven slowly opens his eyes, and finds that there is a weight pressing on his chest, making it hard to breathe, and, at first he is concerned… was the cleric not good enough? Were his injuries too great? His anger growing, he looks around, and realizes the weight is none other than the Lady Amalthea herself. She lay upon his chest, unconscious from the effort of her labors to save him. He smiles broadly and runs one dark hand through her honey colored hair. He puts his face into the crook of her neck, inhaling the spicy scent of the zantha oil, which permeates her skin. His tongue flicks out and traces a moist line, following the curve of her jaw.<br />
<br />
He carefully pushes her aside, and rises to his feet. Lifting her slowly, he carries her to the bed, and places her upon it, pulling the covers over her. An evil chuckle escapes his lips as he thinks how easy it would be to ravage her here, and now. But too easy is exactly what it would be. He will have her when she gives herself too him! What a coup THAT will be, he thinks. He has to turn away, lest the laughter bubbling up within him escape.<br />
<br />
He looks around, and finding a small, hard-backed chair, he settles in. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small Amulet of Tunare (very much like Amalthea’s, but smaller). He places the amulet around his neck, and grasps it with one hand. Taking one last look at Amalthea, he leans his head back against the wall and promptly falls asleep.<br />
<br />
Sometime later Amalthea stirs. She awakens, looking at the rough ceiling of the room, as the memories of what had occurred the previous evening flickered through her mind. She looks towards the door and sees the drying pool of blood…<br />
<br />
“It really happened?” she asks herself. She stands and walks to the door, there is a small sigh from behind her, she whirls, and sees the warrior, head back against the wall, and sound asleep. Her eyes trace the <br />
hairline scar on his chest, roaming over the well-formed chest, the corded muscle of his arms… she flushes and looks away, but not before she sees that his hand grasps a small amulet, which hangs from his throat. She looks back, and her eyes widen as she realizes that the amulet is an Amulet of Tunare.  Can this be? Can he truly follow the Mother? She looks down, and realizes she is still clad in her undergarments; she hurriedly dresses, keeping her eyes on the sleeping warrior.<br />
<br />
As if on cue, his eyes open as she slides into her Mail Shirt. He looks up and smiles shyly, rising; he kneels in front of her, with his forehead to the floor.<br />
<br />
“Dear Sister, my life has been returned to me by you, I owe you all that I am. Please, I beseech thee, tell me what service you require.”<br />
<br />
The Lady Amalthea draws herself to her full height, and speaks.“ I cannot accept payment for doing the work of the Mother, your good health is all the coin I require. Now, if you please, it is unseemly for you to be here, alone, with me, in these chambers.”<br />
<br />
Brinven stands, and looks up into Amalthea’s eyes. “Of course dear Sister, I shall leave at once, through yon window, your honor shall not be besmirched, due to the likes of one such as I!” With this said Brinven strides to the window, opens it, and looks out, seeing no one about, he begins to climb through…<br />
<br />
“Wait!” Amalthea commands.<br />
<br />
He turns towards her, concern in his eyes. “Yes good lady?”<br />
<br />
Amalthea stutters for a second, then regains her faculties.“ You should be careful, the wound has been healed, but there is still the possibility of complications… “ She trails off and takes a step towards the window. “I must know, what happened to you last night, how did you come to be so grievously injured?”<br />
<br />
Brinven’s smile falters, and drops away, he lowers his eyes, and speaks softly. “ There are those that hate me good Sister.”<br />
<br />
Amalthea’s look of concern is replaced by ire “And what reason have you given them to dislike you so much that they wish you dead?” she asks primly.<br />
<br />
“Oh, my crimes are many dear Sister.’ Brinven says sarcastically “I had the temerity to be born in a city some 10 miles from here. And then to further my crimes against all humanity, I had the unmitigated gall to wear this skin color!&quot; Brinven extends his arm towards Amalthea, rubbing his forearm. &quot;And as if that were not enough, I then fled the dark city of my birth to find the meaning of the dreams that haunt my sleep, dreams that when discussed with my own people cause them to shun me, and call me vile names”.<br />
<br />
Taken aback at the venom in Brinven’s voice, Amalthea cannot speak for a second, but the hard look fades from her features. “I am sorry… I … I do not even know your name….”<br />
<br />
“I must apologize dear Lady&quot; Brinven's features soften immediately, &quot;tis not your fault these prejudices exist, my name is Brinven. I claim no surname, as I do not claim the land of my birth.”<br />
<br />
Amalthea’s resolve returns, and she offers a tight smile. “You mentioned dreams, would you tell me of them?”<br />
<br />
Brinven looks at her for a long moment, then looks back out the window.  “It would mean a great deal to me if you would listen to me speak of my dreams, indeed, they are the reason I had come here. I heard that a Cleric of Tunare was here, and had healed a sickly child. My dreams are of the Mother, she speaks to me….”<br />
<br />
Amalthea’s features light up. “You have heard the voice of the Mother?” She asks, excitedly.<br />
<br />
Brinven allows himself a small smile, “Yes good Sister, I believe I have, but you were correct earlier, it is not seemly for one such as I to be here, alone, with you, we will speak again.”<br />
<br />
With this he turns, and slips out the window, lowering himself easily down the side of the inn.<br />
<br />
Amalthea rushes to the window, and looks down at him “You should be careful until we know that no complications exist…” she repeats her earlier warning.<br />
<br />
“No worries good Sister, I shall be fine, and if you ever require my services, please don’t hesitate to ask!” He moves further down the wall. Amalthea watches him drop lightly to the ground, and walk away to the end of the alley. She sees him walk past a Knight of Truth, Sir Breel, she thinks his name is. The Paladin looks at the Dark Elf, and Brinven smiles, and waves hello to him, the Paladin, while not friendly to him, seems to accept his presence. Amalthea closes the window and walks to her bed; she sits down, taking the Amulet into her hand.<br />
<br />
“Dearest Mother, is this a sign, are you showing me that your love encompasses all? Even the Tier’ Dal? I see that the paladin below accepts him, Sir Breel. But can I accept him? Is this your test Dear Mother?” Amalthea slides her knees under her chin, and sits, and thinks, and prays.<br />
<br />
Brinven stands on the rooftop, again gazing into the room occupied by the young cleric. He buckles his plate armor into place as he watches her. “The view is almost as good tonight as it was last night dear Amalthea, that look of complete befuddlement is almost as pleasing to my eye as your naked flesh”. He laughs again, and buckles the last of the many straps. He climbs down and walks to the bank, thinking that he will not be carrying the shield of the Slain Unicorn for a few days, the lady might be offended. Once again the evil laughter bubbles from his lips.<br />
<br />
“No, we don’t want to upset the lady, we are going to be VERY close friends!!” his laugh this time borders on the maniacal, and several haflings look up in alarm and as he walks by, they step back, clearing some room between them.<br />
<br />
He fingers the hilt of his knife. “Oh yes, very close friends indeed….”<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My favorite story I ever wrote - I wrote this is a mad rush at 3:00 in the morning...<br />
<br />
Evil Whispers<br />
By Amalthea<br />
<br />
Amalthea sat on a hillside under her lace-trimmed parasol caught up in a delightful daydream. In her dream, she alone was responsible for uniting the high elves with their poor, misguided dark elf cousins. Dark elf <br />
children played in the streets of Felwithe and the cities of Felwithe and Neriak were united in art, music and learning. Smiling gleefully, she pictured herself having tea with the archbishop. “So tell me, Lady Amalthea,” the archbishop would exclaim jovially, “just how did you know that Tunare wished to be reunited with her lost children?”<br />
<br />
“Well,” she would say, “I knew that I was the chosen of Tunare, her beloved disciple, her Avatar upon the land. It would seem only logical that she would turn to me to help her achieve her dream. Since I knew that the Mother loved all her creatures, when Brinven told me of his dreams of the Mother, I knew she must long to have them returned to her bosom!”<br />
<br />
Smiling modestly under the gaze of her proud papa, she would accept another cup of tea from the formerly frosty Mother Superior. “Clever girl! Learned it all in my convent!” the Mother Superior would proclaim, beaming at the archbishop.<br />
<br />
Caught up in her blissful reverie, Amalthea failed to hear the stealthy footsteps approach upon the grass. As a bubble of laughter burst out from her as she imagined herself being crowned Princess of Felwithe, she was startled to see a dark blue face appear under her parasol. “Hello, dear Lady!” exclaimed the dark elf of her daydream, “pray tell me what is so amusing, alone on this hillside.”<br />
<br />
“Um, Brinven,” she stammered, discomfited by his sudden presence. “I was, ah, remembering a funny joke that I heard.”<br />
<br />
He smiled at her, “Please tell me it, I always do enjoy a good jest.”<br />
<br />
Desperately the cleric cast her mind about for a suitable joke, “Well, an orc, a goblin and a gnoll walked into a bar,” she was horrified to hear herself say, beginning to recite the bawdiest joke she knew, one she had overheard on the boat from Butcher Block. She stopped abruptly, her blush deepening to a crimson tint.<br />
<br />
Brinven gently nudged her, “Go on.” He thought he knew the joke and was intrigued to see if she would actually tell it.<br />
<br />
The high elf lowered her eyes in dismay, “I really don’t tell jokes that well, it’s not very funny anyway.” Anxious to change the subject, she blurted out, “Have you eaten your midday meal yet?”<br />
<br />
Brinven looked at her appraisingly, he was eager to spend time with her and she was making it so easy! “What a pleasant idea, dear sister. It would not be right of course, for me to accompany you to an inn, but perhaps a lunch al fresco, here on the hillside would be pleasant? I have bread and cheese and fresh berries, would you care for wine?”<br />
<br />
The Lady Amalthea stiffened slightly, “My papa does not approve of strong spirits for ladies,” she said primly.<br />
<br />
“Of course,” Brinven replied smoothly, “how about the juice of freshly pressed moss berries? I heard there is a vendor nearby that sells the juice poured over crushed ice that he fetches all the way from the highest peaks of Everfrost. He calls it a “snowcone.” Would you like one?”<br />
<br />
Amalthea smiled in delight, showing the dimple in her cheek. “That would be most pleasant, Sir Brinven, lead on.”<br />
<br />
He extended his hand gallantly in order to assist her to her feet. Warily, she placed her soft white hand in his own strongly callused dark one and he lifted her gracefully to her feet. Offering her the crook of his arm, they walked slowly down the path in East Commons toward the inn where the vendor sold his wares.<br />
<br />
Upon reaching the inn, he held the door open for her to enter. Smiling at his fine manners (normally so sadly lacking on this uncouth continent of Antonica!) she preceded him into the small, dark inn. The vendor, an old, bent man looked over his counter in disgust. “I don’t sell to dark elves,” he snarled. He turned to Amalthea and spat at her feet, “Nor their doxies that should know better than to associate with their ilk.”<br />
<br />
Affronted, Amalthea drew breath to condemn the rude vendor. “Peace, sister,” Brinven said gently, “This hatred for my dark skin exists everywhere. It is my lot to have been born a dark elf.” He sighed sadly, “Let us depart this place.” Bowing low to the vendor, who glared threateningly, the warrior steered Amalthea out of the inn by her elbow.<br />
<br />
Gasping with rage, Amalthea exclaimed, “Of all the nerve! To be so rude, doxy indeed!” Angrily she stomped down the path.<br />
<br />
Brinven stopped her and placed a hand on her chin, “I admire your defense of me, sister, but that prejudice will always exist. Let us eat and discuss my dreams. I long for your wise counsel.”<br />
<br />
Flushing at the feel of his warm hand on her face, Amalthea readily agreed and they quickly found a secluded glade to eat their meal. After hungrily filling their empty bellies, they began to talk quietly. Dabbing at her lip daintily with her napkin, the high elf asked, “What does the Lady Tunare ask you in her dreams? Does she mention returning to her?”<br />
<br />
Seizing on this idea, the dark elf was quick to elaborate. “Aye, sister!  She appears to me clad in the finest white robes, the creatures of the forest at her feet. She gazes at me so sadly! A mother bereft, she beckons…I move to follow and she says, not just you, child. Then she slowly fades from my view. The dream breaks my heart and I have it every night.” His eyes lowered in feigned pain, he snuck a glance at Amalthea through his eyelashes, pleased to see her look of touched sympathy. He had struck a tender place! He would work on this opening with all his wit and guile. The warrior moved a bit away from her, as if overcome with emotions.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, he saw an awesome sight; a mighty winged griffon in the distance, majestically flapping away from them. The warrior turned to call to Amalthea where she sat repackaging their lunch remains and his mind turned to the strange bond he had attempted to forge between them with her healing powers. “Amalthea,” he called with the force of his mind, focusing on her essence, her true inner self that would give him control over her, “Amalthea.” Her head turned slowly as if hearing a faint whisper, she raised her eyes to him.<br />
<br />
A look of confusion settled over the cleric’s patrician features. “Did you say my name?” she asked uncertainly.<br />
<br />
“Yes,” he exclaimed quickly, “Come look at this griffon, isn’t he beautiful? So fierce, so dangerous…yet still one of Tunare’s beloved creatures.”<br />
<br />
She moved to stand near him and he was overcome with a near painful rush of success. His plan had been so dangerous, so risky. He had put his life in her delicate, life-giving hands on the chance that she would go against her entire upbringing and training to save him. Brinven gloated, he had judged her true sweet, unselfish nature correctly and he nearly crowed aloud with his victory. This control over the Healer was worth any price. Drunk with the thought of his power over her, he wondered how far would it go. Would she walk in the griffon’s path if he asked? Would she give her life for him?<br />
<br />
Gazing at Amalthea’s luminous face, he was struck by the beauty of her wide violet eyes. The fierce breeze had loosened her tightly braided hair and soft wisps escaped to dance around her face. The small mole above her lip drew his eyes to the softness of her smiling mouth. Brinven stared at her mouth avidly. He was aware that her breathing had quickened, a small pulse fluttered in her throat; her rose petal lips had parted ever so slightly. Desperately he wanted to kiss that mouth, not fiercely, but gently, to taste her, to stoke the sweet passion he knew burned within her. The combination of her innocence and her desire inflamed him. “Yes,” he thought savagely, “I must possess her, she must be mine for the sake of the prophecy.” A place within his heart he never knew existed said quietly, “No, she must simply be mine.” Aghast at the conflicted feelings swirling within him, he turned from her abruptly.<br />
<br />
“I must go,” he said gruffly, annoyed that the usual glib, silken lies did not spring to his tongue easily.<br />
<br />
Amalthea blinked at his sharp change in demeanor, “Is it that late already? Must you leave? I was so enjoying our conversation.” She tentatively put a white, slim-fingered hand on his forearm.<br />
<br />
“I must go,” he repeated awkwardly, cursing himself for an idiot. He quickly gathered his things and a small bit of his composure. Turning to the Lady, he forced a smile. “There are matters that need my attention most urgently, dear Lady. I hope to continue our conversation soon.” Taking her hand in his own, he raised it to his lips, closing his eyes briefly as he scented the spicy flowers she favored. Releasing her hand quickly, he bowed deeply and stalked out of the clearing.<br />
<br />
As night fell, his rage at his weakness, the power of his thwarted desire and his desperate uncertainty created a fierce storm within him. His fury grew with each step and the blood lust pounded in his temples. Brinven stealthily retraced his steps to the darkened inn he had visited earlier with Amalthea. With one hand he gently tried the door but found it locked. “No matter,” he thought to himself and he drew his finely honed blade. Silently, he cut the rawhide hinges, carefully easing the door to the ground. Like smoke, he glided into the darkened room, which was still and empty. His sharp, pointed ears heard the sound of rustling emanating from the back room. Smoothly, he eased around the broad path of moonlight in the room and headed towards the sound. Standing in the shadows, he observed the owner sorting through stock. The vendor raised his head and saw the dark elf standing in the doorway.<br />
<br />
“I’m closed,” he said querulously, “and I told you, I don’t serve yer kind.”<br />
<br />
Brinven closed the distance between them with two quick strides, “Ah, but you will serve me,” he said with a curled lip, “You will serve me with the all the time that remains of your short life.” He raised his blade, which gleamed in the moonlight.<br />
<br />
“No, please…please, I didn’t mean it, of course, you may shop here,” the old vendor whined piteously, edging backwards from the dreadful blade. “I have a wonderful selection of Erudite silk, at cost for you. Or the finest perfumes of Felwithe, you may have them, anything just want, just leave!”<br />
<br />
The dark elf advanced, as irresistible as the tides. Raising the blade he slashed at the old man’s arm, blood as red as the darkest rose poured out. Breathing in deeply the sweet smell of blood, Brinven examined the stain on the blade, “The blade is sharp, yes?” He laughed shortly, “I should know.”<br />
<br />
His wounded arm cradled before him, the vendor scuttled backwards, desperate to keep distant from the warrior’s slow, menacing approach. “Please,” he begged again, “I have a wife, children…please my lord, don’t kill me.”<br />
<br />
Quick as a striking snake the blade darted forth to gash the man’s chest. “A wife, eh?” Brinven sneered, “Is she pretty? Does she need my special “attention?” Any daughters? Young and nubile, I hope.”<br />
<br />
The old man groaned, “Mercy, my lord! Please I beg you!” Weak from lack of blood, his movements slowing, he staggered, trying desperately to keep his feet.<br />
<br />
The blade flashed again and again and again, each time making a small, deep cut. Blood, that precious life stuff, spilled out onto the floor in a spreading lake to splash against Brinven’s bronze boots. After long brutal minutes had passed, the vendor fell to his knees before the dark elf, his bleeding hands raised to ward off the blows. “Please…my…lord…spare…me,” he gasped, “mercy!”<br />
<br />
With a growl, Brinven slit the man’s throat from ear to ear. “No sweet-faced cleric of Tunare to save you, old man,” he muttered savagely, striding forward to capture as much of the spouting blood as possible in an old leather wineskin. Satisfied that the wineskin was full, he rose to his feet and brutally kicked the dead body. The turmoil in his dark heart calmed by the violence, he turned and left the building, melting into the shadows as if one of them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">:)  I hadn't re-read these in over a year but I still love them.  Here's another story from Brinven/Zalan/Anotos/Athion (he played 4 roles in the Prophecy storyline).  <br />
<br />
Evil Meets<br />
By Brinven<br />
<br />
The sun had set over an hour ago, and in that time Brinven had not moved. Utterly motionless, he blended into the darkness. Slowly glancing around, he assured himself that no one else was within view. Standing, he strode towards the narrow mountain path that would lead him into Nektulos forest.  Moments later he was breathing the fresh forest scent of home…<br />
<br />
Tunare will show you the way” he mimics Amalthea’s words scornfully, laughing as he opens the wine skin of blood, and pours a few drops on a symbol of Innoruk carved into the mountainside. “And Innoruk will drag you kicking and screaming…” He laughs again, then corks the skin, and sits down to await the arrival of the Necro.  His wait is brief, as the Necromancer has been warned of the consequences of being late.<br />
<br />
“Well Brinven, how goes the plan?” the necro asks quietly.<br />
<br />
“Perfectly, of course!” he smiles as he rises to his feet.<br />
<br />
“There is a matter of some import of which we must speak” he reaches into his robe, and removes a rolled up parchment, which he unrolls, and looks down at.  “Ah! You have translated more of the dark writings? Does it reveal the second part of the Prophecy?”<br />
<br />
“Nay Brinven, but it does speak of it, or more specifically, some of the parts of it. I believe there is another involved that you must be on the look out for…”“You speak of the One who Makes?” Brinven asks mildly.<br />
<br />
The Necromancer looks up from the parchment quickly “You know of him already? You know who he is?”<br />
<br />
“I have an idea, I have searched all of Amalthea’s paperwork, and it seems that there are only two in that miserable collection of do-gooders that fit the requirements, we shall simply kill them both. I believe we will need the troll for this one, as I can’t be everywhere at once.”<br />
<br />
“The… troll?” The Necromancer looks unsettled “I do not like dealing with that one, he looks at me as if he is considering what I would taste like baked over an open flame!”<br />
<br />
Brinven throws back his head and laughs heartily “Don’t be ridiculous, trolls like their meat raw!!” Brinven begins to laugh harder, and louder.<br />
<br />
“Well that makes me feel ever so much better! Fine, I will deal with him. Who is his target?”<br />
<br />
“We will send him after the scholarly one, Athion. He has been locked away for a good long time, but now trods the soil again, when next he appears, have the troll kill him. I will handle the other, this “steel slinger” fellow.”<br />
<br />
“I will go then, is there anything else you require?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, I need you to contact the Warrior, we may have need of him, and his slave.”<br />
<br />
The Necro smiles, “as you wish” he turns, and begins to walk away…<br />
<br />
“Wait friend, I have something for you”<br />
<br />
He turns toward Brinven, and sees him holding a wineskin up. “What have you there?”<br />
<br />
“Tis the blood of a murdered man… an innocent man, killed for no real reason, other than the joy of killing.”<br />
<br />
The Necromancer’s eyes light up and he hurries towards Brinven, reaching eagerly for the bag. Brinven hands it too him, and smiles. “Use it well friend, feed the forces of darkness, that they may make us stronger, and make our enemies weaker!”<br />
<br />
“I pray you are not underestimating the forces of good in this matter Brin. Do I need remind you that the penalty exacted upon us, should we fail, will be exceedingly steep?”<br />
<br />
Brinven stops laughing abruptly. “Nay, my Dark Brother, I am well aware of the consequences of failure. I watched my own father melt, after causing the displeasure of those we serve, his transgression was minor, but the pain he suffered was unimaginable.”<br />
<br />
“Keep those thoughts well to the front my friend. What happened to your father will be as nothing, I have seen their handiwork all too often, they grow restless, and that bodes ill for us all. The casting of the bones has shown that the Lifegiver and the Blade are near. The two of them are more than powerful enough to destroy you and our plans.”<br />
<br />
Brinven glares at the young Necromancer for a moment, then smiles. “I understand your concern my friend, but be at ease, I have planned well and carefully. We shall be triumphant!” <br />
<br />
“I pray you are correct….” The Necromancer hugs the wineskin close to his body, and turns and walks away, heading towards Neriak, infamous home of the Dark Elves.<br />

Evil Baits the Hook<br />
By Amalthea<br />
<br />
With a wood wisdom that would make a druid proud, Brinven silently trailed Amalthea through the forest. He had stealthily remained far enough behind that she had been unaware of his presence all morning. Wondering at the purpose of her unhurried stroll, he started as a shriek split the air. He picked up his pace, hurrying down the path after Amalthea. The woods and brush were thick, but through gaps in the branches he could see her blonde hair racing down the path and to his horror an enormous Kodiak pursuing. The dark elf warrior notched an arrow to his bow, his heart pounding as he ran chased after them. As he neared a clearing, he saw the huge black beast looming over the elfin maid. The warrior drew the bow to his cheek and made ready to let the arrow fly when he heard Amalthea’s shrieks change to giggling. “Silly old Bruin” he heard her say with a muffled laugh. Peering through the leafy foliage he was astonished to see the great bear energetically licking Amalthea’s squirming face. “Stop, stop,” she begged breathlessly. “Slobbering bear, enough!”<br />
<br />
The kodiak made that strange howling, barking noise of bears and sat back on his haunches, his front paws batting the air, looking for all the world like a begging puppy. The high elf sat up and scrubbed her face with a delicate, lace-trimmed handkerchief, exclaiming, “Look what you’ve done to me! I’m all wet and covered with your disgusting fur. You are a bad old bear and shan’t have your treat.”<br />
<br />
In response, the great bear made his strange howling noise again, lowering his nose to snuffle the lady’s pockets. Amalthea laughed and threw her arms around the bear’s neck, although he was so huge that her hands did not meet. “You are my beloved brother of Tunare, old bear, and of course, you shall have your treat.” Smiling at the bear, she reached into her pack and pulled out a folded square of rawhide. She unwrapped the package to reveal a large honeycomb. Breaking it into small pieces, she placed a bit of the sweet treat directly into the large toothed mouth. Brinven shuddered to see her small hands nearly engulfed by the bear’s mouth. He heard Amalthea say, “Your friendship is a blessing from the goddess, old Bruin, and I do enjoy our visits.”<br />
<br />
Watching her play with her ursine friend, Brinven was struck by a devious plan and slipped back along the path to seek his evil accomplice. He quickly came upon the Necromancer bent over a foul smelling spellbook, bound in human flesh. “Hail,” he said shortly, “I have need of your talents for acquiring rare things.”<br />
<br />
The Necromancer ceased his scribing and straightened, “Hail Brinven, how goes your effort to bind the Healer to you? I have heard ripples that the Lifegiver and the Blade are aware of our plans and move to stop you.”<br />
<br />
Brinven smiled coldly, “Fetch me what I require and I swear she will willingly be mine.” Lowering his head he whispered in the Necromancer’s ear.<br />
<br />
The Necromancer cackled with unholy glee. “Your cunning is a tribute to our race, friend. I know where to find what you seek and I will return in a moment.”<br />
<br />
Brinven stalked the confined place in a fury of impatience but the Necromancer was true to his word and reappeared in minutes. He placed a small leather bag in Brinven’s hand, “Mistletoe powder, as requested.”<br />
<br />
The warrior clasped the Necromancer’s shoulder, “You amaze me, friend. Worry not, this should be the final hook for our pretty fish.” With a laugh, he turned and left the Necromancer and returned to stalking his prey.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The mage in this story is Emokeeper, a guildmate who also wrote stories for the Prophecy storyline.  He (well, the character) had a bit of a crush on the Lady Amalthea, but who could blame him?  :p<br />
<br />
<br />
Hook, Line and Sinker<br />
By Amalthea<br />
<br />
Brinven retraced Amalthea’s path with ease. It was a simple matter to find the crushed grass and fur where she had romped with the bear and then follow her light footsteps eastward towards an orc encampment.<br />
<br />
The dark elf warrior heard the ringing clash of battle and broke into a run. Entering the orc camp he grit his teeth to see his quarry in a desperate fight with a mighty orc legionnaire. Amalthea had dropped her shield, one hand pressed to her side where a wound spilled crimson blood down her tunic. Brinven cursed that one slip of a girl should be able to get into so much trouble during his short absence and drew his weapons. Before he could meet the orc in battle, it struck a terrible blow across Amalthea’s temple and she crumpled silently in a heap at the monster’s feet.<br />
<br />
With a roar, Brinven entered the fight, taunting the foul beast to leave the fallen high elf. The orc was a powerful creature, but the dark elf’s rage made him an equal opponent. He struck blow after blow at its scaly skin, causing it to reel back. Fear for Amalthea’s safety lending him strength, he plunged his blade into the orc’s throat.<br />
<br />
Ignoring the creature’s dying wail, Brinven sank to the ground by the cleric's side, horrified by her deathly pallor and the bright blood staining the ground beneath her. He quickly grabbed bandages out of his pack and began to press them to the gash in her side, the white cloth swiftly soaked through with blood.  Keeping one hand pressed tightly to her side, the dark elf gently shook her, “Amalthea, wake up, you must wake up and heal yourself, your injuries are greater than my skill to tend them.” Her stillness frightened him greatly and he continued to entreat her to awaken. He softly touched the blood-matted hair on her temple, “Please, Amalthea, you mustn’t die like this.” Straining, he reached for the link between them, but could only see it dimly, a tattered pale ribbon.<br />
<br />
“It is not her destiny to die in this orc camp!” he thought to himself furiously, “Either I win her heart and she takes her last fateful steps out of love for me or I use this bond to drag her, she will be the Sacrifice of Light the prophecy foretells. Her death will blot the sun and all light and good will be extinguished forever. ”“Amalthea!” he shouted, “Wake up!”<br />
<br />
With a shuddering gasp her eyes opened. Her lips soundlessly formed the shape of his name. Brinven caught his breath, “Amalthea, you must heal yourself. You are bleeding badly and I can’t staunch it.”<br />
<br />
Her sooty lashes lowered into a fan on her cheek and her head rolled to the side. “Tired,” he heard her say in a whisper. “Let me sleep.”<br />
<br />
“Amalthea,” he rasped, pressing a dark hand to one ashen cheek, “If you sleep now, you will never wake, you must heal yourself.” Feeling her slip away from him, the bandage soaked through with fresh blood, he concentrated on the slender tendril he could see between them with his mind’s eye. He bore down with his will, forcing her to action and felt the bond suddenly strengthen and flare brightly. He moved both hands to her injury and pressed it tightly.<br />
<br />
The high elf’s brows came together in concentration and Brinven saw her glow with a shimmering blue light. Under his hand, the blood slowed to a trickle. “Again,” he ordered, the blue light engulfing her once more. Pleased, he watched color return to her pale face and the terrible bruise on her face faded to a dull yellow.<br />
<br />
Amalthea opened her eyes. “The legionnaire?” she asked softly.<br />
<br />
“Dead by my sword,” he replied, stroking the curve of her jaw with one finger. “Can you sit up?” When she nodded slowly, he eased her into a sitting position and was relieved to see the wound on her side had closed to an angry red line.<br />
<br />
The high elf leaned her head on his bronze shoulder. “I thought I would wake in Tunare’s palace,” she confessed with a shaky laugh.<br />
<br />
Brinven carefully helped her to her feet, one arm clasped tightly around her waist. “Much as I venerate Tunare, I was loath to allow her the sole pleasure of your company. Enough fighting for you today, let me escort you back to town.”<br />
<br />
“My head feels full of cotton,” said the elfin maid.<br />
<br />
Brinven chuckled, “Being brained by a lego will do that to a person.” Taking her arm he slung it over his shoulder. “Lean on me,” he directed, supporting her. Amalthea was slightly taller than the dark elf but much more slender and he was easily able to support her as she took a trembling step.<br />
<br />
As they followed the path through a thicket, they came upon a great black bear clawing at termites in a rotten log. “Get back, Sir Brinven,” Amalthea exclaimed quickly, attempting to remove his arm from her waist. Brinven cast a quick look at Amalthea as he slipped one hand into the powder concealed within the leather pouch he had attained from the Necromancer, but she was not watching him. Her eyes were firmly fixed on the bear that had risen to his hind legs and was snuffling the air with great gulps.<br />
<br />
Brinven coated his hands with the fine mistletoe powder, a rare substance with the power to befriend the wildest beast. He lightly sprinkled the powder on his body. “Do not worry, dear lady,” he said smoothly, “Bears and their woodland cousins have always been my friends.” He strode forward confidently and came to rest before the bear. The bear made a happy noise of pleasure, dropping to four legs and pressing his great head against Brinven’s chest. His heart shook to be so close to a dangerous animal. Brinven scratched the bear’s ears as casually as possible, turning around to see Amalthea.<br />
<br />
The cleric’s radiant face nearly took his breath away. Her eyes were lit from within with a luminous fervor and her cheeks were flushed with high color. Amalthea clutched her amulet of Tunare to her breast and said tremulously, “Brinven, this is a sign! A sign you are a true child of Tunare. My own bond with the Goddess was acknowledged by all in this same fashion.” Raising a shaking hand to him, she continued, “None shall doubt this marvelous thing. You are a portent from Tunare that she misses her dark children and welcomes them home. We must tell the Order, they will be overjoyed at this glorious news!”<br />
<br />
Unsure of the potency of the enchanted powder, Brinven gave the bear a last pat and returned to Amalthea’s side. Putting his arm around her middle again, he gently steered her back along the path towards Freeport. “I beg you to say not a word of this to anyone, dear lady. There are those that would seek my death, those that would like nothing more than to stamp out the movement for the great unification. I trust no one but you with my secret.”<br />
<br />
Amalthea looked down in dismay. “But surely you could trust my guild members. They are wise and would know what to do, I feel a need of their counsel.”<br />
<br />
Brinven stopped abruptly and fell to his knees before the elfin maid. Grasping her pale hands in his dark ones, he said, “I must have your word, Amalthea, that you will not speak of this. There is danger everywhere and to even speak my name could bring it down upon yourself.”<br />
<br />
Looking at his earnest upturned face, Amalthea nodded. “Of course, dear friend, I will respect your wishes.” Brinven regained his feet. Sighing, she looped her arm around him and placed her head against his shoulder as they walked along the path.<br />
<br />
Brinven wanted to shout his victory to the heavens of Norrath. He had set the bait and she had taken it. Through the link, he knew her well. The high elf was proud, vain and willful but she had a strong sense of loyalty. She would serve his purpose and take her place in the prophecy. His mind returned unwillingly to the memory of her milk white face as she lay bleeding in his arms. He clenched his teeth at the thought of her eventual death as the Sacrifice of Light. The dark elf shuddered as he pictured her violet eyes closed forever by his own hand. Catching her to him as she stumbled slightly he was achingly aware of her soft form against him. Unnoticed by her, he allowed his lips to lightly brush her hair. “Weak fool,” he thought scornfully. “These soft thoughts are unworthy of a Teir’Dal warrior. Our enemies, the pale ones, celebrate love with poem and song, but we are far stronger than that pitifully feeble race. My father died in writhing agony but that will not be my fate. I know my place in the prophecy and I will not fail!”<br />
<br />
He released her gently when they reached the doorway to her inn. Amalthea looked at him with her clear eyes. “Good night, cousin,” she said quietly, “I have much to think on this evening.”<br />
<br />
Taking her hand, Brinven pressed his it to her lips, allowing his tongue to trace the sensitive valley between her first and second finger. When he felt her hand tremble within his, he let go, saying simply, “Good night, cousin.” Smiling inwardly at her look of maidenly confusion, he watched her turn quickly and vanish within the dark doorway.<br />
<br />
Brinven’s eyes narrowed, “Convince her now, Lifegiver. Convince her now that I am not her beloved friend in Tunare.” Wholly focused on his sweet triumph, he failed to hear the angry footsteps approaching and was taken completely by surprise by the hard blow to the jaw that rocked his head back.<br />
<br />
Dropping to a fighter’s crouch, he eyed the angry high elf, dressed in the purple robes of a mage. Rubbing his jaw thoughtfully, he spat a mouthful of blood at the mage’s feet. “Fairly good punch for a book lovin’, weak-wristed, pretty boy magician,” he remarked.<br />
<br />
The high elf balled his fists. “You aren’t fit to be in that lady’s presence,” he hissed angrily. <br />
<br />
Brinven allowed a lazy smile to spread over his face. A one on one fight with a powerful mage might find him at a disadvantage. Keeping the pale one angry and off balance would serve him well. “Amalthea?” he asked. “She thought I was fit enough in her bed.”<br />
<br />
Side stepping the next furious punch, the warrior pulled his blade slowly, his eyes lit with a feral gleam, the heat of battle warming his blood. “That blonde hair, that creamy skin, she’s a sweet armful. Tastes like honey, a bit noisy for my tastes, but you might like it.”<br />
<br />
“You will die for that,” the magician announced coldly, his eyes filled with a killing rage. Mystical energy filled the air and Brinven stepped forward to try to interrupt the casting with his sword.<br />
<br />
“What is this, lads?” asked a bluff and hearty voice. Out of the corner of his eye, Brinven saw Guard Jascen approaching. “Fighting in the streets of Freeport? I won’t have it.” Brinven sheathed his sword, his eyes never leaving the angry eyes of the high elf. “This is my city, boys, and I won’t have a pair of Elvin hooligans bloodying it.” Glaring at Brinven he added, “I don’t like you dark elves in my town anyway. Now be gone from my sight. Both of you,” he added sharply as he saw the high elf mage hesitate. “In opposite directions, lads,” the guard said with a smile.<br />
<br />
Brinven touched his jaw again and nodded shortly to the mage who returned his look stonily. If they met again, only one would live to walk away. Bowing at the waist, Brinven turned and walked down the dusty street of Freeport.<br />
