<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Besides the lil issues that dont mena alot, the scoring system has to be the single big problem i find with this expansion. I dont see why its there and why they dont remove it. There is no point to it other then bragging rights, which is all fine and dandy, but it simply drives people apart which i &quot;thought&quot; was against the idea behind LDoN. I thought it was to get back to the roots and encourage random groupinbg, which this is great for, but with the ranking system you have people and i mean ALOT of people, wanting to play but worried about their ranking.<br />
<br />
Look SoE, i know your afraid to lose the hard core raiding/power gaming demographic, but you cant have it both ways. The people you claim to aim LDoN at are not like the people that your aimed PoP at and you cant mix the 2 groups together, atleast not in this manner. Personaly i think if they would just take out the ranking system the expansion would be even more used then it is now. I can think of so many times where i invited a guildie or a stranger to a pick up gorup and i get &quot; well what level are they cause i dont wanna have a loss&quot; or &quot; No i dont LDoN unless its with so and so, i know ill win with them&quot;. Seems to go against the object of it all. Honestly i think time should be taken off normal and only added to a medium nad hard level so that people can come together and just play for fun and joke and have fun, no always be under the gun to win Win WIN !!!.<br />
<br />
my 2 cents anyway /shrug</div></div><hr />

I like the ranking system.  The ranking system hasn't prevented me from getting a group ever.  I have yet to experience this system 'driving people apart' either.  In fact, the ranking system has promoted me to group with random other players because I had factual statistical information to view concerning their experience in a particular theme.  Hey, this ranger I've never heard of before is ranked #56 in this theme, and has 30 wins and no losses in Rujarkian ----good person to have!<br />
<br />
The only separatism I'd imagine is that exceptionally bad players will (eventually) have a harder time finding groups.  Not a bad thing in my book.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In general I don’t have a problem with the ranking system.  For those who care about such things it gives them something else to play with.  For those of us who couldn’t care less its still kind of fun to look at and make fun of.  However, Frekkels’ post actually gives me a reason not to like it.  Just because someone has a lot of losses does NOT mean they are a bad player.  I know of one person who has six losses thus far due to adventure glitches.  And if you are unlucky enough to get into some bad groups it only takes one fool to cause you to lose the adventure.  I only have three losses out of about forty adventures thus far, but then I only go on adventures if I’m with at least one or two people I know I can count on and they in turn usually invite friends.  When you put up the LFA tag anything can happen.<br />
<br />
The ranking system is nothing more than a toy.  If people start using it to gage other player’s abilities then I would support a petition to have it removed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Skeeter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As y'all know, Test drops.  A lot.  Unannounced mostly.  If you've accepted an adventure, are in an adventure, whatever -- if you haven't completed it, it's a loss.  Even if you just zoned in when the server drops.  LOSS.<br />
<br />
So we have some really good players with horrendous records.<br />
<br />
Granted, y'all don't have this problem.  But if your server 'hiccups' a few times or drops unnaounced a few times, might want to watch for this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A few random losses here and there wouldn't bother me. I think what you would see from an exceptionally bad player would be in the area of 10-15% of wins after about 20 or so adventures. If someone loses that much, I would tend to think that they have some problems with their playstyle that causes them to lose so much.<br />
<br />
6 losses out of 40 adventures or so wouldn't bother me in the slightest. Just people who have a winning percentage far under 50%.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I bet if you took the rankings out of LDoN and just left points to be accumulated to buy things that someone somewhere would make a rankings website :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zacknaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've had great adventures, hardly ever have problems finding a group.  I've lost a total of 13 times, won 41.  Of the 13 losses, 3 were due to the server dropping, about 6 of them were due to people getting in too much of a hurry, 2 I just quit because people zoned in and started timer before anybody was buffed and started pulling too many mobs).  People messing with the chests and things before adventure completion and causing wipe have also messed up adventures, luckily those were all near the beginning when the expansion first came out.  There will always be reasons that you can fail an adventure, but if you concentrate and work together, i.e. assist the MT, and everyone does what they are there to do, you can even complete the adventure successfully when someone decides to log after you've gotten the adventure but before you zone into the adventure zone.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I try to always group with friends, but sometimes that's not possible, so I group with whoever I can get a group with without waiting for hours.  For the most part, I'd say that the groups with people in them that I don't know do as well as, if not better, than the ones with friends in them.  I do my best to get all the mobs slowed, even the ones that resist 3 or 4 times (GRRRR), and the rest of the group does their part.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I get tells all the time, and rarely have to wait more than 10-15 minutes to get a group.  I just try to remember the ones that don't do their part, such as going AFK a long time or the zoners before people are ready.</div></div><hr />

Hail,<br />
<br />
You can select ranking by theme if you want.  Also, a percentage of losses is to be expected (as far as I'm concerned anything above 80% is still doing well when I'm looking at strangers), and not something to be concerned about.  But if you are losing more than half that you are trying, that sends a message.  Your friends who know you to be a good player would still group with you of course.  Though I'm personally only ranked in the 400 range (last I checked anyway) I am in the top 100 for Rujarkian Themes.  Does it mean anything?  Not really.  My Guk ranking is abysmal in contrast. :p <br />
<br />
There are some people (as mentioned) who have phenomenally BAD adventure rates. They aren't worried about them whatsoever because they are going in solo or duo and just whacking named for loot, which is their choice.  They in fact may be much more experienced/skilled on Advenutres than someone like myself.<br />
<br />
You can't see the entire rankings as far as I know.  They are important or as worthless as you want them to be, which is why I don't see them  presenting any problems any more than EQranking profiles do.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

What a stuck-up fool. An hour later after we had won, he was still looking for a group. And yes, he had a perfect record, and yes, it was entirely the kind of behaviour Litgruv is warning of, so it does happen, sometimes...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">We had a guy sitting there LFG for half an hour or more while we were setting up an adventure.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've never used these to determine who I want in my group.  I have a pretty regular group and we've done a few LDoN adventures (we've stopped, our ranger wants to hit 65 after having AAed for eq/AM3 and our rogue wants escape so we're in BoT, HoH, and now Tactics).  I'm one of the guys who recruits, I first look for friends and peeps I know (even by reputation), then just for the best fit and what guild the person's in (there are a couple boner guilds on BB we avoid like the plague).<br />
<br />
I have never recieved a snobby response based on record (we're in the high 80's for successes overall), but I have recieved one based on guild.  Some guy would only play with one specific uberguild (one he wasn't in FYI) and wouldn't play with us because he's had too many failed attempts in the past with members of lesser guilds.  I put him on ignore and took pride in the fact that after completeing our first of 2 successful advent's that night, he was still LFG.  The SK in our group went ape and sent him a tell with his rank and successes that clearly outdid this other guy, then put him on ignore.  Although the guy's reasoning for saying no was lame, he tried to be polite and we were perhaps a little too reactive, but really, it's not like he would ever group with us, so we might as well ignore him.<br />
<br />
In short, I have no issues with the ranking system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Rankings don't really mean anything.  Alot of people fail when trying new things, that doesn't necessarily mean they suck at playing the game it just means that they are working out strats and dealing with something new.  When LDoN first came out I had a record of something like 9-9, and then 12-14 etc.   Losses were from things like people quitting halfway through (had a lot of that at first) and people just generally not paying attention and thinking it was going to be like sitting in PoV or something.   <br />
<br />
After weeding out the bad players on my own and creating my own groups I stopped losing, and found a bunch of good friends to boot.  yeah you run into snobs every now and then, but those are exactly the people that will lose your adventures for you, cause they're too busy bitching out thier own group-mates instead of concentrating on the task at hand.</div></div><hr />

And, I'm moving up the list on my server so maybe I'll get to brag someday!  J/K!<br />
<br />
The one thing that the rankings do show is just which people on your server have absolutely no life at all.  Some folks on Xev have over 300 adventures done which is insane.  I'm not sure what this means but it does add some level of entertainment value for me (seeing just how ridiculous some people can be).<br />
<br />
I like seeing my total wins vs losses and percentage...but I could live without that too.<br />

I do LDoN because it's fun, great xp, decent loot, and a great mechanism for getting single groups going for a perfect amount of time.</div></div><hr />

And people have always kept score.  Last night I was in a pickup group of people in LDON.  I guess they weren't so high up on the scoreboard in LDON because they talked about how many aa they had, being POT flagged, blah blah.  Bragging about having x many hundred aa is no more roleplay than having x number of adv points *shrug*.  It was not a fun group, but we did win.  As long as people want to have appendage waving competitions, they will find a way to keep score.  I remember back in the day the big thing was having a full set of planar armor.  I have X pieces of planar armor is another way of keeping score.  Hell levels are scorekeeping, when you come down to it.<br />

There are people interested in roleplay, but I am not sure there are enough of them to be financially viable for an MMOG.  I'd love to see someone prove me wrong, but I haven't seen any MMOG that approaches the level of roleplay found in a roleplay mud.  Text muds rule for roleplay:)</div></div><hr />

You are correct of course.  A friend of mine compared it (LDoN) to going to Chuck-e Cheese.  The kids throw the balls, they fall in a hole, they win tickets and turn them in for prizes.  And all of this comes with bad food too. :)</div></div><hr />

How is this different from DKP?  Other than that the game is keeping up with your tickets rather than guildmember_01?<br />

Oh and yeah many people seem a bit too worried about loosing (Come on normal mode is pathetically easy as it is), on a recent adventure the group warrior was moaning about how his groups always did bad.....  whilst barely paying attention and being pretty clueless is general, thankfully I was more than happy to do most of the tanking for him =P<br />

Just play Ldon to have fun and make new friends, its far more enjoyable that way than purely gunning to have a 100% win rate and a mountain of points.</div></div><hr />

Just about any RP game has loop-holes than allow them to be played in a non-RP fashion.  However, LDoN is the first EQ expansion that emphasises non-RP values - the Frag board, the timer.  <br />
<br />
To me, the designers appear to have made the decision that Quake-style games are more interesting than role-playing games.  The problem with that is that certainly you lose any value from the role-playing aspect of EQ to gain what - a hopelessly inferior version of Quake.  I've played Quake a lot and I'd recommend it (and its multitude of clones) to anyone who likes LDoN: in fact I'd advise you to stop playing EQ because you have chosen the wrong genre to be in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Well  here is my thing though, im the type of shaman that right now is kinda sick of PoP raiding and more so guild politics ( not my guild only, just in general ) plus i just got this job a few months back and its a hour+ drive to work, so my time is valuable, LDoN fits into my current life real well and i dont pick or chose, ill pretty much take any 60-65 regardless of gear and say, &quot; Lets go have some fun&quot;. Win or lose we gain EXP and gain a great time.<br />
<br />
This ranking system puts unneed strain on the pleasurable dungeon runs, people causing a wipe go from 1 etreme of &quot; hey no big, lets rez up and keep pushing &quot; to &quot; OMG DUDE *** &quot; or /bla bla tells you, good god this cleric is retard and this warrior sucks cause he doesnt have a BoW or BoC's&quot;<br />
<br />
So imagin this, you have 1 run a night through LDoN and thats only IF you can even get on and its enjoyment is hanging by the thread of if everyone can get along. If they cant you waste 1.5 hours or whatever of which time is very important when you work 12 -/+ hours a day.<br />
<br />
Ya see where im coming from a lil more?<br />
<br />
Like the guy up top said it is some stuck up bastards sometimes that you can just brush off and say, what a jerk. But alot of times its my guildies that arent trying to be stuck up, they just wanna have a sharp record. It makes me sad that it holds us apart cause alot of my guildies are so cool and fun. I could understand if there was a point to it, if there was a reward, or if you got something for maintaining it, but there is no reason at all, its simply to say &quot;im better then you&quot; which to me i dont get.<br />
<br />
I want to win but its lowest factor  to me. I want to play and have FUN, thats what matters. I think the more fun LDoN group i had ended in failure of a boss mob , we got him down to like 4% on my SK when our healer died, i was lifetaping like a mad man trying to just las long enough for our DPS to kill it, but we failed. But all you heard in /g was  how fun it was and that was &quot;awesome!&quot;<br />
<br />
Thats EQ to  me....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The ranking system really doesn't mean a thing.  Your wins and losses are determined by your groups, not you alone.  One person can screw up an entire adventure within a minute and as a result, the whole group gets hit on the ranking list.  Just last night I went with a group to Tak-H on an assas mission and a few rooms into the zone, the ranger tells us to hold for a sec, because he wants to go in with camo to see if he can find the boss mob, who hadn't even spawned yet.  So, obviously, Camo goes down, he brings back a train and kills our Cleric.  So, we got the Cleric back up and just started killing stuff again while the ranger just sits in PoK doing nothing. Took him a half hour to finally get back and he ultimately just wasted the rest of the group's time. So, we all got shafted as far as the ranking went, but does that mean that all of us are bad LDoN players? Not at all.  I don't mind the ranking system, but anyone who uses it to decide who he/she groups with is an arse.  <br />
<br />
And, in reply to Crusty, I like LDoN but more as a boredom thing in EQ.  I remember the days of Fennin when there really were the serious RPers, like the Gresh`Maj.  What a great guild.  Anyway, I think LDoN adds that extra little mix of genre to the game which makes it better because you can pick a game style depending on your mood.  Feel like an easy going group? Go pick up a PoJ exit, or something.  Pissed and feel like really killing something? 55+ slaughter in LDoN.</div></div><hr />

I have to completely disagree.<br />
<br />
Maybe it was how i came to EQ, almost completely alone and had to feel my way around and get to know people, i didnt have friends to play with, they were on other servers. To me EQ has always been a RPG and i guess thats why im starting to dislike PoP so much anymore. I mean i remember the days of sitting on boats and talking with stangers about their adventures or walking into a pub and buying a stranger a drink cause you had a good run in Blackburrow. I remember when the thrills were simply crossing the karana's alive and when walking from Qeynos to Freeport would require a hired guide.<br />
<br />
I dunno, maybe im alone there though, im sure most people come to this game with friends. /shrug</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, because I enjoy an EQ expansion that lets me meet new people, gain experience, gain loot and save up adventure points to buy equipment I could not otherwise own I’ve chosen the wrong genre to be in?  At the very least I find your deciding what genre I should or should not play in to be presumptuous.  If you don’t enjoy LDoN and choose not to take part in any of the adventures then that’s certainly your prerogative.  But a lot of who play EQ do enjoy the adventures and that in no way belittles our enjoyment of EQ as a whole.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can meet new people, gain experience and gain loot in EQ outside of LDoN.  So unless the adventure points mechasim is what attracts you to LDoN, the part you actually find fun is very likely to be elements which are done far better in Quake.<br />

Well actually I wasn't deciding it, I was recommending you try another game that I think would suit you better.  Is that really too much?<br />
<br />
If you don&#8217;t enjoy LDoN and choose not to take part in any of the adventures then that&#8217;s certainly your prerogative.  But a lot of who play EQ do enjoy the adventures and that in no way belittles our enjoyment of EQ as a whole.<br />
<br />
Absolutely: What is it about my post that you found belittles how you enjoy EQ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">i dont think the score board is that bad.   I like how they changed it now to show who does hards and who does easys.  ill never be at the top of the list, but its made people compeate alot more<br />
<br />
The one thing i think LDON is missing however, is a hang out spot.  Ya ok it sounds dumb, but how many of you used to hang out in nfp, ec tunnel, the waterfall outside of thurg, nexus, etc.  Just need to add a banker to one of the wayfarer camps and boom instant hang out spot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Rankings thing is kinda stupid I agree, however can't remember who said it but they said it was a social infrastructure which I thought was true when you think about it. I don't see a reason to remove it unless you are intimidated by hardcore people.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps I misinterpreted your post.  If so I apologize.  It came across to me as if you were suggesting that those of us who enjoy LDoN do not enjoy RPGs and would be better off playing Quake.  That was what I took exception to.  <br />
<br />
I certainly don&#8217;t believe that LDoN is the perfection expansion.  In many ways I find the timer extremely annoying and the addition of a scoreboard is not exactly keeping with the RPG feel.  However, I do feel that LDoN has a lot of fantast role-play elements to it.  I&#8217;ve played D&amp;D, and many other tabletop RPGs, over the past 25 years and these adventures remind me of many of those games.  Our group often had time limits on our adventures.  If we didn&#8217;t complete them in the given amount of time there would be dire consequence, such as the NPC we were trying to save being put to death in some gruesome manner.  And as someone else pointed out, having several different monsters in a single room may not be very &#8220;realistic&#8221;, but in the early days of D&amp;D it was common to see exactly that.  <br />
<br />
LDoN has a different feel than the rest of EverQuest, but in many ways its much more reminiscent of my years of tabletop gaming than the rest of EQ ever has been.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">To me, the designers appear to have made the decision that Quake-style games are more interesting than role-playing games.  The problem with that is that certainly you lose any value from the role-playing aspect of EQ to gain what - a hopelessly inferior version of Quake.  I've played Quake a lot and I'd recommend it (and its multitude of clones) to anyone who likes LDoN: in fact I'd advise you to stop playing EQ because you have chosen the wrong genre to be in.<br />
<br />
Just for the record, I hated Quake.  It was quite boring.  I still love LDON.  Then again EQ is the first graphical multiplayer online game I've liked.  And I've never seen much if any roleplaying in EQ, though there is an interesting back story that is pretty well ignored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I don't care about the ranking system, however it's one usefulness would be to make it easier to avoid the truly inept players out there.<br />
<br />
Of all the things that need tweaking and fixing in LDoN, the ranking system falls pretty low on my list :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">You can meet new people, gain experience and gain loot in EQ outside of LDoN.  So unless the adventure points mechasim is what attracts you to LDoN, the part you actually find fun is very likely to be elements which are done far better in Quake.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well i to disagree with ya mate. I used to compete in quake, infact i was the leader of one of the top clans for ra3 in the world, we were ranked #1 more then once, anyway, quake is so far different then EQ. Quake is more like a sport where as EQ is more like a social/fantasy experience. Whiel you can meet new people in quake its far less of a social experience. <br />
<br />
Now lets look at pop for just a second. When im in a LDoN group in almost all cases its people talking and getting to know each other, there is time for it on splits and pulls and just running around the dungeon. Now in a PoP exp group i cant get hardly anyone to speak, its so much more of a hardcore enviroment. This isnt a bad thing i guess, but its definelty different from LDoN and frankly from how EQ started out and how it was meant to be .. atleast atfirst IMHO.<br />
<br />
<br />
Speaking of quake though, i wish quake4 would come out already, my clan has been in hibernation awaiting quake4 or a game worth playing, so far nothign has touch quake3, i mean quake3 felt smooth and fast like a sport, it was like soccer or B-ball, no other game has had that yet. We were waiting on the new Doom,  but we might as well wait for Duke Nukem at this point /sigh.<br />
<br />
Sorry, got a lil side tracked heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I think a lot of our disagreement at this point comes from 2 things:<br />
<br />
1.  The inadequate way in which I expressed the point I was trying to make.<br />
<br />
2.  The differences in people's playing experience due to their personal cirumstances.<br />
<br />
What I see in LDoN is a change of emphasis.  After PoP came out I had what I may come to regard as the 'golden age' of EQ.  I was one of those who stayed at level 60 and stayed out of PoP: for the first time in EQ, I - and the group of people I play with - were able to do real dungeon crawls in dungeons full of dark-blue mobs.  I didn't level to 65 until after the mob exp level nerf was removed.<br />
<br />
I had hoped the instanced dungeons in LDoN would allow me to repeat that experience.  Only this time it would be even better as the dungeons weren't designed to have to respawn for other people, and more variation in mobs and dungeon geometry were possible.<br />
<br />
What I got instead was what I consider to be a clumsy attempt to 'spice' the game up by making it a fast action game (ie. by using a timer to force you to do things quickly, rather than do things with precision).  If I wanted a fast action game I'd go back to playing Quake.<br />
<br />
The design rationale in LDoN seems to be based on the idea that forcing people to hurry makes it exciting.  I disagree with that: doing the same repetitive things with little thought for 90 minutes is boring no matter how rushed you are.  All that happens is that the in group banter that was part of the fun in EQ is now lost for me, because we don't have time to do it in LDoN.<br />
<br />
Instanced dungeons have the potential to serve us far better than that.  The dungeons mobs can be balanced to fit the precise level/equipment of YOUR party so it should be capable of providing a challenge.  With the settings as they are in LDoN we could only get that at the moment by doing the 'hard' setting, and then we'd fail on the timer and miss out on an essential part of the reward system every time.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry if I annoyed anyone by recommending you to go try out Quake.  I did say that I've played Quake a lot myself so it was not intended as an insult.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Toppo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">or the record, I've got 6 wins, 6 losses. I have a grp of 3 friends and the 4 of us will start adventures just to have our own private dungeon. Shaman shaman druid enchanter...we're NEVER gonna win one : from snapdragon<br />
<br />
Exactly! Which makes the rating thing such a useless tool. Looking at it you have no clue why &quot;x&quot; has such a useless or superb record. What if someone was boted through all his/her adventures...happens a lot too.<br />
<br />
I think its like any pick up group. Once you get rolling, you will find out very quickly if its a good one or not. Rankings mean diddly imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">The funny thing is, I used to care about my record... for the first 2 weeks I was in the top 10 on xegony, then I ran into some adventures glitches etc. and now I just realize it was stupid.  Plus now since people in my guild have seen some of the hard drops from named mobs we go there and farm for upgrades for ppl rather than to finish the mission.  We zone in, if no nameds are there we leave, if there are some up we go after them, there are some easy upgrades that can save you having to waste points at a raid for an equal or marginally better upgrade.  So, win/loss ratio is not everything I have about 50 losses from said hardmission adventures.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I find the timer in LDoN a lot less annoying that I thought I would. Usually it just isn't an issue (and the people I group with are far from uber) but those few times when you win an adventure with less than 5 minutes less or even when you barely loose one have turned out to be a lot of fun. Plus there's the added bonus that the old zones are a lot emptier. We actually had Veksar all to ourselves the other day (and walked out with about 30k loot). <br />
<br />
As for the leader board, who really cares? You can't use it to factor out the really clueless people since you only see the top 100 and as some others have pointed out, I can see reasons why people would have a bad loss record even if they knew what they were doing. I kinda like the fact that it lets me keep track of my own adventures but I'd never consider using it to decide if I'd group with someone or not. Basically, the only downside I see is the people worried about taking a loss and screwing up their rankings but I try to avoid that type of player anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I see your point Crusty and agree. I guess its just easier to put a time crunch on it then to sit down and really think out a non cookie cutter dungeon that will require that kinda group skill.<br />
<br />
Still, it beats PoP IMHO. PoP is the king of repitition, the whole XP system is setup like DL if you ask me. Zones that are made to have 6 people camp at so and so spot and pull form so and so area till their minds go numb and they fall asleep in the middle of a pull. Seriously, thats not a uncommon thing with some people.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I found LDoN interesting at first. It was a source of new gear potentially and augments are cool. After you do a bunch of adventures though it's all the same. It's like our 3rd exp point system. Regular, AA or LDoN. The faster ya do em the higher ya get. It's pretty boring now but I really want that Everfrost BP ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Sekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">You know what's the problem with LDoN really is?<br />
<br />
NO1 DO IT ANYMORE!<br />
<br />
Put a LFG up and all I got were BoT, PoV groups. LFA for 2 weeks and no tells ***.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>leillanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I think LDoN has its place. It kinda suits my style of play for 70pct of my play time, but it is repetitive and can be quite boring. I tend to put my own groups together using a similar formula of:<br />
Me - shaman<br />
1 x Plate Tank (Pally or more often War)<br />
1x Cleric<br />
1x Mage / Bst / Bard<br />
make up rest of group with melee if possible.<br />
As long as your puller is half competent and you dont get more than 3 or 4 mobs in camp things should be fine. We normally finish most adventures with 30 mins or so to spare. It is fairly minding numbing most of the time, but it is an easyish xp grind. I am now 22/25 MMC and dont get overly stressed when doing adventures - I dont think that I have ever checked my rankings. But I did get into a RCY group in POD the other day (1st one since LDoN came out) and it was a total breath of fresh air. Friendly banter, repping in and out, inviting friends as reps were needed, collecting people from zin - but I had one of my rare occasions where I had 4 hours to spare playing EQ.<br />
I dont see that LDoN has changed EQ too much, we have just experienced the usual - its new and everyone wants to do it. 2 weeks ago PoD was perma empty on Mith Marr, now it is starting to fill up again as everyone tires of the LDoN rinse cycle and wants to get back to the cut and thrust of the big wide world of Norath. I am an unguilded shammy and TBH LDoN has made zip difference whether I get groups or not, it is just more of a defined time period of playing.<br />

You didn't annoy me, I was just rather puzzled, as I really really dislike Quake.:)  <br />
<br />
I can understand that you don't like this expansion, and kind of understand why.  There are a few things that annoy me about it as well.  I rather like the time limits as I work and go to school and I have precious little time during the week to play EQ.  The time limit means I can log on and do an adventure and it is guaranteed to be over in 2 hours max.  That isn't going to mean you are going to like it though:)<br />
<br />
I think it was a good try for their first time working with instanced dungeons and that the next one may be much better.</div></div><hr />
