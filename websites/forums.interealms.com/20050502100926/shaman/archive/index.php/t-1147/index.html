I agree, a VS shaman or a Iksar shaman sounds kinda silly...but Barbies aren't the brightest torch on the wall...to say nothing about Ogres and Trolls.</div></div><hr />

It's better than the lovely pet names, Gobabaner, Kebanatik, or the best of all....Goner.<br />
<br />
Uggok calls his pet Fifi.<br />
/point.  /laugh.<br />

(Bear in mind my pet fish as a kid was called Fishy - you can prob work out why I use dogdog)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I only say that when you are around.  When you aren't, I call it &quot;Henora&quot; :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still remember killing his enchanter, then watching him run through the zone screaming he wants his dogdog... he is one messed up dude.... but then, who else could come up with Fansy on Sullen?  ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Bad news, Blart lost all his stuff and will not be comming back :( Truely a sad day for shamans everywhere.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I call him Fido.<br />
<br />
But then, I call my horse Fido2.  I'm not one for creativity that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Sends dogdog to bite Jing on the arse.</div></div><hr />

I only call my druids dogdog.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kazlaaz Bonedust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I've never really heard it refered to as &quot;dogdog&quot;.. I just call my pet Cujo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I usually refer to mine as &quot;my useless ass pet&quot;. I still bring him out to play every now and then though when it makes sense, no matter how useless he is :P<br />
<br />
You have to forgive Jing though. He is kinda anal about words and stuff hehe. Just ask him about when people talk about Severilous and the wrong things they refer to him as...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I agree that 'dogdog' sounds pretty stupid.  That's why I call him 'Mr Woofs'.</div></div><hr />

Why do shamans refer to their pet as dogdog? It looks so silly to me. <br />
<br />
Thou hast answered thy own question. <br />
<br />
Silly=Funny= :D<br />
<br />
I do like &quot;Puddles&quot; though - that's hilarious.  <br />
<br />
Calling him dogdog sets a nice silly tone and requires little explaining.  I never see : Soandso tell the group, &quot;Who is Dogdog? An Alt?&quot; <br />
<br />
I am pretty sure I started using it after getting a chuckle out of reading it here from someone - don't remember who.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">OMG Aktunka, it's Sev, not SERV!!!!! That drives me crazy seeing people call him Serv hehe.<br />
<br />
Another thing that bothers me is &quot;PST&quot; meaning &quot;please send tell&quot;. I'm sure this isn't only on my server, as I've heard people on the Nameless are complaining about it, too, so it's likely on most servers by now. People will say &quot;gating for donations - pst&quot;. No kidding, you want us to send a /tell? How the hell else would we get a gate from you?! Same things with auctioning or people LFG &quot;55 warrior lfg - pst&quot;. It's retarded I say!<br />
<br />
Ok, done ranting, I'll think of more things that bother me and post about it later so you all can laugh at me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">People just started using PST not too long ago on Prexus..<br />
Everytime I see someone pasting it after a plead I do the &quot;Oh god&quot; in black adder (2) style, to myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I personally don't use it (I'm Iksar if that makes a difference). I keep aggro so it doesn't matter to me if my pet is green or not. Depending on how it cons I refer to him as Cujo (blue/light blue con), or Toto (green con). But from a roleplay standpoint dogdog works for Ogre or Troll. Or just to be silly......./shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I am also an iksar, and I love my Dogdog. <br />
<br />
and ya, it is basically just to be silly, this is jusr a game...or so I have heard.</div></div><hr />

JBB for sale - PST<br />
<br />
So that's what that means. I always figured someone in the auction channel was just wanting to get paid cash for their item and they were in the Pacific Standard Timezone so you could set up a rendevous.:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">It doesn't mean Pretty Soon Too?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sir, I resent that. I'm a barbarian by race, not by breeding. My pet's name is Reginald P. Dogoody III. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">PST is the single most ****ing stupid acronym ever created.  Like what ELSE are you supposed to do?  Send smoke signals?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I use Cujo ... In retrospect Dr. Puppers is likely a more fitting name, but then again ... sometimes Cujo isn't the sharpest tool in the shed.</div></div><hr />

That was before you could make it use its name in your commands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I have a druid friend whos bears name is Bobo<br />
<br />
Its always dogdog or puppy for me.  Except one time I actually summoned &quot;Viber&quot;<br />
<br />
Anyone else had their puppies name be Viber??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I've had one named Zoner, and a few times I've had Goner. Both are bad omens. Once I had a pet with the same name as the necro's pet in my group. Got a SS of it, I'll post it later when I get off work.</div></div><hr />

Sheesh i wondered about PST for ages, there are more stupid ones emerging all the time, LFM (looking for more)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>L33TL355</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I had summoned my &quot;Goner&quot; when soloing and when i finally replaced an fellow shaman in a group. Didn't know what to expect so I kept him around during the first few pulls. We were doing okay when I started playing with my /pet attack. The best was while fighting in the overthere &quot;Chomper sic balls&quot;.</div></div><hr />
