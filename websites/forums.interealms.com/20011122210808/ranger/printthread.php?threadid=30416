<p><b> Post 55 Guilds and Epics</b></p>

<p>I have been seeing a lot of posts today concentrating on post level 55 play, and I have seen everyone talking about Kael, ToV and other Velious Zones. My question is this: I am level 52 with just my epic foraging done, if I were to join an Uber Guild before I got my epics then what is the liklihood that I would be able to convince them to help me raid CoM, Hate, The Hole, VS etc..., I never stopped to consider that any guild I join Post 55 would be unwilling or too busy to do this. (Underbrush and other TT Rangers your input would be greatly appreciated on this thread)<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Many "uber" guilds would only concern themselves with epic steps if they could do so efficiently.  In other words, they wouldn't take a night from raiding ToV in order to do the Hole, unless there were several members who needed that step.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>I'd say you have different tiers of guilds. The highend uber guild raiding TOV and such in general has their epics. They are the ones who want you to have the right faction, all resist gear, etc etc before joining. 2nd tier guilds are the ones stil working on getting members epics, doing the arena in kael for armor and practice, etc etc.<br />
In general most epic's don't take more then three groups at anyone time. So really with a large group of friends of the right class, epics can be done with enough patience.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Yes what most high lvl guilds do is wait till enough people need the Hole part (rangers, pallies, shamans) then take an hour to go get the pieces for all these people. Same with PoA, CoM, etc.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Hiya Hopwin<br />
<br />
I was lucky enough to join Korsis when we still did epics at an alarming pace.  Its seems now that most of the people in my guild have their epics or are a few battles away.  We always rearrange our schedule to take down these mobs for epics though since for the most part they are easy fights... the warrior epic being the toughest out there and the cleric epic being the toughest camp always tests our guilds patience  <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
Joining CTV, Valon or even DV I would think it would be hard to pull them away from doing epics merely because their level requirements are so high that you should have your epics by then.  Korsis level requirement is 55+ so you should also by that time.  Any of the "sub Uber guilds" such as Korsis, Dawntreaders, FoF, DM and ToH and such would be good guilds to join since a lot of their members still need to do epic work and those battles for those guilds are fairly easy.   I know our guild requirements are that you are a couple battles from your epics or done.  I don't know about the other guilds though.<br />
<br />
If you plan on going with any of the other guilds out there be prepared to wait in line and also realize that some of the mobs you need might be out of the range for that guild.  Being a ranger and getting your epic in a lesser guild is still pretty easy IMHO.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

Infinity Watch is a very good guild and they would be able to kill the mobs fairly easy for the ranger epic.  I do not know the exact numbers they have but they can do it.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Before anything else, I just want to say that joining a guild just so they can get your epics for you is about as lame as it gets.  I don't think that was how you intended your post to sound, but thats how it came across.<br />
<br />
But, I would think any guild you joined would expect you to organize the events you need, then willing to offer the assistance if you have demonstrated an equal willingness to help other guild members with their quests or goals.  You probably wouldn't much help initially until its been determined that you are a team player and not just there for items.  Its a reciprocal relationship.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Self Rightousness, don't you just love it.  <br />
<br />
What would be the reason to join a 55 plus guild if you didn't want your epics or raid high end zones? All you need to do is remeber what goes around comes around, and who cares why joe blow joined our guild, he will have his own stuff to deal with if he is not a team player and or is a selfish player. Things will even them selves out on their own time, and other people shouldn't be concerned what or why "the other" guy is here, hell everyone has a agenda or a reason to do something if you don't you are acting mindless. Just my 2cp worth.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Self righteous for disliking loot whores?<br />
Self righteous for expecting each guild member to contribute to the other members as much as they as their receive, rather than be there only for their benefit?<br />

<p>Hmnns, most likely a "high end" guild won't / will not just do your epics because you don't have it. <br />
<br />
Also, all top end guilds I know usually have a "probation" period. <br />
Meaning that while you might be in the guild, don't expect them to do anything for you till you have proven that you are an asset to them.<br />
<br />
This might mean that you might have to organise you own mini raids, AND not have such raids clash with the guild's agenda. <br />
<br />
For example, a top end guild can be "raiding" every single day and you "organising" a raid that is contradictory to its agenda and thus be looked at as one for your "own ends" (especailly during your probation period) and can mean a swift kick out of the door and "blackballed" from other like guilds by word of mouth. Guildleaders do sometimes talk to other guild's leaders. <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
Oh Yes, probation in this case can mean anywhere from 1 month to 3 months. <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
Unless of course, you are well known on your server or to the guild that you are going to join either by reputation or by the members themselves.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Most of the "uber" (top 2 or 3 guilds) won't have the time to do your epics for you, at least until you have proved yourself to them.  For that matter, many uber guilds wouldn't even consider your application if you're a hybrid class until you are level 59+.<br />
<br />
The second-tier guilds, several of which (on Rodcet at least) are strong enough do  VS/Trak/Serv/Gor/Wuosihi/Chardok Royals/ToV are still often willing to help someone get epics.  But it might take a significant "probation" time before you will find members willing to enthusiatically help a new member get epics.<br />
<br />
Why is this?  It's my experience (in a strong second-tier guild) that far too often, a loot-greedy individual joins us just for the purpose of getting epics and ToV armor.....then as soon as their guild has helped them "become uber" they quit and apply to a first-tier guild.<br />
<br />
People who "use" their guild as a stepping stone are sleeze.  I know we are carefully trying to screen out people with this mindset.  I hope Hopwin, this is not your path.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Aye Locz<br />
<br />
They join and you usually see a totally different person than who applied.<br />
<br />
Alot of guilds ( mine included ) stipulate that you can't be in any other guild or be applying for any other guild at the time you are applying for ours.  You may spend up to a month joining us in raids before enough people in the guild are ready to vote on your membership.<br />
<br />
High Level guilds hit the High level Targets.  Me personally, unless I know you real well, I don't help anyone finish epics unless they have been in guild for a min 2-3 months after they join.<br />
<br />
We have over 80 people in guild..I have lost count the number of nights we have spent moving from one epic encounter to another.  <br />
<br />
Get your friends together and you can get the rest of the stuff.  Do everything but Sky, VSR and Hate.  You show you have all the rest down you will get help.<br />
<br />
A new memeber asked for help with VS..I asked him how much did he have done?  This guy had zip nada done.  I said you may as well take a number.<br />
<br />
It just all depends if you will get help in guild.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Whose calling me a loot whore? Yes I want my Epics, yes I want to do end game encounters, did I ever say I want to join a guild so I can loot XXX off of an_uber_mob_00? No because to me the uber loots are icing on the cake, the true fun comes in experiencing the amazing encounters, the strategy behind taking down an_uber_mobs_momma_01, of laughing at the corpse runs, celebrating the kills. Yeah I do want my epics, would I join a guild just to have my epics? no. For those of you on Terris let me do a perspective check, I have been in the guild Obsidian Elite for 50 of my 52 levels between my 4 alts I have been in this guild for over 120 levels, ever heard of em? didnt think so. Have they ever helped me with a quest, no, have they ever raided a zone that wasnt 10 levels below their average? no. But they are friends and we have fun, I am just reaching the point where I need friends who do fun things at a higher level. But back to the topic at hand, I want my epics, my current guild cannot help me attain them, I dont have enough friends to camp Jade Reavers, kill VS, kill Jalail or even kill the DE Corrupter, I have been on 3 planes raids, 1 dragon raid and 1 Kael raid. I want to start doing things that are more exciting than the exp grind in KC, Velketors or Sebilis. I am sorry if this sounds like a flame or angry post, but I want you to understand my frustration at this point.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

Aggree with you there. <br />
My guild is the "stepchild" stepping stone on my server. A good many individuals join up / want to join up simply because they want us to help them get "uber" and then leave for the top 2 uber guilds. <br />

Understand and feel your pain.<br />
<br />
Though most of those posts are what / how a higher end guild might look at you. Especially the 2nd tier ones that Locz described. <br />
I am sorry if I sounded harsh on my posts, but as a guild officer, when I see someone who wants to join our guild and goes "so..you guys still doing epics right?" (or something similar) alarm bells will ring and you can be assured I will NOT look too kindly on that person. You first post had that impression on me. <br />
<br />
Though its hard to tell sometimes. Guilds sometimes just need leadership and people to steer them in the direction that the leader wants it to go.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Hopwin,<br />
<br />
Also sorry for sounding harsh.  Mentioning "new guild" and "want epics" in the same paragraph is a big red flag.  The experiences I have described with greedy loot-hogs who join our guild to use us as a stepping stone to the top 2 guilds on Rodcet happens too often for me not to be skeptical of everyone's motivations.<br />
<br />
Hopwin, I do think you now have a better appreciation of what guilds take into consideration when they are screening applicants.  I do hope you find new guild which gives you new challenges and rewards.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>If you join a higher lvl guild and show a willingness to help out and be apart of the team, and as has been mentioned do no show a tendancy to use the guild as a stepping stone.  Then its in there interest as well as yours to help you get your epics. <br />
<br />
After all a char with epics > than the same char without.  There for you can aid the guild more in the job you are performing.<br />
<br />
BUT no one should ever expect any guild "To get you your epics", that is a job you must fulfill.  The ranger epics can be done without being in a large guild it just takes time and effort.<br />
<br />
To the original poster, I understand exactly what you are going though, I name it the 50+ syndrom.  Smaller "friends" guilds just don't work at a higher lvl if you wish to do more than just exp grind etc.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>I must be lucky. In my guild, we are still working on getting epics...we can do Kael, planes, DN, a lot of places. Our sights are set on being able to do even bigger things like ToV, etc. But none of this is under any one person's rule. We work as a team, as a family. We are friends. We do screen people, but not according to their equipment. We are not an uber guild, but we have the power to do what we want, and have the friends to call in if we need/want to. We succeed because we work together. There is no agenda to cater to. We have focus, but it is the focus of the guild as a whole, not just the leader. <br />
<br />
Hopwin, I understood your concern. In my previous guild, I had not much chance at attaining epics, we just didn't have the manpower to do the bigger raids. Now, I'm in a different guild that does have that capability, but that is not why any one of us joined. We joined for the people in it. To be with friends.  I think that if someone is looking for a new guild, and wants to get their epics someday, they have a right to question the capability of the guild. Not as in "will you get me xxx" but as in if they can do it or not, or are willing to help. I would not want to just join a guild, then find out later they are not raid-capable, and have to leave, if I wanted to do certain raids or get my epics. Some folks just don't have 30 close friends on of the necessary level.  But some folks do want to go on big raids, and do big quests. There is nothing wrong with keeping that in mind, just being greedy about it is wrong. <br />
<br />
I can't tell you how many epic raids, hunts, etc., I have been on just for my guildmates, and even strangers. Personally, I enjoy seeing them get what they need. In any guild, a member should contribute to the guild, and be there to help out when they can. As well, the guild should be able to back up its members.<br />
<br />
Hopwin, good luck on your search, I hope you find a good guild, who will value you as a person, and help to challenge you as well.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Boy do I know what you're going through Hopwin, I'm at the same point, and for the same reasons.  I can't really apply for any of my server's uber guilds yet though, most have 57+ or higher membership requirements, and while one of them has no specific level requirement, I do realize that I need to be 55+ to contribute anything on most of their raids.  <br />
<br />
I left my old guild when I realized that they would never have the types of encounters I enjoyed and that they couldn't do half the fights to get me my epics (they tried VSR and Faydedar for a druid, and failed miserably on both).  I won't join a guild just so they can get me my epics, but I don't want a guild for whom epics are impossible either.  I've spent too long in guilds that just can't do anything besides the occasional succesful Kaesora group, hour long group in FM, failed Hate raid, failed VS raid, failed Faydedar raid, and a mass exodus of most 50+ that keeps them from achieving more.  The only difference I noticed when I left was that the green chat with the occasional jokes and some arguments as well was gone.  Other than that I'm as well off guildless as I was a member of that guild, which is really sad.  I talked in tells with my friends and continue to, and I get in pickup groups cuz they're the only source of exp besides soloing (no guild groups), just like I did when I was in the guild.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<br />
/Nods<br />
Ever wondered how your old guild would have fared had all these guild hoppers especially the 50+ ones had not left? From your description, your guild never had a chance to grow, and that is unfortunate. For a guild to grow, and to succeed, for the most part, you need people who are willing to stick it out and work as a team. Which is why "twink" guilds usually never get anywhere. The people are just using the guild as an end to a means. In this case, to level, get equipment then leave.<br />
<br />
Still a good many smaller guild have grown sucessful (that I know of) by getting people who are "builders" and not movers. You know, people who stay with the guild, and help the guild by doing stuff like organising raids, formulating tactics when they fail (and they will) and simply not giving up.<br />
<br />
Ubers and high end guilds fail alot too <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""> but the one thing that you will notice from high end guilds is that death (even before we had click ress) is just a slight road bump. When you have members who are willing to take xp losses / level losses just to learn how to take down mobs, who treat failure as part of the game and try again (sometimes for the 4th or 5th time) you have an "uber" guild in the making. <br />
Its just a matter of people sticking it out together and working as a team that get things done.<br />
<br />
Though sometimes, the guild itself isn't interested or just not able to do so. That's really not anyone's fault, just the way the guild was formed or is structured.<br />
<br />
Good luck though, on your new adventures with your new guild.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>my guild over on luclin is (i would say) the second biggest.. we are presently doing ToV every saturday i think and we have xp groups in PoM every night.. then again we do kael (vindi WILL die) and alot of the outdoor dragons but we're still gearing everyone up there i think. also have lots of epic support.. really fun being able to maul half the high end encounters that are up on the server on any given night.. then settle in to velks or PoM for some xp.. im after epics mainly cause i feel my damage output isnt enough to justify the lag i create on large events.. (planes and such) so im trying to get it up to a respectable lvl <br />

<p>My guild has been one of those "Stepping Stone" guilds as well.  We kinda have a chip on our shoulder cause we make people uber (SS quest armor) and then they leave for one of the ST capable guilds.  This last week, we lost our top 3 rogues, our number 3 tank and our number 5 cleric and our number 2 monk.  The rogues quit EQ, the monk ebayed, others decided to apply to a higher guild... taking our guild loot (Donals BPs, Cobalt BPs and other stuff with them).  Youd think that would really hurt a guild that struggles to put more than 40 people online at any time... but no... we killed Vindi for the first time tonite! woot!  (weaponshield owns vindi btw in case you were wondering).  <br />
<br />
Im soooo glad we didnt help that cleric get his epic now, and Im wishing one of our other warriors had gotten the queen blade from chardok just two months ago.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p><b> Re: Guilds and epics</b></p>

<p>I completed my epic without a guild.  I've been guildless since level 51, it's somewhat difficult getting into any of the high level guilds, especially ones on Kael faction -- they are a bit exclusive.<br />
<br />
Most of the battles other than the PoH stone and PoA sphere do not require more than one group to complete.  So find some friends and schedule some time during which they are available to help.  You could probably interest them with incentives such as experience and loot.  Make sure you find out everything you need to know about the encounter to prevent failure.  Otherwise, your friends might get a little weary come the next time you ask for help.<br />
<br />
Choosing a guild shouldn't be a decision of whether or not they will help you with your epic, but rather if you will have more fun as part of that guild.  If their normal activities don't meet your needs, then there's no point in joining it.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p><b> Hmmmm....</b></p>

<p>My guild is kinda cool and I guess powerful, or at least others tell me that, but we're also small (about 45 actives) in comparison to some of the, oh um how do I say, Zerg guilds?<br />
<br />
We kill velious boss mobs and are after ST keys, but I think our smaller size allows us to concentrate on individual needs a bit better than a larger guild.  For example, I am the sole ranger in guild atm (Andilee retired), so that has it's advantages.<br />
We have our epics as well, so mostly newcomers have a need and we go outta our way to finish them, especially if the individual has shown initiative.<br />
<br />
Epics = good for any guild (unless you are banking them), and most are easy to complete (except for rarity and possible competition for spawn- *cough* Ragefire).<br />
<br />
Bottom line: choose the guild ye want and apply and do what's needed, and if ye have style, flair and substance, then ye'll get in.  Epics will soon come or something better, so I'd concentrate on passing probation/trial and put all else on backburner... if ye get in, you'll get equipped.<br />

<p>Hopwin, epics are loot.<br />
<br />
And the reason your post is inflammatory is that most people think that you shouldn't join any guild expecting anything from them but letting you participate in whatever they're doing.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Would you call me a loot whore if I asked my guild to help me do Ivy Etched armor? no... the only reason I get labelled like this is because Epics are level 50+.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>I just wanted to throw out an idea but please do not take this as a direct insult to you guys trying to get your epics.  <br />
<br />
Maybe you just dont deserve to get them this early.<br />
<br />
That said let me explain.  When I was level 50 I had decent stuff but nothing amazing.  I went through 5 more levels until I started to even think about getting my epics and I wasn't in a large guild.  My current guild ended up falling apart and high end guys left while I stayed until I just couldn't stay any longer (6 months of doing no raids... just exp groups).   I think I was one of the highest rangers without his epics on my server.<br />
<br />
I know the word "deserve" is kinda harsh but the epics in my opinion are not suppose to be handouts once you get to 51+.  Seems to me that during the 51+ game you find new people to group with, show them what you are capable of and inturn start to go on raids with them.  This is how I did it.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>I understand what you are saying Mortok, I have not been on a Guild Raid myself in about 8 months, and the ones I did go on before that were train wrecks, and I am sorry I did not mean to imply that I deserve my epics or anything, just that someday I would like to attain them, if a 55+ guild would not help me get them, then I would do it myself without a second thought (I did the staff of the wheel for wizards, you know the Ice Comet Quest,  solo I started it at level 26 and when I was done I was level 23, yeah 23) cause I am stubborn like that. I do not mean to imply that I would base my decision to join any guild regardless of level based on what they can do for me, but if they wont help me do it I would like to know in advance so I can look for friends to help me finish them up. Does that make me greedy? I hope not I just wanted to know if I should start looking for pick up Hate Corpse Runs er... Raids.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p><b> </b></p>

<p>I think a lot of the people that posted have seen the people that come into the guild with the sole purpose of using that guild to get loot and I have to say that it is really tough when that person just leaves the guild over something very very small just so they have an excuse to leave.  They then leave and join up with another guild (usually a higher end guild).  Its just frustrating and I think that is what most of the people kinda took your post as.  I however didn't take it like that since I know you to be a good guy in game.  I think Hopwin has a good question out there.  I think people think we should have our epics already if we come into a 55+ guild.  Our mobs are much easier to kill than a most classes epic quests.<br />
<br />
Lets reask this question.  <br />
<br />
If a new ranger came into your guild but he didn't have his epics how long would you want him to wait before he asked for help with it?  <br />
<br />
If this ranger showed promise, good humor, dedication and overall well being for the guild I know that I would help if the guild wasn't doing anything that day.  Maybe you need to have people on the inside to vouche for you.  Or maybe it all depends on how long you have been with the guild.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p><b> Small isn't bad!</b></p>

<p>My guild is small, we got maybe 18 50+ members.  But we do arena in kael, run the manor cycle and kill lvl 60 giants.. with a lvl 45 iksar sk tank...don't ask you'd have to watch him to see how good he is.   No we ain't doing Tormax or nothing of that lvl but we have fun.  The main thing of any guild is to be selfless, to think of others before you think of yourself.   We got our first epic this week and are close to 4more.  No rule says you have to have no outside friend help.  We use Taskmaster Aboytt in GD for our test almost beat him with 12 and a paladin tank.. oh well, we have fun.  thats the important thing.<br />
