<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night in-game, I was discussing the effects of stats with someone.  In the course of the conversation, they mentioned that max strength has become a requirement for many melee to do their job since PoP came out.  They claimed that since 2 handed weapons have become so prevalent, that strength makes much more of a difference than it did before all the good 2 handers were added.  They made a few more points, including that riposting with 2 handed weapons required max strength to make the most of its usefulness.  <br />
<br />
In essence, their argument was that tanks using 2 handed weapons were not doing their jobs properly if they were not maxxing out their strength.  I haven't seen any parses regarding strength's effect on DPS for 2 handed weapons, so I was wondering if anyone else had information regarding this.  I'd also like to invite anyone with too much time on their hands to test this.  <br />
<br />
And while I'm asking for parses, I'm still curious if anyone has tested if agility's effects were buffed on avoidance classes (monks/beastlords) after the monk nerf.<br />
<br />
*edit - made the title more clearly reflect the subject*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think they may have done the classic mistaken cause an effect.<br />
<br />
Str adds directly to Attack. I dont know if melee get a diff ratio but I know 1 point of str = 1 point of attack for me as a Shaman. Higher attack = better chance to hit for full damage. 2H wep = slower than 1H weps so more hits for full will make a diff if the wep is 40 or more delay.<br />
<br />
What seems to be a max str issue is probably nothing more than higher attack as a result of max str. <br />
<br />
On the flip side its not unheard of for bugs to take numbers that go past the cap into account. A theory (note Im just talking in terms of bugs and rumors) is that no matter what the Cap of the melee the true str score is taken into account up to 355, its just invisible. This should be very easy to test in a consistant environment of say frogs in PoV. Take a melee there that is just under thier str cap, buff them till they just hit thier str cap and parse it.... then give em all the str you got (NOT Primal the added attack will blow your test) and try it again. I would recommend using a war pal or SK for the test.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I hate seeing this theoretical stuff, because that's all it is. Why hasn't someone just done a few parses to see if str really does have a difference on DPS? I really couldn't care less weather that DPS comes from higher STR stat or from higher atk, a melee that puts out more damage is more useful to the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Str adds directly to Attack. I dont know if melee get a diff ratio but I know 1 point of str = 1 point of attack <br />
<br />
Some of the older tests showed that atk derived from strength didn't help dps as much as raw atk buffs did.  <br />
<br />
The point the person was making, although not spelling it out explicitly, was that strength derived atk was more important with 2 handed weapons than dual wielding.  I'm positive they know how their strength effects their atk number.  <br />
<br />

<br />
This is what I'm asking for.  However, it isn't just as simple as doing a few parses.  First, you have to have a level 65 Warrior/SK/Paladin/Monk.  Then you must max out their strength.  You have to have at least a few hours available, and you must parse a substantial number of fights against a wide range of mobs with varying AC.  And you must repeat each fight as closely as possible with lower strength.  <br />
<br />
This is all a pain in the butt and somewhat difficult to do, and I haven't had the time or ability to do it.  Thus, I have to rely on other people to answer this question for me, and hope that somebody with the means cares enough to look at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well my issue is when theory isnt clearly labled as theory. I made it very clear that its rumor theory etc... <br />
<br />
I am waiting to see the results of your tests Penny. <br />
<br />
In griping about the lack of hard evidence you are either going to have to now find out and let us all know, or you prolly should keep a useless post that flames some one else for not doing excatly what your not doing. I for one dont play a melee so I dont give a fig what the real answer is, hows that for an opinion.<br />
<br />
Im not sure I buy the whole max str being more important to a 2H wep as opposed to 1H weps simply because it would have required a seperate set of equasions to generate the damage instead of plugging into the generic formula that all weapons derive thier damage ever swing.<br />
<br />
I do know that chance to hit and hit for max is based on Attack score. I would say post on the rangers glade and let a melee expert answer this question since we're all to lazy :b to parse it ourselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">heh, I notice str help lots at low level<br />
<br />
my lvl26 paladin alt hit 61max with 150str, but hit up to 74 with 220 str after buffed, it is huge notieable on killing rate with buffed at that level<br />
<br />
for my lvl58 monk, it easily notice my max hit is higher with max str buff, but it don't effect my killing rate at all, just very small difference</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There were several parses done back in the day on this subject and there were two large tests that were posted here that showed an average of around 5% increase in dps over an extended period of time in the 50+ world (might have been 55+ dont remember)  Now I could see how 40s level buffs could help a low level pali greatly but these tests showed a rather insignificant (one showed 3-5% and one showed 5-7 if i remember) increase in dps.  That was a rather fun time on these boards as well :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Conventional wisdom is that STR only increases max damage and has no impact on modal damage, therefore having only a tiny impact on DPS.  There are those who think displayed ATK is a composite figure, and that +ATK from +STR has no effect on hit rates.  <br />
<br />
Haven't seen a good test in a while, but even Verant has said repeatedly (including rather recently) that stats are pretty much worthless in EQ and that they can't change that without reworking not only the combat system but every MOB in the game, so don't expect it to change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I never really noticed a difference when I buffed my wife's monk or my bot bard with the best str buffs I had.  Until I got Ferine Avatar.  Not only does she does she do alot more max reg &amp; crit hits now, but my bard lands hits ALOT more.  I've seen him miss a mob for 10 seconds.  When I pop FA on him, he hit I would guesstimate about at least 50% more, and the hits are very noticeably stronger.  Granted I think it's the 140 to ATK that does this, but since more STR means more ATK, it does indeed help.  Perhaps there's a magic number that yields the most effect, but I'm now a real believer that ATK buffs, and therefore STR buffs too, can make a significant difference.<br />
<br />
No, I don't parse nor will I ever (too lazy), I'm just sharing my personal eye-witness account since I got FA several weeks ago.  And my regular melee buddies agree with me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
140 attack (and it comes to considerably more than that actually - melee and hybrid classes get a bonus to direct ATK buffs) makes a HUGE difference in how often a melee class hits and how much damage they'll average per hit.  Unfortunately, that would mask any effect the STR buff in Ferine Avatar is having on damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Check over at the steel warriors board for details, if you are interested.<br />
<br />
The warriors seem to do a lot of parsing.  Their data shows that a 10 point increase in strength gives a 1% average increase in DPS.<br />
<br />
I didnt see a comparison specificly for whether 2 handers give a higher % benefit from strength thant 1 handers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>throxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The Pally's over at Paladins of Norrath also have a recent thread going on this subject here (http://pub148.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm23.showMessage?topicID=195.topic)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Perhaps, and this is just a wild guess, the point is that the issue is not about melees trying to max their dps, but trying to max their aggro generation. I am not sure, but it seems to me that 1 big hit is probably gonna hold aggro more than 2 small hits (but I don't know that for a fact). So, out come the big 2handers - not necessarily for dps, maybe just to try to keep aggro - so, theoretically, even if _str just increases max damage without significant change to modal dameage, the increased max hit might be seen as desirable from an aggro generation point of view. Ok, I might be barking up the wrong creek without a tree, but its a thought</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The main reason tanks have been using 2H in PoP is to mainly cut down on damage taken from riposte as oppposed to do more damage/taunt. PoP mobs have a very high attack rating and DPS (5-700 hitters are standard xp fare etc)<br />
<br />
A few or our alliance members did some testing against HoH suits for a xp day. Warrior (65, marshall, 90+ aa i think) was taking about 15 percent less damage using 2 hander as opposed to boc/epic on average, against a variety of mobs, and doing 70-80 DPS with dual wield/60-70 with 2H if i remember correctly (they had pretty charts posted)<br />
<br />
As for STR increasing max damage, who cares just FA them -sooo much nicer than PA ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">...even Verant has said repeatedly (including rather recently) that stats are pretty much worthless in EQ and that they can't change that without reworking not only the combat system but every MOB in the game, so don't expect it to change.<br />
<br />
Thats bull**** in my opinion. Verant just doesn't want to change anything about stats. The way I see it a solution is incredibly simple. Make it so 95% of all items give NO stat increases, and the best of the best uber loots give something like +5 to stats.<br />
<br />
Then, stats can be adjusted so they have a much larger bearing on the performance of a melee character, and even the performance of a Spellcasting character. <br />
<br />
This not only makes stat buffs actually worth casting, but it makes those extra stat points you spend at Character creation far more influential on your character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">As I understand it the speed of hits also figures into the agro equasion... so a 1h wep (typically much lower delay) will cause more agro than a 2H wep that has higher delay even though the DPS and actual damage may be the same. Now I dont know how that works out if a melee has some uber 2h that outdamages the 1h wielder Id imagine he would get the agro.<br />
<br />
Agro is generated each time the mob is swung at, as well as per damage, proximity, sit/stand, procs (this is prolly the biggest factor) and agro buffs.</div></div><hr />

The trouble is mobs are character classes. If you change the effect of stats it means rebalancing all the mobs stats as well. I can well understand how Sony are hesitant to implement a change on this scale without spending a LOT of time on it.<br />

<br />
thats true. But the stats have just as little of an effect on them as it does on us. Mobs would have all stats set to Class standards, for strength, agil, everything. Again, Stats should not be considered like AC, that are accumulated and increased with levels and equip. They should be found at base levels in 99% of characters, with very tiny increases due to items. the only really changing increases would come from temporary buffs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Strength comes in a distant fifth in importance to tanks, after HP/STA/AC/Resists...Stamina being, by far, the most important stat for a tank.<br />
<br />
Your friend's naivete/ignorance is glaring because he has not yet realized that tanking is not damage dealing. It is a common mistake by people inexperienced at playing a tank, usually one they regret later on when they have to make large adjustments in gear compared to someone who went for sta/hp/ac from the start.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, this is what I figured.  They seemed to think that PoP has somehow dramatically changed how things work with tanks, but until I see some proof, I'll have to assume it hasn't really changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Nope, HP/AC means more if anything.</div></div><hr />
