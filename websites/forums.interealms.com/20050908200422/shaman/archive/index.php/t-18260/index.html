<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Extraor Dinary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">More often that I would like, I'll be playing EQ and go LD.  For the next 5 minutes or so I can't do anything to access the internet.  The modem shows a quick flashing data out light and no data in light so I'm sending nonstop data for some reason.  I run 2 computers on a home network through a router.  If I unplug the router and plug it back in then I don't have to wait 5 minutes before I can get back on the internet, but this doesn't solve the problem of still sending out data and going LD while playing.  This tends to happen a lot during the day and seldom at night.  After playing around I'm guessing that it is my other computer that messes up because it is only used during the day and never at night.  If I unplug it (which is not an option to fix because it is used so much) then I don't go LD.  But, I'm not sure if that is the problem.  Does anyone know a way I can track what it going in and out of the router and from what computer the information is going to or from?  Or has anyone ran into a problem like this and know a possible fix?  Thanks.<br />

Your ISP can furbish log on/log off times of your dialup account. 99% guarantee you its your other computer that is dialing up, and booting your account off, then it takes you a while to do likewise. Get a second dialup account, or make it so other people cant use the dialup connection on your other computer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">have you checked for possible worms/virus on your computer? I know some acts like you are describing it.<br />
<br />
also, you don't say what kind of router you are using, but check if there is perhaps a log file inside.</div></div><hr />

virus, more than likely a windows rpc based virus. Many of them will flood around 100 packets per second out of your network card, which will probably cripple your lan and any computers that have to listen to the rpc port. check the lan status to see the stats of how many packets its doing, its normally a quick indicator of it.</div></div><hr />
