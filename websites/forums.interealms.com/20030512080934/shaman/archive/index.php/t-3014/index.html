<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SoweaterTerrortale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok im finally reaching old enough to hit fear... i was offered many many iksar tear mqs but i didnt want to go that way i have done everything by the book. Been ready for kurn since lvl 38.  Yes i am a twink so going after kurn is  not a problem and its just a matter of waiting for a rotting tear to loot in fear &lt;will ding 46 sometime this week&gt;. If i get the tear its a matter of short hop over to com to kill neh and rak... but my question is what is the known lowest lvl than anyone has seen a shaman epiced at?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can get it whenever - you just cant use the right click until either 50 or 51 I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SoweaterTerrortale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We shall see on the effect when i get it.  Generaly just wondering what the lowest levels werew when the quest was completed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've seen a 49 with epic personally, but I'm sure there have been others that have got it before then. And you can't use the effect until 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was ready for epic at 51<br />
Yep.. been ready... 6 months now... no tear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">some guy posted here long time ago about getting his twink the epic at like level 20.   <br />
<br />
if you are looking for some kind of recognition for getting it at the lowest level you are too late.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">damn twinks and their epics =)<br />
<br />
Lemme know if you need a hand w/ any of the fights, I'm generally sitting around bored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The lowest you can get your epic at without MQing the tear is level 46. Which is an accomplishment, no question about it, but I doubt you'd be the first.<br />
<br />
Kudos for wanting to do the quest properly though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i got mine at 34, some people have recently beat me, but i wasnt trying to set a record or anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I know a guy that had it at 46.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I know another that got it mid-30s.  He stopped playing (at least that shaman) shortly afterwards.<br />
<br />
I got mine at 51, and still had to field a lot of &quot;how do you rate getting it at 51&quot; questions.  Um... by working my arse off and having a lot of friends?<br />
<br />
/em still hates the Hole.  It was by far the worst part of the epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">But the sense of accomplisment when you kill High Scale Kirn ... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>tangurena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I too had to field a lot of &quot;how did you get it at 51&quot; questions. The guild I am in was wanting to let another shaman do the tear, but that guy did not log on that day, so I did the turn-in. Grats me. When that other shaman did have the time, he did not have the faction, so tear got eaten. Another shaman in the guild had the icon eaten by High Scale Kirn: again, lack of faction. My guild has the force and knowledge to acquire shaman epics for every shaman in the guild, it merely lacks the willpower to do so. And with the recent foul-ups, I think even the willpower present is slipping.<br />
<br />
I started on my epic in the 20s. I had the boots in the low 40s, had my tear about 46 or 47 (3rd or 4th PoF raid). Lot of shamans on my server don't even start till 50s, so there is no real race to be &quot;the lowest twink shaman with epic.&quot;<br />
<br />
You got yours at low [level]? grats to you. You got yours at all? grats to you too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I posted the thing on the level 20 epic, and that was NOT my twink, it was someone on my server, he had posted it at the inny.com boards. His name was superslow, and his main was a 60 rogue i belive.</div></div><hr />
