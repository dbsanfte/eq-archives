Does anyone know if Pop lets' you get alchemy over 200 now (without leveling to 64/65)  as they said that they were raising the caps on all trade skills to allow you to Grand Master in more than one. <br />
<br />
I'm hoping that they've removed the level cap.</div></div><hr />

Tanaan Ginko + Erudition Vine = Quintessence of Knowledge<br />
Tanaan Ginko + &lt;herb&gt; = &lt;new potion&gt; or &lt;DNC&gt;<br />

Tanaan Ginko + Erudition Vine + &lt;herb&gt; = &lt;new potion&gt; or &lt;DNC&gt;<br />
<br />
EEP !! how many herbs are there? Are there any potions with more than 3 herbs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No most potions are two herbs with only a few of the stat potions requiring three.<br />
<br />
Still it's a lot of work to go thorough them all =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Murjden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did a number of Ginko + &lt;herb&gt; combines before jumping to the end to do the Q of K combine.   None of the others worked.<br />
<br />
There's an herb-like thingie dropping in SD now, called Nardoo.  Not sure if that's for alchemy or what.<br />
<br />
I did run around a LOT in PoK yesterday trying to see if there was any HINT of new alchemy stuff.  Not a thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. Alchemy is level capped and is a race/class specific trade skill. Grandmaster refers to the 7 general trade skills -- baking, brewing, fletching, jewelcraft, pottery, smithing, tailoring. In the Oct 16 patch, a new ability called &quot;New Tanaan Crafting Mastery&quot; was added to AA general abilities that can be trained only 6 times, which is what allows you to grandmaster more than one of the seven tradeskills.<br />
<br />
Alchemy is separate, and should now be trainable to 205 at level 65 (if there are any new potions with high enough trivials).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bremadle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just a note, level 64 so I decided to to try to skill up past my current 180 skill... 180 str and 180 wisdom, 2 stacks of grow potions and no skillups (20 combines is not a real test, but I was tired and inventory space is at a premium atm), however I just read a thread that other people where having issue skilling up to 180 with grow potions.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Yathandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Grow Potions are trivial at 180.  You will have to try the more expensive luclin alchemy potions to work skill above 180.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Someone has already said Hawk's Eye tonic is not trivial at 185.<br />
<br />
But I'm waiting for a reason to even bother skilling up beyond 180. So far, we haven't found a single damn potion recepie. I am feeling abandoned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ebeneezer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Whilst killing in Kael I noticed a couple of new herbs dropped there as well. When I log back in I'll dig them out of the bank - and try a combine with these two new herbs.<br />
<br />
I'll let you know if I find anything.<br />
<br />
I'm interested to know if anyone finds a recepie which use requires quintessence of knowledge as well, as it looks like something needed for another tradeskill..<br />
<br />
It could be of course that the stackable result is used in a further combine with other alchemy components..<br />
<br />
more beer needed...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Mag lv 62 spell: Tailsman of Return<br />
require : &quot;Quintessence of Knowledge&quot; for every cast<br />
Summon a Tailsman of Return<br />
Effect: Tailsman Gate(cast time 30.0 sec , bring ppl to Plane of Knowledge)<br />
about 100 pp herb cost to make it<br />
<br />
Since high level ppl will pay 50 pp for a port or TL, its is reasonable cost when you can't find wiz TL  or Dru port in dungeon<br />
<br />
Good for melee and hybird in some zones hard to get out like Howling Stone, POF, POH, POG</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grimthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I made some Quintessence of Knowledge (QoK) for someone last night - he bought the herbs, and a medicine bag, and all I did was combine 40 times.  He paid me 1kpp, a Large Sheermetal Torque (from PoI - selling for about 3k in Bazaar on Xegony) and a Tolan's bracer.  JUST FOR THE COMBINES.<br />
<br />
Few things I wanted to say:<br />
<br />
1)  I think we should all agree a price for QoK and stick to it.  We should NOT let the price be chipped away as has happened for SoW.  If the herb cost is 100pp per then my suggestion is 200pp per.<br />
<br />
2)  These stack like normal items, they don't need to be combined into 5 or 10 shot potions.<br />
<br />
3)  This may make Alchemy a viable money-making skill.  Until they introduce a tinkered device that makes QoK much cheaper, or an NPC merchant that sells it.  Which I have no doubt they will.  Although all the big guilds will have a shaman to make these at cost for them anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I doubt we will be able to enforce a &quot;price&quot; on it... there's always some shaman who will do it for cost for friends and buddies, just like sow potions.<br />
<br />
I still get nagged by one guildmate because an old shaman friend of hers made sow potions for 60 plat (about cost with 1 failure), but my price is 75. And that's cause I have carpel tunnel and I expect at least 1 combine to improve my skill while I'm hurting my wrists making these boring things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Macroquest.   Some moron will make them by the hundreds and charge the lowest price by a couple plat in the bazaar.  If you lower your price, they'll do the same until they're selling at just above cost.  At this time you'll get frustrated and quit making them, and the price will slowly rise back up again.<br />
<br />
Happened with all the other potions on my server :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>phantomhood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">don't forget shaman bots so no way to set a price:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sinjuneq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Can someone tell me where the herbs are found in PoK for &quot;Quintessence of Knowledge&quot; please. I have some guildies working on that quest that are requesting the component.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Petercorbin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">And dont expect to sell many.. first of all you have to have a mage get the spell..then you have to know said mage or buy it from their trader.. then they'd have to go get an alchemist to make this for them.. <br />
<br />
oh and the main reason why you wont be able to get much more than cost (if that!) for this:<br />
<br />
The trivial is lower than SoW potions which means any 25 shaman could make them pretty easily.. so all the dorks on your server that sell the 10 charge sow potions for 70-80pp are gunna be selling these for cost + 5pp or 10pp<br />
<br />
If VI had really wanted to help us out instead of making this PoS they could have lowered the cost of the stuff to make the existing gate potions to 110pp or so.. and then added a few more gate potions, but to places druids and wizards dont both get ports to so they can still feel special, like FV, OT, bind.. they could keep it to zones that have PoK books i guess..<br />
<br />
Verants answer to this would be something like this though:<br />
<br />
uh.. we got like hmm 400,000 items in our uh.. database thing and hmm we dont really have a lot of room for stuff like this and uh dont think we can get room for it anytime soon.<br />
<br />
Then I would say : well get rid of the stupid duplicate sets of armor, like the 6 different sets of cloth armor that have diff names, get rid of some of the new drops in newbie zones and make the newbie armor quests ask for more stuff that already exsisted in game.. regardless.. alchemy sucks (except for a couple that people overlook and i'm not going to mention them so they keep overlooking them :) )</div></div><hr />
