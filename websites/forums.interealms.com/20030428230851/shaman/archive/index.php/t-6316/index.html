<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Suddha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It's no secret... my main is a druid on the Tarew Marr server, while I play a shaman on solusek ro server. When I am playing my shaman I enjoy the company of other shamans who know a lot more than me about the class and can help me when I need it. I frequented The Shaman's Crucible, interealms.com/shaman/ , for information and hunting guides.<br />
<br />
The amount of knowledge I found there about the shaman class is priceless. I even grew to recognize names and rely on what they said to help me.<br />
<br />
The day I actually figured out the password for the Crucible's serverwide message boards was the day my opinion about people seriously changed.<br />
<br />
From someone, not going to name, I got the response, &quot;who the hell are you?&quot; This was after the simple asking of a question. I explained my main was a druid... I played a shaman as an alt and I wanted to learn about the shaman viewpoint on the matter. This person was someone I actually looked forward to reading their posts about the shaman class. That person seemed to really know what they are talking about. <br />
<br />
I learned that understanding your class and having people skills are very different.<br />
<br />
The question was, of course, how the shaman class felt about Kragg's Mending versus Tunare's Renewal. I felt that being able to talk to the people directly would help me understand better what the problem was. Man, I was badly mistaken.<br />
<br />
This person decided to yell at me, and another person who shared the same viewpoints as me, about how we were &quot;invading druids.&quot;<br />
<br />
This used-to-be-guru-of-shaman-knowledge that I looked up to soon put me on ignore without hearing out my argument. Their last reply was: &quot;do the math, welcome to ignore&quot;<br />
<br />
So, I did some research.<br />
<br />
A common argument about druids getting a better heal than the shaman class was that druids and shamans have always been equal in healing abilities.<br />
<br />
I would first like to counter this attack with these two spells:<br />
<br />
Turgur's Insects and Tigir's Insects. <br />
Turgur's being a Decrease Attack Speed by 66% (L51) to 75% (L60) spell and <br />
Tigir's being Decrease Attack Speed by 49% (L5 to 50% (L60) with a decrease in hate by 200 points.<br />
<br />
Hmm, ok. Pre-Luclin shamans and druids have the same ability to heal, spells being mainly chloroblast, superior healing, Nature's Touch, and Torpor.<br />
<br />
Both classes get superior healing and chloroblast at the same level. And both classes get Nature's Touch or Torpor at level 60.<br />
<br />
Points brought up about the spells Nature's Touch and Torpor was that Nature's Touch was a Direct heal and Torpor was a heal over time that also has negative effects. Torpor heals more in the end and Nature's Touch has twice the mana cost of Torpor. The two spells are relatively the same, considering the effects of Torpor only last for 4 ticks.<br />
<br />
Torpor info: lucy.fnord.net/spell.html...ource=Test<br />
<br />
Nature's Touch Info: lucy.fnord.net/spell.html...ource=Test<br />
<br />
Ok, so now that shamans and druids are still equal in their actual ability to heal other spells can be used to augment healing efficiency.<br />
<br />
Turgur's Insects and Tigir's Insects are both slows that shamans can use to make them more efficient in their ability to heal. Thus the saying &quot;TANK IN TEH FACE&quot; (the, misspelled on purpose.)<br />
<br />
These two spells break fights. The shamans thus gain an ability to be way more efficient in healing. With their abilities of mana regen (ie: Cannibalize IV and Cannibalize III, talking pre-luclin here  )<br />
<br />
This evidence that shamans have always been better healers than druids, the math is there, just in words, not numbers.<br />
<br />
When I spoke of slow, another shaman in the same channel said that druids get ensnare and ports. Simple question... how does having either affect the effectiveness of a druid's healing abilities?<br />
<br />
Items can now be found that proc ensnare, or versions there of. A common right click effect item for Innoruuk Trolls is the Regent Symbol of Innoruuk, effect clinging darkness, a DoT and snare type spell. everquest.allakhazam.com/...?item=1254<br />
<br />
On the issue of ports: The Nexus has openned up a huge almost subway type place for travel. It is much easier to get anywhere now. Pottery items and Alchemy potions (made by shamans!) can have porting effects. interealms.com/shaman/alchemy/<br />
<br />
However, those spells still do not effect the healing ability of a druid, only the ability to travel and solo. <br />
<br />
In this case, a shaman argued &quot;druids = quad kiting&quot; yes, a druid can quad kite. But it cannot quad mobs that summon, which rules out a lot of mobs that shamans can &quot;TANK IN TEH FACE&quot;<br />
<br />
A huge supporting post to this topic can be found here:<br />
forums.interealms.com/sha...eadid=6202<br />
<br />
Another argument brought up by some shamans was: &quot;for the same cost in mana, same cast time, and 1k less&quot; The wannabe CHs of druids and shamans come with a price. We cannot ask for a CH type of spell that is more efficient than clerics, that is wrong. Thus, both Kragg's Mending and Tunare's Renewal were given the same mana cost as a Complete Healing (400mana at 10sec cast time).<br />
<br />
Wake up call for shamans, druids finally get something that will make them wanted in groups. Be happy for them, as they are no doubt happy for your slows saving the aggro-attracting druid.<br />
<br />
Welcome Shamans, to the embrace of your druid friends. We're<br />

&quot;(Yes, this post was meant to be in the eqdruid's boards, the shaman boards will not send me the confirmation email. I also know that no matter what the shamans may say, they check here to make fun of druids.)&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh yes, not a day goes by without me heading over to the druid boards trying to find something to make fun of the druids about. I would rather make fun of an Everquest character then do something productive...like picking my nose or eating a cookie.<br />
<br />
I have nothing against druids, in fact, one of my best everquest friends was a druid. I skimmed your post but I'm too lazy to analyze it and post my feelings about what you said. I'm sure an  elder will beat me to it anway ;).<br />
<br />
**Edit: And I can't spell.**</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What was your point again? <br />
<br />
If your point is that people are rude to druids, ok I get that.<br />
<br />
If you point is that shaman are better soloers of extremely high level mobs .. ok I get that too.<br />
<br />
If your point is that shaman heal should be less than druid heal (talking Kragg's Mending here), yeah I get it.<br />
<br />
So what are you trying to say?  Is this post just one big flame about a few people that put you on ignore?<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: oh and I refuse to go to druid's hellgrove.  I posted there once and the flames were extremely unecessary ... I was even flamed by the board moderator go figure &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I personally have no problems with druids having a superior heal...  grats to you.  I do, however, think that either the casting time or casting cost should be reduced on the shaman version of the mini-ch, though.  Yours can still be superior - I'd be happy with 8 seconds casting time or say 350 mana, although I'd definitely prefer the cast time reduction over the mana reduction.<br />
<br />
While in many situations, slow does indeed negate much of the need for healing, not all mobs are slowable, and slows can be resisted.  Nobody, to my knowledge, has ever resisted a heal. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">All in all, its a sore point for shaman in general. The fact that before this we healed the same, but after we get a heal that costs the same, has the same casting time, but heals 1k less is odd to us.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
There are also items that proc slow. <br />
<br />
Anyways, i can say is that for now its prolly a subject left alone as most shaman are still upset about it. Yes the heal is nice, but we don't understand why the difference is there. <br />
<br />
Pick a scab and it will bleed :(<br />
<br />
I also think that most shaman agree with kam. Healing less isnt so much of an issue, but the casting cost or mana should be reduced to compensate. My guess is (its just a guess) that if the tables were turned, druids would be asking for the same thing. It just makes no sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Let me recap:<br />
<br />
1.  One of you is a rude bastard<br />

3.  All of the things druids get don't count because they don't directly affect ability to heal<br />
4.  Druids and Shamans have different tanking specialities (druids are better at many lower-level mobs, shamans better at one higher level mob at a time.)  This for some reason means druids are underpowered (since they can't tank &quot;in teh face&quot;)<br />
5.  Can't we all just get along?<br />

<br />
I did not do the insulting friend, it was done to me last night in the Shaman's Crucible serverwide chat.<br />
<br />
I never said all the things druids get shouldn't count because they don't affect slow. Those arguments were the responses I got in chat last night... example: <br />
<br />
I said, Shamans get slow to help with their healing<br />
<br />
A response was, Druids get ports and snares<br />
<br />
<br />
Where is it said that druids are better at lower level mobs than shamans are? Because they can quad? <br />
<br />
(&quot;in teh face&quot;) was the only response I was getting for awhile last night... I am guessing someone else said it earlier. I assumed it had to do with the tanking of slowed mobs.<br />
<br />
I would first like proof of these arguments you said have been &quot;debunked&quot;<br />
<br />
Also, I never said Shamans should be &quot;happy&quot; with their new heal... I said shamans have always had slows... this heal was made to heal less in reference to shamans having the ability to slow. They are quite different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This used-to-be-guru-of-shaman-knowledge that I looked up to soon put me on ignore without hearing out my argument. Their last reply was: &quot;do the math, welcome to ignore&quot;<br />
<br />
Wrong, this person is STILL a guru of shaman knowledge.<br />
<br />
You come to our in game channel and asked a valid question, however, your timing could not be worse.  There seemed to be a **** stirrer on last night as well.  You were on the wrong side of an arguement to be in on that particular channel.<br />
<br />
Next to the issue at hand.<br />
<br />
Let's imagine that your friend was trying to dislodge a hunderd dollar bill from a blender that was turned on.  He looks around for a cleric, but can't find one.  So he takes a shaman in it's place figuring with slow and kragg's they could easily be able to remove the cash with little or no problem.  So, your friend sticks his hand into the blender to gain aggro, and after taunting a few times the shaman casts turgur's on the blender....  OH CRAP IMMUNE, IMMUNE, IMMUNE!  Meanwhile the blender kills your friend and soon the shammy because that 1950, while might be okay in oldworld fighting gnoll pups don't cut it when dealing with a blender of this uberocity.  <br />
<br />
So...  if he takes the druid along it prolly would have went something like this:<br />
<br />
Druid puts a bad arse damage shield on your friend.  Your friend sticks his hand in the blender and the fight commences.  Heal for 2950, heal for 2950, heal for 2950, heal for 2950...  whoa close to death, Nature's touch, heal for 2950.  The mob goes down and now you and your friend have 100 bucks to split!  WOOT!  What you say what if the fight didn't go that well...  OH CRAP!!!!! evac, zone... damn that was close.<br />
<br />
Wait you say, a shaman could make pots and hand them out to the group in case a evac was needed...  Oh wait...  that casting time on the pots is just long enough for the server recognize you died and zone you back to your bind point.<br />
<br />
So you didn't evac in time and need to rez your friend.  Well as a driud you can port and pick up a cleirc with minimal downtime while the shammy is still trying to figure out how to zone in and pick up his equipment.<br />
<br />
This is the Real Ultimate Power of the druid class. A crap load more people play druids than play any other clas, why?  Ports, Quad Kiting, Ports, Making Money, Ports, Soling  When your brothern Bi**h and complain, VI throws them a bone evertime.<br />

<br />
VIOffcial211 says, &quot;Hmm we can't just give you this, we better give clerics a new line of hammer spells and bash and well give you a 2950 max heal and well give shaman a 1950 heal that costs the same, they never complain, what will they care.&quot;<br />

<br />
I did the same thing, yet asking her a question last night (I wish I had taken screen shots) got me a rude response. Then she simply would not hear me out. <br />
<br />
It's unfortunate that someone I have always learned a lot about the shaman class from turns out to hate me. For asking a question no less.<br />
<br />
In the chat last night I said I did play a druid as a main, and I was looking for the shaman view on this subject. Her response was &quot;who the hell are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hardly the shaman I am used to reading the posts of at the Shaman's Crucible boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I was online last night, although in a crazed state of mind, during this conversation. Or flame fest, as you call it.<br />
<br />
For starters, people generally don't have the time or inclination to discuss &quot;other class&quot; issues on the shaman channel. Last night, I was grinding as usual. It's boring, it's irritating (I'm now at 72% through 59), but it does take a great deal of work and concentration, so I'm not about to drop everything, waste my KEI, to start a full fledged conversation because someone wants to pick a fight. And that's what it is, picking a fight. &quot;Why won't you agree with me&quot; is what your argument boils down to. <br />
<br />
And I almost never answer longer than 3 sentences on shaman chat, I'm just too busy with the game to think straight. I keep it on for the company, and for light answers and questions, and for mutual shaman support (&quot;woo, got this, woo, did that, and why won't abe spawn for me?&quot;)<br />
<br />
Second, Gloriana gave you a good deal of rope to hang yourself with before she ignored you, she also has a life, like we do, and it is her matter who she ignore or chooses not to ignore. The fact that you were ignored by someone you respected, well, that is understandly upsetting, but Gloriana is a person just like we all are people, and what she does is her decision. It doesn't reflect the shaman community, it doesn't even reflect her all the time. At that moment, she didn't want to deal with it. So let &quot;other shaman's&quot; behavior drop, it has nothing to do with you.<br />
<br />
Onto your argument....<br />
<br />
First off:<br />
<br />
Not everyone plays an Innoruk troll shaman. So that snare necklace? Usuable by less than 5% of the shaman population. Most are Barbies. I'm vah shir. I know only 1 troll shaman, and I'm not even sure he's innoruk. Very few people play trolls because of the ugly factor, the faction factor, and the xp hit. <br />
<br />
Next, Slow isn't a heal. It can be resisted. It doesn't replenish your health supply. You can't bring someone back from the brink of death and continue a fight with it. All it does is reduce the damage from the beginning. It's like Cripple - it'sa debuffer. It makes the fight go smoother, but doesn't reduce downtime or save that enchanter who has mistakenly gotten aggro.<br />
<br />
Heals = adds hp<br />
Debuffers = reduces the mob's base stats or spells<br />
<br />
Slowing is our class defining ability. Kiting is yours. It's how we make xp. We can't kite. We have 1 crappy rain spell, it's horribly mana inefficent. We don't have snare (except for that 5%, and you will never see them kite). You will never see a shaman grab 4 mobs, run them together, and then kite them all over the zone.<br />
<br />
Fighting IN THA FACE (to quote The Truth, a guy who amuses us greatly by having No Clue) is how we make our xp. It's a different style. A druid gets more xp than I do in 10 minutes, but has to sit down and med for 5. A shaman can go non-stop, with KEI, a horse, a jbb and an ikky regen bp. (Or better). At the upper levels, we get the same xp overall - you get yours in 20 mins, rest for 10 mins. I get mine in 30 minutes, no resting.<br />
<br />
It's a style decision that affects the gear we wear, the tactics we do.... On your druid, is your piercing maxed? Is your defense maxed? Do you work on your 2hb? Do you strive to get your AC over 1000, and your hp over 2600 ? No? If you're like most druids I know, getting wis up is the #1 goal. Then focus items. Most shaman have their wis at or slightly below 200. That's so we can have more AC and HP to take those slowed blows - which do land, just slower - that massively cut into our HP.<br />
<br />
Take away our slow and we would be unable to fight at all. It's not a nice spell. It is our class defining ability - without it, we are nothing.<br />
<br />
Now onto the real discussion - why we are upset about Kragg's. It has nothing to do with slow. As a matter of fact, little to do with Canni V either, as the odds that we will have &gt; 2800 hp to break the 1920 75% limit are very small. There is a limit to how much HP we can fost upon ourselves, even with buffs, and I think that's around 3200 ?<br />
<br />
The fact is, Druids are more unwanted in groups than Shaman, so giving druids a bigger cheal makes them more wanted, also gives them a bigger place onthe cheal train. We're cool with that - we don't want to cheal. We're too busy slowing buffing crippling dotting.<br />
<br />
But it's unfair that we get 1k less hp, for the same amount of mana or casting time. If they reduced either - gave it a 8 sec casting time, or made it 300 mana, we'd be happy. But they don't, so we pay the full painful charge, and end up with an inferior spell.<br />
<br />
That's why we want them to alter the spell. Make it equal. Reduce the casting time, or reduce the mana, or increase the heal. So we aren't paying the same outrageous price for shoddy goods.<br />
<br />
Oh, and insulting Gloriana on the boards? Not cool, man. Let the crucible conversations stay in the crucible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course I read your post! Complete Healing is a cleric domain. Druids and Shamans both got lesser forms of the complete healing spell. And I say again, we cannot ask for a better ratio than the clerics. Lowering the mana cost or the casting time, imo, would do that.</div></div><hr />

I was online last night, although in a crazed state of mind, during this conversation. Or flame fest, as you call it.<br />
<br />
For starters, people generally don't have the time or inclination to discuss &quot;other class&quot; issues on the shaman channel. Last night, I was grinding as usual. It's boring, it's irritating (I'm now at 72% through 59), but it does take a great deal of work and concentration, so I'm not about to drop everything, waste my KEI, to start a full fledged conversation because someone wants to pick a fight. And that's what it is, picking a fight. &quot;Why won't you agree with me&quot; is what your argument boils down to. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I never intended to start a fight. I was asking for the shaman viewpoint. &quot;Why won't you agree with me&quot; is probably what my post is. Only because to me, that's what I see. I had hoped to last night get it clarified with some elder shaman discussion.<br />

Second, Gloriana gave you a good deal of rope to hang yourself with before she ignored you, she also has a life, like we do, and it is her matter who she ignore or chooses not to ignore. The fact that you were ignored by someone you respected, well, that is understandly upsetting, but Gloriana is a person just like we all are people, and what she does is her decision. It doesn't reflect the shaman community, it doesn't even reflect her all the time. At that moment, she didn't want to deal with it. So let &quot;other shaman's&quot; behavior drop, it has nothing to do with you.<br />
<br />

She never gave me any &quot;rope to hang myself on.&quot; You yourself said you have too much concentration in the game to partake in large discussions. Perhaps you missed some crucial information while concentrating.<br />

Not everyone plays an Innoruk troll shaman. So that snare necklace? Usuable by less than 5% of the shaman population. Most are Barbies. I'm vah shir. I know only 1 troll shaman, and I'm not even sure he's innoruk. Very few people play trolls because of the ugly factor, the faction factor, and the xp hit. <br />

It was simply an example.<br />

It makes the fight go smoother, but doesn't reduce downtime or save that enchanter who has mistakenly gotten aggro.<br />

Not every druid kites. I for one do not. I prefer to root and rot. Quad-kiting is a method of exp grinding that we can do. But it is not a class defining ability. Wizards are far better quad-ers than druids.<br />

At the upper levels, we get the same xp overall - you get yours in 20 mins, rest for 10 mins. I get mine in 30 minutes, no resting.<br />

Most shaman have their wis at or slightly below 200. That's so we can have more AC and HP to take those slowed blows - which do land, just slower - that massively cut into our HP.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Defense is actually maxed I believe. I get beat on a lot too. One of my most effective ways of rooting is stand there and try and get a close root off while being beat on. This is used mainly when I dungeon solo.<br />

Now onto the real discussion - why we are upset about Kragg's. It has nothing to do with slow. As a matter of fact, little to do with Canni V either, as the odds that we will have &gt; 2800 hp to break the 1920 75% limit are very small. There is a limit to how much HP we can fost upon ourselves, even with buffs, and I think that's around 3200 ?<br />
<br />
The fact is, Druids are more unwanted in groups than Shaman, so giving druids a bigger cheal makes them more wanted, also gives them a bigger place onthe cheal train. We're cool with that - we don't want to cheal. We're too busy slowing buffing crippling dotting.<br />
<br />
But it's unfair that we get 1k less hp, for the same amount of mana or casting time. If they reduced either - gave it a 8 sec casting time, or made it 300 mana, we'd be happy. But they don't, so we pay the full painful charge, and end up with an inferior spell.<br />
<br />
That's why we want them to alter the spell. Make it equal. Reduce the casting time, or reduce the mana, or increase the heal. So we aren't paying the same outrageous price for shoddy goods.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It is my opinion that getting a spell (or variation of that spell) that is the staple of clerics, means that we cannot ask for better ratios than the clerics.<br />

Having a shaman in a group who is capable of slowing is far greater than having a druid in the group who can damage shield. 50+ mobs' hp is just too great for a 20 damage damage shield to mean anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Sudda, Problem with Druids has always been with subdivisions.  Druid mentality is that the skills of a druid are divided into facets, and the druid should be best or second best in each facet.  <br />
<br />
Healing facet - with the latest spells and the proposed PoP spells, druids pretty much get past shaman.  <br />
DD facet - Wizards win, mainly because of manaburn, and that chaps many a druid.<br />
Taxi facet - Wizzies had Nexus and Druids didn't.  Druids whined like democrats til they got Nexus ports.<br />
Utility facet - can't think of a single spell druids don't get except feign death.<br />
Pet facet - Druids even get a crappy pet now.<br />
Pulling Facet - harmony is extremely useful.<br />
DOT facet - druids are upset to find themselves behind necros and shaman.<br />
Buff facet - druids get some buffs, including damage shield.<br />
Debuff facet - snare is uber.<br />
<br />
The only facets of the game Druids don't have an arm and a leg in are crowd control and corpse recovery.  <br />
<br />
Shaman on the otherhand, have utility, a crappy pet, 3rd rate healing, DoTs, stat buffs, and the coveted slow.  We compete the whole way with Enchanters on slow.  If you want to fight over slow - go to the enchanter board.  They get Tash - which makes slows stick.  Maybe Druids should get clarity...wait - they do.</div></div><hr />

Sorry if this offends anyone, but the truth of the matter is that the majority of the people who play druids are low skill players who picked an uber EQ template class that is easy to play.  Until now those same players paid a penalty for having such an easy class to play.  <br />
<br />
The penalty has now been removed and we are a bit puzzled as to why there is such a large gap between the druids and shaman in healing power.<br />

Clercs have over 5 times the potential current healing that a shaman does, and over 3 times what a druid has.<br />

Of course I read your post! Complete Healing is a cleric domain. Druids and Shamans both got lesser forms of the complete healing spell. And I say again, we cannot ask for a better ratio than the clerics. Lowering the mana cost or the casting time, imo, would do that. <br />
<br />
Are you SURE you read the post thoroughly? And bothered to think about it? Let's do some math.<br />
<br />
Cleric CH = 10k for 400 mana, 10 sec cast<br />
Druid CH = 2950 for 400 mana, 10 sec cast<br />
Shaman CH = 1950 for 400 mana, 10 sec cast<br />
<br />
So... imagine we're grinding xp in UP. You have a warrior with about 5500 HP buffed (decent gear, nothing phenomenal). Assume we all begin casting our heals with the tank at 30% health:<br />
<br />
Cleric heals 3850 hp in 10 sec for 400 mana<br />
9.625 hp/mana, 385 hp/sec healed<br />
<br />
Druid heals 2950 hp in 10 sec for 400 mana<br />
7.375 hp/mana, 295 hp/sec healed<br />
<br />
Shaman heals 1950 hp in 10 sec for 400 mana<br />
4.875 hp/mana, 195 hp/sec healed<br />
<br />
Who's getting close to cleric efficiency? Certainly not the shaman. These numbers get better for the cleric as the tank gets more HP, of course.<br />
<br />
Now, if you reduced the cast time and/or mana cost on Kragg's mending:<br />
<br />
Shaman heals 1950 hp in 8 sec for 400 mana<br />
4.875 hp/mana, 243.75 hp/sec healed<br />
<br />
Shaman heals 1950 hp in 10 sec for 300 mana<br />
6.5 hp/mana, 195 hp/sec healed<br />
<br />
None of this is even coming close to cleric healing, either in terms of hp/mana or hp/sec. It's still worse than druid healing, but at least the difference isn't so egregious. Is this making our objections clearer to you?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I'm sorry but given recent events ... this is all a bit weird to me.   A new poster to this board who has similar style, typing habits, sentence structure as &quot;the Truth&quot;  ... much less quoting him ... makes me want to say &quot;Sock Puppet&quot;.    <br />
<br />
Never the less ... your opening post was built on your raw nerve of being put on /ignored by a single Shaman.    On the flip side, your premise is based on tired conjuncture and fuzzy logic of comparing slow to heals while offering that Druid and Shaman heals are similar in value.    The core issue isn't the heal but the comparison between Druid direct heals and Shamans.    Up to this change ... it was equal spells between Druid and Shaman on direct healing.   <br />
<br />
Now 57 levels , 3 years +, patches, updates, expansions later ... it's DISSIMILAR in total healing output with all other values remaining the same.   What changed here?   If we are all Priest's due to our healing abilities ... but we are not Cleric's (rightly so) ...  then what are we?  The answer is ... dissimilar ...  seemingly suddenly due to some new Shaman slowing ablity?.   Who is surprised that we are concerned that this Shaman's ability is pigeon holed us?.    It would have been a minor thing to change Kragg's Mending casting time and/or mana cost by a tiny amount in effort to balance out the differences.<br />
<br />
But speaking of pigeon holing ... how about this statement that is sure to get a Druid up in arms.   &quot;Oh, you Druids have life easy because you can quad&quot;.   If that bothers Druids ... then the same is true for a Shaman concerning slow ...  because despite the rumors ... &quot;Casting Slow&quot; doesn't kill automatically kill the mob, nor land, or ever hold, stack, much less always add value, and it's replaceable by other classes.   So don't expect to come to a Shaman server wide chat and/or board and get a positive reaction's while trying to convert Shaman's using the same logic.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Although it did occur to me that maybe the original druid poster has a point...  I heard that on test, they added a wizard mini-cheal (1%, capped at 5hps), for 350 mana and a 10 second cast time.  That's like totally more efficient than the cleric cheal, because, like, it uses less mana.  And have you seen those wizards nuke?  Great googly-moogly!  Why would anyone want a cleric when wizards have better heals and can nuke like that!</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Give druids a 15% slow for 350 mana <br />
<br />
Now that we have come to a resolving point. <br />
<br />
Gloriana is one who i look up to also, ive spoken with her once and gave her the heads up on Crucible channel .. I dont bombard (sp) her with questions or druid vs. shaman questions, polls, takes, on the new heals. Good for Druids...they heal more than me ... Does that affect my soloing? nope.  Does that affect my grouping? nope.  Am i bitter over it, yes ... I agree with most on here that they should lower shaman's mana or cast time.  <br />

ever tried healing an 8k hp tank? with kraggs? ... yeah i barely dent him.  <br />

move along little druid, we have already talked about how we feel about the differences in the spells.   if you care to read up on it, try the search feature.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">It is my opinion that getting a spell (or variation of that spell) that is the staple of clerics, means that we cannot ask for better ratios than the clerics.  <br />
<br />
We're not asking for better ratios than clerics. Clerics can take a fully buffed uber warrior with, say, 10k hp from 1 hp to 10k for 400 mana right? Complete heal.<br />
<br />
Shamans and druids heals are capped at 75%, or 3k for druids/2k for shamans, whichever comes first I guess. Both druid and shaman heals cost the same mana, and same casting time, yet shamans get a heal 1k less than druids. My shaman is only level 48, and I really don't have a whole lot of mana. I even find that chain casting greater healing can run me out of mana quickly. Often times when I play main healer for my group the only way I can keep up with slows and heals is if I have C3 on. Even then I'd be at 40% hp almost constantly from cannibalizing. Sure, we can regenerate mana back quickly, but that comes at a price. An even trade, hit points for mana. Druids get hp AND mana regen spells with PoP right? Well answer this question for me. Where is the penalty? What price do druids pay?<br />
<br />
Clerics don't even come up in the flames anyway(from what I've seen). 2k and 3k heals, every 10 seconds, for 400 mana on a raid buffed warrior is NOT going to cut it. Clerics still completely own us as far as healing. And now they even out melee us with their new hammers. In my opinion, I think shamans should be one of the best meleers out of the priests. I mean, come on, who would hit harder, a high elf cleric with a strength of 55, or an ogre shaman with a strength of 130 or so? <br />
<br />
If our mana cost was lowered, as well as the cast time(Or maybe one or the other. I think maybe druids cast time should be lowered by a second or two as well though.), then we wouldn't be complaining. <br />
<br />
I'm hoping you see my point. If not then I can't do anything further to help you understand my point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you believe the slow line of spells should be considered in the &quot;who has more healing power? equation, then where do you place Enchanters in the healing business?<br />
<br />
1. Horrible - slow shouldn't even be considered as a heal  (trick answer ;) )<br />
<br />
2. Worse than a druid?<br />
<br />
3. Even-steven with Druids?<br />
<br />
4. Better than druids?<br />
<br />
If your response is anything except 4, then your argument regarding the healing impact of shaman slow is meaningless because your response indicates there is no direct comparison between the two.  If your answer is 4, then once again, you have convinced yourself that slow is really not related to healing since clearly Enchanters can't replace lost health withtheir slow spell.<br />
<br />
Heals replace lost health.  Slow reduces the rate of health loss during combat (much like AC buffs, health regen, dodge, parry, etc).  They may be tangentially related, but are not directly comparable.  I think this is why people tire of this topic - it's silly at best, but mostly just pointless.<br />

<br />
I really don't think shamans who apparently flamed or ignored you are to blame. Not everyone of them.<br />
<br />
You have to know that we are tired of seing here and there that we are overpowered, not to say unbalanced. tired of been flamed by people not even knowing our class, or how we can play it.<br />
<br />
Your first post, when i read it, told me &quot;you don't have any reason to complain about, these new heals are well suited&quot;.<br />
For many of us, it only was another of these endless discussions we don't want anymore, where we were facing another owner of &quot;that absolute truth we don't want to see&quot; :)<br />
<br />
Only later in your thread could i see you really wanted to know why we were asking for a 2 secs save in casting time, or a lesser cost in mana.<br />
even if you couldn't really understand, or if you doubted we wanted it for any good reasons.<br />
<br />
A really nice thread, written by someone playing a warrior (and a shaman i think, not sure), explained very well why this new heal is not efficient as a heal at this level of game for a shaman:<br />
- just have a look at Sithrax post, to understand why this heal is not efficient in group situation.<br />
- just imagine a 10 secs casting time for a heal while soloing, even a slowed mob, and tell me we will never get interrupts.<br />
- and i won't talk about raids, where we have to debuffs / dot / refresh debuffs / redot / ... at cost of a very high aggro, and many resists. we don't really have time to heal save as patch healers, for fast casting heals.<br />
<br />
So we only wanted to remind we are priests, and as priests we need to be efficient as healers.<br />
It's not whining. It's saying we are proud of what we are, and we want to do it well. Not to be the best at it, only to do it well.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You argued that slowing add to our heal habilities.<br />
i don't think so.<br />
<br />
slowing is a different thing, and that is debuffing.<br />
This is our realm, Shamans are debuffers, and are kings in this realm.<br />
<br />
Like Druids are Kings in movement realm. <br />
you get snare (you don't use it? it's your personnal choice. some shamans too are rooting/doting, but the higher their level the fewer they are to do so). you get harmonize to solo pull. you get habilities that will grant you faster speed than almost everything you choose to fight. and others to run from whatever you didn't choose to fight (evac). you can go to battle in a few seconds with tp to almost everywhere, where we have to run to a spire, sit for up to 15 minuts, then run again (when we don't have to wait for another tp in luclin). You can choose then find your prey with tracking, and even know exactly when your choosen prey pop in your zone.<br />
(in fact we slow damage rate of mobs while you try to annul it, to avoid any melee range with your foes)<br />
<br />
<br />
And as we have 2 different realms, we have different gear (druids being a leather class, not really suited for fighting &quot;IN TEH FACE&quot; while shamans are a chain class, heavily looking for HP gear as HP are our life and our mana), we have different tactics, using at best our different powers.<br />
<br />
<br />
In fact shamans and druids are really differents, two distant parents. but parents sharing some habilities we (in this community) wouldn't like to loose (don't forget that in our world<br />
after they became the celt we know and had druids to guide them, west european people had a nomadic way of life, and had shamans. druids are born of shamans!!).<br />
This is why we ask for these change.<br />
(but i doubt we'll ever get it, as i doubt we get anything that could have a chance according to VI to raise our already nice mana regen capacity. here is the true problem according to me)<br />
<br />

For some reason this hardly surprises me at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Personally I think druids heal at 58 needs to be nurfed down to 2k just like the shaman heal. Quite frankley at that lvl it is over powered and broke. It is too close to a clerics true CH and clerics don't offer enough else to bring to the group. Your average tank at lvl 58 isn't going to have enough hps to make a difference between the cleric heal and the druid heal.<br />
<br />
In my experience most clerics tend to land thier ch's for about 60% or so to give them pleanty of time to cover fizzles interupts and possible adds for more dmg etc. That means that a tank needs bout 4500hps for there to be any difference between the cleric and druid heal. <br />
<br />
Running to magelo I pulled up some random profiles.<br />
<br />
Just for fun i went to magelo and checked thier warrior profile thread. Here's the random sampling i took of the none lvl 60 uber guild warriors.<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=287903<br />
lvl 53 warrior with 2600 hps.<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=389385<br />
lvl 55 warrior with 2224 hps.<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=380492<br />
lvl 55 warrior with 2397 hps.<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=376152<br />
lvl 56 warrior with 2488 hps.<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=349614<br />
lvl 59 warrior with 2847 hps.<br />
<br />
Since Full raid buffs is about 2k with lvl 60 buffs none of these tanks would be significantly over 4500hps fully buffed and the odds of having a 60cleric shaman and druid around to fully buff you in an exp group aren't very good. Meaning they will be even less than that.<br />
<br />
Drop that down to a 2k heal like shaman currently have and you still have a reasonable heal but you also allow for clerics to still have a measurably better heal.<br />
<br />
Now that doesn't mean I think shaman and druid should be stuck with a 2k heal at 60 because that just doesn't cut it either. When your tanks have 7k+ hps healing for 2k doesn't work. The 3k heal needs to be a lvl 60 spell that commonly drops of no drop mobs tier 3 or 4 and higher so that as you start getting those 5-6k tanks you druid and shaman can heal them effectively still.<br />
<br />
Should probably be a 4k heal too for clerics and shaman off mobs like aow, emp and seru.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, I'd rather have another heal in between the lower levels. From 29 to 51(or 52, forgot) I have been/will be using greater healing. Sure at 29 I'm thinking &quot;sweet, I can actually heal now&quot;. But now at 48 the only good it does me is to heal myself and let the clerics worry about the meleers. Not that I group anymore(unless on raids of course). I prefer to solo, because then all I have to worry about is my dog and myself. No damn gnome getting splatted all over the place from a giant while I'm chain casting greater healing on him.<br />
<br />
ANYWAY. Point is, what is the point of nerfing druids heal, and moving both of our heals up to level 60?? If anything they should lower KM's mana and/or cast time. When summoning my pet, which is like 11 second cast, it feels like it's taking FOREVER and a day. Man, I wonder what would happen if I had to heal someone in an emergancy huh? Oh yeah, probably gonna have to memorize more than one heal spell. It's not like I could use any other spell slots for something more usefull.<br />

your initial post<br />
The question was, of course, how the shaman class felt about Kragg's Mending versus Tunare's Renewal. I felt that being able to talk to the people directly would help me understand better what the problem was. Man, I was badly mistaken. <br />
<br />
Pointing out that you say &quot;help me understand what the problem was&quot; and so you, of course, knew that this was a sore spot with shaman currently and feign surprise at the negative reactions to asking about it?  <br />
<br />
Naive.<br />
<br />
Returning to the Crucible to whine about this event instead of researching the boards to find out your answer, or posting a well thought out question minus the recount?<br />
<br />
Immature.<br />
<br />
My view that will hopefully help you answer your deep and unique question?<br />
<br />
Priceless.  (sorry had to be done :p)<br />
<br />
<br />
If we were to return to the days of before the new CHs, you would find druids and shaman carrying on as they normally do with our little bickering between both sides, but both relatively secure in the belief that we were deemed balanced classes, or at least, fairly equal and balanced overall versus each other.<br />
<br />
Now if you give one of these classes something and yet keep absolutely everything else about the two the exact same, you seem to be showing a certain amount of favoritism.  It indicates that you either thought more of the class you gave something to, or you're telling everyone that they were stupid and wrong and that things really weren't equal as you'd thought to begin with.<br />
<br />
Either way you insult.<br />
<br />
There's your answer.  Enjoy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, THAT was certainally silly. Rather like asking a bunch of gangsta rappers if they do anything by the Ramones. Now, you know better.<br />
<br />
I would first like to counter this attack with these two spells:<br />
<br />
Turgur's Insects and Tigir's Insects. <br />
Turgur's being a Decrease Attack Speed by 66% (L51) to 75% (L60) spell and <br />
Tigir's being Decrease Attack Speed by 49% (L5 to 50% (L60) with a decrease in hate by 200 points.<br />
<br />
Turgur's Insects and Tigir's Insects are both slows that shamans can use to make them more efficient in their ability to heal. Thus the saying &quot;TANK IN TEH FACE&quot; (the, misspelled on purpose.)<br />
<br />
These two spells break fights. The shamans thus gain an ability to be way more efficient in healing. With their abilities of mana regen (ie: Cannibalize IV and Cannibalize III, talking pre-luclin here  )<br />
<br />
This evidence that shamans have always been better healers than druids, the math is there, just in words, not numbers.<br />
<br />
True enough argument. Except when the critter is immune to changes in attack speed, really resistant, or just naturally fast as all hell. Maybe, if Warriors above level 58 were immune to druid heals, and all players had a chance of resisting a druid heal, or if characters with a regen spell only gained half the HP healed, THEN your argument would be 100% correct. For now, it's about 70% correct or so.<br />
<br />
When I spoke of slow, another shaman in the same channel said that druids get ensnare and ports. Simple question... how does having either affect the effectiveness of a druid's healing abilities?<br />
<br />
On hte healing ability? Well, I would say that Snare has a drastic effect on your ability to heal when soloing, and a well-placed evac can save your group as well as a CHeal can, without the aggro. What this fella was probably trying to convey was the relative power of the classes as a whole. You can't focus on just one peice of a class compared to another, because when you do, the class you start with will look badly underpowered. (Waaaaah, warriors nuke worse than wizards and heal worse than necromancers!). Get my drift?<br />
<br />
Items can now be found that proc ensnare, or versions there of. A common right click effect item for Innoruuk Trolls is the Regent Symbol of Innoruuk, effect clinging darkness, a DoT and snare type spell. everquest.allakhazam.com/...?item=1254<br />
<br />
Yup. Out of six possible shaman race / deity combinations, one has the ability to cast a short-lived snaredot that, being magic-based with little modifierto resist ability, will bounce off often enough. Out of six possible druid race / deity combinations, three can get a root necklace. All six can get clickable damage armor from Kunark, yet only five of six shaman combinations can do the same.  And don't forget, human and dark elf clerics can get the snare necklace with less factionwork. Items do NOT define balance, do they?<br />
<br />
On the issue of ports: The Nexus has openned up a huge almost subway type place for travel. It is much easier to get anywhere now. Pottery items and Alchemy potions (made by shamans!) can have porting effects. interealms.com/shaman/alchemy/<br />
<br />
I beleive druids and wizards both benefit more from the Nexus than anyone else. Why? Because there's lots of people all waiting for fifteen minutes (half an hour in the case of Velious / Odus) to get to a place kinda near where they really want to go. Rest assured, there are more ports out of nexus via druid / wizard ride than my sitting on the speaker-shattering platforms.<br />
<br />
And again, don't bring up gear (especially high end tradeskill stuff) as part of &quot;class balance&quot;.<br />
<br />
In this case, a shaman argued &quot;druids = quad kiting&quot; yes, a druid can quad kite. But it cannot quad mobs that summon, which rules out a lot of mobs that shamans can &quot;TANK IN TEH FACE&quot;<br />
<br />
A huge supporting post to this topic can be found here:<br />
forums.interealms.com/sha...eadid=6202<br />
<br />
Okay, we have a lot of shaman that will be reading this thread, I'm sure. So, I'm gonna ask something from you guys.<br />
<br />
Will every shaman that solos summoning mobs for experience in a &quot;grind&quot; kind of situation, please raise your hand? Thank you, kindly take your uber asses out of here and go kick some butt. The rest of you may read on.<br />
<br />
And, some more advice... Don't point towards &quot;The Truth&quot; on the castersrealms forum as someone who knows what he's talking about. I'm sure if you do a search, you can see where i've swatted him down many a time.<br />
<br />
[b]Another argument brought up by some shamans was: &quot;for the same cost in mana, same cast time, and 1k less&quot; The wannabe CHs of druids and shamans come with a price. We cannot ask for a CH type of spell that is more efficient than clerics, that is wrong. Thus, both Kragg's Mending and Tunare's Renewal were given the same mana cost as a Complete Healing (400mana at 10sec cast time).<br />
<br />
Well... Why not? They still have rezzes and better-than-bard melee going for them, along with the best meaningful buffs in the game (Another show of hands - all of you without at least one stack of peridots on their person?). And, tell ya what, I'll think the spells are fair if the druid heal had it's casting cost brought up to 532, and the cast time increased to 13.5 seconds. That extra 1/3 healing power you guys get should be compensated for, yes? :)<br />
<br />
[b]Wake up call for shamans, druids finally get something that will make them wanted in groups. Be happy for them, as they are no doubt happy for your slows saving the aggro-attracting druid.<br />
<br />
Erm... That looks an awful lot like &quot;**** n00b shman u don know what u talk about dr00dz r00l&quot;. Am I happy for druids? Nope. Am I angry at druids? Nope. Am I indifferent? Yup. I still haven't seen druids giving up their quad-grinds in ME and Umbral to join groups as a healer. Nor would I expect most of them to know HOW to heal in a group. &quot;Uh oh, the tank's down by half a bub, better hit him with my big one! Aggro? Noooo! Dumb tank can't taunt, I'm gonna solo&quot;<br />
<br />
Welcome Shamans, to the embrace of your druid friends. We're<br />
all priests after all, right?<br />
<br />
Actually, I think we're becoming like those poor Bards. &quot;You're a... uhm... er... unique, uh... priest-like... er... class... thing! Kinda. Sorta. Sometimes&quot;</div></div><hr />

You might as well add me to your ignore list since it is obvious, to me, that Kragg's Mending is as it is because of the shaman ability to /cough Turgur.</div></div><hr />

You know Suddha, you would be take seriously if you didn't play a druid as your main.<br />
<br />
Sorry if this offends anyone, but the truth of the matter is that the majority of the people who play druids are low skill players who picked an uber EQ template class that is easy to play.  Until now those same players paid a penalty for having such an easy class to play.  <br />
<br />
The penalty has now been removed and we are a bit puzzled as to why there is such a large gap between the druids and shaman in healing power.<br />
<br />
It is disheartening to see a bunch of low skill players get bumped up the food chain when our population is so much higher quality in terms of the typical player who chooses the class as their primary. <br />
<br />
You are probably right about the getting a better response if I was say, a cleric, or something.<br />
<br />
However, your comment about choosing a druid because of the &quot;uber EQ template class that is easy to play&quot; as being the reason anyone chooses a druid is totally unfounded.</div></div><hr />

Well, I don't know the exact numbers, and it's easier with rounding anyway, so play along with me...<br />
<br />
assume:<br />
Shaman: 2000hp for 400 mana in 8 seconds (my proposed improvement)<br />
Druid: 3000hp for 400 mana in 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
So that means in a given 40 second span, the shaman can heal 10khp for 2000 mana, and the druid can heal 12khp for 1600 mana.<br />
<br />
Tell me again how that in any way gets shaman up in the realm of clerics? <br />
<br />
With those numbers I agree with you, however, I still don't think you understand what I was trying to explain.</div></div><hr />

Clercs have over 5 times the potential current healing that a shaman does, and over 3 times what a druid has.<br />

I don't think that we have a chance in hell of surpassing that ratio. <br />

Are you SURE you read the post thoroughly? And bothered to think about it? Let's do some math.<br />
<br />
Cleric CH = 10k for 400 mana, 10 sec cast<br />
Druid CH = 2950 for 400 mana, 10 sec cast<br />
Shaman CH = 1950 for 400 mana, 10 sec cast<br />
<br />
So... imagine we're grinding xp in UP. You have a warrior with about 5500 HP buffed (decent gear, nothing phenomenal). Assume we all begin casting our heals with the tank at 30% health:<br />
<br />
Cleric heals 3850 hp in 10 sec for 400 mana<br />
9.625 hp/mana, 385 hp/sec healed<br />
<br />
Druid heals 2950 hp in 10 sec for 400 mana<br />
7.375 hp/mana, 295 hp/sec healed<br />
<br />
Shaman heals 1950 hp in 10 sec for 400 mana<br />
4.875 hp/mana, 195 hp/sec healed<br />
<br />
Who's getting close to cleric efficiency? Certainly not the shaman. These numbers get better for the cleric as the tank gets more HP, of course.<br />
<br />
Now, if you reduced the cast time and/or mana cost on Kragg's mending:<br />
<br />
Shaman heals 1950 hp in 8 sec for 400 mana<br />
4.875 hp/mana, 243.75 hp/sec healed<br />
<br />
Shaman heals 1950 hp in 10 sec for 300 mana<br />
6.5 hp/mana, 195 hp/sec healed<br />
<br />
None of this is even coming close to cleric healing, either in terms of hp/mana or hp/sec. It's still worse than druid healing, but at least the difference isn't so egregious. Is this making our objections clearer to you?<br />
<br />
Next time you come on a SHAMAN messageboard or a SHAMAN channel and try to tell us what we need or don't need, please do us the courtesy of coming up with a cogent argument. <br />
<br />
yes, you are making it quite clear that you didn't understand what I said.<br />

If shaman have always had slow and healed exactly the same as druids, then we should still get our slow and heal exactly the same as druids. We are not asking to heal the same as druids. Most shaman I know despise playing healer. We are talking about fairness here. Of course you don't understant it. You're getting everything you could possible hope for.

Druids keep adding in slows to our healing factor. We have always slowed and we we always will. Our slows were never put into the ratio before, now all of a sudden they are.<br />

I'm sorry but given recent events ... this is all a bit weird to me.   A new poster to this board who has similar style, typing habits, sentence structure as &quot;the Truth&quot;  ... much less quoting him ... makes me want to say &quot;Sock Puppet&quot;.    <br />
<br />
Never the less ... your opening post was built on your raw nerve of being put on /ignored by a single Shaman.    On the flip side, your premise is based on tired conjuncture and fuzzy logic of comparing slow to heals while offering that Druid and Shaman heals are similar in value.    The core issue isn't the heal but the comparison between Druid direct heals and Shamans.    Up to this change ... it was equal spells between Druid and Shaman on direct healing.   <br />
<br />
Now 57 levels , 3 years +, patches, updates, expansions later ... it's DISSIMILAR in total healing output with all other values remaining the same.   What changed here?   If we are all Priest's due to our healing abilities ... but we are not Cleric's (rightly so) ...  then what are we?  The answer is ... dissimilar ...  seemingly suddenly due to some new Shaman slowing ablity?.   Who is surprised that we are concerned that this Shaman's ability is pigeon holed us?.    It would have been a minor thing to change Kragg's Mending casting time and/or mana cost by a tiny amount in effort to balance out the differences.<br />
<br />
But speaking of pigeon holing ... how about this statement that is sure to get a Druid up in arms.   &quot;Oh, you Druids have life easy because you can quad&quot;.   If that bothers Druids ... then the same is true for a Shaman concerning slow ...  because despite the rumors ... &quot;Casting Slow&quot; doesn't kill automatically kill the mob, nor land, or ever hold, stack, much less always add value, and it's replaceable by other classes.   So don't expect to come to a Shaman server wide chat and/or board and get a positive reaction's while trying to convert Shaman's using the same logic. <br />
<br />
Who is The Truth?<br />
<br />
I can assure you I never posted under a name called The Truth. should be worth looking up though, what is it? simply The Truth? or The_Truth?<br />
<br />
I quoted &quot;IN TEH FACE&quot; from the shamans in the channel... never heard of the truth until this topic.<br />
<br />
Anyways, reply on this post. You are right, my original post was done out of anger at being totally ignored from someone I looked up too.<br />
<br />
Hmm, if the shaman spell is lowered in cast time and/or cost per cast... the only logical step would be to lower the same for both cleric and druids CHs.<br />
<br />
I thank you for pointing out the quad kiting vs slow as sore spots for two classes. It makes sense to me. Just the same quad-ing is not so &quot;popular&quot; among druids as it may seem. It can get a druid killed a lot easier than other methods of exp hunting.</div></div><hr />

Although it did occur to me that maybe the original druid poster has a point...  I heard that on test, they added a wizard mini-cheal (1%, capped at 5hps), for 350 mana and a 10 second cast time.  That's like totally more efficient than the cleric cheal, because, like, it uses less mana.  And have you seen those wizards nuke?  Great googly-moogly!  Why would anyone want a cleric when wizards have better heals and can nuke like that! <br />

Gloriana is one who i look up to also, ive spoken with her once and gave her the heads up on Crucible channel .. I dont bombard (sp) her with questions or druid vs. shaman questions, polls, takes, on the new heals. Good for Druids...they heal more than me ... Does that affect my soloing? nope.  Does that affect my grouping? nope.  Am i bitter over it, yes ... I agree with most on here that they should lower shaman's mana or cast time.  <br />

We're not asking for better ratios than clerics. Clerics can take a fully buffed uber warrior with, say, 10k hp from 1 hp to 10k for 400 mana right? Complete heal.<br />
<br />
Shamans and druids heals are capped at 75%, or 3k for druids/2k for shamans, whichever comes first I guess. Both druid and shaman heals cost the same mana, and same casting time, yet shamans get a heal 1k less than druids. My shaman is only level 48, and I really don't have a whole lot of mana. I even find that chain casting greater healing can run me out of mana quickly. Often times when I play main healer for my group the only way I can keep up with slows and heals is if I have C3 on. Even then I'd be at 40% hp almost constantly from cannibalizing. Sure, we can regenerate mana back quickly, but that comes at a price. An even trade, hit points for mana. Druids get hp AND mana regen spells with PoP right? Well answer this question for me. Where is the penalty? What price do druids pay?<br />
<br />
Clerics don't even come up in the flames anyway(from what I've seen). 2k and 3k heals, every 10 seconds, for 400 mana on a raid buffed warrior is NOT going to cut it. Clerics still completely own us as far as healing. And now they even out melee us with their new hammers. In my opinion, I think shamans should be one of the best meleers out of the priests. I mean, come on, who would hit harder, a high elf cleric with a strength of 55, or an ogre shaman with a strength of 130 or so? <br />
<br />
If our mana cost was lowered, as well as the cast time(Or maybe one or the other. I think maybe druids cast time should be lowered by a second or two as well though.), then we wouldn't be complaining. <br />
<br />
I'm hoping you see my point. If not then I can't do anything further to help you understand my point. <br />
<br />
I do see your point. And I agree, with the last part about lowering... even though not only druids, but you would have to lower clerics' as well.</div></div><hr />

If you believe the slow line of spells should be considered in the &quot;who has more healing power? equation, then where do you place Enchanters in the healing business?<br />
<br />
1. Horrible - slow shouldn't even be considered as a heal  (trick answer ;) )<br />
<br />
2. Worse than a druid?<br />
<br />
3. Even-steven with Druids?<br />
<br />
4. Better than druids?<br />
<br />
If your response is anything except 4, then your argument regarding the healing impact of shaman slow is meaningless because your response indicates there is no direct comparison between the two.  If your answer is 4, then once again, you have convinced yourself that slow is really not related to healing since clearly Enchanters can't replace lost health withtheir slow spell.<br />
<br />
Heals replace lost health.  Slow reduces the rate of health loss during combat (much like AC buffs, health regen, dodge, parry, etc).  They may be tangentially related, but are not directly comparable.  I think this is why people tire of this topic - it's silly at best, but mostly just pointless.<br />

I really don't think shamans who apparently flamed or ignored you are to blame. Not everyone of them.<br />
<br />
You have to know that we are tired of seing here and there that we are overpowered, not to say unbalanced. tired of been flamed by people not even knowing our class, or how we can play it.<br />
<br />
Your first post, when i read it, told me &quot;you don't have any reason to complain about, these new heals are well suited&quot;.<br />
For many of us, it only was another of these endless discussions we don't want anymore, where we were facing another owner of &quot;that absolute truth we don't want to see&quot; :)<br />
<br />
Only later in your thread could i see you really wanted to know why we were asking for a 2 secs save in casting time, or a lesser cost in mana.<br />
even if you couldn't really understand, or if you doubted we wanted it for any good reasons.<br />
<br />
A really nice thread, written by someone playing a warrior (and a shaman i think, not sure), explained very well why this new heal is not efficient as a heal at this level of game for a shaman:<br />
- just have a look at Sithrax post, to understand why this heal is not efficient in group situation.<br />
- just imagine a 10 secs casting time for a heal while soloing, even a slowed mob, and tell me we will never get interrupts.<br />
- and i won't talk about raids, where we have to debuffs / dot / refresh debuffs / redot / ... at cost of a very high aggro, and many resists. we don't really have time to heal save as patch healers, for fast casting heals.<br />
<br />
So we only wanted to remind we are priests, and as priests we need to be efficient as healers.<br />
It's not whining. It's saying we are proud of what we are, and we want to do it well. Not to be the best at it, only to do it well.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You argued that slowing add to our heal habilities.<br />
i don't think so.<br />
<br />
slowing is a different thing, and that is debuffing.<br />
This is our realm, Shamans are debuffers, and are kings in this realm.<br />
<br />
Like Druids are Kings in movement realm. <br />
you get snare (you don't use it? it's your personnal choice. some shamans too are rooting/doting, but the higher their level the fewer they are to do so). you get harmonize to solo pull. you get habilities that will grant you faster speed than almost everything you choose to fight. and others to run from whatever you didn't choose to fight (evac). you can go to battle in a few seconds with tp to almost everywhere, where we have to run to a spire, sit for up to 15 minuts, then run again (when we don't have to wait for another tp in luclin). You can choose then find your prey with tracking, and even know exactly when your choosen prey pop in your zone.<br />
(in fact we slow damage rate of mobs while you try to annul it, to avoid any melee range with your foes)<br />
<br />
<br />
And as we have 2 different realms, we have different gear (druids being a leather class, not really suited for fighting &quot;IN TEH FACE&quot; while shamans are a chain class, heavily looking for HP gear as HP are our life and our mana), we have different tactics, using at best our different powers.<br />
<br />
<br />
In fact shamans and druids are really differents, two distant parents. but parents sharing some habilities we (in this community) wouldn't like to loose (don't forget that in our world<br />
after they became the celt we know and had druids to guide them, west european people had a nomadic way of life, and had shamans. druids are born of shamans!!).<br />
This is why we ask for these change.<br />
(but i doubt we'll ever get it, as i doubt we get anything that could have a chance according to VI to raise our already nice mana regen capacity. here is the true problem according to me)<br />

Returning to the Crucible to whine about this event instead of researching the boards to find out your answer, or posting a well thought out question minus the recount?<br />
<br />
Immature.<br />
<br />
My view that will hopefully help you answer your deep and unique question?<br />
<br />
Priceless.  (sorry had to be done :p)<br />
<br />
<br />
If we were to return to the days of before the new CHs, you would find druids and shaman carrying on as they normally do with our little bickering between both sides, but both relatively secure in the belief that we were deemed balanced classes, or at least, fairly equal and balanced overall versus each other.<br />
<br />
Now if you give one of these classes something and yet keep absolutely everything else about the two the exact same, you seem to be showing a certain amount of favoritism.  It indicates that you either thought more of the class you gave something to, or you're telling everyone that they were stupid and wrong and that things really weren't equal as you'd thought to begin with.<br />
<br />
Either way you insult.<br />
<br />
There's your answer.  Enjoy. <br />
<br />
Hmm. Your single word-supposed-to-sum-up-the-argument answers really don't fit the definitions you laid out for them.<br />
<br />
Your last statement hits one of points directly... one class was given something the other didn't have... I bet you can guess what it originally was.</div></div><hr />

Blah blah blah, heals, whatever. I'm a shaman, only time I heal something is if it's gunna die. In which case 10 seconds is too long.<br />
<br />
Moving on to some more amusing bits...<br />
[/i]<br />
<br />
Well, THAT was certainally silly. Rather like asking a bunch of gangsta rappers if they do anything by the Ramones. Now, you know better.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
True enough argument. Except when the critter is immune to changes in attack speed, really resistant, or just naturally fast as all hell. Maybe, if Warriors above level 58 were immune to druid heals, and all players had a chance of resisting a druid heal, or if characters with a regen spell only gained half the HP healed, THEN your argument would be 100% correct. For now, it's about 70% correct or so.<br />
<br />
[/b][/i]<br />
<br />
On hte healing ability? Well, I would say that Snare has a drastic effect on your ability to heal when soloing, and a well-placed evac can save your group as well as a CHeal can, without the aggro. What this fella was probably trying to convey was the relative power of the classes as a whole. You can't focus on just one peice of a class compared to another, because when you do, the class you start with will look badly underpowered. (Waaaaah, warriors nuke worse than wizards and heal worse than necromancers!). Get my drift?<br />
<br />
[/b][/i]<br />
<br />
Yup. Out of six possible shaman race / deity combinations, one has the ability to cast a short-lived snaredot that, being magic-based with little modifierto resist ability, will bounce off often enough. Out of six possible druid race / deity combinations, three can get a root necklace. All six can get clickable damage armor from Kunark, yet only five of six shaman combinations can do the same.  And don't forget, human and dark elf clerics can get the snare necklace with less factionwork. Items do NOT define balance, do they?<br />
<br />
[/b][/i]<br />
<br />
I beleive druids and wizards both benefit more from the Nexus than anyone else. Why? Because there's lots of people all waiting for fifteen minutes (half an hour in the case of Velious / Odus) to get to a place kinda near where they really want to go. Rest assured, there are more ports out of nexus via druid / wizard ride than my sitting on the speaker-shattering platforms.<br />
<br />
And again, don't bring up gear (especially high end tradeskill stuff) as part of &quot;class balance&quot;.<br />
<br />
[/i]<br />
<br />
Okay, we have a lot of shaman that will be reading this thread, I'm sure. So, I'm gonna ask something from you guys.<br />
<br />
Will every shaman that solos summoning mobs for experience in a &quot;grind&quot; kind of situation, please raise your hand? Thank you, kindly take your uber asses out of here and go kick some butt. The rest of you may read on.<br />
<br />
And, some more advice... Don't point towards &quot;The Truth&quot; on the castersrealms forum as someone who knows what he's talking about. I'm sure if you do a search, you can see where i've swatted him down many a time.<br />
<br />
[/i]<br />
<br />
Well... Why not? They still have rezzes and better-than-bard melee going for them, along with the best meaningful buffs in the game (Another show of hands - all of you without at least one stack of peridots on their person?). And, tell ya what, I'll think the spells are fair if the druid heal had it's casting cost brought up to 532, and the cast time increased to 13.5 seconds. That extra 1/3 healing power you guys get should be compensated for, yes? :)<br />
<br />
[/b][/i]<br />
<br />
Erm... That looks an awful lot like &quot;**** n00b shman u don know what u talk about dr00dz r00l&quot;. Am I happy for druids? Nope. Am I angry at druids? Nope. Am I indifferent? Yup. I still haven't seen druids giving up their quad-grinds in ME and Umbral to join groups as a healer. Nor would I expect most of them to know HOW to heal in a group. &quot;Uh oh, the tank's down by half a bub, better hit him with my big one! Aggro? Noooo! Dumb tank can't taunt, I'm gonna solo&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
Actually, I think we're becoming like those poor Bards. &quot;You're a... uhm... er... unique, uh... priest-like... er... class... thing! Kinda. Sorta. Sometimes&quot; [/B]<br />
<br />
Once again, I used the snare item as an example, sorry for not clarifying... again.<br />
<br />
And once again... I don't know who The Truth is, I was quoting shamans in the channel while playing EQ. Perhaps you missed that part.<br />

You may disagree with it.  But it sure as hell isn't unfounded.  Ask any class board out there.  The majority of druids are played by morons. <br />

Lesson 2:  If you are going to troll, take it to the brawl hall, or where you must.  NO ONE ON THIS BOARD CARES WHAT YOU THINK ANYMORE!<br />

<br />
Most shaman (myself included) considered themselves fairly well balanced with respect to druids. I'll give you an analogy of how we see this.  Two men walk into a restraunt together. They both order the same meal. One is given a meal that is only 2/3rds the size of the others. He is however expected to pay the same price and wait the same amount of time for his meal to be servered. Does this explain why shaman feel like we got the short end of the stick?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can at least understand that if I can slow a mob by 75% then I don't actually need as big a heal as I would otherwise need.  Whether this justifies the difference between druid/shammy heals is another matter: I at least understand that there is an argument to be made.<br />

Here's something I cut and pasted from the IRS website.  Feel free to quote it and make a useless comment underneath.<br />
<br />
The IRS, a branch of the Department of Treasury, deals directly with more Americans than any other institution, public or private. It also is one of the world's most efficient tax agencies. In 2000, the IRS collected more than $2 trillion in revenue and processed 226 million tax returns. It cost taxpayers 39-cents for each $100 collected by the IRS, the lowest cost/collection ratio since 1954.<br />
<br />
In 2000, the agency also assisted more than 100 million taxpayers who called the toll-free automated telephone line, wrote letters or visited one of the more than 400 offices the IRS maintains nationwide. Customer Service Representatives can be reached toll-free at 800-829-1040, Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Many  forms and publications are available on the IRS web site.</div></div><hr />

According to youl, you came to the Crucible looking for shaman viewpoints.<br />
<br />
I believe it's fair to say that you have found them.<br />
<br />
From the rest of your posts, it seems to me that you are trying to find ways to assert your viewpoints, which happen to be oppisit of the previously mentioned &quot;shaman viewpoints&quot;. So, at this point you are participating in a discussion, and not looking for shaman viewpoints. Unfortunately for you, this topic has been discussed quite thoroughly on the Crucible a few weeks ago, and also unfortunately for you, your arguements have been brought up, and then disproved.<br />
<br />
What you are doing now is not so much as debating, but repeating what's been said before while hoping for a different result.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but running headlong into a wall for the 5th time is going to have the same result as the 1st.<br />
<br />
I doubt being ignored was anything too personal, but imagin if someone comes up to you and insists upon talking about the 1988 presidential election saying the EXACT same thing that was said in 1988, how long would you tolerate it before to tune them out?<br />
<br />
The bottom line is, druids have strengths and shamans have a different set of strengths. In certain situations one set matters more than another, and it is annoying to have a equal cost heal that heals for 1k less. <br />
<br />
You spoke of ratios, but at the same time you ignored something simple, I'll assume unintentionally. If you really cared about ratios, you would be telling shamans that our heal should be 1950 and 265 mana, to be on par with the druid spell. I'm not entirely sure you missed something so obvious, but I suppose all of us make mistakes from time to time.<br />
<br />
In the end, you seem unwilling to change your views, and I doubt you can change many minds on the Cricuble by bringing up month old arguements, so let's just call it a day, eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u118"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p118">Sudda, you are either a troll or an idiot.  I made it to page 4 and had enough at that point.  You want a shaman point of view, look at Harvyst's first post, a excellent summary of why we are (mostly) not happy with the new heal.<br />
<br />
If thats not what your asking than clarify your request, so far it's been ambiguous at best.<br />
The question was, of course, how the shaman class felt about Kragg's Mending versus Tunare's Renewal. I felt that being able to talk to the people directly would help me understand better what the problem was.<br />
To reiterate what shaman have already said, the spell is significantly less effective than the druid heal, especially over time and the difference does not need to be so severe.  The differences between DS and slow have been covered by Harvyst so I won't repeat those views.  That answers your question. <br />
<br />
How do we feel about Kragg's, we like it, but we're insulted that our primary function is being factored into healing, while druid primary functions are being ignored which is a sure fire way to imbalance classes.  How the hell can you not see that with this new spell?  Abilities that were balanced till the spell was implemented, are now imbalanced.  The slow was there 2 expansions before the new slow, so why change now?<br />
<br />
If you want to look at solutions, MANY have been put forward, almost all so far have been noteworthy.  the best is the 8 second Kraggs and that STILL gives druids a better heal ratio.  In fact, in EXP groups where at best you're healing only 4 times in one pull, your spell shines more.  In raids, the extra 1k is HUGE on a tank, especially with rampage or AE damage.<br />
<br />
If for some reason this does not answer your question, rephrase it.  If you do not understand and see reason, then please delete your shaman and don't come here anymore.  Some shaman who can't yet actually cast the spell, understand.  Troll elsewhere please.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are right, I do now understand the shaman viewpoint a little better. I came here thinking that shamans were frustrated because their heal was 1k less than druids. But it turns out that is not why, shamans are frustrated because it still costs the same mana and has the same cast time. After realizing this, I tried to say that shamans can slow, therefore making it more efficient to heal. And I learned that shamans hate having their class defining ability factored into their ability to heal. <br />
<br />
What would you guys consider the druid class defining ability to be? Our ability to quad doesn't seem like a resonable answer since wizards are better (are enchanters better slowers than shamans? this I do not know.) and the fact that a lot of druids do not choose to quad because root rotting is so much safer.<br />

If you really cared about ratios, you would be telling shamans that our heal should be 1950 and 265 mana, to be on par with the druid spell. I'm not entirely sure you missed something so obvious, but I suppose all of us make mistakes from time to time.<br />

Was definitely a mistake, sorry about that.<br />

OK here goes, trying to sum up everything in ONE post so I don't piss off more people. If I forget someone's point, sorry :( <br />
<br />
Tarthug - I don't think you realize that it took me awhile to actually get to the point of understanding why.<br />
<br />
Gloriana - Obviously you continue to check this thread. I am sorry that you cannot tell the difference between a troll and someone who is actually curious and willing to learn.<br />
<br />
Genine - I don't know what server you are from, but Tarew Marr is full of power gaming druids (or druid bots). And as some of you said, the fastest way for a druid to level is to quad. Some of us play for enjoyment and wish the social interaction with other people. There is hardly any druids in zones like sebilis, velks, ME, or some such place who are actually LFG. If you don't know, in such zones when a druid does &quot;/ooc level ** druid LFG&quot; the druid is almost immediately flooded with tells to port someone somewhere.<br />
<br />
Fenril - Perhaps KM and TR were given to both classes as they are to encourage grouping. Tell me, would you rather have a class that can heal for 2k and slow, or another class that could only heal for 2k in your group? (saying that TR=KM)<br />
<br />
Geal - Yes I believe it was done for balancing issues.<br />
<br />
Racknar - My intention was not to &quot;troll&quot; sorry about it coming off as that. When you said &quot;noobish board behavior&quot; sorry that it came off as that as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: How was that? Better? Not as annoying?</div></div><hr />

Problem with that is shaman are not the only class that can slow. We may be the best at it and the ones that commonly do it but we aren't the only ones. Consider the fact that 2 of the other slowers out there are also the classes that provide mana regen and crowd control both things that groups usually want. Assuming the group has grabbed a bard or enchanter to provide crowd control and mana regen which do you think they would prefer, a 2k heal or a 3k heal given everything else about the heal is the same. <br />
<br />
Not to mention that druid stacks alot better with bards and enchanters than shaman do. DS stacked with bard ds definitely contributes some major dmg. Druids nuke better, dot well, have evac if things go really bad and snare and stuns to help prevent it from going bad. Druids can even add to the entire groups mana regen.<br />
<br />
And to expand a little bit on my last post since I kinda ran out of time and had to go home from work before i really finished it =)<br />
<br />
Now that verant has finally address shaman and druid healing vs clerics they really need to actually go all the way and give shaman and druids appropriate heals at all lvls of the game. The only way to do that with out just giving us a compleate clone of ch is to give us several different spells that scale up in volume and efficiency to keep us at the right range compaired to clerics.<br />
<br />
At lvl 58 2k heal, Store bought just like KM is currently.<br />
<br />
AT lvl 60 a 3k heal, dropped of mobs and no drop spell. I see it being added as another drop on any mob that can drop a glowing orb of luclinite as an extra drop just like the orb. Make 2 different spells for shaman and druid if you want but make them both heal and cost the same thing. The no drop is so that the spell can't be sold in the bazaar and become commonly availble to everyone who can spend the time to just get to lvl 60 but it should be common enough that anyone who actually spends time raiding reasonable targets should be able to get.<br />
<br />
At lvl 60 again or maybe 61-62 after pop comes out a 4k heal off the appropriate difficulty mobs. With several 7k+ tanks in my guild and that easily passing 8 or 9k with pop's lvls, raise in stat cap and aa abilitys a 2k heal is going to be just as broke as a 600 point heal is on your average lvl 58 tank.</div></div><hr />

Every server that I have heard of has problems with level 50+ pickup groups. Seb and ME on Karana, my server, is basically bring your own group.  Most people go LFG there for 1+ hour before they just finally give up. I have heard the same from many other people on many different servers. That is what guilds are for. So the problem with getting a group is not just a druid problem in the zones you specify, but one of anybody looking for a pickup group in any zone.<br />
<br />
And as far as druids getting begged for ports when you /ooc lfg, how about saying no and /ooc again.<br />
<br />
I have several druids in my guild and we all group almost daily. I have other shaman in my guild, we almost never group. Two druids in a group are good, two shaman in a group.....just doesn't happen.<br />
<br />
Any class above 50 have a hard time getting into pick-up groups. Period.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You seem to be stuck on the fact that shaman are the only class that can slow. Enchanters? Bards? Not to mention the warriors and other classes that get weapons that proc it regularly. If you consider slow our class-defining ability and factor it (Keep in mind, bards, enchanters, etc can also so nearly as well) into the healing efficiency equasion, then you have to factor your class defining abilities into the healing efficiency equasion too. <br />
<br />
I have not seen this done yet. You continue to insist that slows make heals more efficient. This may be true, but you have to realize that you are not factoring in your class defining abilities into that equasion at the same time. There simply is no reason to have a shaman when an enchanter can mez and slow and regen mana and stun, and a druid can heal for 1k more than a shaman, not to mention they can DS and Evac and add extra mana regen, hp and ac with PoTC and PoTG and nuke (although i admit i dont see many druids nuke, but their nukes are a hell of a lot better than shaman ones). Half the time in exp groups we cant dot cause of mezes, and our dots are our best form of damage output.<br />
<br />
So, where does that leave us? Pretty much no where. We have a pet (so do druids), We can buff stats which really dont mean anything in the long run, and we can heal for 1k less in the same time and for the same casting cost as a druid.<br />
<br />
Doesn't make sense.</div></div><hr />

I wish someone would put up a web page of &quot;good&quot; gear that can be quested, etc. I use Allakzahm's search engine, but it loves to pull up Veeshan's Peak Stuff and Sleeper's Tomb stuff...

Part of the problem with checking other's profiles, which I do do, is you have to find out where they got this or that item, which means cross-searching with the allakazam site, and finding out what is actually doable with a mid level guild, what isn't uber rare, etc.<br />

Refusing to consider any druid abilities because people cant pick one 'class defining' one...  You have to look at the big picture, there's simply no other way to do it.<br />
<br />
Even with no other slowers around, in many situations, druids being able to give mana+hp regen, hp buffs, tracking, harmony pulling, evacs when needed, or even just easier travel to/from the raid is enough to take them over a shaman in many situations.  Now throw in the fact that your heal is vastly more efficient, and if one of several other slowing classes is along on the raid already, why exactly would they pick a shaman to come?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am trying to see the big picture. Truly trying. There isn't a druid defining ability, to my knowledge. Druids can do other things that classes can do to a lesser extent. Shamans have already stated that slowing is their class defining ability, so I use that. <br />
<br />
DoT stacking, are all shaman buffs debuffs as well? That is a reason to bring shamans along on raids.<br />
<br />
Yes, I agree with you that druids' heal by itself is more efficient. HP+Mana regen buffs mean nothing with an Aego capable cleric at a raid.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u145"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p145">If you're not considering any other slowing classes, then I guess this is about soloing.  That's the only valid way you can ignore them.  For soloing, personally, I could care less about the new heal.  Torpor is more efficient.  <br />
<br />
Limiting any grouping discussion to priests merely helps support your argument, while diminishing ours, so it's mighty convenient for you.  So I guess what were're arguing is if 5 clerics wanted a 6th member, would they take a shaman or a druid, because otherwise, non-priests are involved.  Or is your true subset priests, melees, int casters, and hybrids, but not bards, chanters, or anybody that has anything that procs slow?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u146"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p146">Well, I read through the entire first page..<br />

If slows make up for shaman getting the heal as it is, what about that time and mana it takes to cast a slow?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now unless you have ANY SINGLE VALUABLE argument why shaman must have the same mana cost, the same casting time on a semi-ch like druids but heal for 1k less, no need to requote me.<br />
<br />
In raid where this heal could be usefull, when the slow land on the mob, does it impact only the damages taken by the melee I heal ? Hell no, it's the same for you, the shaman slow but anyone take profit. Your point is plain wrong and our heal just an insult.<br />
<br />
In solo, well you are solo, so no slow but you have snare. Oh don't tell me that a lot of mobs are unsnarable, cuz a lot of mobs are unslowable as well. As I said in my previous post. Shamans slow and tank, Druids snare and quad kites like wizards.<br />
Well, I still wait a wiz comming here whining that we can slow and tank while they only can quad kite with no healing power.<br />
<br />
In group mode, shamans slow yes, so? Would you like someone who can slow and heal a bit less than you or someone who can slow and KEI you ?<br />
<br />
Oh last note, I bought KM, I tested it... I deleted it, Torpor is still more mana efficient imo as I barely never heal someone for the full potential 1950 hps and in urge when 10 secs is damn too long, Torpor still stack with chloroblast. Not mana efficient but extremely useful to let the cleric do a real CH.</div></div><hr />

That poster &quot;Slowd&quot; supposably revealed himself to be working to TEACH us a lesson concerning issues about manners.   Then this post follows principally railing on Gloriana for her /ignoring the poster on similar line of thought ... aka manners (coincidence?)   The typing on this post appears close to the  same style, grammar, sentence structure, and spelling as the others ... only differing slightly in tone ( the main revealing factor for dealing with a Sock Puppet ).

These are people post on on-line boards with topic's to not only gather attention but do so for attention and effect.    To continue things as long as possible they take on multiple identities for the purpose of support and delusion of the post.

Not sure why it wasn't e-mailing you, don't think anyone else has mentioned it, but I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe I'll create some random sign-ons and see what happens.  You guys realize I have to read all of this, right?  I'd considered locking it but then I'd just have to read a second, newer thread :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u167"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p167">Find it rather amusing you're trying to justify yourself in this thread as opposed to that one.  As I recall, you did not endeavour further defending yourself at that time.<br />
<br />
In addition, that was one of the only 2 statements you made in that reply, so it's nice and dandy to construct 2 rather coherent paragraphs in this thread, but you can't really rely on context to boost your self-worth, especially given the fact that statement 1 and 2 had nothing to do with one another.<br />
<br />
Look at your prior replies within the same thread too.  You were complaining about the same mana cost of druid vs shaman heal when druid one heals substantially more.  Then in your final reply, again with the following:The fact we regen mana faster was already countered by giving druids buffs that speed their mana regen<br />
<br />
If there's any context involved, your prior posts would qualify as  just that, and since you were complaining about mana cost in the first place, I could only logically assume that you were giving too much credit to druid mana regen, thus why I paraphrased what you conveyed to say druid mana regen = shaman mana regen.  The verb to counter pretty much corroborates my claim too.<br />
<br />
If it had been a conversation, I would have said it and you would have said shaman and druids do not regen mana the same! And I would have said, no, that's not what I meant.<br />
<br />
That's funny, I replied to your post myself.  Said &quot;Canni &gt; PoTG and whatever wolf/treeform they can use outdoors /laugh&quot;.  Did you bother telling &quot;that's not what I meant&quot; then? <br />

your point of view is moronic slows + heals do NOT equal out the 2 damn spells &lt;period&gt; thats as dumb as saying your fricken heals are better when you solo cause you can snare and just stay away from the mob. You  are just jealeous cause you cant slow .  FINE take my slows, give me your all your ports. what? cant hear you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are really interested in understanding the comparasation between Shaman and Druids and why they ought to have comparable heals Suddha, you can give me a tell with your character on Solusek. In a dialog it might be easier to discuss than on message boards, where the timeframe between answers is too large (if one doesnt check the boards every few minutes like you do ;)).<br />
<br />
Its hard to distinguish a troll from someone who just doesnt get it, and if you were trolled enough in the past you assume the former. So I understand the reason why everybody puts you on ignore, because you are kind of single minded in your argumentations.<br />
<br />
You keep asking what the defining ability for Druids is, not understanding that being very good at some things can be better than being the best at one thing. Group composition is very situational. If a sixth spot is open, the healing ability alone doesnt decide. Do you need more healing power, do you need more offensive power, will you have to deal with many mobs or will it be mostly single pulls against harder mobs. Do you have healer mobs, will you expect surprises, is ghetto mezzing possible etc etc.<br />
<br />
Your take is that Druids and Shaman compete for the same group spot, which frankly we seldom do. Druids take the damage dealer position quite often, something we cant even think about competing with. They compete more with Wizards than with Shaman. They compete more with Clerics than with Shaman. In a challenging situation Shaman dont have the time to play main healer anyway. If we have, it is a boring, nonchallenging XP-grind. And BOTH Druids and Shaman make better XP solo than in those grinds.<br />
<br />
Most of the time, as a Shaman you cant neglect your duties (the expected ones) to be locked in a chain of crappy 10sec heals. You have to slow, you have to debuff, you have to rebuff, you have to regain your mana. The only heal Shaman need in their line of work (apart from raids I guess) is a quick spotheal to save a caster until the Cleric/Druid has the healing under control again.<br />
<br />
The solution would have been an easy one. You are right in that Shaman and Druids dont need the same heal for the same mana cost and same cast time. Giving us 1000hp less for the same heal was an insult nontheless, and one that could be avoided easily.<br />
<br />
We simply cant have the same ratio as the Druid heal. It would make our Mana regeneration insane. Therefore, we never asked for that.<br />
<br />
So, you cant have the same hp for the same mana and the same casttime for obvious reasons. So, you could lower the casttime along wil less hp healed (most wanted change here, which fits our playstyle the best). Or we could have a worse ratio by upping the mana cost for the same hp.<br />
<br />
The point is (and Gloriana wrote that more than once, so thats why the Suddha might be a troll part is from) that you cant have exactly the same spell with only one part significantly worse. You can make it worse in one aspect if you make it better in another. And you can make it so that the ratio is worse. Druids can have a heal that makes them the mainhealer in groups for some situations (well, now its most situations, but thats a balancing question Druds vs Clerics). We just dont want the same heal gimped, we want a spot heal that can replace Chloroblast in higher levels and can save Enchanters on the spot for a short time when the Mainhealer (Cleric/Druid) is busy. <br />
<br />
If you want to discuss why it is unfair to not have a comparable heal (with all three components put together) give me a tell on Solro and Ill try to explain. Dont press that point on the boards any further though, its the wrong medium at this point.</div></div><hr />

The problem is not with having a druid main, nor having a shaman alt.. but rather that tiresome comparison between class X and the shaman class on the shaman boards. Especially of it's whining that shaman are better (we know shaman are the best class but that's not due to the abilities, rather the people that play the shaman class).<br />
<br />
I have no trouble with a post asking about shaman matters - even asking if there is an equivalent shaman way of doing things like class X can - learning is something I will never frown upon.<br />
<br />
I too can appreciate constructive addition to posts by other classes for example when talking or discussing game balance (such as mod rods).<br />
<br />
However shaman really have experienced the whine and being the butt of all comparisons since that game came out.. it's old hat and really doesn't belong on these boards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well lets start off with something here. You do know how much slow is resisted at levle 58 right ?<br />
<br />
Your argument here is that shamans get slow so this makes us more effective healers. I dont understand your logic , cause you get snare and damage shield which in effect lowers the damage dished out to a Melee cause the target is dieing fast. Not all that different to how our slows reduce the damage taken to a take , though ours is more effetive i cant argue. however your snare alows for alot more effectivness to be added to this equation by proding slowed movement and kiting abilities that is invauluable.<br />
<br />
You claim to play a shaman and i have no doubt you enjoy it and are probly quite good at it , but i have the feeling you havent experienced the high end of the shaman. <br />
<br />
i say this cause only cause i feel your not taking into account the level in which this spell somes to us. 58.  Think about that. 58.<br />
<br />
This is a level where ALOT of things are resisting our slows. In fact it could be argued that you are MORE effective at this level cause your damage shields are casted on the tanks which dont resist them :p.   not to mention you get one of the best spells in the game &quot;evac&quot;. If your telling me this is not as vauluable as any spell in the shaman line up ... well i dunno what to tell you without  a insult involved :-\<br />
<br />
Im happy for the druids , infact the argument isnt that they dont deserve it. We are want the druids to have a role and to take the healing off our backs cause we arent clerics and most of us dont like that role. The arguement is that our heal is not balanced wiht the druids. We dont even want the same heal i think alot of us are very happy with it, we simply want a relitive mana/cast time ratio. I think this is very far and more to the point , more suited to a shaman. Heck keep it the same mana cost if you need to feel satisfied , i think the real grip here anyway is the casting time. 6-8 second cast time would make me ALOT happier with this spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u202"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p202">Originally posted by Sithrax <br />
<br />
<br />
Are you SURE you read the post thoroughly? And bothered to think about it? Let's do some math.<br />
<br />
Cleric CH = 10k for 400 mana, 10 sec cast<br />
Druid CH = 2950 for 400 mana, 10 sec cast<br />
Shaman CH = 1950 for 400 mana, 10 sec cast<br />
<br />
So... imagine we're grinding xp in UP. You have a warrior with about 5500 HP buffed (decent gear, nothing phenomenal). Assume we all begin casting our heals with the tank at 30% health:<br />
<br />
Cleric heals 3850 hp in 10 sec for 400 mana<br />
9.625 hp/mana, 385 hp/sec healed<br />
<br />
Druid heals 2950 hp in 10 sec for 400 mana<br />
7.375 hp/mana, 295 hp/sec healed<br />
<br />
Shaman heals 1950 hp in 10 sec for 400 mana<br />
4.875 hp/mana, 195 hp/sec healed<br />
<br />
Who's getting close to cleric efficiency? Certainly not the shaman. These numbers get better for the cleric as the tank gets more HP, of course.<br />
<br />
Now, if you reduced the cast time and/or mana cost on Kragg's mending:<br />
<br />
Shaman heals 1950 hp in 8 sec for 400 mana<br />
4.875 hp/mana, 243.75 hp/sec healed<br />
<br />
Shaman heals 1950 hp in 10 sec for 300 mana<br />
6.5 hp/mana, 195 hp/sec healed<br />
<br />
None of this is even coming close to cleric healing, either in terms of hp/mana or hp/sec. It's still worse than druid healing, but at least the difference isn't so egregious. Is this making our objections clearer to you?<br />
<br />
Next time you come on a SHAMAN messageboard or a SHAMAN channel and try to tell us what we need or don't need, please do us the courtesy of coming up with a cogent argument. <br />

Didn't leave with a bang, was more like a spur of the moment thing where I just decided not to play the game anymore because of school and extra curricular activities :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u208"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p208">Someone PLEASE point out the obvious contradiction contained in the two quotes above! Please! <br />
<br />
You're arguing for the sake of arguing Hrothgar, there is no inherent contradiction to be found in those 2 quotes.  I never pretended to be a Crucible veteran.  I've contributed a little, both in advice and money, but I'm not putting myself on the pedestal as I know others have contributed much more.  <br />
<br />
And as much as I'd like to explain my reasoning, there's really no point since my beef with Glori is over and that analogy is no longer valid.  Not like I hated her with a passion, more like I didn't see eye to eye with her, but after all, this is cyberworld, and holding never-ending grudges against someone you don't know personally, over a few statements I happened to disagree with, is kinda dumb :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u209"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p209">You pointed out your own contradiction.  Good for you. Here is your cookie.  Sure you never stated you were a veteran but your &quot;tone&quot; was the same of that you were arguing against (&quot;stuck up&quot;).  I just found that hypocritical tone amusing is all.  Enjoy your cookie!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u210"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p210">Putting words in my mouth is one thing (in fact I'd prefer that cookie), but now you're accusing me of using a tone you have this magical hunch on?

<br />
That last bit was a paradox btw, not a flat-out contradiction :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh now you're interpreting what I conveyed to say &quot;I didn't mean to be stuckup?&quot;  I wasn't being stuckup, slight difference, and as much as you're entitled to your own opinions, you're cramming words into my mouth.  Cause if I didn't mean to be stuckup entails that I could have been stuckup, but that I didn't intend on it.  <br />
<br />
You're prolly gunna tell yourself &quot;Exactly!&quot;, but remember you're the one who told me that I myself &quot;can go back and say well i didnt mean to be stuck up &quot;, and I never did say that.<br />
<br />
Oh, and let's look at this particular gem:<br />
(the more reasonable interpritation)<br />
<br />
There's reason in the word reasonable, and all you're going on is a hunch; that's the last thing I would call reasonable.<br />
<br />
Now leave me alone.<br />
