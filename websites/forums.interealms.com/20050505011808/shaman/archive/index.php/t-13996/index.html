<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Melchezedek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I've seen lots of threads on 2 boxing with melee currently 2 boxing SK/Froggie Shaman :) but I've thought about boxing something else with the shaman for when I want a change of pace. So I was looking for some suggestions. I've ruled out Necro just because they are a bit too close to home with the sk being the sk's parent class. So it's basically between mage or enchanter. Mage would prob. be the easiest to box with just send in pet, nuke when mana allows basically making the shaman the primary of the box. With enchanter I think it would be the other way around with the chanter being the primary since eventually the most efficent exp would be charming I would figure although I don't know how viable that is anymore since most enchanters I know charmed with a druid or cleric and not a shaman. I also don't know how much the changes to charm have effected the charm solo seen. So any opinions/experiences with this would be welcome...<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Enchanters aren't that hard to box with a shaman, just nuke once or twice a mob, if two or more come start slowing one and mez the other.  You can do neat stuff like start slow, switch over and tash, and then go back to the shaman before slow finishes too if you've got a pally or sk tank and save yourself a long slow malo cast.<br />
<br />
With as easy as POP is to single there's very minimal work on the chanter.  You can also group the two, invis the shaman, and charm solo with the chanter for pretty decent xp for both.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wizards get snare.  Yes, its an AE snare that doesnt last long, but with alpha pup and Nukes galore how long do you need?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drajjen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You really can't compare a necro and SK.  While the necro is the parent class it still makes no real difference.  I group with a necro friend of mine and I can tell you a necro/Shaman duo just plain rocks.  <br />
<br />
Necro's really don't have to worry about mana regen, and when the shaman slow's the mob, there pet goes to town on them.  Granted, it may be the same with the mage but the mage is going to have to wait on mana where the necro won't.<br />
<br />
As far as an enchanter, that may be a good choice, but once again I would go with the necro because of the pet.  I have only been killed once with the necro pet tuanting, and that was because it was a summoning mob who really didn't like the fact that I slowed him.<br />

ROFL sad but true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>JomoMojo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've really enjoyed my shaman / magician combo.  The auto root feature of the earth pet is really nice.  Its really easy to buff up 2 pets, send them at a debuffed mob and then hit the mob with a nuke or two.<br />
<br />
Since the pets keep my primary target occupied I can use my shaman to do some ghetto crowd control or line up the next mob to kill.<br />
<br />
With call of the hero on the mage I can make my life easier traveling and pulling mobs.<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to when my mage can summon high level pet gear.<br />
<br />
Once flagged for some of the higher level tiers I can aggro kite using the backstabbing water pet and shaman pets, which speeds things up a lot.  My shaman has several mage friends who I often duo with, quick way to get some AA XP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">necro would be great to 2 box, with other classes you will have to wait for them to regen mana, with a necro pop on a regen and hes gtg =) plus all your DoTs will stack and you get another pet to help chew through the mobs. They have snare, can FD pull if needed, mez, hell even summon corpse and rez for 93% if you get in a bind.</div></div><hr />
