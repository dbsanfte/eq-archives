over 1 minute, for a 60 rogue, a 60 shaman, and a 58 shaman, to kill one goddamn paladin. No talent whatsoever, shield, heal, loh, shield, whatever, it is pissing me off. If he was alone, fine, but of course, 1 minute into the fight, 5 screaming alliance brats come running.<br />

<br />
Sorry, but Rogues don't get to insta-kill anybody (except maybe cloth classes).  Your desire to PWN Paladins is bordering on the obsessive. Oh btw, how many of you did he kill?<br />
<br />
I can answer that with 100 % certainty - NONE.<br />
<br />
Roll up a Paladin. Play it for awhile. Duel people of your level.  &quot;Nerfed into oblivion?&quot;  What are you going to nerf next? Their shields? Make them wear cloth? Take away their healing?<br />
<br />
Paladins on my server are re-rolling left and right. It wasn't the SotC nerf, it was the accompanying 15-30% DPS nerf that came on top.<br />
<br />
Don't worry Mill. Another class IS due to get nerfed. <br />

Rogues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I wouldn't be talking about another class being overpowered when you play a rogue mill, honestly.  You can walk up to anyone without consequence.  Kill them while they are fighting an NPC, and then retreat so they can't seek revenge against you.  I'm sorry but rogues piss me off a lot more than paladins do.  BTW did the paladin get even close to killing one of you?  If the answer is yes, you need to improve your group.  paladins are perfectly balanced as far as I'm concerned now.  <br />
<br />
BTW do your shamans know what earth shock and purge are?  They gimp any paladin.  Tell your shamans to purge their melee shield.</div></div><hr />

Well rogues are overpowered in being able to kill people in PvP and you chose that, it's only natural some people would choose a class that's over powered in being hard to kill in PvP. You can't blame him. You both chose over powered classes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kolmirg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Mill, this may be a crazy idea, but have you ever considered just leaving the paladins alone? If it takes so much effort to down one in pvp, then why bother?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">From someone who is tossing his L51 paladin off a bridge other than on instance runs to play a rogue, I find Mill's conclusions hilarious.  My rogue levels on normal exp 50% faster than my paladin in blue exp. I find it humorous that someone who plays a rogue combat build (ss + evis = sum total of their play experience) says that a paladin (equally bland) is easy.<br />
<br />
Do you know how many quests you can cheese with stealth alone? And how about the extra coin/loot from pickpocket? How about cc with sap? How about fights that are lucky to last 10 sec?<br />
<br />
I'm a backstab/ambush build that revolves around remorselessness for grinding.  At L29 using this build I have 85% chance to crit backstab on my first attack, 55% using ambush.  When I get my ambush talents done this will be 95% chance to crit.  <br />
<br />
Here's a typical fight for me on my L29 rogue: stealth, ambush. If I get a crit, mob is at 50% health or below (I haven't gotten hit yet). If not, I hit sinister strike twice and drop an evis. Mob if not dead is damn close.  Don't forget I'm using instant dd poisons that stack with weapon enchants and go off 20% of the time per swing. Okay, so mob is now dead. I have 20 seconds to attack another mob, during which time remorselessness gives me an additional 40% chance to crit.  So I right click loot, haul ass to next mob, stealth and drop an ambush.  Since I now have 55% chance to crit it goes off all the time.  Mobs are lucky to live longer than 8 seconds with this build.  <br />
<br />
It honestly feels like I am cheating and I don't have nearly all the talents that make this build shine yet.  The only &quot;downside&quot; to this grind style is that I kill so fast I don't have time to pickpocket. As someone who was used to fights lasting 45 seconds, 8 seconds is a refreshing change of pace.<br />
<br />
I have finally found the class that replicates the feeling I had playing a prenerf closed beta mage.  I have a sheepish grin on my face at all times.<br />
<br />
But let's get back on topic: paladins are overpowered. Rogues, which can gank every single other class with ease and level the fastest in PVE, are perfectly balanced.</div></div><hr />

Wow, you had two shamans, that means you can completely stop him from casting ANY heal when he's not using divine shield.  Guess that does absolutely nothing ?</div></div><hr />

Two shields and one is purgabl. After the 10 second one what were the shaman doing? What were you doing to stop his heal for that matter? 5 point kideny shot stuns for what 5/6 seconds. Kick can stop a cast and improved kick is a 2 second silence.  Sure you arent trying to just overpower and getting pissed that it isnt working?</div></div><hr />

well at least cappi seeps showing how much of a ****ing idiot it is.<br />
<br />
What exactly, you idiots, should people be doing when there is only one paladin, leaving them alone? Gee, not like we didn't know they were just buying time to call in the rest of their alliance crew eh?<br />
<br />
Alliance are no talent putzes, pure and simple. We still gave better then we got, because we have skill.<br />

Iz, time to shut the **** up about your rogue, you have no clue what anything means above level 40 for christs sake. Christ, yes you may be able to kick ass in Ragefire or Wailing caverns, when you can fight in pvp let me know, oh that's right, you don't pvp. Shutup and leave.<br />

Perhaps tone down the anti-paladin rhetoric a bit.  They are not &quot;easy mode&quot; by any stretch of the imagination. What's easier- an 8 second fight or a 45 second fight? And don't give me this &quot;I don't know because I'm only L30&quot; crap. Our 56 rogue is killing at the same pace at his level. Please.<br />
<br />
I think the difference is that instead of bitching about how beyond overpowered and out of control rogues are, I simply rolled one to partake in the abuse.  If paladins are so great- roll one. I can't wait to see your response when you take 45 secs to kill an even con wearing full instance gear.</div></div><hr />

Why aren't you whining about warriors, they wear plate too, hell they do a lot more DPS too.  Are you whining about having to wait 8-12 seconds for their shield to end before &quot;pwning&quot; him?  It's called being a defensive class, they stay alive long, wow.  I used to bitch a little about paladins but then I learned to deal with them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mill, get off your cross. I play a troll rogue on a high pop server. I have a pretty damn good idea of how things are, and they are nowhere near the crap you report. <br />
<br />
My guess is that while drunk you charged some paladin using your two button combo and got your ass handed to you. Not knowing how to deal with your rage and being a drunken buffoon you of course post this stupid crap. Sobered up you realize what an ass you're being but due to some defect in your brain you feel forced to defend it no matter ridiculous it is.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Dunno what server you're on but everytime I've run into a paladin solo, it's just solo.  Perhaps they do call for zerg backup but I've hardly ever been zerged out of no where while fighting alliance, unless there are alliance in the immediate area that can see what's happening.  <br />
<br />
Fighting a paladin as a rogue is just being able to outlast them until they run out of mana.  When they invuln shield, back off and bandage and restealth.  When they pop that 2nd melee immunity aura or whatever, back off restealth.  If/when they lay hands run away and restealth.  Preparation comes in handy here where it gives you 2x cb,blind,evasion,vanish.  Again, it's all about outlasting their mana.  If backup arrives for them, run away /shrug<br />
<br />
You really shouldn't be using evisercate on plate classes.  Rupture does better damage over time.  Also rupture can't be cleansed or dispelled.</div></div><hr />

But my premise still stands, even a completely untalanted Paladin is a tank when it comes to pvp, only a few buttons to use, period. Difference between a well played and a horrible Paladin isn't much, usually just gear, and if they are cool enough to have friend in the zone.<br />
<br />
Now a well played shaman is a brute, a poorly played one is easy as hell to kill.<br />
<br />
And yes, taken into account it is alliance only, the paladin is the most played class.</div></div><hr />

If we are talking alliance only (as Mill has stated a couple of times) then Hunters and Paladins are easily the two most common classes (with Hunters being first).  The only 'real' data I could find was on wowcensus, and my in-game experience matches it.</div></div><hr />

people still missing the point here, taken into account realm only class, Paladin is the most played class. Multiply Paladin population by two if you want to compare it to all classes.<br />

112K Alliance Warriors<br />
93K Alliance Mages<br />

2200 Hunters<br />
1700 Paladins<br />
1400 Rogues<br />
and the trend continues just like the overall numbers...more Hunters than Warlocks and Priests combined.  I was personally suprised that there were more Druids than Warlocks / Priests.<br />

Personal perception:  If I see a player with a pet, chances are he's a night elf.  If I see a dwarf, chances are he's a paladin.  I still never see any druids.  :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
sigh.... paladin is available only to one realm, same with shamans, so saying &quot;more people play rogues than pallies&quot; is silly, because you get two factions playing rogues. Yes more people play them overall, but they are a big, big percentage of the alliance. It isn't really fair to give % to classes that exist on only one side and compare them to classes that exist on both.<br />
<br />
More paladins are played than any class on the horde side, total.<br />
<br />
I was surprised alliance has more hunters then paladins, but if you averaged the population between realms, horde and alliance, you see what I am getting at?<br />
<br />
So I guess hunters for the win, paladins a close second, warriors,and then rogues.<br />
<br />
<br />
They really need another plate class on the Horde side. We are always looking for warriors for instances. Maybe, oh I don't know, just off the top of my head here.....Shadowknights?<br />
<br />
really surprised, considering warcraft lore, no Death Knights, they were the anti-Paladin class I think. Alliance has more than double the plate wearers the horde has as it is.<br />
<br />
I may not be expressing myself right here. 200k people play paladins, that is alot, alot of people.</div></div><hr />

So with a 1.7 to 1 ratio a doubling the number of rogues would actually not show a proper spread, instead you should add the 199k with 10/17*199k giving an actual number is around 316k. <br />
Draw your own conclusions, but with your trackrecord I'd be careful not making small mistakes like that, it may be seen as an attempt to make the numbers show what you want them to show ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">You know what Mill, screw you. Trying to reason with you is like teaching a cow to ride a bike. So I am just going to say - if you have no clue how to play a paladin, or what it is to play a paladin, then just plain and simply shut the f... rikkin up.<br />
<br />
So pathetic to see these whines about &quot;paladins have no skills and need no talent to play&quot;. If you don't know anything about the paladins, then just don't say anything, makes you look smarter. Situation what you described shows how stupid the group you were with was. Not to mention that &quot;fight for OVER 1 minute&quot; is actually showing that the paladin HAD the SKILL, because the shields are active for 20 seconds max. Basically, this meant that:<br />
<br />
No talent whatsoever, shield, heal, loh, shield, whatever, it is pissing me off <br />
<br />
1) Your team damages the paladin, forcing him to pop the shield up;<br />
2) Paladin does zero damage while shield is up, because he heals and that takes just as much time as the shield lasts;<br />
3) Your team damages the paladin considerably, so he uses LOH because heal wouldn't cut here anymore - paladin is at 0 mana;<br />
4) Your team attacks 0 mana paladin, who still survives enough to actually gain enough mana to slap on another shield - note that he would have never got enough mana to cast any other heal before the shiled would have went down;<br />
<br />
As far as I can tell, your team was pretty skillless. And I am 100% sure that during that whole time, the paladin didn't even bring anyone's health in your team down to 75% for good. What, was your rogue SLEEPING? Unable to find the key for Gouge attack to stun the paladin? Use stunning poisons?? 2 frikkin' shamans can't stop paladin from casting, slap mana drain DoT's on?<br />
<br />
Note that all the action described above, from paladin side, means 30 sec of activity, so if that paladin actually survived for more then 1 minute, then he had more talent and skill then your team alltogether. Especially after that paladin used the second shield after LOH, which means that after 8 seconds (as the other one he used is a targettable group one and lasts 8 seconds) the shield went down and paladin had no mana for practically anything, max for popping up some Seal - so for next 30-40+ seconds (as you said, fight went for over a minute) the manaless paladin, no shields, no LOH, still survived the attack of 3 until reinforcements came, has no skills and takes no talent? Send that rogue and shamans back to training, they haven't got a clue about their abilities, apparently. Especially rogue. I know lvl 30-40 rogues who perform much better.</div></div><hr />

When I played a paladin, as I got later levels of LoH, you actually get back a certain amount of mana on the higher level LoHs.

Shaman have no mana drain DoTs or any mana drain spells at all.  Best they could have done (RE: should have done) was chain earthshock, but that would have still given the pally 1-2 seconds to cast and would have depended on perfect rotation of shocks, also would rely on rogue to snare.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">the answer is insanely simple Millman. People want to play warriors (in your face up front dudes with lots of sharp **** and armor). On alliance they start as a warrior and realize warrior blow chunks. Then they try paladins and get an inaccurate impression that paladins are overpowered because they have just come from THE WEAKEST CLASS in the game... literally any class feels overpowered compared to warrior. So alot of alliance stay with thier paladin.<br />
<br />
On horde... you guys don't have any other real choice... You have warrior or... rogue... shaman are more of a caster class so anyone with a thing about not wanting to play a caster will not be satisfied with them.<br />
<br />
What does both sides have in common? A weak warrior class. Improve warrior defense in ALL stances so they have considerable survivability again and they will DWARF the other classes in the game.<br />
<br />
For this same reason.. If they created a monk style class or option for priests there would be a considerable amount of them as well. <br />
<br />
Not every player likes caster style characters. And a large majority likes in your face fighting characters... just the choices suck right now.</div></div><hr />

Everyones dps can be streaky, and you have the option to stun runners if you choose to use it. No clue on the undead aspect, I am assuming like mage invis it was getting abused so they removed it. <br />

<br />
Paladins are dependent on seals for steaky damage. Or they can respec to 2H which adds to DPS at a sacrifice to AC.  Seals like Justice have limited returns in that there is a set number of times a PC can be stunned in a minute.<br />
<br />
Our 6 second stun is on a one minute timer. (Fireworks!). <br />
<br />
Others have discusses Rogue options versus Paladins. At a 7-1 (1H), or even 4-1 (2H), Rogues can simply load up on poisons, attack at their leisure, then Vanish and move away. <br />
<br />
Again, if you lose to a Paladin in 1-1 PvP you either suck or are 10 levels lower.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Stun runners? Thats a 6 second shot in the dark. One you have to finish them in the 6 seconds and two not need it in the fight. I can only catch runners with them being real low health and I actually hit them when they are stunned. <br />
<br />
I'm really not sure what mill wants anymore. Pvp a pally who doesnt heal and use shields and see how THAT fight goes. People have no idea how irrtating it is to pvp someone and know if they run you have a 95% chance of not catching them. Mill is like 400 wins and 10 losses and complains about paladins living a long time. Sorry If i'm not sympathetic to your win streak being slowed down once in a while. <br />
<br />
I'v seen what its like to play a pally up to 60. A rogue mid 40's now and grouped with my wifes pally who is mid 40's. I see the difference how it is to fight the same mob 1 on 1 for me., 1 on one for her and than how much she is still shocked by the speed increase when we group. My only limite is still somewhat limited PVP. I do join when groups invade each other and dont gank low lvls. So ive seen how it is to fight in small skirmished and big fights. Not an expert but not clueless. <br />
<br />
People have no clue how long it takes for her to kill stuff when she is 1h and shield. She doesn't complain because she likes being able to survive rough pulls without running. You do have TO KILL STUFF In PVP to have &quot;win button&quot;. Just shielding and moving to a spot doesn't it. Ive been patient with these threads and no fired back at mill but getting old. COULD go ON AND ON for days if you only look at it from YOUR perspective. <br />

I hear 5 pallies in PVP would do this and that. What would 5 shaman do? What do shaman give rogues in group that a pally cant match? I dont know because my shaman is still a youngin but give me a break mill it cant be that damn bad.</div></div><hr />

What I know, is many paladins barely even hurt us when we attack them, and others put up a hell of a fight. That is a good paladin, somone who actually fights back and kicks ass. Alot of pallies shield way too early too. They only use like 2.5-3 lives instead of a full 3 or 4.<br />

5 shaman would die, because they have one life, and no shields to heal through, concentrate fire on one shaman at a time and they die, repeat. heh keep flocking to the pally class man, much rather fight them than a warrior.<br />

Maybe it is just the azshara farmers that bring the pally class down, those ass clowns barely even fight back, the real Paladins you encounter are tough, and very deadly, regardless of what people say about dps.<br />

majority of farmers actually are pallies, easy pve, slow, but really simple. Losing to a 52 rogue, if you are 60, is just awful though faern. You got good gear? What three poisons did he have on you? Can you cleanse poisons? You should be hitting that rogue for 300-500 and if he is like most rogues, he doesn't worry about stamina, and will go down quick. I don't think they are &quot;all that&quot; I think they are too tough to kill in the hands of a decent player, and it imbalances group pvp. Simple.<br />

     I play a 57 Paladin. From your logic this concludes me to be a no talent, unskilled 6 year old with 12 lives and an &quot;I win&quot; button whenever I feel so inclined. I've thought about posting a mean, hurtful reply, but to what end would that serve? So instead I ask you this:<br />
<br />
What exactly is it that is so horrible, so replusive about Paladins merely surviving?<br />
<br />
Paladins generate very little threat, no reason to go for them first. Sure they heal, but that's not often with 2.5 second cast times. Shield and heal is the only way we're going to get a heal off. Having 3-5 lives depending on your build, surviving, enduring, is the only trait a Paladin has to fall back on to potentially win a fight.<br />
<br />
Your complaint centers around the fact that the Paladin's death takes too long. You're not complaining that the Paladin won, that the Paladin escaped, you're angry that the Paladin stood there and lost. Nevermind the fact that none of you died, or the fact that his hearthstone was probably down otherwise he'd have probably Shielded and Hearthed just to piss you off more, you complain that it took to long to gank him. <br />
<br />
What are we supposed to do if not survive, if not be support?<br />
<br />
We aren't DPS, all of our combat abilities are based on chance, luck. How'd you like it if your backstab were a chance to proc? Maybe a chance to land sinister strike up to 5 times in any given minute? Thought not.<br />
<br />
We aren't main tanks in the late to end game. Off tanks at best. We can't hold aggro well. Even though we share plate with warriors, we can't tank as well as they do, period. We can't snap aggro back on us. Ironically some Paladins have found a half-assed way to do this through heavy investment in the Holy Tree for Holy Shocking a Judgement of Fury`ed Mob. So much for our defensive and offensive trees for this job.<br />
<br />
We aren't main healers. We can heal, but we aren't going to save anyone outside of Blessing of Protection (which will kill your group if you cast it on the tank, aggro immediately switches to 2nd highest target) and Lay on hands (40 mins per use at best). God forbid the Paladin is tanking and they use Divine Shield (Same deal as above). They only thing we have going for us in this department is that we seem to pull less aggro then priest, and if we do get aggro we can live through it. At level 57 I'm probably good for 5-7 big heals. Granted my int isn't very high and I could probably make a so-so healer if I specced and geared towards it, Druids and Priest fill the role so much better with little to no effort. in a 5 man Paladins aren't going to be MH.<br />
<br />
What am I supposed to be doing then? Apparently I'm a support class. A stubborn wart of a problem that isn't serious, I just help everyone else do their jobs abit better when I can. In order to secure my supportness, Blizzard has ensured me that I will live - so that others will live.<br />
<br />
But apparently this is overpowered even after some fixes and nerfs. I'm eager for your enlightened and unbias wisdom on this subject.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Can you cleanse poisons?  <br />
<br />
Sure. One at a time.  I had three on me.  So that's another five to six seconds of getting rid of poisons - meanwhile,<br />
<br />
I'M NOT ATTACKING.<br />
<br />
You should be hitting that rogue for 300-500.<br />
<br />
Not with my setup which was 1H + shield at the time. I don't average 300-500 on NPC's much less PC's. My 2H weapon is Doombringer with + 7 Enchanted.  I tested it out on NPC's - certainly not averaging 300-500 a crack. You must be thinking of Warriors.<br />
<br />
Like I said, when BG's come out look for a Rogue nerf. DAOC sorta did it with L.H. Axe.  That or Hunter &quot;detect hidden / stealth&quot; will be changed to offer a counter.<br />

No, not all paladins are, I never said that, I keep saying that it is the stupid ones that make you look bad.

Horde is always hurting for warriors, it sucks, I can't imagine how easy strathe for instance, must be for alliance with all the undead. And here we are dependant on one or two guild tanks. If shaman could tank, I think it would be a little more fair.</div></div><hr />

Back to the topic at hand. I have a Paladin alt and it is just painful to play (as I am finding out that most of this game is - but that is for a different thread). Sure it takes a lot to kill it, but it takes the Paladin forever to kill anything and just hope it does not run....  Yes they are hard nuts to crack, but there is not much DPS coming out on them.  Seems to me Killing a Paladin in PvP would be an exercise in patience - rather than a drunken foolish charge.  That seems kind of stupid and plays to all of the Paladin's strenghts.  <br />

so what you are saying is, you suck at this game, you suck at pvp, and you are a board troll, cool man, way to go.<br />
<br />
But heh, go talk about class balance in your little &quot;I am too scared of getting ganked&quot; world when you only fight somone if you can win for sure.<br />
<br />
Pathetic attempt at trolling by the way, really awful. Try harder next time.<br />
<br />
Oh look, a night elf hunter, the number one played class, the easiest by far to play, weee!!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
tried being cordial, but heh, if people want to act like jackasses here, I am game, no problems at all. You insult me first, I wil tear into you too man. A bunch of carbear non-pvp'ing people trying to talk about class balance? That is just funny.<br />
<br />
/edit<br />
<br />
on second thought, since this forum is not the grey, I am going to report every single insult thrown my way, if people cannot act like grown ups, then they will get a tongue lashing from the mods. Tired of dealing with immature people who have nothing better to do than flame.<br />

<br />
Trolling? No idea what that is man......sorry for not being up on &quot;board lingo&quot;......I read the boards occ when rl allows time for it....<br />
<br />
As far as class balance goes I dont worry about it because I am not worried about whether or not my chosen class is better, worse or the same as another......The only &quot;balance&quot; I care about is if I am having fun.<br />
<br />
As for pvp.......I personally find it boring but if that is what trips your tigger fine.....but that sure as hell does not mean I do not know how to play or cannot understand class issues.......just ain't my cup o tea....<br />
<br />
Ummm......so if troll rogue or whatever you are became the number one class then you would suck by definition cuz if it is the number one class then it must be easy aned therefore suck......great logic considering a few posts back you were attempting to say that pallys were the number one played class and now it is night elf hunters.......<br />

Do not know what the hell you are so angry about in rl but get some help dude before you pop.......seriously.</div></div><hr />

you cannot argue, one way or another, how classes match up, without extensive pvp time, it is as simple as that.<br />

<br />
taken into account realm per realm, paladins would be the most played class. We went over this. Hunters are a great class, probably the most powerful over all, 500 + 30 yard autoshoot, pet, all kinds of utility in snare, wander, aoe, etc? Hell ya, if all i was gonna do is pve, hunter is probably the single best choice. They are a serious pain in the ass in pvp as well.<br />
<br />
Do not know what the hell you are so angry about in rl but get some help dude before you pop.......seriously.<br />
<br />
I am not angry, I like posting, gets boring at work. Funny though, things were going fine, and the two internet stalkers, bubba and krup, jump in, start a flame war, and the rest of you of course join in, just classic, and worked perfectly.<br />
<br />
My title of the post was poorly chosen, I apologized for that, we then started discussing class balance, and I get slammed by a couple of kids, and the rest of the kids jump out of the woodwork,<br />
<br />
deal with it. Perhaps grow up a little, and no, if you do not pvp, you should not even attempt to discuss class balance, because you are truly ignorant.<br />

I drink too much, if you want to have a legit complaint about my character, say something about that, always a good target, personal information works the best, ask Krup and Bubba, they spend alot of time doing it :)<br />
