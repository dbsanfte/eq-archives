<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was reading this thread  (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=13810) and was interested in using EQtools.  I visited the website but did not find any FAQ's that could answer my quesion, now was there documentation in the read-me files.<br />
<br />
Does EQtools work with EQWindows?  I noticed from some of the screenshots that EQtools created a menu from which to launch EQ from.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to use both EQW and EQT?  if so, how?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
