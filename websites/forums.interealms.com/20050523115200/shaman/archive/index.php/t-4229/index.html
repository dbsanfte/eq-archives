<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raketh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What are the classes/lvls/equip needed to do HoT with 1 group? and also how about 2groups? i come from a small guild with not many ubers, but i think we got 2 groups full. So please say what i s needed to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you're not ubers then you're going to have some trouble doing it with 1 group.  I don't ever hear about HoT being done with 1 group, but I know west tov gets done all the time.  My friend that farms wtov uses:<br />
<br />
monk<br />
cleric<br />
warrior<br />
shaman<br />
druid (snare and port bot)<br />
rogue<br />
and one other I forgot (probably chanter)<br />
<br />
All 60, all fairly uber.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sepisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah HoT is 1 group able.  Do it all the time with:<br />
<br />
Pally<br />
Monk<br />
Shaman<br />
Cleric<br />
Mage<br />
Enchanter<br />
<br />
Other then the cleric everyone is 60 and not uber in the least.  Talking thurg armor level here.  Its slow and if turgurs wont land one tank is probably going to die.  However, if all goes well you'll be able to pull it off and score plenty of armor at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Shaman is a necessity for malo and slows and the hp buffs.<br />
Cleric is a necessity for cheals.<br />
Enchanter is a necessity for the haste on the tanks, clarity for casters, and tash on the mobs.<br />
A bard would be very useful for OOS and more mana regen.<br />
A monk is a necessity as you can't pull multiple mobs into camp.  A shadowknight with good gear can probably get by here.<br />
A main tank is now needed, being paladin, SK, or Warrior.  I'm not sure if snare is actually needed or not in HOT.  Keep that in mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Snare everything.<br />
Drain every cleric.<br />
Succor if you in trouble, pull more than one or you have a gater.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kuthu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When i have done 1 group HoT our group consisted of...<br />
<br />
1 warrior<br />
1 bard (tash sticks are good to have here)<br />
1 shaman<br />
1 enchanter <br />
2 clerics<br />
<br />
The main problem that we ran into was that there wasnt alot of dmg output so it would take some time to kill... espically the wurms. <br />
<br />
It is doable with everyone in thurg lvl equipment but you will struggle at first but you will see it get easier as you get SS armor.. (espically on your tanks). Also be sure that your casters have adequate resist gear.... if not they will be eatting alot of dmg from ae's and have to be healed too much.<br />
<br />
Like it has been said before DRAIN all the casters.... but one thing to remember before you slow/malo/ooc ect is that the cleric mobs... espically the white wurms have casted aego on themselves. We usually cast dispell bout 2 times to make sure to strip the buffs from it... makes it easier to kill.<br />
<br />
We have our clerics bound at ToV zone in so if it gets hairy they just gate and come back and rez us after everything has left the camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've done Hot with 1 group before with out much difficulty several times.<br />
<br />
The group has varried a bit but the basics are<br />
Lvl 60 enchanter<br />
lvl 56+ cleric<br />
lvl 60 shaman<br />
lvl 60 warrior<br />
+ 2 others.<br />
<br />
The 2 others have varried, been a 57 ranger, a 60 druid, a 60 rogue, lvl 60 bst, and a couple others.<br />
<br />
For the most part the group isn't a really uber group since most are peoples twink not thier mains. The notable exception are me as the 60 shaman and the 60 rogue we had on a couple trips.<br />
<br />
You need a good tank, warrior probably strongly recommended if going non uber. Our's is in mainly dorf armor with a pair of good buyable weapons (sod and horn of ssraga now but lesser when we started).<br />
<br />
Need to have a cleric, gotta have ch, no question. Have done it with a lower than 60 cleric with out too much problem.<br />
<br />
Need to have 2 of the 3 following for buffs/debuffs.<br />
<br />
Shaman with malo, enchanter, bard or mage with mala. We've always had me as a 60 shaman with malo and an enchanter but you could still do it with a 60 mage with mala and a bard if the bard had an epic or better to haste the group and thier new lvl 60 mana drain song.<br />
<br />
Throw on 2 more, dmg dealers, evacers and a feign puller all aren't bad ideas.<br />
<br />
Things will take a while to kill but as long as you slow everything you should be able to keep mana up for long enough even with just one cleric.<br />
<br />
2 groups with<br />
2 clerics<br />
1 bard<br />
1 shaman<br />
1 enchanter<br />
1 warrior<br />
1 monk<br />
and what ever other misc people you want to add on should be more than pleanty altho you do want people to be as high a lvl as possible with descent resists if possible. Some things have some pretty mean ae's.<br />
<br />
It may take some wipe outs or bad pulls at first but once you have the pulling down pretty well singles aren't bad to handle with that type of group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ahaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just did HoT with 5 yesterday with :<br />
<br />
60 monk<br />
60 cleric <br />
60 enc<br />
60 war<br />
60 shm (me)<br />
<br />
Due to low DPS, it took long time to kill, 2 EPIC DoT worn off on wurm before it dead, was fun tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">we do HoT with <br />
<br />
60 shm<br />
60 bard<br />
55+ warrior<br />
56+ cleric<br />
60 monk<br />
insert other class here (usually 58+ melee dmg class mnk/rog/rng)</div></div><hr />

I have two friends that pay their rent that way :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">We tried 4 in ToV once: warrior, monk, cleric, shaman.<br />
Couldn't get the mob slowed even after malo. Probably would have been ok if the monk had remembered his tash stick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Guy on Drinal plays 6 accounts there all by himself and farms it. I know, I didnt believe it at first either. Prolly anyone here from drinal could confirm it though. He has posted pics of his pc setups...i cant even fathom playing sk, enc, cleric, shaman, and the other ones all by myself hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I was in HOT with a few friends, about 7 to 9 people, and we got wiped at times. Then comes an 60 chanter and cleric. Chanter had dire charm, and had charmed some hatchling, a lvl 45,46 mob (dont remember what it was he said) with 18k hps and doubled for 250, 260s.<br />
<br />
Pet on mob, Cleric CHeals (which heals 10k of damage, so its healing power is used fully). These two characters (played by one person) farmed HOT themselves. yey =) Sounds to me as they got to reevaluate either dire charm or the 'low' level dire charm enabled mobs.</div></div><hr />
