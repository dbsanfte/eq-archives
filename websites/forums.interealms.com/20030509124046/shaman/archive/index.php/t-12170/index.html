<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bohemith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, I've been soloing the CoM bridge and I love the exp, but I'm starting to get the odd lb at 46.I've read in other threads that people have suggested the temple. Now, I did a little bit of exploring and I think I found the temple (right from the gate, looks like an Aztec paramid with water coming down from it). I tried to pull some mobs but I got doubles and triples, and I couldn't root park from being interupted and I eventually had to zone em. :( <br />
<br />
I'm an ogre shaman, and I can get to about 1700 hp buffed and I have about 830 ac, with 170 wis. I do own a JB Bracer. Could you all offer any suggestions, or perhaps a different place in CoM??<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Metadone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, I'm a 48th shaman from FV server. I didn't believe all what people said about the skellies camp in DL as DL is crappy xp now but I went there just to see yesterday and man can I tell you I rocked the place. Skellie came single. I could kill non stop (thank you Stoicism), only thing that made me get a brake was no more skellie in temple (though there are roamers) and I used this time to regen to full hp and mana. Dogdog and I were always full buffed (Str, Sta, Dex, Agi, Talisman, Ineer fire (every little bit helps), AC, SOW, regen, fury (self, of course) and haste). I do not own a JBB (sic), self buff, my AC was 893 and HP were 1795. I made about 10% xp per hour here (this is taking into account my racial malus of 15% as I am an Ogre), I think you'd get better xp at level 46. Just go and see by yourself. On a side note, don't forget that you got some loots to get in CoM for your epic if you plan to get it one day. I do want this and I'll do my best to get it at level 51 (I think it would be a first on FV hehe).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bohemith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah I know about this place in DL. The only problem is that its always camped. I like CoM better because its usually uncamped and there are many many mobs to pull. Being a JB Bracer owner I tear the skele pyramid in DL Up and then sit around waiting for respawns.. when in CoM I have constant pulls.<br />
<br />
So yeah, anyone have any insight into the temple?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Metadone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, playing on FV, I tend to forget that DL is a heavily camped place on the other servers, sorry.<br />
Maybe you could try HHK (I've been told it's for 49+, but with a JBB, maybe you can be good here). The place being flagged as a town, I think you don't have racial malus to xp here (don't think this is the case in CoM despite the fact that you can get bound here).<br />
The Hole has a nice +25% zone experience modifier. Maybe you could do the entrance (if it's not too much camped).<br />
SolB is a great place too. I can't drop mobs fast enougth so I don't hunt here solo, but I know it would be my home if I had the same toy as you :p<br />
Now, these are place that might be heavily camped. Other great exp place that won't maybe be camped are :<br />
- Scarlet Desert (never been there, but have been told it's cool and not too much camped from a friend who plays on another server, AB),<br />
- Burning Wood. When you zone in from DL, go west (follow the wall on your left). You will arrive in a place with a lot of hornets (bees). These are easy solo and great xp. Avoid Solarae (sp. ?) one as they have a lot (and I mean a LOT) of HP. Here again, JBB might be your friend.<br />
- So much more place. Go have a look to EQAtlas, they have a great hunting guide per level range.<br />
Hope this help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gimak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Soloed most of the time here from lvl 46 to almost 50.<br />
<br />
Stuck to the bridge and adjacent areas until lvl 49 then moved into the stables.<br />
<br />
Took a few practice runs in the stables to get the right pattern of pulling down so I didn't pull more than two. Lvl 49 spells make a huge difference as does new pet.<br />
<br />
Very fast xp at 49 - never ran into mana/hp problems once I got the pull pattern down.</div></div><hr />
