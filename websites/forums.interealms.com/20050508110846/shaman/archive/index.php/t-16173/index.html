<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hangman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am finding it hard to join a guild on the Zeburxurok server. Every guild I ask they say I am to low (lvl 39). I am only a social player, around 1.5 hours a day 5 days a week if I am lucky. So I can not see myself getting to lvl55+ any time soon. I have been shouting in the bazzar and PoK asking if any guilds want anymore members, to no avail. If you are on the Zeb server and are taking new members at my lvl could you reply and i will give you a tell in game please..?Thanks heeps. By the way, I am an Australian player so I am playing at off peak times to most, hence the problem finding people in guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Look for your server's message board and post on there.   A nice/friendly guild will normally reply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Be warry those guild OOCing in PoK &amp; Bazaar for more members.  Some them are not all that bad.  However, once they start doing that sooner or later they start getting undesireables in the guild.  At that point it all depends on how good the leadership is weather the bad ones chase off the good ones.  If your honestly seeking a good friendly guild to be with my suggestion is to start asking the people you normally group with if thier guilds are recuiting or what thier guilds requirements.  That way you let people your level know you are looking for a guild.  Alot of lower level guild will recuit people they play with alot.  On my server we have a guild that recuits by OOC in PoK alot and I swear every last person I have had problems with under level 55 is in that guild.  Granted I do know some good people in that guild the majority are just plan bad apples.</div></div><hr />

 I have to agree. A guild that feels the need to advertise so openly seems a little too desperate for me. I also don't think advertising yourself in the Bazaar and PoK is the best route either. A guild worth belonging too probably isn't advertising like that or looking for folks advertising themselves like that. They are waiting for people to come to them.<br />
 Usualy it involves becoming friends with guild members, getting to know them, and letting them have a chance to know you. It can be a lot of hard work, especialy if your playtime is so restricted. Expect a LONG waiting period while they get to know you. Understand that they have to be sure about you because in today's EQ letting just anyone into your guild is just asking for trouble. Saddly it's just the way things are and they way some people who play the game are  :( <br />
 I think posting on the message board is the best idea. You should be able to get an idea of which guilds are worth looking into. Once you know which guilds interest you the best thing to do is go to thier website. Most guilds have websites and message boards of thier own, and there is usualy a place for hopefulls to post and intoduce themselves. They will give you the info you need to know what's required to join them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Personally I feel the best way to find a good guild is not to worry about it for one and just group more.<br />
<br />
At your lvl you should be &quot;looking&quot; for a guild in DL or CC (what I mean is grouping with people for exp and meeting other people, not soloing)<br />
<br />
When you group you will find someone that you like to hang with.<br />
<br />
More often than not they will be in a guild<br />
<br />
After grouping with them a few times ask them what their guild is like<br />
<br />
Ask them how often it raids, what the guild leadership is like, do they have a web site, do they feel included, is guild chat friendly etc...<br />
<br />
The reason this is preferable, besides getting a guild &quot;members&quot; perspective instead of a guild leaders perspective, is that now not only do you have someone you will know in the guild, most likely you will continue to group with them.<br />
<br />
And lastly chill... relax... don't worry about it...<br />
<br />
Trust me it is much better to take your time and find a great guild than rush it and find a crappy guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd put down my views but they precisely match what Tiorr just said =)<br />
<br />
Don't rush into finding any old guild, instead just find people you like grouping with regularly, if they are guilded, go from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not to mention, while you're following Tiorr's excellent advice above, make sure this guild (or the leadership, to be more specific) isn't going to feel the need to give you static about your casual play time.  Sad as it is, I've seen people berated (long ago) that they don't play enough, don't give enough time to the guild, bla bla.  You may be best off just avoiding that idiocy from the start.<br />
<br />
You can also do a: /who all &quot;bunny feet&quot; to see how many people in the guild Bunny Feet are online at the time.  So if you're looking for a guild that's active when you're playing, you can look for quantity and matching level.  Having a guild all around your same level is really going to be the most fun.</div></div><hr />

Look in the unemployment line board :) Some people may reply if you throw a post in there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My advice is to find a guild whose members in general have about the same amount of play time as you do. The reason for this is that if they play considerably more than you  do then they will out level you quickly and you will no longer be able to play with them :/ . I had this happen to me several times and had to leave guilds because of this. This is not a fun situtation to be in from either side.</div></div><hr />
