A recent interview with one of the programmers from Everquest:<br />
<br />
Q: In the most recent patch, many skills broke that seemingly have nothing to do with particles or the other changes you made to the game. Why did these code changes have an effect on the code for Spell Casting Mastery or Lay On Hands?<br />
<br />
A: Those of you that are familiar with programming may have heard of &quot;Object Oriented Programming&quot;. Well we don't do that. Heck, we don't even have any &quot;functions&quot;. Everquest is one big &quot;If-Then-Else&quot; statement, with the occasional GOTO thrown in. This means that if we forget to put in a semi-colon, your character may suddenly become a female bard with a batwing crunchy for a primary weapon. Then there's the monkey.<br />
<br />
Q: What monkey?<br />
<br />
A: We have a spider monkey named ‘KiKi’ who has access to the code once we’re done with our changes. He bangs away on the keyboard...<br />
<br />
Q: … You let him do this?!<br />
<br />
A: Well, its really kinda cute when he does this. You’d have to see it, I guess, to appreciate how adorable it is.<br />
<br />
Q: So when this monkey is done banging on the keyboard, what happens?<br />
<br />
A: Then we save the program as an ASCII file so that we can copy it off of our iMac and move it to our PC to compile. Since its all one big file, we have to use a whole bunch of floppy disks.<br />
<br />
Q: (sigh) After its compiled, what happens?<br />
<br />
A: Then we have Harvey, our Janitor/QA guy arrange a play-test. We have sort of a charity-type, play-testing arrangement with the “Helen Keller School for the Deaf and Blind”. The kids come in, do the play-testing, and report any bugs to Harvey. … They never seem to report any bugs at the time, though.<br />
