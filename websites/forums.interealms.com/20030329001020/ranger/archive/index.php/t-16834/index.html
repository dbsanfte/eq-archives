<br />
Make a graveyard feature which summons corpses to it after a period of time and doesnt allow you to pull them out after that.. then put mobs in that graveyard.. then on the other side of the zone by the GY put like 6 more mobs..<br />
<br />
Thanks for making the game a pain~ and contributing to hours of frustrating CRs.. if i could avoid the Temple of Marr i most certainly would, not because of the encounter with MM himself (that is actually fun) but instead because if ANYTHING goes wrong your raid is doomed to repetitive deaths and frustration while tryin to recover! Brilliant strategy if your goal is to reduce the number of subscribers!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>khalysta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">every graveyard is like that. if it goes to the gy you cant move it out.  If you try it will go a few steps then port back.  A few times when we were doing the agnarr cycle this happened to people and then you couldnt coh or con them back in which sucked.  Just need to learn to rez the first ones dead first by checking the rez timers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ticat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the most pain for that zone is not because your corpse will go to GY, there is a KoS mob really really close to GY and most likey someone will agro it, that make CR hell there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Maegwin Darkenwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Our guild was having problems with this GY as well...and the same frustrations...<br />
<br />
Here's what you need to do.  After a wipeout...select a balanced group of people ( war, clr, ench, sham, 2 others ) and have rogues drag cr them out of MM room.  Then rez those 6 people and have them loot up and kill the cat that is right at the GY.<br />
<br />
Problem solved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gluas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Entitled to your opinion Hoppwin.. however, it is PoP =p<br />
<br />
For those who have valuable input, it is appreciated and yes we have a CR team established now. Figured that one out as well =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Telon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just drag the corpses to the edge of the graveyard.  Corpse will stay there and it's out of aggro range.  Just gotta have clerics who are awake and not ressing people who aren't at the edge of the GY.  PoP is very much about that, making sure people are awake and not just blindly going through motions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rezz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You can summon the corpses behind the porter to HoHA and they will not move.<br />
<br />
Just make sure no one clicks anything (use keyboard shortcuts) or moves around much (you can &quot;walk&quot; into the portal since the colums seem to port you back to HoHA)  until you are ready to kill the mobs in the graveyard.<br />
<br />
Remember, Harmony is your friend. Pull 'em one at a time. They stay dead a good long time.<br />
<br />
It's not that difficult, just annoying. Really annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tolian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just harmony the cat and the other 2 there for good measure.  Then make sure no one is stupid enough to actually walk within arm's reach of the cat, and you're fine.  Gotta agree tho, wasn't very cool to put KoS mobs right within aggro range of the GY, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>decairn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The real annoying thing about the CR there is if you happen to click a corpse by the portal area that is slightly in the hedge, or the moon is full, or something equally weird like that, when the rezzed person pops back into zone they are put right in the middle of the circle on top of the KoS wrulon.  If the 'about to die and newly rezzed' person slightly moves the wrulon then agros on everyone by the hedge and wipes out your CR team again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gluas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Haha,<br />
<br />
Well.. we got it all worked out, just best to kill em (fairly long repop).  Just frustrating situation and ridiculous design imo.  As for harmony, the front three gaurds are lvl 66, so not sure what version of harmony you are using, hehe, but  mine doesnt let me harmony lvl 66 mobs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lord Vageeta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">just invis and move your raid force to the safe spot behind the statue in the main building as you zone in, theres no need to bother with the entrence mobs.<br />
As to the deathtrap zone, dont know what to tell ya, be careful :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cymrich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">this is the worst zone in ever :mad: <br />
<br />
you can zone back on accident just by running into the lightning, not even clicking on anything, which makes it worse. on raids, several people always die from accidental zoning :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Highline Winterwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Fancy seeing you here Cymmie )<br />
<br />
You cannot harmony the cats in the GY, you get that this target is unaffected message.  <br />
<br />
VI needs to fix the wires once in HoHB, these are very buggy as Cymrich said.  If you just walk near them without clicking you sometimes zone.  Also the click range on them is huge, so be careful.  <br />
<br />
CR's there we basically have had the smallest amount of peolpl there for the cr.  You get rezzed them immediately TLed out...as we have some folks that just dont seem to get it some nights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gluas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Vageeta,<br />
Good suggestion for starting the raid in that location, however, not gonna work for CRs (<br />
<br />
Only if ya could pull the corpses from the GY or do CR before GY timer expires..<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, maybe we do our next MM raid from that starting spot ) If we ever need to kill him again that is )<br />

<br />
We get NPCs that bind melee characters in the central gateway plane, PC corpses that don't poof if they're empty, a billion different ways to invis, translocates, even zones that automatically summon our corpses for us, and some people still whine that CR is too hard.   Whadya want, an NPC at the zoneline that you can hail for a free 100% res?  A pet GM that will summon your corpse out of the zone and give ya a ******* while she's at it?<br />
<br />
If you have trouble convincing your raid to sit on their freakin' hands for 20 minutes, to keep their fingers away from the mouse button, and to curb their curiosity to see if those wrulons are just friendly little kitties...<br />
<br />
Have your people zone in invis, move off to one side, /corpse their corpse to the edge of the GY, and loot their corpses partially until you have enough equipped to take out the single mob that might aggro.  To loot without zonin', just do /corpse and look STRAIGHT at the ground using only the keyboard (PGDN default).  Target it with a left click, then /loot.<br />
<br />
You've not done CR until you've failed at an old-fashioned Fear break.  With only level 46's to 50's.  In crap gear.  I'm talking stocking up on your 3rd set of backup CR gear and running back from Freeport, or Oggok if you were brave enough to do that... maybe gettin caught in a death loop with the guards beatin on ya.  Zoning in to a zone with 50 naked people, 2 at a time, with see invis mobs packed in thicker'n a dwarf-woman's beard.  Running to the camp, hoping you don't get aggro... dying if you do.  Then starting over.  Getting trained by others tryin' to get to the camp.  Hiding up on a ledge hoping to Prexus that invis doesn't break, and looting corpses in between pathing cycles.  If the random number generator fails at the wrong time on any of multiple factors like invis timers or aggro detection, you get to start over.  If you're lucky, you won't lose so many levels that you can't zone back in again.  Startin' at 6pm and going til 2 in the morning without killin a single mob.<br />
<br />
If we'da had only one mob to kill to ensure us a safe recovery, we'da fought him, geared or not, bitin and scratchin if we had to.  Usin' sticks and rocks we found on the ground.<br />
<br />
Vladimirr shouts, &quot;Alright, ya prepubescent dorito-munchin' maggots, wipe up that drool, grab another coffee, get both hands back on the keyboard, and listen up 'cause I'm only gonna say this once.  If ya train the camp again, I'm leavin yer corpse fer Cazic bait.  Lose your auto attack hotkeys and ASSIST this time.  We've got 5 hours before our first wave of corpses start ta' rot.  Now let's get in there an' show them pansies what real Fear's all about!&quot;<br />
<br />
Arrr, those were the days of CR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Vladimirr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">(takes a deep breath)<br />

lol hiya high :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Telon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">rofl Vlad, I hear ya man.  Those were the days, back in early fear.  I only caught the tail end of it on my server, before fear started being farmed 24/7, but I had my share of 3 am cr's with naked raids.  People have it too easy now days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ryche</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ya know...back in the day I used to walk the 20 miles to fear, uphill with no shoes on in knee deep snow.  Yep, thems were the days and thems were the times that made me the hardened ranger I am now.<br />
<br />
Thanks Vlad, that was great.<br />
<br />
And to anyone complaining about any worse, suck it up and learn to deal with it.  CR in ToM isn't that hard if you use a few brain cells and don't do stupid things.  /corpse, /target Ryche's Corpse and /loot are your friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dinuvian Mistwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Those were the Pure days, Vlad. The days when men were REAL men, and women were vicious...ok well women haven't changed but life is SO much easier than it used to be.<br />

Such fond memories :)</div></div><hr />
