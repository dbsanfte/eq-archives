<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shaman_Seductress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone.<br />
<br />
I am just starting EQ for the first time and I have a few questions.OK first thing I have read ALL the manuals for EQ many times so I am familar with gameplay,rules,ect.So my first question is:What is a good race?I browsed over all the races using various sites and I thought about either an Iksar or Kitty.I am prefering these because of personal role-playing preferance. :D  Although I really want some more experianced players advice.Just FYI I have no other characters or any friends/guild to help me out so that may effect race choice.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for all the help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hi, welcome to the Crucible.<br />
<br />
It really doesn't matter. Pick whichever you like the look of. Each race has slightly different attributes and there's not a lot to distinguish between them.<br />
<br />
A quick summary though:<br />
<br />
Trolls have innate regen which really can help at low levels, but they have an experience penalty also. They're also a large race and hence have slam.<br />
<br />
Ogres are immune to stuns from the front, which can be very useful, so I'm told. They are also a large race with slam and an exp penalty.<br />
<br />
Barbarians have no night vision, but are the most &quot;human&quot; looking, so the most popular. They used to be the only non-evil shaman race, but that's no longer true. They're large with slam, and a slight exp penalty.<br />
<br />
Iksars have an exp penalty and innate regen to compensate. They have an AC bonus, but can't wear jaundiced bone armour which means no nuke bracer, which can help a lot at around 45-55, but probably isn't as big a deal as it used to be.<br />
<br />
Vah Shir are cats, and have safe fall. Pretty neutral choice, no major drawbacks, no major advantages.<br />
<br />
Similar with frogloks. They have a cute backflip when they cast a spell, and some people think they look good. Again no major drawbacks or advantages.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps, and feel free to send me a tell on Xev if you see me on.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Whatever you think looks cool. In the end its all the same anyway.<br />
<br />
I have a barbarian, but if i was creating a shaman today i might have picked Ogre because they look so damn cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ogre.  <br />
<br />
Immunity to frontal stuns is an unbelievalby powerful ability.  Way way greater than any other racial ability or AA ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I chose barbarian because when I started they were the only non-evil race and had the smallest exp penalty.<br />
<br />
If I had to do it over again today, with all the easy experience and accessability of beta neutral zones like Shadowhaven and PoK, I would probably play an ogre for very high starting stamina and stun immunity.  They still carry a 15% exp penalty, but with the hot spot zones and the Planes its not as big a thing as it once was.<br />
<br />
Or maybe a Vah Shir, just cause I think they look cool and have zero exp penalty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If i were going to remake my sham, i would go Ogre.  I picked troll for the regen, but that was almost outlived by the time i was lvl 40.  I would love the ability to not be stunned from the front.  Would be well worth it i think for those nasty summons from our insane agro building dots and slows.  Might pick a frog just for the flip tho, that would be cool, cept i wouldnt get to see myself flip unless in a diferent camera.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I would never be a barbarian tho, there are just too damn many of them running around.  I understand that they used to be the only &quot;good&quot; race shaman, but if i werent on a zek, how much does your race play into your ability to grp?  I have an SK on Maelin, and hes an Ogre.  He gets grps just as fast, if not faster, then my almost same lvld half elf bard.  So that right there makes me believe that race on a &quot;blue&quot; server really has little to do with anything.  And the exp penalty is barely noticeable.  It may just be that i am used to it, but i really dont think the difference is that much.<br />

Back before vel/loy/ldon and pop the starting faction greatly changed your game play unless you were willing to do alot of faction work.  A barbarian could stop by freeport or Gfay and sell or bank....try that with a troll or orge.  If you want to bank it means running back to one of the evil towns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Granted, but in todays EQ where you can buy anything in PoK/PoT/Shadowhaven/... that you can buy in any city, there is no need to be worried about a race really.  Unless you want to do stuff like the cudgle quest later and then you could either be a Lizzy or do factioning like all the others.  But ok i do see your point in the pre-pop era :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grimleaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Frogs have ultravision which allows them to see in the dark and Vah Shir eat food twice as fast. As far as the frontal stun thingy, I hardly ever get stunned and when I do it's usually from behind. Hell, I get stunned mabey once a night if that. I don't think it's that big of a deal but some people swear by it.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I picked a frog for my second time around. He seems to work just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There are many choices, but I beleive the Iksar to be one of the best choices due to the inate regen and the added AC, but as the only foraging Shaman this puts them sligthly over the top.  They have faction troubles which thanks to SOE and their lack of vision with faction, it really doesn't make much of a difference anymore and you have no faction work to be eligalbe for the Cudgel quests. XP penalty.  Unable to wear plate and Jaundiced armor ( it chafes the scales )<br />
<br />
The Innoruuk worshipping Trolls have a 3 step quest that ends up with a right click snare neck ( i soloed it at 24 ) and also have inate regen, but the stat trade off is lowest wisdom to one of the highest stamina scores out there. True Large race. XP penalty.  Fun to roleplay.<br />
<br />
Ogre's can't be stuned from being hit in combat from the front ( spell / proc stuns still affect them ) They have low wisdom but this is offset by high stamina.  True large race.  Fun to roleplay.<br />
<br />
The Vah Shir have inate safe fall, but eat more.  They get hair balls.<br />
<br />
The Barbarians have high wisdom and good stamina.  No night vision.  They wear skirts.<br />
<br />
The Frogs are cute, sorta.  They are yet to be driven from Grobb... Long live Grobb!<br />
<br />
Keep in mind as you place your initial stats that it is very likely that the gear you will increase your wisdom.  It is wise to devote a good portion of your beginning stats to Stamina instead of wisdom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Everyone overlooks the Vah Shir's hidden ability...sneak.<br />
<br />
Sneak lets Vah Shir buy and sell anywhere, so long as they aren't KoS.  This is an unbelievably handy little ability, especially at lower levels.  It's also quite useful for getting past KoS mobs without having to fight.  Of all racial abilities, I think Sneak is the most overlooked, and probably one of the most useful.<br />
<br />
Vah Shir eat and drink twice as fast, yes, but that's in a trade off for their ability to burn out poison/disease DoTs twice as fast.  At lower levels, again, this is very handy.  Think they call it enhanced metabolism or something.<br />
<br />
If I were to reroll my shaman, I'd make a kitty for sure (my current one is kitty...hehehe), but I'd be tempted to go ogre for slam and frontal stun immunity.<br />
<br />
IMO, they're the 2 best shaman races.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mysticrhythms64</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I created a Barbarian Shamanness, she gets stunned a lot. were I to do it again, I would probably create a kitty (except for that horrible lag I get in kitty town, not to mention how lost I get there!). Either that or maybe an Ogre were it not for the faction problems. Ogre's are pretty tough buggers.!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The big question is - do you plan to just play the game or are you going to be leveling like mad to catch friends and then play once you are 65?<br />
<br />
If you just want to play pick whatever you think looks the best.<br />
<br />
If you plan for 65 go Ogre or Vah Shir. Ogre for the no-stun, Vah Shir for sneak. Even then the differences due to races are very very small. You certainly will not be tempted to reroll as a different race because of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>stanislao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Most of the shamans around (me too) are barbarian. That's because when I started I didnt want to have faction problems when I go in different towns.<br />
With the last few expansions you would not have that problem anymore because PoK/Bazaar and the new hot places let you go around even if you play an evil race.<br />
At this point I would choose an Ogre because the fact that cannot be stunned from frontal attacks. There is no AA or item that can equal that and you are gonna find it very usefull at every level of the game.<br />
Also the slam ability that large races gets helps a lot to interrupt casters (gaters or CHers) sometimes when you solo. Don't always work but it's a nice thing to have.<br />
Beside that shamans get shrink at lvl 19 so you would not have any problem like a non caster ogre would have in some zones.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'd say that either Ogre for slam and stun immunity or Inny Troll for slam and snare neck are your best choices.<br />
<br />
Being night blind is a massive disadvantage for barbarians... to hell with how &quot;cute&quot; they are.  <br />
<br />
Eating twice as fast doesn't bother you till you start using expensive stat foods and you forget to force feed your starving cat and *POOF* there went another bucket of crab legs.  Sneak could be handy though.<br />
<br />
Iksar are cool - but no JBB hurts in the horrible period through the late 40s and early 50s... although foraging ability is low, it helps.<br />
<br />
Frogs... are frogs... play one if you find them novel or you think skilling up your swimming will be difficult.<br />
<br />
Cazic trolls get a fear neck... but it pales in comparison to the usefulness of the snare that Inny trolls get.  If you make a troll, go Innoruuk.<br />
<br />
I started my shaman in the Kunark era... faction just never was as big of an issue as everyone made it out to be.  Freeport is only one zone closer than Neriak... and Oggok was closer to CT and SK/Paw (where I exped a lot early on) than any good-faction city.  In Kunark I had the ability to bank and sell in the Outpost of OT where the good races didn't... and by the time I was hunting DL/KC the nexus was up and running and trivilialized that run - sure FV was closer, but it wasn't that big of a deal any more.  Frankly, I think in some ways I had it easier being evil.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Dug up the last post I made on this topic, still applies. IMHO, it depends completely on your overall &quot;goals&quot; in this game.<br />
If I had to do it all over again, from a purely powergaming standpoint, I would pick the race with the smallest XP penalty, I think. The 50s just sucked as a troll, especially since I did a lot of them when there were still &quot;hell levels&quot;. At 65, the regen just ins't enough to make up for the fact that I would probably have 100 more AA if I was a Barb or Frog. <br />
<br />
However, from a purely game-playing view, I love my troll. There aren't a million of us, we have more story behind our race than many other races, and we just look damn cool! <br />
In another thread I cant find, I think I mentioned that I would go Kitty Kat for sure. Looks cool, has awesome innate abilities, and no XP penalty. The abilities they have actually HELP at higher levels, rather than the semi-trivial ones that Trolls have. Ogre or Kat, I think, /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shaman_Seductress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think I have made my choice.I am either going to go with the Froggys or Kittys.I appreciate all your help and info.I have choosen these two because of I am inot the whole looks things and Trolls and Ogres are just butt ugly IMO  :D .Anyway I will be making the choice later today.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">one other thing to consider--starting stats<br />
<br />
sure, gear changes things a lot, but the simple fact of the matter is that they will help a lot at early levels. for obvious reasons, it's very easy to get shammy usable gear with wisdom on it, so going with an Ogre helps you out in a small way. basically, at character creation, dump into wis heavily--i believe you can get wis to 100 base--and put the rest in stamina. at level 1, you sould be able to be in the mid 140s stamina. i'm sure there will be those who will point out that you can buff stamina heavily with shammy buffs, but once you get focus of the soul (hp totals from focus of the soul beat Infusion + Boar + Kragg), you will benefit again from the high base stamina by being able to buff to max or close stamina on top of boar and FoS, even if you don't have an incredible amount of stamina add gear.<br />
<br />
just something i noticed since i made my own shammy a barbarian and noticed that since i'm using FoS + boar now for max hps, i'm at 225 stamina, while my max possible for stam is 280...the extra 55 stam sure would be nice, and since my wis would be the same either way, i wouldn't be losing at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
bottom line, though--if you obsess over how much you dislike the appearance of a char, you won't play it. i still like the barb look the best, personally.<br />
<br />
enjoy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shaman_Seductress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">/sigh<br />
<br />
Now after I have read a few more posts Im back on the decision train again.I hear talk about how stamina is almost or is just as important as wisdom to a Shaman,but my thought is how much does stamina really help as far as Hp goes?Does anyone know how mucha point gives you or such?Im still thinking on creating a Froggy,but now(even though looks are a factor) Im thinking of an Ogre./cry So confused.  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If I was to do it over again I would choose a Rallos Zek worshipping troll so I could get a snare necklace.  I can't count the number of times that I've gotten killed because something I was soloing ran away and brought back half the zone to help.<br />
<br />
Snare potions are just not that useful to me.  If you could stack them and put them in your ammo slot I think they would be better.<br />
<br />
Stamina is as important as wisdom but honestly you'll find that you can raise just about any stat you want to with the right combination of gear, augments and buffs.  I wouldn't worry too  much about your stats.  Find a race you would like to roleplay and go with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Noooo not froggies!!! They seem to be the lamest of all races... just my opinion. I think ogre for the stun immun, or troll for the snare neclace, since SOE doesn't seem to want to give us any other kinda snare.<br />

I just wanted to add, whatever class makes you happy... that is just my opinion. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The snare neck is a solo'rs gift.<br />
<br />
There is a lot of truth that there is not a lot between the races, and the race to 65 these days is so short it doesnt matter.<br />
<br />
I'm an ogre cause I like bein an ogre, but I would have gone troll if I wasnt sooo attached to ogres.<br />
<br />
Snare means is that you will be able to solo a bit easier when waiting for pick up groups.<br />
<br />
I know it doesnt last long, and you cant use it for agro kiting, but its great for slowing runners in dungeons. Pop it on at 40%.<br />
<br />
One of my alts is a troll sham, i love his snare neck 8)<br />
<br />
At the end of the day its the only significant difference given the availability for armour for the ikies now, and the fact the JBB is no longer the ultimate arm piece.<br />
<br />
btw, for getting through 50, go to OOT and solo giants with yer jbb, works nicely 8)<br />
<br />
Alternatively get a horsey, head to POI, group and be a slow/nuke tart.<br />

<br />
troll for the snare <br />
-Use this race if u like to dot and run around (kiting)<br />
Casting skills rise up fast this way.<br />
<br />
Either way, your stats will all be max by the time u get to 65.<br />
Personally i use a kitty. Cos they look so cute when shrunk.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't remember what it did at lower levels, but I know that in the 240-250 sta range that I'm at, each point of sta is a bit over 3 hp.  Don't know the exact forumla though.<br />
<br />
So +5 sta on an item, for example, will result in about 15 hps or so.<br />

Please, please pick what you think looks good.  Ogres are big and ugly (this coming from an ogre).  If you want looks, go for looks, honestly.  The immunity to frontal stun is nice but I can practically guarantee it will be put in as an AA sometime down the road and you'll wish you had that nice purple frog.</div></div><hr />

You can do more damage concentrating on canni'n and nuking/dotting.<br />

Sooo much more that its a shame (once again *sniff*)<br />
<br />
I can quite happily slow and heal EP groups if i have a bankup healer to counter my very slow cast heals.<br />
<br />
if yer gonna tank &quot;in teh face&quot; then all you are doing is positioning for ruppie puppie to get best access.<br />
<br />
If yer positioned in a corner its nice not getting interupted, but so is not bringing a 30 mob train down on your arse because root wore off when you dropped that last dot on.<br />

I'd say the snare neck is underrated, I love it on my alt, now if I could just get my mains gear and aa's transferred....<br />

Iksar can not use the Jaundiced Bone Bracer.

<br />
But I've always gone based on what I want my character to be... looks say a lot, as does race.  I chose Barbarian, as I wished to be a goodly shaman, and that was the only option, plus, other than the kilts, I loved their looks!

I kinda think it's fun when some dumb lvl 50 Troll warrior says he's gonna squash me. It just makes my class choice worth it every time as I laugh in their faces. For some reason, none of them will duel me though : (<br />
<br />
I put most of my starting points into wisdom for some dumb reason. I'd probably focus on stamina more if I re-rolled. Froglok's already have pretty respectable starting wisdom and their starting stamina is a bit weak. As said before though, it all pans out in the wash. I'm at the point now where I can self buff all my stats to 280 (except stamina, which I'm working hard on now) and I'm far from uber.</div></div><hr />

YOU are the person who has to stare at that character select screen.  If you think Ogre's are horribly ugly and disfigured but find yourself wishing daily you had the sexy Iksar tail... If you think your froggies backflips are cute but wish you could sneak and emote pouncing on your prey as a cat...<br />
<br />
My SK is a human.  She was my first ever character in EQ.  I love her to death.  Wouldn't change a thing about her (usually, though Illusion Potions help on days I start wondering).  Even now after all these years, I still get comments on having a human SK.  Some positive (wow, never seen one, cool) Some negative (why on earth did you make a human, ogre/troll/DE better because...) But what it ends up as, &quot; I &quot; am happy everytime I log her in.</div></div><hr />

Maybe if you choose an Ogre you will end up not playing it because it looks ugly...  :(<br />
BTW in my experience I maxed WIS with bazaar Items and STA was the first stat I maxed (to 305) with EP gear. Took years tho.<br />

Lol, that's funny. Actually they do have the best animations, like something out of a Walt Disney cartoon.</div></div><hr />

Yea...  I started as a casual player (very casual) playing several toons and then I raided for 9 months almost every day up to the elemental planes.<br />

I never said you NEEDED one, and I hear things like this said by a lot of people, but they usually turn out to be Iksar.  My advice is not based on hearsay, but EXPERIENCE with the Jaundiced Bone Bracer.  No, you don't NEED one item to be a successful shaman, but it sure as heck helps. Items are fast becoming a pseudo-level system, easily seen in how twinks outlevel the now rare honest newbie.<br />
<br />
All through levels up to 60 (Canni V/Torpor), and even sometimes today, I've had my bracer on a hotkey in my first page, and will alternate between it and my canni after I have landed my slow and DoT's, if I am exp grinding.  Whenever my Dot's would run low with the mob at just above 20 percent, I would nuke it into run mode with the JBB, and continue firing and medding while dogdog bites its butt.  <br />
<br />
It became almost like a reflex for me, and if I added up the amount of mana free damage I've done with it over the many many many months I have had it, it would be huge.<br />
<br />
If I had never owned one, I would not include it in my choice, but since I DID get one, and experienced for myself how awesome it was up until the endgame, I now DO include it.  Fungal Tunic is even better, if you can get it at level 24, you are freakin' SET until about 44, at which point you can receive Stoicism anyhow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">To get a sham to 50 in a couple of weeks by yourself without PL'n services all you need is:<br />
<br />
1 Fungal Tunic<br />
2 A horse<br />
3 A JBB<br />
4 A BFW (Big ****ing weapon, 2hb masher)<br />
5 A haste belt<br />
<br />
If you can afford it, get a full set of cultural 6ac/65hp rings, orc fang ears.<br />
<br />
Go to you newbie area, smash stuff till lvl 10.<br />
Head to paluadial, go to the zone exit, smash bugs till light blue (lvl 16 I think)<br />
Go back to the zone in and shout &quot;lvl 16 twinked sham lookin for a group&quot;, kill the humanoid model things. Most probably you will be the tank, unless they are have a fungi tunic themselves you will tank better than anyone at that level.<br />
<br />
At 24 go get canabalise, now you group for 10 levels. canni + fungi + horse = mana god.<br />
<br />
I suggest overthere, get a ranger (yes they can track, and you can heal anything). Get all of your braids for your OT hammer.<br />
<br />
Alternatively Highpass Hold.<br />
<br />
At lvl 34, go get your pets (all of them at once, its a prick of a trip).<br />
Now you can practive tanking &quot;In teh face&quot; till your defensive skills catch up.<br />
<br />
Now go to DL and get another ranger near Karnors to pull mobs for you.<br />
Sit on horse, slow, heal and dot.<br />
<br />
at 40, try to get a group inside.<br />
<br />
at 46, go the pop, go directly to pop.<br />
<br />
Thats how I made 50 odd in two weeks un power leveled. It works, and i wasnt online 24 hours a day.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />
