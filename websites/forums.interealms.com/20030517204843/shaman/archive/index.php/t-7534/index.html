<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Konarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thanks in advance.  In a guild that has gotten to point where we can drop all the Kunark dragons, All old planes, Vindi, etc.<br />
<br />
Any ideas what I should shoot for next?  I am mostly a AC/HP shammy but likes a decent mana pool for when enchanters lock down so many mobs I almost lose track what to root/slow next. :D<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Some of that you can probably find in the bazaar cheap, some of it involves some PITA quests ;), and some are from boss mobs that your guild should be able to do based on what you mentioned.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Konarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Here's what Ive upgraded so far..<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=439748<br />
<br />
Upgraded neck/back   saving cash for gloves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heheheh :) <br />
<br />
Remember thurg armour can be a nice stand in till you get SS or Giant armour. I've got thurg leggings, and until I can get my hands on SS leggings, I am content. :) (Second in line, perhaps,  to get ss leggings, but ToV recently has only been dropping chain bracers. Grrr :))<br />
<br />
Anyway, people sniff at thurg cause it's the weakest, but it's still a nice upgrade from what I was using before - Jaundiced bone greaves. And it'll do until I can get better. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&quot;Arms: Hardened Grey Flesh, Velious Quest&quot;<br />
<br />
Are we talking about Hardened Grey Flesh Sleeves? Those are lore, droppable, from the Grey... while they have decent hp - +25 hp, +6 sta, AC 16, why would you choose them over say, giant sleeves which have +3 wis and 30 hp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">No one would probably choose them over HGFS, Harvyst, but they'd choose them over his JB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">True :) I just got all excited about another velious quest with possible good loot, then looked it up on Alla and went &quot;oh&quot; :)<br />
<br />
I'm sort of in a velious kick at the moment... working on my 6th shawl, doing all sorts of dragon aligned quests (just in case my guild switches to Giant in the future, I want my dragon quests done now while my faction is good :)).</div></div><hr />
