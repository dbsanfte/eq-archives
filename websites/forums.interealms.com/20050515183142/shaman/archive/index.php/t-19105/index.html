<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tekulo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is the best to Specialize in? right now I have Alteration maxed cause I always though that Slow and Healing would be used most. But now I am thinking that Conjuration it what I should have done. DoTs cost hella lot of mana and if you think about it, you only cast Slow once or twice. Was I wrong in Specializing in Alteration?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">nope, like 90% of the spells you cast are alteration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Slows and heals are Alteration.  Maybe Q is too(4am fogginess).</div></div><hr />

Alteration works best for all of the priests..heck it's even a good one for necros. I can't see doing conjuration for anything but mage(my own mage is evo though).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aekhold</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Conjur is just good if you only solo. You'll never dot in raids (or really not often).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">With GoD a second specialization is going to be added (or so I hear ).  Conjuration might be a good choice for that, but for your primary specialization Alteration is a no-brainer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chairman Meow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">To me, as your first spec, alteration is the only choise.  Heals, Slows, and malo are all alteration.  For the second spec, that will be available with GoD, I will prob go with conj for the dots that I rarely use, but evoc could be a choise as well for our oh so uber dd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">One thing to consider is the spell you cast more than all other spells combined is also alteration.  Specialization helps your fizzles go down.  Canni is alteration.  Its something to think about :)<br />
<br />
Having but one choice for specialization, alteration is the best.  <br />
Having two choices, I would pick conjuration as my second.  Not only are our DoTs all conjuration, but our better nuke, in my opinion, spear of torment also is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sorry for the highjack<br />
<br />
What exactly does specialization do? I understand it reduces fizzle and possible reduces mana cost.<br />
<br />
because alteration is so easily gained (canni) I tried specializing in Conj (pre-60) just to see what difference it made.<br />
<br />
While I didnt notice more fizzle I did notice that I was out of mana more often after buffing.<br />
<br />
I guess my question is.. how does it work? Is it a roll to see if you save mana or not?</div></div><hr />

Its a basic skill check like most others in EQ; your skill checks to see if it fires everytime you cast a spell, assuming your skill works, you use a certain % less mana. It also uses that same check to see if you prevent a fizzle as well.<br />
The AA Spell casting Mastery makes your specialization &quot;fire&quot; more often, increasing the chance by 30% at the end of the AA. I am currently working this one and even iwth just 2 ranks in it I already see a significant savings.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The mana savings isn't random or otherwise.  Specialization has been parsed to be a flat savings % off casting skills in a certain casting skill type.  While the game does indeed claim that specialization is a random check, this is not what actually happens.<br />
<br />
50 specialization is roughly ~2.5% savings<br />
200 specialization is roughly ~10% savings<br />
<br />
SCM1 is ~2.5% savings<br />
SCM3 is ~10% savings<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what SCM2 is..guessing ~5% but i dont recall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dogpoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">going against the grain here but im gonna say it really depends on what you do.<br />
<br />
i raid some and solo lots,i myself was just thinking of switching back to conjuration myself.<br />
<br />
slow and a Q or two is basically mandatory for each mob that ya solo,figure this is about what,5-600 mana?(i know my numbers arent exact by any means,just bear with me)<br />
<br />
so,ya got your mob slowed,ya gotta kill it lol-this is gonna cost a few dots,so roughly 1200 mana or so<br />
<br />
i`d much rather be shaving mana off that 1200 rather than that 600 from alteration.<br />
<br />
hehe correct me if im wrong,and of course this only applies to ppl that solo a lot,i raid a lot too,but with multiple shamans in the guild i`ve been doing more dps with dots on raid mobs than healing or anything like that.<br />
<br />
if your case is similar to mine go conj;dots cost at least 2x the mana Q does to put it simply</div></div><hr />

Newp. It's a mix of the two, a random check that averages out to a certain percent. If it were a flat rate you would cast the exact same number of spells with each manabar..you don't, there is variation there. Sure it's small, and in the end averages out, but it's there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vladigar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Since the vast majority of spells you will cast are either alteration and conjuration, go alteration first. Then when GoD is released, make your second specialization conjuration. Several classes out DD us so evocation isn't really a logical choice.</div></div><hr />

No it is a flat percent is exactly the same every time the spell is cast. This has both been parsed in game and verified by people using programs like show eq. Mana pres focus effects on the other hand are a random amount upto the precent of the focus and end up averaging about half thier value.</div></div><hr />

Do me a favor, go in game and strip off all of your gear, then cast healing as many times as you can until oom. Do it 5 times or so, see if you cast the same number of times every manabar.<br />
<br />
Spoiler: You won't<br />
<br />
If you want to see it a little more precisely, cast minor healing or inner flame instead of healing.</div></div><hr />

I don't need to test it because I already have and it is constant. I've also seen the number posted by the people sniffing the numbers from the data packets. Specialization and spell casting mastery are a flat percentage savings. MP Focus effects on items are clearly random how ever and thats easy to see with a high perect item like bracelet of darkness.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's funny, because the most in depth test of specialization I am aware of was over on graffe's..will try to find a link for it.<br />
<br />
He tried to claim the same thing you do, but he got something like 6 different amounts of spells he could cast from his mana bar. <br />
<br />
If you have a parse that would be excellent..post it and easily prove me wrong!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did a quick search on google here is the second link I found :  LOOK HERE (http://www.rpgexpert.com/384.html) <br />
<br />
<br />
Basically give Ostorm (located in the temple of solusek ro, off of lavastorm mountains) a ruby he will reset all your specializations to 49 again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Thats interesting to know, I always assumed mana preservation was a fixed percent of 10%. I  guess with some forethought its logical it is random. So by the calculations a 2nd specialization will save 7.5% mana more on conjuration or evocation spells(the 2 I would consider on a  2nd specialization) as well as a decrease in fizzle rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">on beta I just got &quot;Your skill in Specialization: Conjuration has increased (62)&quot;.  It's to early to tell howmuch of an increase it will be, but it's something that I plan on getting asap when GoD goes live.  Def. start with Alteration as your first specialization.  When GoD comes out, for 10 AAs, it will be worth it to get this AA to save more mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jenoah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I just dinged 30 and put a point on Specialize Alteration and just for the heck of it, clicked on Specialize Conjuration to see what would happen.  It turned on as well.  Does this mean I can specialize in both? I'm not quite sure how it works</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Divination, hands down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Coraz shouldn't you be outside playing in the street or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Jenoah, it's the first one that goes past 50 that will keep increasing.  The rest others will cap at 50.  My advice is to just cast a low level alteration until you hit 51 with it, then go out and play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Jenoah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">thank you =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also Jenoah just incase you didn't know you need to put a point in each of them before any of them can go over 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I spec'd Conjuration for the DoTs because I solo'd so much.  If we get the 2nd spec. AA that has been kicking around for GoD then I'd go Alteration with that for sure now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oye didn't know that.  I was wondering why my alteration wouldn't go past 50  :p <br />
<br />
thanks  :)</div></div><hr />
