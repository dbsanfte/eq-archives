<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did this all with a beastlord for a partner, but for 40s it should work the same with any melee partner.<br />
<br />
40 - 45<br />
City of Mist<br />
We mostly wandered around the front area, could clear anything with ease. Had a few problems pulling stables a few times, but that was only because of weird aggro.<br />
We didn't go past the goo house area where you get to where there are two little hut thingies over a lake near reaver castle(sorry dont know name of area)<br />
Pretty easy zone and pretty fun.<br />
<br />
46 - 51<br />
Jaggedpine Poachers<br />
<br />
Poachers rock. Named are tough at mid 40s but can be done<br />
Once you hit 49 this camp is a cinch, and it is awesome exp. They also drop tons of pelts and they don't drop ruined, so even better if you are tailoring. Or just for cash, HQ cat and HQ bear sell ok in quantities.<br />
<br />
Be careful of black panthers. They weren't kos to beastlord, but they were to me, and they are pretty tough at this level. If they add while your in a tough fight, you're in deep water.<br />
<br />
good luck</div></div><hr />
