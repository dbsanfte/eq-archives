<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if anyone knew if this would be a nice place to hunt in. the exp mod is insane for this zone, and that plus old world mobs should make it juicy exp. Im asking this mostly as would this place be good for PLing people through the 40s? with an EB item the all underwater thing wouldnt be that bad. I popped in here solo and killed a few things, wasnt too hard. only problem I had was finding a place to set up camp. its way too easy to get lost in there and I have no idea where X mob spawns on Y floor, in Z corner.<br />
<br />
im basicly asking if anyone has PLed here before and if so where and was the exp worth the hassle?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Kedge Keep use to be shammy solo zone.  At the zone in you can set up shop and pull the random fish there and use the wall as a brace for casting.  If you deside to go there just be sure you have a few fish scales in bank or handy for CR.  Nothing like trying to hold your breath long enough though a zone to loot your EB item.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Went there tonight to take a look. First floor would be great at level 40- easy single pulls (fish are swimming all over the place, just have to watch them and pull when timing is right).<br />
<br />
At level 44 though the second floor is where I should be, although I only had time to take a peek on the second floor.<br />
<br />
The exp is nice in there no doubt, the low db impalers on the first floor gave at least 2% at level 44 per kill.<br />
<br />
The fish have very low ac compared to the LoY mobs I was used to.<br />
<br />
more to come....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Qeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wow.. i'll have to try and convince my warrior friend to come down there with me.. sounds fairly interesting... now just for an eb item!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok. Went down to solo on the second floor tonight. There are 2 empty rooms that are great to pull to. I used the smallest one and waited in it to make sure there wasnt any fishes that could possibly add, not sure about the slightly bigger room.<br />
<br />
Exp was good. about 2 percent per kill at level 44. You have to use caution when pulling to get singles, but its not that tough. I'm leaving it though, cause the loot isnt good, and with level 49 approaching fast and all my focus items expiring I need to be making some plat. Misc words, fish parts and a swordfish bill (piercer sells for 4g to a vendor) is what you can expect for lewts there.<br />
<br />
A very cool place to solo none the less.<br />
<br />
Exp is good though. Hardly any tougher than any other dungeon.</div></div><hr />
