<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Impressive. I like the way you timed the cuts to the music.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've got one I'm planning on sharing with the masses soon, assuming It's well recieved by my guild =b</div></div><hr />

<br />
No idea where these two spawn, I think somewhere in 2nd castle? our first few attempts on both Reparm and AMY were at c1, we had a lot of room to work with there to get used to the encounter, now we pull em both to c2 near 2nd fort.<br />
<br />
Btw, the video is on the newspage of the web site, just right click the link and save it to your hard drive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Nice cuts/editing.  Cool movie too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">they spawn up in the castle 2  their is alota space to work with inside shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just checked it out, great film, gratz and great timing with with music.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">/shrug<br />
<br />
we just usually set up at whatever camp is open (or if we don't feel like getting rid of the birds we just run to the tables), then pull everything along the way.  Have a bard pull and he doesn't agro anything and if he does just gets rid of it.  Have never seen a mob not come solo to us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Bloody awful music :(<br />
<br />
Nice to see elemental mobs like that, as i not interested in being in a tier 4 guild (not enough time) <br />
<br />
WHy dont someone do a video on each elemental zone, and the inhibitants thereof?  The hitchhikers guide to the planes  :P<br />
<br />
Was the best quality eq movie i have seen, so far....<br />
<br />
[after i turned the music off]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>ReddhawkXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">my plan was to make a video for each elemental god we take down, Fennin was recent and finished the movie, next will most likely be Xegony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Careful folks this may be a virus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">40 meg .wmv a virus?<br />
/boggle<br />
I'd be pretty surprised.  Most people wouldn't waste their time making the movie in the first place...<br />
<br />
Why in the hell would someone want to tarnish their reputation like that, especially with a guild capable of doing those encounters?<br />
<br />
EDIT: WOW.  After watching the video, if this is a virus, it's worth it.<br />
:)<br />
<br />
In other words, NO THIS IS NOT A VIRUS<br />
<br />
And excellent choice of music.  Loved the calming interlude right before Fennin :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">LOL, nice troll Tuffy.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">notice he's posted about 20 random things today, post farming perhaps? )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zammatacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Very good job on the vid ~smiles~ I look forward to seeing more of your work.</div></div><hr />
