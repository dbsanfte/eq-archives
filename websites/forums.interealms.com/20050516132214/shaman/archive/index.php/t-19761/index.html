<br />
<br />
Say I have 1000 pts in Everfrost and 1000 in Guk.<br />

<br />
You &quot;unlock&quot; wayfarer vendors by completing adventures at that vendor. So, if you have 1000 points in Everfrost and 1000 points in Guk, that means you have successfully completed adventures in both those camps. <br />
<br />
If i do that, am i able to Buy from any vendor with any of my points? <br />
<br />
It's like faction. You have to earn the points at each vendor. If you earn 1000 points in Everfrost and have completed 0 adventures in Butcherblock, you still can't buy anything in Butcherblock. If you've earned 1000 points in Everfrost and 1000 points in Guk, you could spend all 2000 points in Guk (on items that don't individually total more than the 1000 points you have unlocked). <br />
<br />
After i spend the points will they still be unlocked <br />
<br />
Yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">basically what it boils down to is that you can spend your points anywhere but you can only buy an item up to the value of what you have earned in that specific camp.<br />
<br />
So lets say you have 1000 in ef, 1000 in guk, 500 in tak 250 in ec. So you've got 2750 points total. You could go to guk or ef and buy 2 1000 point items and have some left over or you could go to tak and buy 5 500 point items etc but you can't buy a 1000 point item in tak even tho you have almost 3000 points to spend.<br />
<br />
Unlocking is what people usually use to decribe when you've earned enough points in that camp to be able to buy anything in that camp.<br />
<br />
In my personal case I've gotten something like 7000 points so far in assorted camps and bought a number of augments. I started off with most my runs happening in ec since i wanted to get bane there and then several people want to unlock the 40hps augments. I got a number of points there and got a couple 40 hps augments but ran out of spots i wanted to put them in so started looking at the 20/20 augment from guk. I went to guk and earned just enough points in guk to be able to buy the 20/20 augment and then ended up buying 3 of those augments before I ever went back and did another guk run.</div></div><hr />
