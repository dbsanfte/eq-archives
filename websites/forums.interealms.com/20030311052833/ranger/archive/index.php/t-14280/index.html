<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BelzarQuickfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">All I hear on my server from the 2 guilds who are in HoH is how much spectral parch drops compared to etheral...  well, we finally did drop aerin'dar first shot we got at him and after a few days in hoh i've seen a whopping 2 drop... just 2...<br />
<br />
anyone confirm if they nerfed the drop rate or if people were full of crap?<br />
<br />
also.. maybe i'm hunting the wrong mobs.  HoH has a whole bunch of new 66-67 mobs in HoH that weren't there pre-patch (I love the rabid wrulan.. feeblemind... lol).  Been killing guardians for the most part tho solo'ers like to claim the rooms for themselves really limits our options.  Any ideas or help is much appreciated.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Taluvan Winterscar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Appeared nerfed. Prior to patch my guild has been farming them and parchments were dropping like rain. I personally soloed 7 parchments (ended up with 4 brushfires /rude verant). Windblade and Girdle of Mithaniel were nerfed around a week prior. The drop rate became so incredibly rare it's not funny. Spectral parchments still drop in HoH and has been comfirmed. But drop rate is alot rarer now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Silvanoshi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">of course, make it harder to get spells that are already a pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>StarGazeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This is actually about the 3rd time they're changed the drop rate on spectral parches there.<br />
<br />
They used to be fairly common... then went to rare...  and now they're pretty scarce =/.<br />
<br />
Does make it kinda of hard for the guilds that didnt get there quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sharidann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">bloody typical :)<br />
<br />
My guild is also flagged for HOH and the drop rates were semi decent till last patch. Was kinda happy to get 2 earthen roots (yeah Im sarcastic :D) Oh well, one of our rangers was happy to fill his spell book and Earthen root is really nice for add parking without risk of mez breaking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Omodan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">On a side note, specs in tactics seem to have been increased significantly.</div></div><hr />
