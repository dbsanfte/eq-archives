<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been reading, but not finding, that there is a quest for the Rune Etched Armor.  Anyone know anything about it?  More info would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah, you can turn in your Rune Etched armor to one of the shaman guildmasters in Plane of Knowledge. In return, you get .25% of lvl 61 exp, or 1% of AAexp plus a random gem. So far I've heard the gem being a peridot, diamond, raw diamond, or blue diamond. Not worth it if you might use your RE sometime again, but much better than just destroying it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hardback</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The quest is simple Rune Etch is the the name of the armor that drops in hate turn in your old hate armor and get a gem usually a blue diamond or other decent gem<br />
<br />
The troll shaman in hte bad part of town gave me the quest</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wampaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You turn in your hate armor to your class trainer in PoK. You dont have to say anything, just hail him. At 59 I turned in 4 pieces and got just over 1 blue of exp in normal exp. I got 1 blue diamond, 2 regular and 1 raw diamond. Not bad since i was just hanging on to that stuff for cr gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks all!! Guess if I get desperate and once I have replaced more of my rune etched armor, I'll head up there and see what I get :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">RE looks too pimp, I ain't giving mine up for a couple hundred pp~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mukkrakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So we know about the Rune Etched one. Tongiht, i wandered everywhere and could not find a shaman trainer who wanted to take the Scaled Heirophant gear. Wanna get rid of it all since I've long since upgraded -- but using the destroy button just seemed sooooo wasteful.<br />
<br />
Guess I'll /bug this and let them know that we won't be discriminated against. :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Where is the guildmaster who gives this quest? I hailed all of them I could find and none said anything about turning in armor. Thanks for any help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fumeden Ex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I THINK his name is Oracle Caldor. Over near the Halas port stone in one of the buildings.  Barbarian fella</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sunbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I never got any of the text but decided to take a chance and give him one of my bracers... it worked!  Got 4% AAxp and 4 peridots for turning in a bracer, legs, boots, and helm.<br />
<br />
My guess is that if you can train with the guy, then you can turn your armor in to him as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Is the gem random, or linked to the piece you give him?<br />
<br />
Well, at least now people will loot armor from PoH... right now most of us pass it up :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks for the info, it is the one near halas. The gems seem to be random as I got a raw or rough diamond for my arms and a peridot for my gaunts and BP. If it were linked to a certain piece, I would think the BP would give a better gem.</div></div><hr />
