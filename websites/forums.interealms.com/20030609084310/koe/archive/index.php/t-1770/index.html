In answer to your question..<br />
<br />
IMHO, it depends on what you get.. 4-6 groups (depending on levels, class mix, etc). I recommend no less than 3 clerics (prefer 4) and 3 chanters. The chanters must be at their best and I think it is one of the hardest tests as far as crowd control goes in the game. (As a side note, I thought the chanters did awesome the other night. Take a bow, you deserve it). After talking to several people, we came to the conclusion that the chanters did most of the tanking the other night.. :) A raid breaker is you need a rogue with 201 lock pick.  A monk is very much a plus for pulling. With the changes to CoH (not sure if they are in or not), you need some type of FD puller to break each of the royal rooms. <br />
<br />
Other things to take into consideration are wipe outs and what to do. It happens.. a lot. I would have some plans in place to deal with this contingency. (Coffins and necro/sk). If you get to the safe hall, CR can be done there. If you get nailed before then, it could be hard to find a spot to start up CR as the dogs see invis and see through rogue sneak. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps and good luck.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ganeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hi all-<br />
<br />
Regarding the CR contingency plan in Chardok...would it be possible to bind a CotH mage and a porter in the safe hall?  That way they could avoid the see-invis dogs, then get right to work pulling in the needed people to start the CR ASAP.  Just make sure some clerics are bound at the zone in to Chardok.  I added the porter due to the fact that the mage would get screwed if he were dropped from the group or otherwise couldnt CotH the proper people over/invite group members, etc.<br />
<br />
Just an idea...would this be possible?<br />
<br />
My only other suggestion is to start the Chardok raids earlier if possible.  My old self barely held on til 4:30 am the other night.  I got rather burned out on EQ, so am gonna take a break for a few days.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Canelek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">OK, I just got 'Summon Corpse' so I will at the very least be available to help in an emergency.  Just give me a tell and I will be there.  I don't have any coffins (not too friendly in Neriak yet), but I will be able to arrange all of that in case of trouble.  (I also got the robe :))  I will park outside of the zone so let me know if you need me for Meat-Shield duty or an emergency CR.  KoE has helped me reclaim the joy that EQ brings as well as helping me when I am slain (thanks Hammer!).  I am at your service on behalf of my beloved guild.<br />

<br />
uncertain work schedule prevented me from signing up earlyer.<br />
I was about to sign up for a stent untill midnight eastern and suggest logging me at the safe hall for half of a CR team. <br />
I'll keep an ear open to see if we can get this going again.</div></div><hr />
