Yes, mage summoned weapons will proc with our true spirit pet. Remember that damage proccing weapons may break root. When you're fighting casters you can equip him with a Gnoll Hide Lariat (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=2665)  which procs stun to help interrupt them (assuming they are level 55 or below).<br />

  He never hits above 60 pts of damage but seems to stay consistent. Now that I can get Virtue for the little blighter and take him with me where ever I go, he has become much more valuable..Also, when you suspend a pet, can you summon another pet and keep the one in suspension as back up?<br />
<br />
Yes, with the second level of suspend minion, you can fully buff and equip your pet, then suspend him and summon another pet. The buff timers are also suspended during this period. In fact, you can cast Quiescence on poochie just before you suspend him and it will still be running when you recall him.<br />
<br />
Remember that suspended pets won't zone with you, so be sure to recall him before you zone or gate.<br />
<br />
I think there's lots of pet info in the Medicine Cabinet for the reading.</div></div><hr />
