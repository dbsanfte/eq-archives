If so, what did you get in return?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lonedar</div><div class="date">10-22-2002, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I talked to an NPC who was in the middle of practising hand to hand fighting with another NPC...he indicated that each guild leader was looking for a certain type of armor.  So if you ask any guild leader &quot;what type of armor are you looking for?&quot;--they should tell you.  The ranger guild leader wanted to replace her &quot;worn out thorny vine armor&quot; and said she would give something in return.<br />
<br />
That's all I know...</div></div><hr />

Still not sure if he meant the whole set or each piece.</div></div><hr />

Not bad, but was hoping for a free upgrade : )  Maybe get an &quot;Improved Thorny Vine Breastplate&quot; or something, i dunno.

Guess it gives a good reason to collect all those rotting drops next time we hit fear or hate, but there is no way I'm giving up my set of TV (minus BP so far) for a few gems.</div></div><hr />

Well here's the quest...<br />
<br />
I wonder if anyone has turned in an entire set yet?  Verant flags characters having completed some quests now, so it's possible after you turn in an entire set theres another quest out there they will give you, although somewhat unlikely.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lonedar</div><div class="date">10-22-2002, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Being as I am still a few levels away from being &quot;plane capable&quot; and looking forward to getting TV to actually wear ... I hope I won't have to roll on peices with other classes that just want it to turn in for gems.  (would be nice if it was coded that only the appropriate class could turn it in).   But maybe I'm being paranoid because I have not yet felt the warmth, joy and love of a plane raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eolair Strongbo</div><div class="date">10-22-2002, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still have my BP, greaves, and gauntlets, not sure if anything else.  I wouldn't turn it in for something like a Blue Diamond as the best prize though.  Its worth more as both a sentimental thing, as well as some back-up gear in case my body is in a tough to reach spot and a little armor would help me get it back.  Besides, if they do this now, maybe they will include a better trade-in later. :p</div></div><hr />

Got a peridot for the helm, and BD for the greaves.  I wasn't really gonna use them again anyway, so no great loss.<br />

I did get 4% of aa xp at 60 with full 100% aa turned on.  So wasn't a total loss.</div></div><hr />

I got an extra Thorny Vine BP for CRs back when I was still wearing one but destroyed the extra one recently when I received a Golden Leaf BP :(  <br />
<br />
No way in hell am I handing in my nearly complete set of Thorny Vine, but it would have been nice to be able to turn in the duplicate.<br />
<br />
Luckily, my guild still does hate and fear for armor for our younger members and epic drops, so I might get some to turn in for some blue diamonds (which will then be turned into a nice bow .. ) :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well...maybe the helm...for some reason the Old World/Kunark Wood Elf Helm strikes me as a nazi one :/</div></div><hr />
