<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Spraggon-Test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Still in Sol A.  Once the goblins have run dry (or a lot of light blues) move onto the gnomes/clockworks part of the dungeon.  These do see invis so you have to fight to the spot, but its still great xp and worth while.<br />
<br />
NOTE:  If you see a gnome pet just standing somewhere by itself, DO NOT use dogdog.  I made this mistake unknowning and got ran down by about 15 gnomes.  The conjurer pet won't aggro you, but will aggro the puppy, which then attacks it back of course which brings its master from who knows where and all the gnome forces they can muster on the way.  Anyway, I haven't used pet here as its too close quarters and pathing is too screwy.  My monk pet works just fine. ;)<br />
<br />
Get the map for Sol A from Questor of Norraths Map shop (Chizuya):<br />
http://www.nx.sakura.ne.jp/~chizuya/indexe.html<br />
<br />
The place to pull to, until you find you are killing so fast you are waiting for more (depends on if monk has haste most likely and how good a FD puller they are) is to the left of the number '1' on that map.  That room is just outside goblin veiw and no gnomes wander up there.  Monk can pull to bottom of stairs to split, then bring it up.  Make sure to snare (if you are a troll of Innoruuk you should have your snare necklace by now, if not shame on you :D )  If no snare root them when low because they will try and run.  <br />
<br />
Use dispel on conjurers to get rid of their damage sheild or it will chew up your monk.  For the most part I just slowed and kept the monk buffed.  On conjurer (mage) or curator (cleric) pulls I would dot and nuke to kill them faster, cleric mobs are the worst cause they greater heal themselves.  Casters are fairly uncommon tho, mostly you'll see clockworks and gnomish miners.<br />
<br />
Once you are outpulling this area and need more to kill (depends mostly on your mana management and if the monk has a haste item) then you can move into the gnome keep area.<br />
<br />
Gnome keep area is the big area on the upper right corner of the map.  To get started pull to the small room to the right of the big room marked with a '5'.  There are about 3 gnomes down in here to split up and thats a good place to start.  Keep moving into the keep area until you get to the big courtyard just outside.  once the front gate spawns are dead you can move accross the courtyard to your spot to sit until you are ready to go.  On the map you'll see a little notch on the far right side of that courtyard.  It is safe to sit and med here and you'll never aggro a gnome, however while the spawns are clear out front I recommend having your monk pull on out and run around to see how screwed up the pathing is here out front.  Just split up all the spawns and pull from back down the hall you came.  <br />
<br />
Gabbie Marbuple(sp?) she is a wizard which we haven't had spawn yet, if she does, make sure to buff your monk with resists (cold,fire,magic) and burn her down fast.<br />
<br />
I believe you can get to 40 here, tho I just hit 38 so not sure how they con at 39th.  Haven't seen any light blues yet at 38th. :)<br />
<br />
Loot is not as good as goblins, but comparible.  Bonus is you get gnome meat for baking fun!!  Gnome Kababs anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dsalcedo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have been fighting here since level 34 with my 2nd comp monk.  It is indeed fast and furious xp.  You can average a level every 2-3 hours or so depending on if you pull the whole castle.  At 39 the experience really starts to fall off, but 40 is doable here as my monk made it to 40 this morning.<br />
<br />
Loot while not great is pretty good.  I have acquired 8 charred guardian shields, and 4 molten cloaks in the past week here.  All in all not a bad haul.</div></div><hr />
