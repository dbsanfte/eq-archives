<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm guessing BoT or HoH perhaps? Just dinged 62 so I can go to BoT now if I want (was keyed for HoH long ago), but I've never been there before. AA xp in HoH was not bad, even with grouping with a lot of 65's I would get an AA every hour 45 or so. Regular xp in HoH, not 100% sure, I do know that I made all of 61 and a yellow of 62 in about 6-7 hours of grinding there.<br />
<br />
I am still a few AA away from canni5, but with not much money and no torpor/malo, I decided to just level to 65 and get the upgraded versions, so I'm mainly interested in regular xp rate, but knowing the aa xp rate would be nice to know also.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At 62-65, I'd do one of the following:<br />
<br />
1) Put a group together yourself.  Paladin/sk, cleric, bard, beastlord, and one other high dps class.  I prefer necros because their group heals and mana regen kick so much ass.  With this makeup, it's basically impossible to run out of mana.  With a knight tanking, you can nuke and dot with impunity.  Go to inner caverns (or any camp) in POV and chain pull.  You can probably get about 15% xp an hour doing this.  That's roughly a yellow and a half in 2 hours of xp grinding.  <br />
<br />
2) Put the same group together and go to BoT and kill the bees (stormriders) up top by the towers.  It's more fun than regular xp grinding because you have to keep moving.  The mobs also heal, so you need to keep pushing them like crazy or have the bard chain mez to interrupt.  <br />
<br />
If you're confident of your group's ability and your gear/spells/skill is sufficient, forgo the cleric and get a knight tank, a bard, and 3 more high dps classes.  A beastlord is ideal because they can often preslow, saving you a lot of time and mana, not to mention beast crack and buffs.<br />
<br />
You can get about 15% an hour xp killing these things at a brisk pace, and the loot is great.  You get tons of EP and SP drops, as well as about 500pp each per hour in splits.  <br />
<br />
<br />
For AA's before the Plane of Fire (I'm not there yet, so I don't know), my favorite xp group is:<br />
<br />
Warrior<br />
Paladin<br />
Ranger<br />
Cleric<br />
Enchanter<br />
Shaman<br />
<br />
We go to tactics, either in the pit or armorer camp, charm a mob, and chain pull mobs.  We all have about 100 aa's average, and pre-elemental tier 1-3 equipment.  <br />
<br />
This nets about an AA every 45 minutes.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It makes baby jebus cry when people solo (or other such horrible time wasting activities) to 65.</div></div><hr />
