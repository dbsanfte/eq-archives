With the tools of slow, buffing, healing, pets, rooting, doting and nuking I can do anything.<br />

I can solo well, I can group well, I can raid well.  Some people might be able to do one of those things better than me, but there is nobody better than me at all of them.<br />
<br />
I am never looking for a group, I make groups.  I have I have five spots available in my group, and with my skills and capabilities I can make any group of 6 work.  <br />
<br />
But over it all I have my pride in my skills and capabilities.  I am a shaman and proud of it, I would not be any other class, for they are all weaker than me.  Each is far more one dimensional that I am.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm fond of telling my BL friend 'nerf BLs'...and he has a druid too and when he mentions he's getting mana regen spells for his druid I'm like, &quot;***, nerf druids too - what crackhead decided to give mana regen to druids?!&quot;  He always replies, &quot;I'd aceept that coming from any class but a shaman.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what this means, but I love my shaman and think the class is nicely diversified, solos better than many, and is a great grouping class.<br />
<br />
I've seen talk here of how shaman need improvements...but I've yet to see any logical arguments for it.  I'd say that shaman have it better than many classes and no class should just utterly dominate the game - what challenge would that be?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fearcazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">He is right! I farm ornate in Sol Ro Tower with a ranger. I'm MT, Slower, Healer, and Buffer. Mana never drops below 80% thanks to my Time's Slow stick. Keep recasting and you'll never lose aggro. Not bad walking out of Sol Ro with ornate for pp and a few AAs.<br />
<br />
Shamans can make groups too I guess but I don't see why we would want a full group unless it's for LDoN.</div></div><hr />

Shammys rule. flat out, hands down, polls are closed. No class is better at us than doing all of our jobs at the same time (i.e. healing, slowing, DoTing, meleeing at the same time).<br />

booya other classes  :p</div></div><hr />

i unlike Veril just said Shamans, meaning the Shaman class in general. i understand why Veril got flamed a bit, for saying &quot;I&quot; in every sentence, but why did i get it? i simply stated what others had also said, that the Shaman class is awsome. *** is so messed up about that?</div></div><hr />

Wasn't a complete flame Sajem, don't get upset. I just find posts about how we are the BEST at EVERYTHING amusing. Granted we are a very versatile and useful class. But why do we have to be the BEST? It always brings a smile to my face when someone proclaims themselves to be above all others. I see the same thing on other class boards, and while some of those boards are just incredibly far off, shaman aren't. We are a great class, with some awesome abilities, and some areas that need work. There are other classes that can pull things off that we couldn't dream of, while we can do things others can't imagine. That is why I highlight these posts. They make me chuckle.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The Vah Shir make the best shaman.  Vah women are much more snuggly.<br />
<br />
Plus there are all the ethical delimas.<br />
<br />
If you take screanshots of a naked Vah Shir... is it considered Kitty Porn?<br />
<br />
And if someone is cybering with a Vah Shir,  is that beastiality?<br />
<br />
Just think about it.  Then you will hate me even more.  :)<br />
<br />
<br />
I do agree in many respects.  I love being a shaman and I enjoy that we are so good at so many things.  I wont say the best, but still very good.<br />
<br />
That is why there is so much jealousy towards us by many classes.  Sure, we are jealous of what others can do - and rightfully so - but others are of us.  I would say that it is a fair indication of balance, though i would not mind more new toys (rather then re-hashes and slight upgrades to things we have had for a while now). :)<br />
<br />
So c'mon, lets make this the official &quot;Shamans rock, everyone else will cover in fear as we evolve into pure light and exist on a temporal plane while they die wishing they were us!&quot; thread.<br />

ok, so i DID overreact. was ticked at the time, and apologize for taking it out on you. <br />
<br />
i meant our ability to do alot of stuff at the same time is the best. Clerics can't slow, heal, DoT, and melee all at the same time. Neither can Necros. Beasties can do all of those, but we're better at it. i realize Shamans aren't the BEST at everything (not best at anything really except slowing) but our ability to do all those roles in the same fight against the same mob &gt; all the other classes. was just my way of saying we're the most VERSATILE class. sorry that it came across wrong  :D<br />
