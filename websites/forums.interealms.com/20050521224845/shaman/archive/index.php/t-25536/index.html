This has changed.<br />
<br />
The only thing required for KT/Yxxta access is the Tipt trial. Vxed/Sewers/Rondo are no longer needed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thats not true. The flag requirements hasn't changed the zone is just bugged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Virulence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've heard from a few different people on this that you indeed only need Tipt now. This could of course just be rumor spreading or a bug as taraddar says, but has a dev or SoE rep come out and said for sure either way?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">well, can't be too hard to test this, can it? for those who are going to be doing the flagging anyway, just do that one first...if it doesn't work, do the others...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's either bugged or changed, but either way only Tipt is required for KT access.  This has been verified by a group in my guild.  The problem is, you cant zone out of KT if you get the flag this way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmm.. well, I guess that I can physically say that some of this is true at least.  I have had Vxed and Smith Rondo for my beastlord for a solid six months, just never finished tipt until a few days ago.  When I finished it, I went to the scribe and got the flag changed to permanent, then zoned into KT.  I thought that all was good and well, until I realized that I couldn't zone out.  I ended up havin to get someone to come out and help me leave.<br />
<br />
I went back to the scribe and finished the flaggin (I honestly thought that I was done, but was just dumb of me not checking first) and when I went back to there I didn't have any problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I believe there is a random bug with zoning out of KT, was mentioned in our guild chat today.<br />
<br />
So. if playing a non-gating class make sure you have a potion or something similar with you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ribeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Confirmed, only Tipt is required atm.  shhhhhhhhhhh.......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Could something in the flags have gotten borked when they added the Vxed part of the warr 1.5 or maybe the new backflagging stuff? Everytime I zone into KT now I get the same message as when I zone into Qvic...wonder if its related.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have only Tipt &amp; i have been into KT &amp; Ikk Trials quite a bit. So I can confirm this to Work. We were even able to Raid(group) someone in as well</div></div><hr />
