<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cranston Stryde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After only having my Spear of Fate for a mere 7 days I noticed something rather peculiar while soloing.  I noticed that when I had solo'd before Epic'd, and after I had aquired it something odd was happening.  Before when I solo'd (56 Iks Shm btw) that pretty much at least 8 of 10 times landing a DOT on a mob would break root. ( I still use good old 14th level root for quick casting time and low mana requirements)  Now after I am Epicfied, that once the Curse of the spirits and root are landed, that my DOT's breaking root has dropped to the 5 of 10 range or so.  Just wondering if anyone else has noticed any similar occurances, or if the change that I am noticing is merely coincidence. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its because the epic dot hasnt a DD component on the cast, unlike all our others dots. DD's tend to break root. Theres a good explantion of how roots work over at the Druids Grove, obviously the roots are druid spells in this case but the explanation at the bottom about root mechanics is true of any of them.<br />

edit: oops, didnt notice you were talking about about landing dots AFTER epic and root, Can't say I've noticed that myself, could be relative level vs mob compared to what you were soloing before, or, as you say, coincidence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cranston Stryde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually no level difference.  56th vs 56th.  Only change in my technique was the Epic dot.  Only gear change was moving my Howling Harpoon out of primary (yeah in main not range, have better range item) and substituted my Spear of Fate.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm, I don't have the epic and &quot;at least 8 out of 10 times&quot; having a DoT with direct damage break root seems too high. &quot;5 of 10 range&quot; seems more like it, actually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">another advantage to the epic is it has low aggro since.  As stated earlier though,  the dd component is what breaks the root</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cranston Stryde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually no House, I was not exagerating about the aproximately 80% root breaking from my standard dot spells.  It was so bad, in my mind that instead of pulling with Turgurs, I got at max Ebolt (hadn't gotten Nife yet, jus did couple days ago) range pulled with that, backed up while spell recovery time is met an mob advances, normally can land a VoS just before melee contact, slap it with Ebreath then root it, back up to sit to heal/med.  I found that this metod worked best for me.  Perhaps employment of say paralizing earth may improve root sticking, but at a high price of mana and spell casting time.  Depending on where I attempt to solo at (when I cannot get a group), I alter my tactics.  But I digress.  Had one person speculate that with the added stats that got increased due to upgrade to Spear of Fate that it may have affected the root holding power.  I do not think that is the case, as the target resists using their MR mainly.  Again, perhaps I may have had the longest string of bad luck with roots breaking pre-Epic, and the luck has went to nuetral and having a more realistic root holding ability.  Or possibly I've had a string of good luck post-Epic with root sticking.  I was just trying to see if anyone else had noticed any difference with pre vs post Epic root stability.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't use root as I prefer immobolize as the DD component seems to break it less. I've never noticed the Epic having any effect on rooting though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I seldom use my other dots at this point as it's too much mana.  I pull with slow, use paralyzing earth (god that spell is sweet, nothing like having a mob just stand there for hte full 2 mins) and then apply the epic dot.  Only use EB when it's a mob with sick hps.<br />
I've definately noticed that the JBB tends to break root less than the DD from EB did.  Even though the EB DD is less than the JBB's, I think the spell's level is somehow considered.<br />
But I havn't noticed any decrease in EB breaking root after the Epic dot is added.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">hrm, if you are only using the epic dot you are doing yourself an injustice if you are soloing. It takes way to long to kill a mob like this.  the only time to use only the epic is if you want to kill a mob while cannibilizing and getting your mana up.  Much more efficient to to pull with slow, epic, something off the poison line, and you and pooch melee it. However, you should do what works for you but experiment with other tactics to see what combo's work best with your gear.</div></div><hr />
