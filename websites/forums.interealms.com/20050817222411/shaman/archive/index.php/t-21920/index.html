As before, I took off my Innovator's Ring to get significantly below 255 STA, then juggled potions, buffs and tribute benfits until I was blue in the face. <br />
<br />
This explains the strange results found in my less thorough parsing over on Gloriana's thread:<br />

<br />
Basically, before 255 STA each individual point adds between 3 and 4 HPs. Post 255, all the way to 305, you need two points of STA for the same effect, just raising STA by one doesn't necessarily raise your HP total. <br />
<br />
And that's pretty much it - it's a straight 50% reduction, achieved by the simple method of making you need 2 STA for a boost rather than a single point. The only fly in the ointment is what happens around 280 STA, which is something I can't explain....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Kudos for the juggling act.<br />
<br />
Any way this can be done on a Tank?<br />
<br />
One arguement sure to get thrown back in our face is that our buffs are more effective for Tanks than for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Any way this can be done on a Tank?<br />
<br />
The only level 65 character I have is my shaman (none of my alts are anywhere near 65). However, over the weekend I'll see if I can nab one of the tanks in my guild and spend half an hour force feeding them potions and casting STA buffs on them.  :p <br />
<br />
<br />

I'd suspect that the same pattern after 255 would be found with the other classes, but until it's tested I can't be sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So, interesting...diminishing returns as we had expected. What we don't know, because at this time we can't crack the stat cap is how much more ineffective each point of sta might be post 305. What if it takes 3 points of sta, or 4 points of sta for a single hitpoint boost over 305?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm not sure we will see diminishing returns over the cap.  In fact, I'd suspect we won't.<br />
<br />
My reasoning is that the stat cap is simply an artificial limit placed on a value.  I'd say that the formula, once it smooths out (around 281 right now), is pretty consistent.  In other words you've probably got something that says &quot;If STA &gt; 280 then add 1 HP per 3 STA&quot; - or whatever the formula is.<br />
<br />
Unless they alter the formulas specifically to account for a new round of stat cap increases, the curve seems set over 280.<br />
<br />
But, what it does show is that STA really means jack and *(&amp;@ over 280.  Even if you extend the cap another 80 points and the double the benefit (for melee characters) . . . you are talking what, 500HP . . . on tanks that have 10k+ HP . . . . facing mobs that can take nearly half their life in one round.<br />
<br />
Take our new focus . . . 700 HP . . . this highly theoretical STA increase of 500 HP . . . 1200 HP total buff from a Shaman . . . facing a mob that can hit for 1000 and quad?  ***?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am just curious if you have the AA Natural Durability?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I vaguely remember testing on the cleric boards showing that wisdom (and presumably int) have another case of diminishing returns past 305. I do not have link handy however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am just curious if you have the AA Natural Durability?<br />
Oops, forgot to mention that in my post - yes, I have ND3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">From what I recall, ND3 does not effect HPs from stamina gains. I think that is correct but I could be wrong I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I am pretty sure that ND3 will take your hp, whatever it is, with whatever buffs or stamina increases and add the percent on top of all of that.  Thats my belief anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">ND affects your buffed stamina + geared HP.  The things it doesn't affect are straight hp buffs like virtue or focus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Impressive work Retron. More solid arguments like this is just what we need to show Rytan when we voice our concerns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'd really like to see this done on someone without any Natural Durability.  There are several bits of oddness about the sta-to-hp curve there, and I'd like to see if they are an indication that the stat convresion is flawed (my assumption), or that ND is being oddly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My first guess would be, those are simple rounding errors.<br />
<br />
Especially when the formula looks something like (ignoring level factor):<br />
<br />
(STA &lt;= 255) * N + (STA &gt; 255) * N/2 + increase_ND<br />
<br />
and each single summand is rounded (probably always down even) separately, you can have errors up to 2 easily. Could explain some of the jumps in Retrons values.<br />
<br />
Just random thinking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'd really like to see this done on someone without any Natural Durability.

<br />
We can factor in the effects of ND3 by removing 10%, the value of ND3, from the HP numbers. Some of the variations we are seeing is from rounding, or as I sometimes suspect simply dropping anything to the right of the decimal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm most interested in that behavior right around n=280.  Strength behaves very oddly starting at 280, and I'll be presenting evidence shortly that dexterity does as well ... I would not at all be surprised if stamina had a discontinuity there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">For priest classes:<br />
At 255 STA or less, each point of STA adds (level/20) HP.<br />
Over 255 STA, the amount is cut in half.<br />
ND3 AA adds 10%.<br />
<br />
65 Shaman with under 255 STA and no ND, 1 STA = 3.25 HP<br />
65 Shaman with over 255 STA and no ND, 1 STA = 1.625 HP<br />
65 Shaman with under 255 STA and ND3, 1 STA = 3.575 HP<br />
65 Shaman with over 255 STA and ND3, 1 STA = 1.7875 HP<br />
<br />
Other classes are different.  I know with warriors their formula changes with levels, at 65 their STA gains are about twice what Shamans get.</div></div><hr />
