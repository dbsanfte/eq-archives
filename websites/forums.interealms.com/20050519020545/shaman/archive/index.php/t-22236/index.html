<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Preferably ones that don't hate my guts :)  I got into the beta a few days ago and have been messing around a bit, but don't know many people.  So I was wondering is any of the usual suspects from around here are in, and willing to give advice to/BS with/kill stuff with a WoW n00b.  I am playing a Tauren Warrior mostly, but of course there is an Orc Shaman named Uggok waiting in the wings... <br />
<br />
The game is fun so far, but I can see some weaknesses too.  Way too early to have any serious opinions yet.<br />
<br />
(I figured it was OK to put this in General, but if you guys want to kick it to the WoW forum that nobody ever reads I guess I understand). <br />
<br />
PS: No, I have not quit EQ, and PLEASE don't turn this into a &quot;WoW ROCKS, EQ SUCKS!!&quot; &quot;NO EQ ROCKS/WOW SUCKS!!&quot; thread.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah.. we still need to talk about that JD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Are you guys still under the NDA?<br />
<br />
Can you maybe just &quot;let slip&quot; something like:<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, when WOW goes live I'll be cancelling my EQ accounts,&quot; or &quot;I though DAOC blew chunks, but WOW really is a techniramic colorspray of crap.&quot; ??<br />
<br />
I was sort of attracted to the Night Elf Hunters, Archers with a pet. (IIRC)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We need to talk about what?!<br />
<br />
And there is no NDA that I know of.  I hope I'm not wrong.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">And Hunters STILL aren't in the game.  /sad I really want to play one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">it's just like with any game out now.. you have some who just love it, and you have others who don't.  Personally.. i'm loving GoD right now and wouldn't even think of leaving EQ for any other game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm still into EQ, moreso now cause of our guild change.  But I reallllllllllllllllllllllllly like WoW.<br />
<br />
WoW is very much more geared toward the casual player right now, I like that since I can't play but every once and again due to EQ taking up most of my computer time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">teases!  Still checking my email daily hoping for an invite. I was hoping for beta so I could get a feel if I wanted to spend my money or stick with EQ. DAoC and SWG especially ticked me off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">At the current point, there is enough entertainment value in WoW to make up for whatever it costs.  I will be buying it.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">just wait JD.. once your guys get past Barxt EQ fun factor will change.  The Barxt script is one of the best scripts overall that I've ever faced, and you will have so much fun in Inktu'tu.  That whole zone is just incredible and you will love the cursecaller event.  It's made for shaman :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oh I don't doubt that.  And I can't wait for it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Got an email that I'm on the list to be in shortly, but didn't specify when that &quot;shortly&quot; was.  Hopefully this week =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>beriah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have been in WoW beta since beta 1.<br />
<br />
Its a really really good game.<br />
<br />
There is not as much content as I would like.. but I am sure they will fix that eventually.<br />
<br />
The graphics are 100X better than EQ, and yet somehow run a lot faster on my computer set to MAX detail.<br />
<br />
I guess its just using the resources of my vid card etc.<br />
<br />
I have a 1.5 GHZ 500MB system with GEFORCE 4ti.<br />
<br />
EQ Barely runs on my system.. lots of graphics lag etc..  and thats with some settings turned down.<br />
<br />
WOW I turn all the settings to MAX and resolution to the highest and I run at a great frame rate with no stutters etc.<br />
<br />
EQ is still more fun for me.. due to the content difference.. but if WOW eventually caught up on content.. I Think it will def. be one of the bigger games.<br />
<br />
I am having a ton of &quot;fun&quot; playing it.<br />
<br />
I guess the other thing is we dont know yet how fun it will be once you max level / items /etc.. ie: high end gameplay ie: raiding etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
just another beastlord class .... wait till they get the shaman totems (they will be called animal totems, the totems only affect your pets and enemies and will be almost identical to the shaman ones &quot;IF&quot; they decide to continue with the class) i play a 30+ shaman and a 30+ rogue</div></div><hr />

<br />
seriously sounds like your raiding some african tribal nation ...<br />
<br />
/insane sarcasm<br />
<br />
&quot;then we killed ikababadoodooday ! and he was soooo hard, he had this blow gun of pwnage and the somolian adds he spawns are sooo fast !&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I emailed them and pulled my application. WoW didn't have that much appeal for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well WoW is great once you get past the initial stages.<br />
The first 10 levels are more a tutorial then actual gameplay.<br />
<br />
But the more I see higher level instances the more I like the game.<br />
Scarlet Monastry was good<br />
Uldaman was better<br />
Zul'Farrak is great<br />
<br />
It feels good to be not dependand on a specific class to do content, it feels good to be able to play long sessions or in short periods and while there are plenty of issues atm Blizzard is listening and trying to work things out.<br />
<br />
PS Uggok if you ever leave the doomed horde side, I can be found in SW on Donal (human warlock). feel free to bugger me with questions</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">One of the differences between the hunter and EQ's beastlord is that they're a ranged class and they can tame and train a wide variety of pets some of which changes they way they play. Apparently balancing that is taking more work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Dang, I'm jealous.<br />
<br />
I think that just like EQ had not all that many zones when it first came out, not to mention events, we can expect that sort of thing to evolve over time with other MMORPG's.  Especially since Blizzard has a rep for taking their time to work out bugs before releasing product.  It's the nature of things that as the game goes on, the worlds in MMORPG's expand.  But first, they're going to start a lot smaller than they eventually become.<br />
<br />
Might be frustrating for some hell-bent ferociously determined power-leveler types at first; haven't played WoW so I don't know.  I'm sure Blizzard won't rest on their laurels after they initially create and market the game, though.  They'll probaby get plenty of money back from the game to keep developing new content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">anyone on WoW beta with dialup? be curious to see how it runs on it.. i played guild wars awhile back when they had the E3 promotion, but that was just horrible on dialup even though they specifically said (and im positive lied) that some of the testers were even on 28k modems</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Stygiana, I think that I will always be a Horde guy at heart, but I do plan on making a few Alliance characters later on to see their zones.  I'll look you up when I do.  Unless we meet on the battlefield first :) <br />
<br />
[disclaimer: I am the worst PvPer that ever lived]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I'm in, but I only pay late at night / early morning after work (I work 3rd shift) when no one is on EQ in my guild.   While its a fun game, EQ takes priority over WoW for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Did any of you see the animation with the WoW orc imitating MC Hammer?  (or whatever his name is...remember the song &quot;hammer time&quot;)<br />
<br />
I saw it yesterday...it was hillarious  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Jaydee, how is the priest class to play?<br />
<br />
Ive been thinking about playing a priest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Speaking of WoW, from the &quot;not so serious angle&quot;, check out these movies. Made in WoW, with some out-of-WoW additions, but in the end, quite entertaining :)<br />
<br />
Hammer time<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
Highway<br />
<br />
Shows that beside the 'serious' working in WoW, people also can and know how to have fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I like my Priest. Seems the most like the EQ Shaman. Wimpy Caster who for the most part can just stand there and take it. Between Shield (rune), Renew (HoT) and other heals, they can take a fair amount of beating.<br />
<br />
My main complaint is that because everyone can solo... grouping becomes 5 people soloing together instead of 1 group. Gets pretty crazy as a healer like that. Worse when they don't speak English. ;)<br />
<br />
I've been a bit turned off by the whole range damage tweak. Haven't played a whole lot since this push/patch/phase hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Played a Tauren Shaman last push to 39 and really enjoyed it.  Felt alittle under powered but the wind totems are still to come.  This push im having a better time since I swaped to the Alliance side.  The horde quests and content are not anywhere near as abundant as what the Alliance has.  The majority of all the content is based around Stormwind atm, but every other major city will be bulked up in time kat said.  <br />
<br />
Playing a Pally now named CeNo on the PvP server.  Shoot me a tell.  Kinda nice playing a tank for a change.  Although i run oom trying to keep mobs tuanted well.  So far I kinda suck in pvp, unless its undead then i just tear them apart. Only lvl 29atm cause with summer here I have been out on the boat too much trying to wakeboard.  <br />
<br />
Ranged damage just seems to not be checking armor, i.e. why your getting hit for max every time from the hunter mobs<br />
<br />
That Highway video must be old, thats the dwarf animation from last push.  Glad they changed it!  The little russian jig he does now is alot nicer.<br />
<br />
Hopefully yall are using the Cosmos UI (http://www.wowmods.com/downloads.php) .  Its so handy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Siroro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Everquest runs on a very old and bad engine. This causes bad lag and why the graphics are bad the fix for this is EQ2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Gumurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I have been thinking about both WoW and Everquest 2, and both seem very appealing to me, the cinematics from both games are amazing so far only difference i see is that World of Warcraft uses mostly hand drawn images where as Everquest2 uses computer generated graphics.  I will have to see when they come out, but i have no decided which game i will go to yet.</div></div><hr />
