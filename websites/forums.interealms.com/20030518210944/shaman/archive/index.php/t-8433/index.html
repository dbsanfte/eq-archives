<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Copper25</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sounds kinda silly but for the simple fact of always being able to med.  Can't really sit in battle because of agro, horse would fix that. Anyone have one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jadii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I picked up one of the cheap ones.. and as i have all of the new graphics off, i have my normal run speed... and i can sit, but my agro seems to be less than it did... even after getting slow/cripple and a heal on the MT off :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Horse is great for not getting sit aggro, but it sucks for regenning hit points.  Basically what I do now is the horse dance, instead of the canni dance :) <br />
<br />
On mob inc I'm usually off the horse, I'll slow and do all that shaman stuff and then pop on the horse and canni down to regain mana.  When the mob turns or when I know I wont get sit aggro I'll jump off and sit to regain hit points.    Alot more fun than canni-dancing mid fight and suddenly finding a mob on top of you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">With replenishment and regen 3, I don't miss the sit regen rate that much.<br />
<br />
Soloing, I pull, then jump on the horse.<br />
<br />
Raiding, I'm on the horse from the moment we set up camp, I click off when we move. In Hate, it's nice to not be the the one on the roamer's hit list... ditto for Fear.<br />
<br />
Grouping, if I am not pulling, I'm on the horse... the mana regen is incredible, and especially when doing constant pulls, I can keep my mana up without much work, often throwing in nukes and BoN to keep my mana occupied.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Copper25</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So while sitting on the horse, you regain mana as in medding but not hit points?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eepjr24</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You regen hit points as if standing. With ikky, regrow, regen III, mine is about 25, so no big worries. With Horse, PoTC earring (small, but hey),  and JBB I am seldom below 50m unless there are more than two on me. The difference was VERY noticeable after I plopped down the 8,399 for my glue factory nag.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Talamorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I took a year off from EQ and i came back about 2 months ago. I was a bit skeptical about spending 10k on a horse, that was a lot of cash for me at the time, all my cash hehehe. But after reading many post i decided to get it. <br />
<br />
It was the best piece of equipment i have purchased since the day i bought my JBB at level 46. I can slow and not have to worry about sit agro. And the rate of mana regen is insane. Yes i have noticed the HP regen is not as good. But its fine, i canni down some, Chloro and my mana regens so quick im usually FM. I even traded my JBB for upgrades since i can canni and use Torrent and be basically back to full Mana in no time with the added damage. I will encourage any young shaman to save their pennys and get a Medding Machine ( horse ) asap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>umpaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">horse rules plain and simple.<br />
<br />
i lose 16 hp/tick regen (trollie + no bear on horse) but i am always medding.  <br />
<br />
mana regen is simply too huge to pass up. i hardly ever get off it. im not sure what the medding rate is but from personal experience the mana regen is faster than canni dancing and you get no sit agro. the horse really isn't that slow either about run 3 i'd say. when crawling around in PoI it aint that hard to keep up with the group while on horse back.<br />
<br />
give your canni finger a break and get a horse. if you have the jbb its even better since you are medding while you are casting a clicky effect. this is also a significant benifit.<br />
<br />
love my donkey!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You lose 16 hp a tick? That can't be right?<br />
<br />
2 points for not being able to use bear form.<br />
<br />
But at level 60 I think a troll gains 18 hp/tick sitting and 12 standing, so you're only losing 6 there.<br />
<br />
I agree with you though - the extra mana from having a horse far outweighs the slight loss of hp regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Copper25</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Got my horse and it's amazing how much Charisma affects pricing when things get this expensive.  Got the black one for abour 9k.  Takes some getting used to, not sure if it better to solo on the horse or off of it.  I am leaning towards soloing without it, seems as if the horse will come in handier when grouped.  Thanks for all of the input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>eepjr24</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Others will probably chime in on this one, but I do solo on my horse. Not constantly, but most of the time. For tricky pulls, I click it off, pull back to camp, then click on while dogdog holds the fort. In some areas I keep it on all the time, but shrink twice to get the head out of my way so I can see. If you do option 1, just keep sow up for when you click off the horse, saves a few secs of casting it. They don't cancel each other out as I originally thought they would.  Lastly, fro looting it is often alot easier to select the corpse from a distance, then run close and do /loot, for those who have trouble looting from the saddle.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Warscar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Remember, if you turn off all luclin models, you can run at SoW speed. You don't need to jump off and jump on horse when pulling. You get all the positives of the horse and none of the negatives.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Does it have to be ALL Luclin models?  Or can I just turn off the pet models?<br />
<br />
I'm a troll, and I ***MUCH*** prefer the new troll models to the old ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Heigelyac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I tried turning off the horse but not the barbarian and the said &quot;you *must* have your latest character model and horse model active to use a horse.  can i get away with turning both off and this will work?   mioght do that for a while...  dunno. not really that inconvenient, just gotta shrink twice when I use da horsie</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Naala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">They must have fixed this &quot;bug&quot; about turning off the horse model and your race model.  When I did this I got a big red message when trying to summon my horse.  Something of the effect of you must have your race and horse models turned on.  So no more doing that I suppose.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I used to have the horse graphics off a long while ago, but they supposedly fixed it so that you couldn't.  I tested it once right after the patch and it didn't work.  I haven't done it since, but they easily could have broken it so that invisible horses work again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">As of last nite, the horse still works fine for me with all Luclin models (incl horse) off.</div></div><hr />
