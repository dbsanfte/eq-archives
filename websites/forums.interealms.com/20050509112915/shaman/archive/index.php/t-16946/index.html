<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Marr.Tevash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The only shaman usable item in the game i could find with quickening of mithaniel is the gleaming mesh girdle off fennin ro. I have wanted this belt for so long but never was able to get one and we have stopped doing fennin ro and moved onto other gods/time as of late. Currently im wearing the VT legs with Wind of the nightcrawler effect....which is the exact same effect of 30% beneficial spell haste. I wanted to get FR belt so i could replace those legs with Elemental or Furious Might. Here is my question: Do any of you know if there will be a 30% beneficial spell haste augment from raids or put into game at vendors? Thank you for any information you can share.</div></div><hr />

Where did you read about the patch on the 8th?  I don't see anything on the upcoming updates page or the scheduled downtime page.</div></div><hr />
