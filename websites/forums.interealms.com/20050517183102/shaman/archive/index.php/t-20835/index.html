EQ Banned <br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Well I have finally 'Banned' EQ from my machine and from my visa account.<br />
<br />
This was decided after continuous infractions against my SSLA (Software Suppliers Licence Agreement). <br />
<br />
The suppliers have a long history of supplying boring, frustrating, broken, timesink filled content, poorly balanced classes, inadequatly tested patches, inability to zone without going under the game world, warping mobs, inability to target or mobs getting stuck on the tall grass, stealth nerfs, intolerable customer service and a perceived arrogance towards their paying customers. <br />
<br />
I have not added the, as yet unproven, claim that they also hire several bogus players and trolls to come on boards, such as this one, to claim all is wonderful and well with EQ to compensate for genuine customers complaints.<br />
<br />
To this record has now also been added extreme cases of DOS (Denial Of Service) caused, it would seem. by the inability to repair broken and/or badly implemented code and hardware such that there is now excessive downtime during what ought to be prime playing hours.<br />
<br />
This together with the fact that at least one other viable supplier may be entering the arena to challenge EQ. WoW (World of Warfare) seems to be just what is required to finally break the unhealthy monopoly held by SOE in this genre of online gaming.<br />
<br />
All of this means that EQ is now banned from my two computer systems and they have lost a monthly billing for 4 accounts.<br />
<br />
If the subject software company wishes to appeal this action they should please send an email, explaining what they commit to do to improve their record and in what timeframe, to: DisgardedGames@ErasedandJunked.sw<br />
<br />
My SSLA can be obtained from: WhatUNeedToDo@ToGetMy.Money<br />

Well, as for the DoS... somewhat I guess... if you pay 12.95/month and are getting constant crashes because of the &quot;new engine&quot; or can't login, and nobody at SOE has a clue (known fact there), denial of service. Simple as that.</div></div><hr />

You expect the odd bug to creep in but not ones that were known about on Test.<br />
Then when they do pop up Sony seem to lazy to fix them but seem more concerned with nerfing other things.<br />

Exactly. I remember designing, writing, testing, and &quot;publishing&quot; my own turn-based strategy game, and before I put anything (anything) live, or even to be tested, I gave it a once over first. Just running through the part I changed/added once to iron out any glitches.<br />
<br />
I made a grand total of $0 for running the thing for a good, long while (it was web-based) and it had less bugs total than EQ has had in the last 6 weeks, and wasn't small by any means either.<br />
<br />
You'd also expect something with the occasional glitch, or something that slipped by but is so weird it's only caught when it goes live... you can't possibly catch every little thing... but give me a break. Some of this is clearly untested, or unfixed, before going live.<br />
<br />
You'd think for 12.95/month... the software and service you pay for, would at least have the decency to test it first (Unfortunately, this has been the case since Luclin).<br />
<br />
One little note: I, personally, gave better &quot;customer service&quot; for $0 for over a year, running a web-based strategy game, than SOE does with EQ (which contains a lot more, obviously untested, bugs) for $12.95/month. I get better CS out of ChiGC's (http://www.chigc.com) ET (Enemy Territory) server, for $0, and more catching of griefers and cheaters, than out of EQ for $12.95.<br />
<br />
Doesn't take a brain surgeon to figure out why that server has 30+ people on it almost 24/7.<br />
<br />
Remember: Speak with the End Billing button! They'll listen then I bet.</div></div><hr />

Omg it's a metaphor, I've actually been like this since birth =oP<br />

<br />
'Retired' is EQ shorthand for 'now spend all the time reading the boards that I used to spend playing', at least on torv =)</div></div><hr />
