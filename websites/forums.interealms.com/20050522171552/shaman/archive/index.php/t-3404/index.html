<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
   I've been trying to upgrade my equipment but as I've been buying items I'm quickly realizing that the gear I'm buying isn't going to meet my desired stats.  I'd like to get my unbuffed AC to around 900 and my unbuffed wis to around 190.  I'd also like to get my resists up to around 50 unbuffed. (I'll buy separate gear for raids).  My defense is not yet maxed, it's at 184 so I expect another ~45ac from maxing it (it just takes forever to raise).  I know the legs suck, I've just been upgrading an item at a time as my mage is able to farm enough cash to do so, I didn't want to waste too much money on middle of the line gear that I'd only throw away anyway.<br />
   Any equipment ideas you might have to reach this goal would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance. :D<br />

Sorry if anyone accessed the magelo site when he was naked, I accidentally overwrote him while trying to figure the site out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You don't specify available budget, but you're rapidly approaching the point where gear upgrades aren't going to be cheap, especially if you're looking for gear that gets you to a strong AC, strong WIS, and decent resist level at the same time.   I'm in a very similar place right now, so I know what you're facing.  :)<br />
<br />
Couple notes before I get started.  First, I'm only listing stuff you can purchase outright.  There might be better and cheaper multiquest/camp options for some slots, but I tend to buy my stuff (habit from my tunnel rat days, I suppose) so I'm more familiar with tradeable items.  Also, some of this stuff is expensive.  To get where you want to go, I'd suggest picking one or two of these out and figuring which would make the biggest impact.  For a &quot;What the the next cheapest version that's still good&quot; option, check my profile (these are mostly the upgrades I'm looking for.)  Oh, and prices vary by server... so my Karana prices might be a little off for you.<br />
<br />
Ears:  Ditch the Forest Loops (if nothing else, a vendor will give you almost 300 pp for each one)- replace one with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=20595&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Imbued Golden Ivory Earring&lt;/a&gt; (this is an easy one- increases your WIS and AC- and super-cheap, 100 pp each max- player made.)  For the second ear, either get another of those... or (if your budget is there) the quest components for the Earring of the Solstice (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=28771) (around 15k for all of the pieces- quest info (http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm13.showMessage?topicID=1402.topic).)<br />
<br />
Face:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=24813&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Arctic Wyvern&lt;/a&gt; is the cheapest way to go (few hundred pp), Mask of War (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3997) is better, Death Mask of the Elysians (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8990) arguably better still.  The latter two will set you back a pretty penny (5-10k, prices vary.)<br />
<br />
Neck:  Shrouded Medallion from Maidens is a nice combination of stats.  I don't have upgrade plans, so I don't know on this slot.<br />
<br />
Fingers:  Grab a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=28708&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Shadel Bandit Ring&lt;/a&gt; (got mine for 2k).  If you're wisdom-centric, keep the golem tear, otherwise swap it our for a 6/65 ring, or something like that,<br />
<br />
Wrists:  Bye bye runed mithril, hello Bracelet of Sense (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8971)  (great stats on this one, good AC, WIS, and saves!)  Another great option are Artificer's Ringmail bracers (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=23668) (player made) - either choice will set you back around 15k each.  Not really a good cheaper upgrade- maybe one of the lower dragonhorn bracers?<br />
<br />
Shoulders:  For the AC and resists, Imbued Granite Spaulders (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=4394) can't be beat.  Prices are falling a bit, too... they've fallen from 15k to closer to 10k lately, now that the Obulus Death Shroud is becoming more popular due to the focus effect.  The death shroud (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=4315) doesn't offer stats like the IGS, but 10% less mana for all of your spells is a nice effect.  Priced similar to the IGS.  Cheap options include the tattered mantle (few hundred pp) or the Chokadai Hide Spaulders (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=4919) (few k).<br />
<br />
Chest:  You're set here until Torpor.<br />
<br />
Back:  Lots of upgrade options here.  For around 3k you could choose between a great WIS cloak (Acrylia Studded (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=6087)) or a great AC/HP cloak (Ancient Seahorse Hide Cloak (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=24736)).  Upgrades from there include the Heirophant's Cloak (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=1622) (around 10k) or the Lodi Shield (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=22816) (lots, 40k?)<br />
<br />
Waist:  The Chitinous Belt (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=28728) has nice stats and is pretty reasonably priced (3k?)... the Artificer's Ringmail  (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=23671) (player made, 15k?) is a great belt for stats.  <br />
<br />
Legs:  Dragonleg Breeches (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/adv_search.html?stn=dragonleg) are around 5k for the cheap ones, and provide nice AC/STA, Jaundiced Bone (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=4534) provides great AC and mana/Wis, and Artificer's Ringmail (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=23676) (player made, probably 25k) provide great AC, Wis/mana, and HP<br />
<br />
Boots:  Not a lot of good choices here.  Barbed Dragonscale (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=25029) (around 5k) would be a minor upgrade.  Flowing Slime Boots (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=27882) are another (expensive, 20k?) alternative- with bad AC but FT3 and nice mana.<br />
<br />
Weapon:  Your epic will help- it's your next major stat upgrade for this slot.  :)<br />
<br />
Shield:  Minimally, get a Sarnak Battle Shield (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=9205)  (nice ac/hp/resists, and cheap at 2k or so) - upgrades from there include the Bone Braced Buckler (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=6440), the Shield of Bane Warding (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=31837), or the Orb of the Infinite Void (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=25098)  (in any case keep the SBS bagged- as the upgrades don't have the SBS's resists.)<br />
<br />
Finally, if you spend much time outdoors, let me recommend a horse.  JBB + Horse = a blast !!!<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />
<br />
P.S.  While saving your coppers, I'd hit Maiden's Eye and grab some of the nice no drop stuff that drops pretty frequently.  Last time I was there I got a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=32318&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Shrouded Medallion&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=32323&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Stone Idol&lt;/a&gt;, both very nice pieces (in the 4-arms camp.)  One of these days I need to go back there and pray for some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=32307&quot;&gt;Divine Inspiration&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;images/smilies/wink.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wow - nice post Biggus :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks Bigguss!  You obviously put a lot of thought into your post and I appreciate it.  I don't really have a price range, I guess under 10-35k per upgrade slot. (it will take me a while to farm that much cash but being a shammy god is worth it :D)  I have higher level chars that can farm the equipment directly rather than purchasing it if it's not too rare of a drop so those ideas are welcome as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nice post, Bigguss.  It should be stickied or put in the FAQ or something!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>dennman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">while we are at it can someone make some suggestions for me?<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=272492 <br />
<br />
just came back from a 9 months break so I am still trying to adopt the new hp&gt;ac&gt;wis theory.<br />
<br />
a lil back ground: i am lvl 60 and I can get about 50-100k pp for upgrading. Most of my factions are bad, excpet i am ally to zek :) I am interested in upgrading the following slots:<br />
<br />
Ears: I have an Imbued Golden Ivory Earring as well.<br />
<br />
Face: I like the resist on my mask, but should I upgrade to Mask of War or Death Mask of the Elysians?<br />
<br />
Bracer: thinking of bracelet of sense<br />
<br />
Feet: I would like to get some FT3 boots but in Terris Thule people are asking 75-100k!<br />
<br />
Shield: I like the resist and stats on Lodi shield, but should I try to go for Orb of the Infinite Void?<br />
<br />
Range: I guess I can try to camp for a Divine Inspiration. so rare tho :(<br />
<br />
I think the rest of the slots are ok until I can get something nice from guild raids. <br />
<br />
thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">heya Dennman.  :)<br />
<br />
buyable stuff<br />
Ears - earring of twisted leaves, earring of solistice rules.<br />
Face - eyepatch of plunder is pretty good<br />
bracer - bracelet of sense is okay, bracelet of fortitude is better<br />
Feet - spirit caller boots are fine<br />
Shield - orb of the infinite void.<br />
Range - Divine inspiration, stone idol(ME), gorganga idol(ME), idol of the thorned..etc.<br />
<br />
You're still in CTV still right?  <br />
one shield you could probably get pretty easy is a shield of the wurms.  or maybe you all don't go to ntov anymore, just live in ssra maybe.  range item that is nice is the itraer insignia too.  :)</div></div><hr />
