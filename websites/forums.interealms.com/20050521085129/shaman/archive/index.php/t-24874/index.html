<br />
Having a blast. Little disorienting in combat and navigating the interface, but easy enough to learn and get used to.<br />
<br />
Since I play EQ1 and EQ2 now I can foresee myself making mistakes in both games because I'll forget what game I'm in.<br />
<br />
I like it a lot so far. LOVE my new house!</div></div><hr />

I am highly enjoying the game thus far.<br />
<br />
Just now it's hard to say but atm it seems to have everything I liked about FFXI coupled with some of the aspects of EQ1 which kept me playing all these years.  Overall I'm pretty happy with the mechanics of the game in general.<br />
<br />
Have no issues with locked encounters as I'm quite used to it from FFXI. Though heals and buffing being only castable in group for a majority are kind of over the top IMO.  They should of just level restricted spells cast on other folks instead IMO /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What level are you? 11<br />
What class are you? shaman (ofcourse)<br />
What server are you on? permafrost<br />
Do you enjoy EQ2 so far? yeah<br />
What are some things the game has going for it? the quest system, it allows you to always have stuff to do. the look and feel<br />
What are some things you dislike about EQ2? im still thinking EQ1 terms and that gets me into problems.<br />
<br />
I do think its worth trying out, I was playing EQ1 on oow/tacvi level, but it just took to much time, so this is a good replacement from that.<br />
now i can play 1-2 hours and log without feeling i should grind the next lvl or AA... just simply enjoy the game again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lolanon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What level are you? 7, 6<br />
What class are you? preist, mage<br />
What server are you on? blackburrow<br />
Do you enjoy EQ2 so far? Loving it.<br />
What are some things the game has going for it? You can play for short periods of time and enjoy the game yet still get some where. Quests, lots of quests, and no more [say me for more confusing quest script]... it just gives you options of what to say.<br />
What are some things you dislike about EQ2? Lag in the main cities, I can have graphics on high in out door zones but go into a city and wow it owns my comp. Only getting 1-2 spells a level is kinda annoying.<br />
<br />
Good game over all, very worth the money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Levels:  7 on evil, 5 on good<br />
Class:  fighter (bruiser), scout (bard)<br />
Server:  Blackburrow<br />
Enjoy:  Sure, when the servers are up.  ;)<br />
Pros:  Pretty, pretty pretty.  The spell effects, the models (for the most part), the creatures (goblins are FANTASTIC).  Lots of quests with worthwhile rewards (i.e. GEAR), and I'm kept pretty busy.  The intro newbie island is great, and I hope there's a lot more like it in the rest of the game, tho I suspect that wont' be the case.  STAY ON THE ISLAND.  Don't be in a hurry to ring that bell.  *grin*<br />
<br />
Cons:  Server performance and uptime (fer crap after the first day, when only preorders and people who had it shipped overnight were logged in).  <br />
<br />
Bugs - since 90% of the people play good, evil quests and content seem sparse and buggy as all get out.  In general, there are a LOT of combat/ability bugs that should in no way still be in a live release.  Track becomes bugged and stops bringing up the track list, and I don't think tracking works at all, since when I select something and hit track, nothing happens.  Some of my characters tend to stop fighting and put away their weapons for no discernable reason in the middle of a fight.  My scout has a tendency to turn her back on her target when I'm in 3rd person, and is unable to fight until I go back into 1st person to face the creature.<br />
<br />
Jury's still out on the game itself.  It's hard, though, not to compare it to WoW, which is 20x more complete and polished in open beta than this thing is at release.  Not surprised, but disappointed.<br />
<br />
Other than the bugs, they're vastly different games, and IF they get the bugs worked out, I'm likely to keep an active subscription to both, providing gameplay doesn't become significantly less enjoyable than it is at these low levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Funny you should mention server performance after day 1. A friend of mine that made a ranger on Najena with a big group of friends we have on there deleted his Ranger and said he's playing on another server because he can't handle the lag and the full server.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing it's going to be that way on all the servers sooner or later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Lvl 16 Shaman Lvl 8 Artisian on the Butcherblock server.  I love this game so far..  The mix up of spells and to start fresh with everyone else.  Well right now the combat is the only thing I dislike gosh golly Im glad I picked Mystic as my goal 8P.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What level are you? 14 (9 artisan)<br />
What class are you? Shaman<br />
What server are you on? Kithicor<br />
Do you enjoy EQ2 so far? Yes, greatly.<br />
What are some things the game has going for it? It's fun &quot;again&quot;.<br />
What are some things you dislike about EQ2? Super high system requirements.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as server stability goes, I haven't had any problems on Kithicor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Qeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What level are you? 4<br />
What class are you? umm. fighter<br />
What server are you on? not really sure/<br />
Do you enjoy EQ2 so far? Oh yeah<br />
What are some things the game has going for it? Graphics, quests, fighting, i could list more.<br />
<br />
What are some things you dislike about EQ2? I can't run it with all my setting on high at 1280x1024<br />
<br />
Basically i've only been able to play for around 3 or so hours. I'm loving my fighter, but i spent last night basically tweaking the graphics. May not sound fun to you, but it does to me! It was fun to see what which did and how it impacted my FPS.</div></div><hr />

I love EQ 2 it has a great mix of features that were great from other games.<br />
I do wish they would change some of the quest rewards to give more vareity. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What level are you? 12<br />
What class are you? Shaman<br />

Do you enjoy EQ2 so far? Yes<br />
What are some things the game has going for it? Fast paced combat, good class balancing, well implemented death system<br />
What are some things you dislike about EQ2? Spliting the player base in half between two cities without offering a decent gameplay reason for doing it (i.e. PvP between Qeynos/Freeport citizens)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">14 ENC on Mistmoore, fairly fun so far but not without it's frustrations as well.<br />
<br />
PROS:<br />
-Looks are obviously a biggun if you have a system that can show it all.  <br />
-Gameplay is pretty good, fights and crafting are more interactive with the combat wheel and the little things that go wrong during crafting that you have to respond to.  <br />
-Levelling so far seems at about the right pace and if you don't want to just grind you can do quests which, if nothing else, diminishes the feeling that you're grinding.<br />
-Tons of quests and a wide variety in types of quests that I've found.<br />
<br />
CONS:<br />
-Good/Evil split forcing players apart in a game that has no PVP doesn't make sense IMO.<br />
-Crafting is frustrating as hell to get started in.  Could use a lot more in-game explanation.<br />
-Lack of good explanation of the combat wheel/HOs and how they work in game.<br />
-Seem to be a lot more bugs in game still than WoW (nothing major that I've encountered, just not as polished)<br />
-System requirements soo high.</div></div><hr />
