<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thornebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know this Topic is nothing new but just to add my experience and 2 cents.<br />
<br />
Now I am not going to list any thing for class balancing for us.<br />
<br />
But when I first started playing EQ I was a War. I made it up to lvl56 and the Time that I was hanging out in KC for EXP SoV was still the new expansion.<br />
<br />
I had a Shaman Friend that I hung out with a lot. (and just to site one expereince) I can remember Trying to Hold a CY in KC and when my Friend would join the group. I could always remember. Now Its Time To ROCK The House!<br />
<br />
As a War I felt 5 Times larger then life when a Shaman would join the group.<br />
<br />
Once I started playing a Shaman I remember Other Melee's expression the same Feeling when I join their group.<br />
<br />
We are no longer the Melee's Best Friend. IMHO.<br />
<br />
This is what I feel that we have lost as Shaman's and what we are trying to find again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hehe yeah, I remember grouping up in KC on one of my original characters in the Kunark era.  Shaman there were in some crazily high demand, it seemed.  There'd be woohoo'ing all around whenever one joined, and there were a couple Shaman who were known by the main KC Exp crowd by name, and were fought over when they zoned in.  It's sad, but that desirability seems to have long since faded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Must be what enc's and cleric's feel like now.<br />
<br />
Sitting outside vxed/tipt... waiting...waiting... WOHOOO!!! Enc inc!!!!  Wait a bit more, wait some more... WOHOOO!! Cleric inc!!!!, now we can actually do this! hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I recall when I was in my 50's and I got into a few KC groups that were F-U-N.  In a couple I was the only caster, I'd heal (didn't have to heal much), CC with root and slow, and even melee (limited, basically did damage till melee peeled it off), nuke and DoT.  It was beautiful, fights didn't last too long, but long enough for slow and DoTs to make an effective difference.  My buffs were helpful and guys runing parsers could see the difference.  In those days I heard plenty of &quot;that's my best hit ever!&quot; and stuff like that.  While some of that carried over till the time I quit, it was obvious that in full groups bent on DPS I wasn't as effective (ran private tests, stopped slowing for X number of mobs and checked to see if the cleric bot healed more, noticed the DPS differences between ToA and SLTW on the SK MA was marginal, that stat buffs had almost no impact on combat from active parses).  The game had changed, my class really hadn't.  I wasn't useless, but the times I really made a difference became fewer and fewer and more specific (I rocked on overpulls, but with 1 harmony puller, 2 FDers and 2 pacifiers rotated in and out of the party, we didn't overpull as much).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wait - it's only on test.<br />
<br />
They'll fix us after the expansion is shipped.<br />
<br />
Shaman are fine, I heal just great in Droga PL'ing my friends {insert class here}.<br />
<br />
We're not broken, I can solo {Insert MOB here}<br />
<br />
We don't need 'X', we need 'Y'.<br />
<br />
As somebody on this board, much wiser than me said,<br />
<br />
&quot;Once long ago, we scored four touchdowns in high school, now we just sell shoes.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thornebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I really do miss the Days of EXP Grid in DL at the Ruins.<br />
And Trying to Hold The CY's in Train City called KC.<br />
<br />
Adds or Over Pulls where life hung on a thin String hearing group tells of OOM!! and thinking if we can just hold on a little longer things will be fine. Hoping the Root lasts long enough. That the Haste does not Fade.<br />
<br />
Or Other Times like that but you would have still to run for the zone and then fight a short way back in.<br />
<br />
but during all of that. Our Buffs made the Melee's more capable of handing over pulls or adds. we could park root. (dont see people doing that any more these days?) throw a couple of quick heals while the main healer is resting after going OOM and trying to get mana back. drop a DoT and know it made a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aurigabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For a single class duo partner, the Shaman IS still the melee's best friend. No other class has the combination of haste/slow/heals (and buffs to some degree) that melee's need to xp effectively, IMO. Why do you think there are so many shammy bots out there? ;)<br />
<br />
Shaman aren't being replaced by a single class, but by a combination of classes. Enchanter+cleric can provide all key shaman abilities plus CC and DPS with charm. Cleric+Beastlord cover the required haste/slow/heals bases and the beastlord has sick DPS to boot. Probably even BL/Druid works in the vast majority of xp situations.  <br />
<br />
Add to that the fact that full groups are by far the most efficient way to xp and having a &quot;jack of all trades, master of none&quot; shaman in the group seems less desirable. Just pick a combo of classes that covers haste/slow/heals and get as much dps as you can in the process. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Back then in the days of old. Efficiancy mattered. Fights took longer. And Mana regen was not even 1/10th of what it is now. <br />
<br />
Now people just brute force with heals and take the 30 seconds required to recover. <br />
<br />
It has become &quot;encounters&quot; Rather than a world. The tag line should really read  You are in our &quot;Encounter Area&quot; now! <br />
<br />
The arcade feeling of EQ has never been stronger. And that has truly lost something.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">All i have to say, is its a whole lot different from raiders - casuals.  I am still very welcome and accepted into grps by my friends and smaller guilds.  But that is only cause the people i grp with are like me.  65ish, average gear, average gaming experience.  That is one reason i have yet to join a raiding guild, i like it where i am  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup yup, same story here. Level 65, casual, mediocre equipment, a few AAs here and there, but having a good time with my friends and guildies in LDoN, PoP, Droga, Hate, Veksar, etc. All places where I can slow, heal, DOT, tank, nuke, pull, and/or CC depending on the circumstances. Or do all of the above as was the case the other night. As long as I am online, we have an instant group and can go hunting for fun and profit. Compared to most of my friends' characters, my Shaman is positively overpowered in groups and that even includes a Beastlord with 100+ AAs more than me.<br />
<br />
Steady character progression against moderately challenging opponents in pleasant company is all I want from the game. I am happy with the fact that there is a variety of content that meets my needs and I can pick and choose just how challenging I want any particular evening to be.<br />
<br />
Of course, it doesn't mean that Shamans don't have problems in GoD, it just means that there is enough lower level content in the game that at this time many Shamans who are not into big time raiding are not seriously affected by these problems.</div></div><hr />

That sums up what I want from EQ 100%. Nicely put. :)</div></div><hr />
