<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Meiamour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello I hope someone out there can help me. I have a question....I need to get pants for my Mage. She is currently pantless right now and would like to pick anyones brains on what to get her. Right now her Intelligence is at 208 so I really do not need anything with Int in it. I am thinking more of Mana and resists so any help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
She is an Erudin also incase you need that info too.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advanced for any help you can give me :)<br />
<br />
Hugs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Falamil Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Quick and easy, Falamil can make you some tailored crystalline silk pantaloons.  They are AC 5 or 6 and a magic resist.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Otherwise, the giants in the Kael arena drop leggings that are AC 11 and 3 INT.  Wearable by any caster class, and all medium and large races ( no gnomes, dammit!  ).  You might ask those you catch hunting down there to save you a set, as they aren't no drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Meiamour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks Fal I would love some crystalline pants. Just tell me what I need to get for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fanadile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't EVER say you don't need an item with INT on it.  The reason being is sometimes you can increase your INT on part of your body and strip it off another for a better +mana/resists/stats/etc piece.<br />
<br />
As far as leggings it would also depend on your budget and what you are interested in.  Some suggestions:<br />
<br />
Netted Kelp Leggings: nice stats including +6int and svF, drops in SG<br />
Hand Woven Leggings: AC8 with +10svF, random of sarnaks in LoIO<br />
Loam Encrusted Leggings: +2int with other nice stats and i think svF, drops in The Hole<br />
Silversilk Leggings: AC4 +4agi +15hps if I remember correctly, been a long time since i camped Magi =P</div></div><hr />
