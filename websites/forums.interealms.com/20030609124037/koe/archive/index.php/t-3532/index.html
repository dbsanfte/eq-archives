<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Windigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I brought my pottery up enought o make Thurg gate potions, and I have fletching up at about 140 so I can make my own arrows and some bows for the newbie folks when I get bored.  Does the guild need more people with a certain skill?  It used to be that it was just something fun to make things, but now there are a lot of useful items that can be made for quests.  I'd like to help and take up another skill if there is a need for a certain one.  I can't be a poison or potion maker.  I do have a 23 gnome to start tinkering with, and everything else is open I think.</div></div><hr />
