<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">greetings, right now your thinking, walk through ? is it that hard ?<br />
<br />
<br />
well yes, it is hard, but worth the journey.<br />
<br />
<br />
to start, you recieve the WC (wailing caves) quests, inside the left eye socket of the giant skull entrance to WC. WC is in the oasis south west of cross roads, watch out for the koltar :P<br />
<br />
you should get one in ratchet too, 99 year old port, i only saw the goblin once out of 6 clears of WC.<br />
<br />
you will have the extermination quest, killing of the evil druid leaders, serpent blossom (from Thunder Bluff in the caves below the elder rise) if there is anymore im too tired to think.<br />
<br />
in WC its a small dungeon, you will get multiples, at least 2 at a time, blobs duplicate themselves befor they die if you let them do it. the winged serpents poison, the raptors can sneak and hide and backstab, <br />
stay to the right of the water deeper in the cave, you will fall in a hole if you don't watch your step, head a lil further into the instance this is where the fun begins ....<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
                                     the instance.<br />
<br />
once inside, its a whole new ball game, mobs hit harder, faster, more frequent, and there are spell casters (druids) they cast sleep, this is a good time to have a shaman to use tremor totems.<br />
you will see a druid upon entering, hes a good guy, talk to him he will buff you for free, and give you quests.<br />
<br />
-killing the serpent leaders-<br />
<br />
1. lady anacondra, the first leader to kill is near the sleeping druid, she casts sleep alot, and turns into a serpent to dot you and do more damage, she heals when low on life. and average group of lvl 19 can take her.<br />

http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=3039<br />
<br />
2. lord cobrahn, go east in the water withthe crocs, you can kill the vipers on the way for the eradication quest. he does almost the same as anacondra, except he does more melee damage. and has large ammounts of adds near by.<br />
http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=6460<br />
http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=10410<br />
<br />
3. lord pythas, hes in the winding caverns, he has lots of these little root mobs around him, they hit fast but have no hps, use AE spells on them, like shaman fire blast totem or mage nukes. hes not as hard as cobrahn or anacondra once his adds are killed.<br />
http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=6472<br />
<br />
4. lord serpentis, hes a son of a b*tch, hes tough, hes green (and he killed duke in the G.I. joe movie :P) he is tough, have potions on hand for everyone, he has a bad way of chain casting nukes on your healers. his biggest buddy is just a step away, don't let him run to him.<br />

http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=6469<br />
<br />
5. Verdan the Everliving, the giant elemental, serpentis's buddy, hes lvl 22 he HITS like rosanne bar at a buffet, chain heal your tank after debuffs, totems and HoT's. <br />

<br />
after you clear this room, drop down the far side of the room into that tunnel, it takes you to the entrance (WoW quest desingers and dungeon designers thought of it all !)<br />
<br />
all of these mobs drop amazing loot.<br />
<br />
<br />
but they are not what your after !<br />
you have to free the druid leader from the nightmare of the emerald dream! its your duty, your quest !<br />
once you defeat the leaders, return to the taureen druid, he will begin the real QUEST !.<br />
protect him at all costs, he will heal, nuke, and do his best o help you (i love WoW ai, he even buffs you when your buffs wear off !)<br />
you will begin the waking ritual, and fight waves of mobs each harder and harder until you fight ...<br />
<br />
Mutanus the Devourer   <br />
<br />
a huge froglike being (murlock) from the corrupted emerald dreamscape.<br />
he hits like a peterville truck, he has more hitpoints that your entire party at this point and ... he tastes like chicken !<br />
once he dies his most rare drops are<br />
http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=6463<br />
http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=6627<br />
http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=6461<br />
<br />
 and he drops http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=10441 for a quest after !<br />
<br />
-making the group-<br />
include a shaman, they can interrupt casters and add substantial dps, rogue is a great addition so is mage and warlocks, the rest is up to you.<br />
at lvl 20 i main healed the whole adventure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i will be making one for shadow fang keep (a must) and maybe rage fire (haven't done ragefire)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">forgot to add TRIGORE THE LASHER lvl 19 elite drops<br />
http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=5426<br />
i think hes a random spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Waking the guy at the end was bugged for us.<br />
We killed all the named guys to complete all of our quests.<br />
We returned to the guy at the zone in.<br />
He didn't do anything for us.<br />
<br />
Was kind of lame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oh, ya.  The goblin is near the zone in.  He's stealthed.  If you hug the right wall right after you enter the dungeon in Barrens, he's in the first alcove there.  He also spawns on the left hand side tunnel just a short ways in, before you get to the pool of water with the 2 sea monsters in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You forgot Scum the thunder lizard near Lord Pythas (I think) .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Torlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This is a fun, fun instance. I was lucky enough to get the Shoulder item for my Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Glencannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I spent two hours going through this instance yesterday.  Pick-up group. Warrior, hunter, mage, shaman, shaman.  Other shaman leaves halfway through.  We wiped only once (still not sure where the adds came from).<br />
<br />
I played EQ for 5 years.  I have to be honest: when we finished this instance, and finished the scripted event at the end, I realized I had just had more fun than at anytime in my EQ life.  With just four people.<br />
<br />
And I finished *six* quests at the same time.  Hello, half a level of experience from quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah, fun place for sure.<br />
<br />
You can also get the Wailing Essence quest from Ratchet to do in here.  This is the second part after you turn in some scythemaw horns.<br />
<br />
Script at the end worked fine for us.  First wave was I think 3 mobs coming, second was 6 and I think the named came on the 3rd?  Can't remember exactly.  Very cool stuff.<br />
