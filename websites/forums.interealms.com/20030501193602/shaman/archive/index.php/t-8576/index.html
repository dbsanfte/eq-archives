(thread titled &quot;longest post ever&quot; by Holocron)<br />
<br />
Particularly the second half where he discusses MMOGS with movie-sized budgets and alternate revenue streams (though the single character vs multi character server thing is interesting too.  Very interesting reading (Designer Dragon often is).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I started off mildly interested in Mr. Koster's reasoning behind single character per server (SCS) and indifferent to SWG because of the Sci Fi genre.  By the end I strongly disliked him as a person.  That was a fat lot of BS.<br />
<br />
You see, our characters are much more expensive to store than those of other games because <br />
<br />
Give me a break.  Storage is cheap and grows cheaper by the minute.  I just built a PC with a harddrive larger than the collective electronic storage of the planet 20 years ago.<br />
<br />
MCS is needed to allow multiple members of the same family to play together with only one account.<br />
<br />
Now, looking at the legal reality, the fact is that the EULA disallows this. It disallows it in most of the games.<br />
<br />
Notice how he just referred to the EULA as if it were the US Constitution?  He spins it into something external, fixed and unrefutable.  You know what EULA's means?  To them, it's the pro-corporation consumer laws that congress wouldn't pass and to me it's another word for 'shrinkwrap'.  <br />
<br />
He likens multiple characters per account to getting cable to several rooms in your house.  WRONG.  You can watch multple cable extensions at the SAME TIME.  It's more like being able to watch one channel at a time, but being able to change that channel.  Hey, like it is now.<br />
<br />
Many have commented that MMORPGs are probably far too CHEAP for the market they are mining; when UO launched and set the monthly flat fee at $10, it probably lowballed the amount people would be willing to pay by a factor of two or three.<br />
<br />
Lowballed?  LOL.  Go ask accounting what percentage of EQ's earnings come from Stormhammer.<br />
<br />
SWG is doomed if that's the CS attitude they have even before it ships.  He's defending forced grouping by quoting nameless biologists? Riiiiiiiiiight.  The whole post is, &quot;we want to give you less and charge you more.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Sorry, I rather doubt this.  Did you take into account the bank of computers that the CIA was running that was controlling what we were thinking by sending microwave broadcasts into our heads?

It's interesting reading all the fanboy comments.  One guy said he was going to save the post on floppy in case his computer died.  <br />
<br />
To recap, Star Wars Galaxies will feature one character per server.  One of the developers makes a long, spin-doctoring post on why it's so wonderful that you get less flexibility and value for the higher subscription rate.  It reads like a car saleman explaining why you should pay double so he can have a new boat.</div></div><hr />

It will encourage multiple accounts, but it will also probably help dedicated craftspeople by lessening the number of tradeskill mules.  <br />
<br />
The more interesting stuff was the fact that there are games with 100+ person staffs and 8 figure budgets already, and the fact that companies will have to rely heavily on non-subscription revenues to provide more services.<br />
<br />
I agree with him that prices are probably too low right now.  People don't spend $40 for Stormhammer because they can get pretty much the same thing for $13.  I think there are a good number of folks who would pay $40 for something that was actually better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tradeskills mules are still players.  They are still craftsman.  To read his phraseology, you'd think they were ebay'd robots who run &quot;legitimate&quot; tradespeople out of town faster than Walmart.  Going single character reduces the options for players who enjoy doing tradeskills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Chouka, they always close threads with 400+ posts there, they opened a new one with the same title and the same post from Koster titled &quot;part 2&quot; which is the typical practice there.  The flamewar rolls on!<br />
<br />
Good point though Barm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sentok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Just read the first 5 or 6 pages, and I thought it was odd that he emphasized the cost of storage as much as he did.  They must be storing a heck of a lot of information about a character if they are truly concerned about character storage, I don't particularly buy into him.   But why not say an account is limited to 10 characters across all servers? That way I could have 10 characters on 1 server, or 1 character on 10 different servers, or some intermediary combination. The storage requirements would be the same. <br />
<br />
He just didn't emphasize the gameplay reasons enough to convince me that it is in my best interest to only have one character per server. Curtailing misbehavior seems to be the biggest reason, I can go along with that. I just can't buy the others.  <br />
<br />
How does only having one character encourage interdependence? I don't see how me having multiple characters, of which I can only play one at a time, discourages interdependence, other than for some mundane things. (weapon repair or something similar)<br />
<br />
Cutting off level 1 tradeskillers I can sorta see, but I can think of better ways to do this if you want trades to only be viable to &quot;real&quot; characters. (level-based self-imbues or something).  <br />
<br />
Mules? Mules shouldn't exist period, it's ridiculous that we need two and three characters spread around the world to hold all the keys, backup gear, quest pieces, tradeskill ingredients, etc.  Eliminate the need for storage mules, and you eliminate the level 1s with an inventory full of backpacks of Misty Thicket Picnic ingredients.  Players would gladly accept that change.<br />
<br />
I've played MUDs where you were only allowed one character, but they were such that you could appear into the world and rather quickly be &quot;geared up.&quot; i.e. no months of levelling to catch up to people.  And they tended to be very RP-intensive and conversation-based, not combat/gear/progression-based.  <br />
<br />
The cable TV analogy of his was pretty poor too, it left a pretty gaping hole for arguments. Color me unimpressed.  They do have some inspired fanboys though, I'll give em that :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Selkie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">“But this is a game! I’m here to relax!” <br />
Yes, you may be here to relax, but no, it isn’t just a game. It is a new medium of entertainment with its own rules.<br />
<br />
*snort*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Deathwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">1 character per server?  Wow, that's pretty bad move on their part.  I think that's on the same level as Germany starting war with Russia during WW2.  It will lead to their end, and the game isn't even released yet.  Do they realize that most of the people that will be buying that game are veteran EQ players?  Yeah, there will be lots of star wars fanboys(anyone see that conan o'brien episode where Triumph was making fun of them?), but that is not going to be the core of their gaming community.<br />
<br />
The players that will stick with this game are going to be people that have already played MMOG's.  MMOG's are simply too old to be a 'new' genre to try.  Anyone with a desire or penchant to play an MMOG like SWG would have already picked up EQ or, *shudder* Crap Ages of Crapalot.  My point here is that they are used to multiple characters per server.  This isn't a small thing.  It's great that you are allowed to play an alt if you get sick of your shaman.  <br />
<br />
And this customer service, wow, that's pretty bad.  And this is coming from someone used to VI's crap.  Their spin-doctoring covered up nothing; lucasarts is a money-grubbing company that puts out terrible games.  I mean, they don't even do their own games anymore, they outsource most of them.  Name the last great game that Lucasarts did, and then go further back probably because some other company did it.  Grim Fandego maybe?  Tie-fighter?(wow, that's old-school)<br />
<br />
Edit: read more of the post<br />
<br />
This all seems to boil down to this: hey guys, we designed the game this way, so we have to go with SCS so that tradeskillers don't break the delicate system we setup.  So, f**k you, and give us the money.  And the fan boys are just rolling over!<br />
<br />
In a business sense, that's fine.  I get pissed off by the sheer egotistical manner that Holo, or whatever his name is, shoves down our throats.  They need to get a better grip on reality before they about making huge changes.  Not everyone is making their MMOG's that way, and there are no market trends(that would certainly defeat competiteness in this type of market, eh?).<br />
<br />
They need to make a forum for non-fanboys only so they see all the stupid shyte they are doing to the game.  If SWG really costs that much, maybe this business &quot;snafu&quot; will cause LucasArts to think more before releasing crap with their name on it(see above).</div></div><hr />

You realize he's NOT talking just about hard drive space?  No you probably wouldn't as it seems you didn't give even a second of thought to what was being said.  If you would have you woulda though about how EQ has 8 slots per server and how many servers?  Now take that number and multiply by 300,000.  Then multiply that by at least 2 to take into account a raid setup.  Then probably double it again so you can account for a backup.  Now take your &quot;cheap&quot; storage that you think you know all about and triple the cost because YOU aren't buying the storage, you are paying someone ELSE to do it.  Remember THEY do NOT OWN THE SERVERS!  They lease/rent them from another company and that's NOT cheap.<br />

Actually his analagy is true and accurate.  Quite a few cable companies don't legally allow you to siphon cable to every room.  Many want you to have a converter in each room and then pay a fee every month for each converter.  So the analagy holds.  The EULA doesn't allow multipl users per account either, same thing.  You CAN watch multiple cable extensions at the same time but by doing so you are usually committing signal theft.  The analagy you came up with is just plain wrong, and stupid.<br />

Once again if you knew what you were talking about you'd be slightly dangerous.  When UO came out, most of the onlin games out there were still following a pay by the hour price model which got VERY expensive VERY fast.  THis is what he's referring to.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm tired of pointing out how wrong you are, and i'm sure you get the point by now that you dont' know jack squat.  I suggest you go and re read the post and this time think first before opening your immense yap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So you are saying that there are 300,000 customers on each server?<br />

Hmmmm....</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
And now take that cost and cut it in half again because the great benefit of lease/renting is that you aren't paying people to support them.  <br />
<br />
The cable analogy I saw as flawed because of the following: <br />
I have a cable tv in my living room.  I can sit down and watch a football game I like, and then when it's done I turn it off.  Now my girlfriend comes over and watches Sex and the City. Note that i cannot watch football at the same time. That's the closest cable tv analogy I can think of to having multiple characters on a single account.   Having the tv in multiple rooms (so we could watch Sex and the City and football at the same time) would be more analagous to installing the same instance on multiple computers so you could play multiple characters at once for a single subscription fee.<br />
<br />
I agree with him that the market got lowballed by the $10 a month fee though, rest assured that will rise and people will continue to pay - MMOGs right now are ridiculously underpriced - people have gotten hundreds of real life days of enjoyment for the cost of a weekend ski trip.<br />
<br />
Again, I am not totally against this idea, I can see some reasons for it. (cross team spies in PVP *suck*)  I just think that this article wasn't entirely forthright.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Personally i think you should know *** your talking about before bashing someone and doing it so lengthily. <br />

Well, as a professional system's administrator and having played computer games since the Apple 1, I think maybe I do know what I'm talking about -- but feel free to personally attack me anyways Doctor Ogrym.<br />
<br />
You realize he's NOT talking just about hard drive space? No you probably wouldn't as it seems you didn't give even a second of thought to what was being said. <br />
<br />
I do think he's talking about electronic storage.  Probably because that's what he said he was talking about.<br />
<br />
Remember THEY do NOT OWN THE SERVERS! They lease/rent them from another company and that's NOT cheap. <br />
<br />
I don't know what you're basing that statement on but I would be highly surprised if they did not own their own servers.  Outsourcing electronic storage has diminishing returns as the amount of data increases, not to mention supporting a massive, custom application.  It would be way cheaper to build and maintain your own servers than to pay X per megabyte to support half a million customers.  You don't cut deals with geocities for MMORPGS.<br />
<br />
Quite a few cable companies don't legally allow you to siphon cable to every room. Many want you to have a converter in each room and then pay a fee every month for each converter. So the analagy holds.<br />
<br />
You were questioning my reading comprehension?  Let me say it again slowly.  <br />
<br />
One cable connection &amp; one TV.  You watch various channels -- one at a time.  <br />
<br />
One game account &amp; one computer.  You play various characters -- one at a time.<br />
<br />
With me?  No one is splicing cable through the whole house.<br />
<br />
Once again if you knew what you were talking about you'd be slightly dangerous. When UO came out, most of the onlin games out there were still following a pay by the hour price model which got VERY expensive VERY fast. THis is what he's referring to. <br />
<br />
No, he never mentioned per hour pricing.  His comment was that UO charged $10/month when &quot;some&quot; felt they could have charged 2x or 3x that amount.<br />
<br />
I'm tired of pointing out how wrong you are, and i'm sure you get the point by now that you dont' know jack squat. I suggest you go and re read the post and this time think first before opening your immense yap.<br />
<br />
Somehow, I don't feel too humbled.  Probably because you were consistently mistaken in what you said.  Remember kids, stay in school and don't do drugs.<br />

Barm makes several good points about flaws in Holo's arguments without insulting anyone.  Ogrym responds with an insult ridden post that is pretty weak (imo).  Ogrym, take of the princess leia earmuffs and put down the double lightsaber.  <br />
<br />
Back to the original topic:  I think Holo is doing a spin job, pure and simple...which is probably his job at SWG.  It all boils down to money.  His entire post could be summed up as thus:<br />
<br />
Hey, it's entirely too expensive for us to allow you to have multiple chars.  If we did, we'd need to charge you a monthy fee that no one would accept.  Besides, SCS is easier on us.</div></div><hr />

FWIW:  Koster is a sharp guy and has good ideas...  Doesn't mean all of his ideas are good...<br />
I will not buy into another Verant product because they're:<br />
1) Dishonest<br />
2) Try to treat their customers like they're stupid mushrooms<br />
3) They ALWAYS, without fail take the easiest possible way out.  How many GM's have you dealt with that do not have the common sense to pump gas or flip burgers?  All but one of my GM experiences has been painful and stupidity laden on the Verant side...<br />
4) They don't test things, then let the playerbase suffer because of the lack of testing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>kitsinu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Worlds of Warcraft is also talking about one character per server.  This isn't an isolated incident, it is an industry trend (with 300 k people paying around 10$ per month for three years for just one example, it IS an industry).<br />
<br />
Benefits for the industry : More money from families and people determined to twink no matter the cost.  Less storage (not sure how important that is considering the cost of recordable DVDs).<br />
<br />
Benefits for the player : Less twinking, more value per character that plays seriously.  The characters have more value because you either need to recruit from another server, get someone to buy another account, or delete an existing character.  While there will be cross server twinking, any character you twink from another server is one that you are either recruiting away from the other server's guild, or that will compete with your own guild.  There will be far less farming to twinks.  Farming to get trade goods yes, but not many will be twinks, so prices will be much more reasonable for the level of the item (which will reduce the amount of farming due to the lack of value).  More focus will be devoted to low levels, which will make starting a new character more fun.<br />
<br />
Personally, I am looking forward to WoW more than SWG or EQ2.  While EQ2 has the better graphics, WoW will be a breath of fresh air after three years of Verant's philosophy.  WoW's philosophy will probably end up like Verant's, but there will be a time that it isn't a grind.<br />
<br />
We will see if it is a better or worse system.  I think it has a lot of potential.  What all the problems associated with it are, we will have to wait to see the full extent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">More focus will be devoted to low levels, which will make starting a new character more fun. <br />
<br />
Could you elaborate that one please? :)  I see the exact opposite.  With only one character - once I'm too high a level for an area, I'll NEVER go back.  <br />
<br />
Sure, at this time most of the low level chars on a EQ server are twinks.  Most are either a) being PL'd as fast as possible or b) just being played to screw around with friends, blow off some stress, or explore a different playstyle.  But they are still out there, huntin orcs in CB or running around SouthK.<br />
<br />
But when everyone on a server has reached lvl XX, the lower level zones will be abandoned, with absolutely no one in them.  And heaven help you if you start playing SWG a few months after your friends...they will be too high a lvl to work with you.<br />
<br />
Of course, this is trying to cram SWG's approach into an EQ framework, and it might be radically different.  But I'm curious how one character per account forces more focus on the lower levels.</div></div><hr />

Tough to argue with (you can't, really, on the first two points), although many people are trying, fervently. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is one character per server, not per account.  Unless you want to powerlevel people playing certain classes moving to your server, you won't do much powerleveling.  Sure, there will be guilds that are powerful on multiple servers powerleveling their friends, but that won't happen until people start hitting whatever the level cap wall is.  Basically, if you want to start a class/character, you need to level and equip yourself (which is cool because others will be in the same non-twinking boat), or be in a fairly well organized guild if you want to twink or powerlevel.  Cross server trades will probably be against the EULA to make it harder to do (pure speculation on my part, but makes sense if they want to make you play the low level game rather than coasting).  Twinking is bad for the game as you end up with non-twinks feeling left behind, reduces the halflife of the game, and reduces the skill of people playing a class at high level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Kitsinu:  I understand your comments about cross server PLing and twinking...I not defending either one as a &quot;GOOD THING&quot;.   <br />
<br />
However, I still don't understand how limiting a person to one char (per server) forces the developers to focus more on the lower levels.</div></div><hr />
