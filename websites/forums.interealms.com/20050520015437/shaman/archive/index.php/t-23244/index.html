<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Indalecio Galronte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all, I'm sure by now we've all seen a very intresting AA called:<br />
<br />
Spiritual Channeling <br />
While this ability is active, all of your spells will be fueled directly by the energy of your body, consuming hit points rather than mana. <br />
<br />
This is a poor, raped version of the AA I suggested awhile back:<br />
<br />
Spirit Channeling 5/10/15<br />
<br />
Description:<br />
This grants the shaman the ablilty for a short time to fuel his spells with supernatural haste, and negating the cost of the spells at the cost of the shaman's life force.<br />
<br />
How it works:<br />
When you activate this AA, after a casting time (2 secs maybe?) for the next 7/16/30 seconds. All spells you cast will have a 30/45/60% spell haste applied to it. The lowest a spells casting time can be reduced to is 1 second. All recast time for spells during the period of time in which this AA is active is reduced to 0. No mana cost is deducted from the shaman's mana pool for any spells casted by the shaman during this period of time. After a successfully casted spell, the shaman would instead take damage equal to twice the amount of the mana cost of the spell. When this AA is active it will take up a buff slot (and operate much like Quiesscense does) and may end the effect by clicking it off or simply waiting for it to expire. <br />
<br />
<br />
In my suggestion I realized that Shaman spells have frustratingly long casting times and generally are underpowered compared to specialized classed (mainly comparing nukes and heals here). SO, what I did was design this AA around the a built in spell haste, which makes it leaps and bounds better then the suggested farce above it.<br />
<br />
As you all have pointed out, we have tons of mana, casting from our less manipulatable hit point pool would actually be more hinderance. The spell haste was the main goal of the AA, while basing it around hit point usage was an to make it balenced (you will die quickly if careless, our spells are costly and is reflected in the hp consumption). Together they make a very worthwhile AA. <br />
<br />
It was also meant to have a fairly short reuse time (something around the area of MGB heals) and to have a fairly short term effect (like under a minute tops). They seem to have thrown both of those out the window there - rabid bear style.<br />
<br />
In short, I just wanted to vent and apologize to the community for the mangling of the idea. It may still yet be decent, but the original goal of the idea, BURST utility, seems to have been left out in SOE's grand equation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Id prefer the SoE version to yours. Its very simple and I expect will be very, very effective.#<br />
<br />
Yours would cause many deaths when a shaman casts Fo7 while this AA is active.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Indalecio Galronte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A matter of opinion Urdegish, I didn't design this AA to speed buff. We already have AA specifically for that. This AA was designed around providing a solution to what many Shaman feel: completely inadequate to deal with burst (fill in the blank). Besides, in my version you'll notice the time frame is much shorter, meaning it's more of a reactionary AA or an AA you plan to activate. It's an AA that requires skill (Not for a shaman bot, sorry) to use. I'm trying to bring some sorely needed flair and techinque back into the class. Sorry if that's not something you look forward too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>garborg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Be happy they used your idea in context and try and see how maybe your version would have been too powerful for solo role.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think this is gonna be the best aa ever</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The AA in it's current form sounds like it's a fix for what many, MANY shaman were sick of: active mana regen (and to recoupe from putting ACP on the ancient list).<br />
<br />
If you don't have to cast any canni's, ever again, that frees up a lot of time to cast other spells.<br />
<br />
Also, with your suggested use, what point is there so that a shaman could cast a ton of spells once every, what, hour?  Half hour?  What kind of reuse time would the ability have?  If it were anything that actually made a noticable difference it could be seriously abused and other classes would have a real problem with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>doedel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Spiritual Channeling seems the most interesting Shaman AA in that next expansion.<br />
<br />
Though two things will determine its overall usability:<br />
- the &quot;recast&quot; time (Rabid Bear crap anyone?)<br />
- the HP-Mana-Ratio. I dont expect it at 1:1 but somewhere in the region of Canni 4, maybe even worse.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless this skill seems very situational. It will be very good <br />
- if you just got a rezz. Throw yourself a Quiescence and start to rebuff immediately<br />
- if you fight mobs with harsh mana-removal abilities. Other casters would be defunct with an empty manapool, but a Shaman with this ability would continue to do his mojo.<br />
<br />
These are more or less raid situations.<br />
 <br />
In single groups I dont see much usage of this skill; I rarely run below 60-50% of my mana pool simply for the fact that i cant blow out my mana fast enough because many of my spells have such a long cast/recast time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Be sweet if you canni with that activated it heals you~</div></div><hr />

like most of the spells and skills soe puts out .. the purpose WE as shaman are going to use it for will be different than how SoE thinks we'll use it</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why would I care to have this ability only 5 minutes out of every 69?  The ability does not have a situational use because it's exactly what we do all the time with canni.  However, if you had to be spam healing or something to the point where you are running oom then sure this would greatly help, but that's not the case.  From what I have read and experienced, if you have to be spam healing that much then you and your group will probably die at 50m anyway :(</div></div><hr />

Nah, most likely it'll just kill you.  A &quot;You do not have enough hit points to cast Canni V&quot; would have prevented my embarassment a few times when I first received it.<br />
<br />
Unbuffed casual shaman: &quot;Hey, check out this new AA I got!  Inc MANA FREE mgb Fo7! Loading, Please wait...&quot;<br />
<br />
Even if the recast IS an hour, 5 minutes of an ability this broken seems awesome.  Problem is, like I've said, if I don't have anything useful to use it on, it's pointless.  My slowing speed is already hindered by recast and the need for Malo, and chain Nukes or Heals won't do jack outside of trivial content (and I include BoT in my definition of Trivial, seeing as this is an OOW ability).<br />
<br />
As far as original post goes, double hp cost for spells would be too much.  You'd instagib every non-EP/Time geared Shaman after more than a couple spells are cast... or would be waiting on a tick or two of Q for every spell, defeating the purpose of the skill.<br />
<br />
Also, it's gonna be hard to avoid instinctively hitting Canni V when this is active, and accidentally gutting yourself to blood aggro and death, assuming you were lower on health when you Canni V'd (due to spell usage).</div></div><hr />

No, you take a look around lucy some more, the recast times on AA's are ilrelevant or are you saying Canni 5 has a recast time of 69 minutes also ? http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2749&amp;source=Live<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Sounds like it's not so much a spell you cast as an effect you don.  You won't need a certain number of hps.  However, the hps you have will drop each time you cast a spell.  In theory this wouldn't be a problem since you have Q and can just slap that on and forget it.  300 mana = costs you 300 hps, gains a lot more hps than that tho.</div></div><hr />

How is it broken?  Do you mean overpowered?  I can chain cast already without having mana problems.  Now, add to the ability a removal of spell recovery and recast times for the 5 minutes and now you have a broken ability :)</div></div><hr />

your spells still cast at the abysmally slow cast times, you still wont do any better healing or damage? all that this does is mean you can use hp instead of mana? why? do you really run out of mana? also you`ll have to stop doing anything your doing to kleep healing yourself?  this is a very bad aa. please dont give soe the impression this is good it isnt in it`s current form. please think about this seriously when would you use it? why would you use? ever!.<br />

i just cant see why anyone would think this would be useful let alone great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">i just cant see why anyone would think this would be useful let alone great.<br />
<br />
You don't see why its great?  I seem to remember quite a few posts complaining about how canni is active.  How we can't keep up in LDON because we can't canni.  Shamans DO run out of mana.  Maybe not on raids, but they do run out.  If you aren't running out of mana during exp group then its because you aren't doing everything you can to help the group.  It means that maybe you are C4ing instead of nuking, or Qing, or FAing or baneing.  I routinely have to cut back what I do when I start running lom.  Yes I can get the level back up relatively quickly, but everyone saying shamans don't run out of mana is just full of crap (unless you are talking specifically about raid encounters)<br />
<br />
All the complaining about how C6 is ancient.  Whats so big about C6?  C6 is big because you spend less time canni.  The AA is even less time than C6.  It cuts out the middleman.<br />
<br />
This AA will allow shaman to essentially do 2 things at once:  canni and cast.  How could you not see the usefullness in doing 2 things at once?  At the very least its uniqueness is what makes it attractive to me.<br />
<br />
The actual usefullness of the AA will be determined by how often it can be used.<br />
<br />
Think about it some.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't run out of mana, but that's because I canni like mad.  If this aa removed the need for me to canni between every dang spell I would buy the expansion for that *one* AA only.  It would *have* to be a toggled effect to really be used that way though, otherwise it would be too much of a risk to use regularly - like you said, cast a spell from your hitpoint pool to heal yourself when you are taking damage?!  Uh, no thanks then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">please dont confuse this with the very useful canni aa, this is nothing like that , for one things it`s got a lot bigger &quot;recast time&quot;  this aa will not help your mana running lower if you have problems with that now.<br />
<br />
now it being not a mana regen or frequent tell me again what use is it? this is not a mana regen therefore has no relation to the request for a better canni. you will still be canni like mad if you do that now except maybe for ashort time ever half hour or so. this alone makes it bad.  now think about how much hp you will use? if it on canni ratio of hp to mana  you wont be able to cast many spells before you use all your hp up, but this i cant be sure about as it level 70 to use it, but i bet it atleast a 1 to 1 ratio but likely worse</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Well, it appears to be a 5 minute ability that allows you to use hp instead of mana to cast. With spiritual serenity (455 hp/tick), ancestral regrowth (60 hp/tick) and your innate hp regen (~30 hp/tick for Mokara) we are talking about 545 hp/tick being available for conversion. The conversion rate appears to be 1.8, that makes it equivalent to a mana regen rate of ~ 300 mana/tick. And thats not counting HoT crit ticks (another AA ability).<br />
<br />
Alternatively, the Lucy entry might mean a 1:1 conversion with a limit at 180, ie 180 mana/tick<br />
<br />
Of course you cant do this all the time, it will likely have a 1 hour refresh, but thats no different from many of the other &quot;special&quot; AA abilities that other classes have. The warrior &quot;heal&quot; comes to mind, that has a refresh of over an hour.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure why Bara cudar doesn't like it. I sure as hell can see uses for it, since I allways run out of mana against large raid targets if I do all the things I would like to be doing during the fight. For 5 minutes I'll basically be able to cast non-stop on those special occasions without really using much mana at all. What's so crappy about that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
5 minutes of not using mana?  I think that would bring me up to full mana<br />
Be nice to get to start FM all over again in the middle of an aggressive crawl.<br />
<br />
Different tactic but might allow me to load a spell set w/o cann for 5 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">How is it broken?  Do you mean overpowered?  I can chain cast already without having mana problems.  Now, add to the ability a removal of spell recovery and recast times for the 5 minutes and now you have a broken ability :)<br />
<br />
That's true, and sort of parallel to my point.  No matter how long we can chain cast, we can't provide the type of impact that a few other classes could, were they given the same ability.<br />
<br />
Which lends a bit of credibility to the spell haste idea promoted by the original poster.  Casting times have always been one of the factors used to limit us to third-rate role fulfillment outside of Slows.<br />
<br />
When I said it was broken, I was really just stating my initial, knee-jerk reaction to the text as I read it on the safehouse.  After some thought, though, it does seem that it would be limited in terms of Aggro... if you are casting with your HP, your HP is going to be going up and down, AND the extra heals/DD's/DoT's you are casting are no doubt going to bring some extra aggro down on your head, and it will be much harder to sustain the consequences of that aggro with your spells using HP instead of mana.<br />
<br />
So perhaps, if they can code it right, it can be an ability that is limited not by the recast, but by the dynamics of the ability itself as it relates to the shaman class.  In this case, I think (or at least hope) that you'd see a separation of skilled and unskilled shaman as far as who chooses to use this ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">please dont confuse this with the very useful canni aa<br />
<br />
?? When was a relation to canni5 suggested?<br />
<br />
this is nothing like that , for one things it`s got a lot bigger &quot;recast time&quot;  this aa will not help your mana running lower if you have problems with that now.<br />
<br />
Actually, if I did have problems with running low on mana this would be a great ability to have.  I could turn it on and for 5 minutes, I wouldn't use any mana.  That sounds like it would help me if I were running out of mana.<br />
<br />
now it being not a mana regen or frequent tell me again what use is it?<br />
<br />
I said already.  This AA is either going to be a one shot &quot;cast til the cows come home&quot; ability or it will be something that replaces canni4.  If the former, then it will be of very limited use.<br />
<br />
this is not a mana regen therefore has no relation to the request for a better canni. you will still be canni like mad if you do that now except maybe for ashort time ever half hour or so. this alone makes it bad.<br />
<br />
Again, ???  Yes this is not a direct mana regen spell, but who asked for a better canni?  I want to *eliminate* the need for me to constantly be spamming my canni hotkey.  I don't care if it's a downgrade on ratio, it's sickening to be the only class still forced to have active mana regen after so long.  What makes it bad?  You really lost me.  What does &quot;this alone&quot; refer to?<br />
<br />
now think about how much hp you will use? if it on canni ratio of hp to mana  you wont be able to cast many spells before you use all your hp up, but this i cant be sure about as it level 70 to use it, but i bet it atleast a 1 to 1 ratio but likely worse<br />
<br />
Breath of Trushar is 630HP per tick.  On a 2:1 HP:Mana ratio, that's 315mana worth of spells a tick you could cast for zero mana and not lose health.<br />
<br />
That's true, and sort of parallel to my point.  No matter how long we can chain cast, we can't provide the type of impact that a few other classes could, were they given the same ability.<br />
<br />
Which lends a bit of credibility to the spell haste idea promoted by the original poster.  Casting times have always been one of the factors used to limit us to third-rate role fulfillment outside of Slows.<br />
<br />
I agree, it doesn't address our ability to use the mana we have effectively.  However, it does address having an active mana regen.  :)<br />
<br />
So perhaps, if they can code it right, it can be an ability that is limited not by the recast, but by the dynamics of the ability itself as it relates to the shaman class.  In this case, I think (or at least hope) that you'd see a separation of skilled and unskilled shaman as far as who chooses to use this ability.<br />
<br />
Exactly.  Sounds like a plan to me :)  It would probably benefit those players who are really adept at monitoring and controlling the relationship between hp and mana for a Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">let me see you recon this is gonna let you cast all the time? what do you think youll be casting? you never want to use the solo, in a group? you be casting still be casting malos , slow and attempt some other spell before it dead? and you will have to keep healing yourself or be another strain on the cleric? <br />
<br />
you must look at the bigger picture by the time you will get this you`ll have a bigger mana pool, likely more mana regen etc. you wont be going oom so much except if you solo.  so for 5 mins you`ll be able  to use your hp instead of mana?  how much mana do you use? are you going oom over time? how much time? 5 mins? 10 mins? 20 mins? 30 mins? are you needing to canni after 5 mins? before 5 mins? after 10?  you will still be having to do that then!<br />
<br />
also there is so much better ideas out there that could be used instead. like say taking 30% to 60% of your health and giving it to someone esle as a 1 to 1 ratio. and a group version that does the same but splits for group. that would be much more useful. this isnt as useful as you seem to think, and there are much better ideas out there.<br />
<br />
but you dont have to belive me as i doubt they change it even with negative feedback. you get to try it yourself, and when you come back he saying it blows, i be here to tell you i told you so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Actually, I would find myself using this quite frequently I imagine.  While doing crawls in Gates zones I run with a VERY high DPS crowd.  We all play quite well together and are able to handle 3 or 4 mobs at a time pretty casually so when pulling we often find enjoyment in letting 2 people pull.  It used to be in pre-Gates that our healer would run low on mana and so I would step in for a fight or 2 and cover healing while he gets mana back up, as such we never had downtime.<br />
<br />
  In gates though, I started to utilize Nihil a lot more, and that meant refreshing slows and blowing extra mana on those larger pulls, so... as much as I hate to admit to it... some times it is ME that is out of mana during the exp crawls and needing to take a small breather while canni5 refreshes (normally not more than 20 seconds or so, but still longer than I care to need).  Even though this ability may only be available once an hour, that means I can use it to get mana back up after rebuffing the group (which coincidentally happens to be when I normally have those mana problems, my manapool is small enough that fo7 is a pretty hard hit to me unless we stop pulling to buff).<br />
<br />
  So yeah, even with a 1 hour reuse timer on this thing, I can definately see myself getting some use out of it.  Yeah, I can also see myself getting a couple more &quot;Oops, low health aggro'd him again ;)&quot; moments, but I always get those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Hmm I misread it I thought it included a super spell haste too. I still think its a not bad idea though, it has originality, but I am not sure perhaps that it does anything for balance or utility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">btw dont get me wrong i can see times when this could be useful, but not many,  over all it isnt a great aa, thats all i am saying. I am probably spoilt in that i have a TA and therefore that saves me a alot of mana, but with ft15 mana regen spells canni aa  etc I cant use my mana fast enough to make this aa worth while at any time. All i need  is less hassle canni, and i sure most of you if we had a real canni aa u/g or get the new canni spell that isnt ancient will find that this isnt really as useful as you might orignally think, when i first saw it i though hmm kinda cool, then i thought about it and realise it isnt what i need  or as good as it might seem.<br />
i need faster casting of my spells, an aa to do that passively would be much better.<br />
<br />
that being said if any of the suggestions i feedback actually get listened too then more mana might actuualy become useful again. <br />
<br />
if it had spell haste, sure but the reuse time is still a factor that makes it not very useful. as i said there are much better aa to ask for and get than this.</div></div><hr />

btw it does use alot more hp than the mana cost. and if you running out of mana this will not help you regain mana. if your on beta i would feeback to get this changed. It might sound very powerful but it isnt. it is like rabid bear too short to long to reuse and not that great in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">The re-use time is exactly the same as Cannibilization. Why is everyone saying its 69 minutes? <br />
<br />
Spirit Channeling (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5932&amp;source=Test)<br />
Cannibilization (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2749&amp;source=Test)<br />
<br />
Now granted, other AA abilities have time listed in X.XX format, like VP, Paragon, and Divine Rez, but some other &quot;long re-use&quot; spells like Divine Aura (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=207&amp;source=Test) have 900 as their re-use. <br />
<br />
Can someone confirm the re-use on this please? If its the same re-use as Cannibilization, then it is a TRUE upgrade to Canni 5 and, in fact, something that people have been SCREAMING for, a &quot;scalable&quot; Canni 5, Keep casting til you run out of HPs, baby. <br />
<br />
Honestly, if this and Canni 5 have the same re-use, I dont see myself EVER having to mem a canni spell again. During the spot between the effect wearing off and it lighting back up, hit C5, and by the time you HoT back the health, SC will be ready again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I'm curious bara cudar, why do you think that 100 mana/tick for 3 minutes is a bad thing? It essentially gives you 3000 mana that your otherwise wouldnt have had in 3 minutes at the cost of 4800 hp, if I read the spell description correctly. I had a look on beta as well, and the reuse time is less than 69 minutes, but long enough so that you couldnt have it constantly running (not going to say what it actually is, you'll find out soon enough). A 5 minute duration would require that you had 8000hp btw, an unlikely scenario unless you were casting an HoT or heal in the interim.<br />

This is a great ability for those situations where you need to lay down as much mana in a short period of time as you possibly can, large target fights for example (groups or raids).</div></div><hr />

Agree 100%, has been 2 recent occasions where I went OOM taking down a big target with a very small number of people for the level of gear we had, this would have helped alot in that situation.<br />

if you just look at it for 3 minutes then yes it seems alot, but if you take it over the actually reuse time , it is not very much atall. i have now actually manage to use it, i will agree it isnt totally useless now, however, it is no way near as useful as canni aa for instance. and i really havent needed to actually use it other then to test it.  btw 100 mana a tick? that surely depends on what you have cast on you, this aa does not give you any extra mana, it just lets you not use any (which only gains mana in that you arnt using any so you notice your normal regain) and what ever your regen is will be what you get back in 3 mins..you would have regain that back anyhow! though admittly you not using that mana, so you could say its extra, but because you regain that anyway try taking that mana from the total mana cost of the spells you cast in that 3 minute time and that is the  actually the &quot;mana gain&quot; the question is how many more spells can you cast using this, than just the regain normally? that will depend on what you cast and how often you cast it?  that is for working out how much better a shaman using this would be over a shaman not using it. (which now i thought about it i must test, but i dont think it will be as great as you might think) and 4800 hp? how you work that one? it goes on spell mana not mana you regain, you could use  alot more hp than 4800 or alot less, depends on what you cast! i quite happy went through my entire hp bar almost just debuffing and stacking dots, but youll only do that while soloing or you would be instantly summoned and killed in group or raid, kinda defeats the purpose there. Using hots with this is effective, but at the end of the day this isnt as powerful as it could due to the innate problems shaman have already, slow casting and agro issues. what it does save is the mana you use for spells. also you shouldnt include canni 5 or canni spells as they cast the same taken same time to cast and regain same mana back and it still takes hp so really no extra gain If you take the reuse time into account it is noway near as much as it seems, and if you have trouble with your mana running out this aa probably wont help that greatly, though you might be able to extend running out of mana by maybe 3 to 5 mins. But for me that would be a very loong fight , something that only raid mobs have and even then those fights arnt that long. <br />
<br />
that said it does save you mana, it is a speed bump type thing, it just not as great or useful as it might sound. But yes if you run out of mana then this could be useful, but only on those long fights (which there arnt many) where you might run out of mana. but you`ll likely not want to use this on mobs that have large ae nuke/dot. It just seems to me to be very limited.</div></div><hr />

Er . . . not sure where you are going with this thought Tug. Are you saying he should be doing more healing or nuking? Certainly you cannot be referring to using DOTs on big targets. Thats in invitation to a failed raid if you get summoned and the MA loses aggro. <br />
<br />
I use a ton of mana. My main raiding zone curently is Time, and that is just a mana-pig set of raids. I heal, nuke, slow, root, FA, Focus the newly rezzed. There are spots in Time where I actually bust out my Lizard, I use so much mana. But honestly, Tug, our &quot;overall contribution&quot; is almost negligible. I can go AFK for all of T3 Time and it doesnt make a damn bit of difference in the end. Why? Because our nukes just arent that big, and our heals just arent that big, and in the end, the mob is gonna die and whoever gets hit is gonna get healed, and other classes aer gonna do it FAR more efficinently than I ever could.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I haven't used the ability Bara Cuda, my shaman on beta isnt high enough. My reading of the spell data on Lucy was that it would give 100 &quot;effective&quot; mana per 160 hp consumed. I assumed that that was what would available per tick with the balance taken from regular mana, but if the limit is only as fast as you can recover hp then the ability is that much more powerfull. It would mean that the effective mana available to you would be limited only by how fast you can regen, which, with Trushar, is considerable. Giacs's experiences notwithstanding, I pretty much allways go oom on raid targets unless my primary function is to keep my group alive. There is no excuse for a shaman not to. Being FM 3 minutes longer than I normally would gives me 3 minutes more to do my thing.<br />
<br />
The other thing that this would be usefull for is an in fight rez, since it would allow you to get back to business allmost immediately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Nope, I never DoT on raids because of the agro factor, unless I'm allready oom (in which case I try to land BoN off my pants and/or epic DoT). I've never been summoned by a raid boss either, except when we are in the process of wiping (and that doesnt count), and I allmost allways go oom before the fight is over. I spam heal the MA (especially on tank changes or when discs are about to fade) or chain nuke the mob (after a discrete waiting period of course). If we are dealing with mobs with nasty AEs I either cure or try to keep most of the group alive, which may or may not be mana hungry depending on the mob involved. On some AE mobs I have to decide who I am going to allow to die and who should live, because if I try to save them all I will lose them all.<br />
<br />
The only time this doesn't happen is when I'm focussed on keeping my warrior at full health so that she is ready to step in as MT when/if the MA goes down, and to spam heals at that point.<br />
<br />
This ability should allow me to do these things for 3 minutes longer, which is a big deal, to me anyway. I guess if one's mana pool is so large, or you have much better mana regen, or you are doing other functions which are not as mana heavy, then the ability would be less usefull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">as another shaman that never goes oom in raids, i find this aa to be marginal at best, just because you spam heal a ma that is probably getting chain ch or cleric quick heal and wasting mana, doesnt mean other will do the same, i heardly ever heal ma, thats cleric job, i heal offtanks or group (which can contain the clerics), when they fine i dot with bane and nuke, though some mobs that add more mobs at certain life % you might only want to nuke. the only time i ever get close to coming oom is when i have to continueously spam heal with tnargs. Which doesnt happen that often. The other thing that happen is i have to cure poeple with rgc or nadox blood etc and heal group or offtanks. again i never actually go oom, though i will use lot of mana, and use canni.<br />
<br />
however, you do go oom, so this aa might be worth it for you. and our hots will easily keep up with the damage done.  although you do have to cast those hots. without focus yer looking to cast and recats 8.5 with focus about 6 sec. which youll need to recast every  42 sec,  or 4.2 times so out that 3 mins youll spend atlast 25 seconds just healing yourself, assuming you dont canni during this to help mana regain, leaves you  2 mins 35 sec. of preety much casting what you want. great!  only how many fights are longer than 2 min and 35 secs? if you using you mana during the fight too? longer than 5 mins? so likely you wont use all that time casting. not to mention the nasty ae dots and nukes that mobs can do which even with trushar can kill you if useing that aa?<br />
<br />
alos not to mention the new mana regen spells that will increase the amount of mana you gain  too? and aa that help increase ft15?<br />
<br />
and canni 5 get me up and running pretty quick as it is.<br />
<br />
it could be marginally usefull for encounter that have mana drain, but unfortunately those usually have nasty dots and dd too. and if you completely oom you cant heal yourself! and you will kill yourself very quickly.<br />
<br />
it has its usage, but it just isnt that great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Fact is that you can only cast one spell at a time. So whether you are DoT'ing or healing, it doesn't relly matter. <br />
Another fact is that your alt's gear isn't exactly high-end GoD level and when you are referring to going oom you are probably talking about Time encounters(Yes, you can go oom in Time, but this ability didn't exist back then when it would have been useful).<br />
<br />
Feel free to name GoD encounters in which a Shaman with adequate gear and spells for the content is supposed to go oom in your opinion. <br />
<br />
Until then, please refrain from making assumptions about my contribution to the raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Bara cudar, MTs are at highest risk during a couple of points during a fight. For example, during a tank switch or when discs fade. There have been countless times when my warrior has dropped right after discs have faded. When fighting mobs where this can happen I routinely warn the healers that discs are fading so the secondary healers can buffer the transition, and I warn the other tanks so they can be prepared to step in to take my place. If you are leaving healing solely to the chain, you are not performing your function as a secondary healer properly, and you have room for improvement as a shaman.<br />
<br />
Spamming heals is extremely mana inefficient because half the time they land on a fully healed tank, but they do serve a purpose. Personally I would like a 1K heal with a very fast cast time so that I can react to gaps, but we dont, so our regular heals have to do.<br />
<br />
In your mana drain example, if I'm casting with my hp, I can cast heals/HoTs with my hp, so the state of my mana is irrelevant. If you are timing your casts along with Trushar ticks, you would basically stay at full health anyway. Mana drain scenarios are in fact the ideal places to use the ability.</div></div><hr />

Ok, I'll bite. Zun`Muram Votal. Just an example. You can end that fight FM or oom, depending on whether you are being proactive or reactive. Bosses in the IK trials are another situation where a shaman in &quot;adequate gear and spells for the content&quot; will either go oom, or come close to it (if they want to win that is). Now, there are fights that are very short, many in the IK raids come to mind, and in those cases you probably aren't going to go oom, but anything that takes long enough for melee discs to fade takes long enough for you to burn your mana doing something usefull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">In your mana drain example, if I'm casting with my hp, I can cast heals/HoTs with my hp, so the state of my mana is irrelevant.

<br />
actually you are correct, my mistake, so for the mana draining fights this would be great. but its still very situational, there arent that many mana drains that drain all my mana, (one in god i know off) and quarm but i cure that one pretty quick.<br />
<br />
my main point is that is just isnt as useful as say a u/g to canni or other aa ideas that have been posted here, nor is it as powerful as you seem to think. also , as pointed out by many, there are many ways to play a shaman , some are more effective, but it doesnt mean other ways are wrong. i really didnt mean to attack they way you play, though it came off that way, however in my guild we have plenty of druid and cleric, i have plenty of faith that they can keep the tank alive during disc ending or tank changes, i have no reason to spam heal the mt normally (unless we are low on healer which doesnt happen really) there fore healing group (which s sometimes the clerics) or offtankers general makes more sense in my guild. Possible in your guild it doesnt. <br />
<br />
i am not one of these shaman that think i should cast a dot on a mob to do 1 tick of damage cos every bit helps. I will heal poeple if theyy are low on hp, but if they get healed before i finish i will duck if i can. Pherhaps its just that i conserve my mana better? It s also possible that i have better focus and save mana that way? Either way just because you go oom alot doesnt mean that most other shaman will, or that they are not doing enough because of that. That is just the way you play, not me. It isnt wrong, but doesnt mean that this aa will help most shaman, however i might be the exception to the rule and it might. But my personal opinion is we could do with something alot better.</div></div><hr />
