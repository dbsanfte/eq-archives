Drunk Girl (heh, why not :P)<br />
Mango :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Micheall</div><div class="date">04-27-2002, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With such a plethora of incredible talent that has gone through that show, the original characters are still my favorites.  Many many funny bits, great characters, but the one that always had me in stitches because I knew a kid so much like her, so much so that her parents dreaded SNL,<br />
<br />
Lily Tomlin as Elizabeth Ann<br />
<br />
One comedienne, on stage by herself, one large rocking chair, kid style clothes, speaking softly, and getting people to first crane their necks to hear her, then fall on the floor laughing.<br />
<br />
Incredible talent.  <br />
<br />
The entire first cast made such a huge impact on television, almost all of them going on to movies and continued fame.  So many top-notch comedians have come from through that show.  <br />
<br />
And yes, I too miss Gilda Radner, she was amazing.  Gilda's death was the one that touched me the most.  Gene Wilder, her husband and a great comedian as well, has obviously been diminshed by her loss.  His work while still good, lacks the spark of his time with her.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mango. <br />
&quot;You think Mango homo-gay?!&quot; and he slaps his ass at Cuba Gooding, Jr. =P<br />
<br />
The Sean Connery bit on Jeopardy was really, really good.</div></div><hr />

Not sure on how he is doing now.  There was one article stating that he was doing better but I have never trusted the rag that printed the story.  It was dated for May of last year.</div></div><hr />

ROFL  <br />
<br />
Hulk  &quot;Hey come on.. its not supposed to smell like roses!&quot;<br />
<br />
I also love when all the other super heroes are picking on Garret Morris as &quot;Ant Man&quot;.<br />
<br />
Superman:  Whats your powers again?<br />
Ant Man:  Well I can shrink to the size of an ant but still retain my normal strength.<br />
<br />
*Everyone chuckles&quot;<br />
<br />
Ant Man:  What?  Thats a good power!<br />
Superman:  Oh yeah, you must clean house on all those other ants.... (rolls eyes)<br />
<br />
OMG that was hillarious.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sure I know some of the characters, since so many have made it into movies, but unless someone tells me, I wouldn't know the source of the character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nitefox</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can download MP3's of the SNL Jeapardy skits from audiogalaxy.com.  I've got 5-6 of them.  Crack me up to no end.<br />

<br />
Never?  As in .... never?  You should go rent some of the dvd's.  I assume they have the old ones on tape or dvd out there.  Really funny stuff =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shiphro, I think Tina Fey is a Hottie.  I've always had a thing for smart girls with glasses.  Is she a lesbian?<br />
<br />
Will Ferrel's Harry Caray is some of the funniest **** I've ever seen.<br />
&quot;If the Moon was made of green cheese, would you eat it?  I know I would!  Cubs win!  Cubs win!&quot;  lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nitefox</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Back in the days of Phil Hartman, Jon Lovitz, and Kevin Neiland(sp?), they had a skit they did every now and then called Tonto, Frankinstien and Tarzan.  That was some funny stuff.<br />
<br />
Phil Hartman dying was a real tragedy.  I used to love that show News Radio.  It went down the tubes very fast after his death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drexel</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, too many SNL geniuses were lost to an early death.<br />
<br />
News Radio was one of my fav shows of all time.  A shame, a real shame. :(</div></div><hr />
