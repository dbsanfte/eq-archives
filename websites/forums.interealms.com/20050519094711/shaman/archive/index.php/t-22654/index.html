<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking at the huge list of changes since velious in the other thread<br />

<br />
I thought it might be interesting to list things that might have been good ideas but were horrible in implementation. <br />
<br />
Three things immediately come to mind for me. <br />
<br />
1) LDoN Raids - this could have been a god send for casual guilds that wanted to do some raid content on their schedule of for guilds that couldn't find any targets up some nights (happened to us a lot on PST raid times). Instead they were long, borning, and had horrible loot for the time and risk involved. Could have been so much better.<br />
<br />
2) Slow mitigation - I don't really need to say anything else here<br />
<br />
3) LDoN points system - They are finally working out some of the issues here with the buyback and augment removal, now if they'd just eliminate the need for 30 wins in each theme and just go off the total wins I think it would be ok for lvl 65's at least. The other major problem with the points system is the cost of low level items/spells vs the ammount of points they get per adventure.<br />
<br />
What else could have been great, but ended up being poorly implemented?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">4) Dieties, in general, and specifically the inability to change your worship.<br />
<br />
5) Character stats? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dieties are fine.  Heck it's not worshipping a diety, it's that every Guard, Merchant and NPC can tell.  I mean it's like Warhammer 40K where the Chaos Champions are wearing big flashing neon signs:<br />
<br />
&quot;I WORSHIP THE GOD OF BLOOD / CHANGE / DISEASE / PLEASURE.  YES THAT'S RIGHT ** ME ** YOU SILLY GITS !&quot;<br />
<br />
And besides, you shouldn't be able to change what God you worship like you change your underwear.<br />
<br />
Anybody ever play (A)D &amp; D?  God's got EXTREMELY pissed off if you started worshipping somebody else to the point that spell casters went without or were hunted down and killed. (Kind of like the Mob and people who owe money)<br />
<br />
Now, I do think you should be able to change from Agnostic to a God, (sort of &quot;I have seen the light!&quot;), but not from Rallos to Mith Marr as your mood suits.<br />
<br />
My opinion.</div></div><hr />

If mitigation had not been introduced content would be unplayable without a shaman or trivial with one. The problem, in my opinion, is not slow mitigation but ensuring shaman have enough other benefits they can bring to a group.<br />
<br />
As for your character's patron deity, the relevance of this to the game is non existant once you get into PoP and higher. Sure it is a pain at the lower levels (since it affects faction) and there are a few diety specific items but I don't thing this is a big deal.<br />

<br />
Oh I'm definately not going to argue that it wasn't necessary, but turning around and slaping it on every mob and their little dog too wasn't. It should have been used to tune boss fights and such, but not exp camps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hot Spots.<br />

Giving out some goodies for your addicted playerbase - good idea.<br />
<br />
Introducing more 24+ hours camp festivals with 30+ players waiting in line - ..... no comment.<br />
<br />
Oh and what about (drumroll please): Alchemy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My points:<br />
<br />
alchemy - the idea of items that use up are a good idea for the economy (PP drain) but we all know the prices for alchemy are to high<br />
<br />
gnomes - Oh this evil little gnomes. I tell them &quot;Go and clean the kitchen!&quot; or &quot;Die now&quot; and they never do it ;)<br />
<br />
bazaar - It works ok if you have an extra account for your trader mule and / or a flat rate. If you have to pay your internet by the time your lose.<br />
<br />
faction - Once it was an important part of the game but has now (almost) no meaning.<br />
<br />
PoP port stones - IMHO you should be level 46+ to use the PoP port stones. May be level 20 to use the one for your home town. This way druids and wizzards could still make some PP woth porting peeps and Norrath would still be a huge, dangerous world (at least at lower levels).</div></div><hr />

I usually just put 'Guild Raid Only Please', or ' Mob Name Raid Only'  in my LFG window, your comments show up on someone else's search, so I usually don't get tells when not wanted.</div></div><hr />

The Chaos Champions adorned their armor with the appropriate colors / signs of the god they worshipped and carried banners depicting so :)  Many people wear various signs of their worship on their person, publicly visible, but you're right that it shouldn't be an automatic giveaway.<br />

<br />
I agree that it shouldn't be a frequent ability to use, but it should certainly exist to some extent, especially since many of the gods kill you on sight even if you worship them :)  I remember a friend of mine who was seriously bummed when he finally made it to a fear raid and was killed by Cazic pulling with his SK hehe.<br />

That's actually what I was specifically referring to and it has been brought up at just about every fan faire.  I have a 65 wood elf war (yes yes, yuck it up! :)) who was made a very long time ago and is agnostic.  Bummer she can't use any cultural armor because her deity choice was made long before anyone knew they would actually have any impact on the game other than for roleplay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">bazaar - It works ok if you have an extra account for your trader mule and / or a flat rate. If you have to pay your internet by the time your lose.<br />
<br />
I do remember the time (1994-1996?) when many Internet providers charged you per hour, had usage tiers and so on, but I thought those things disappeared a long time ago. Even back when EQ went live in early 1999, the only people who were concerned about hourly rates were Europeans, or so I seem to recall.<br />
<br />
I am just curious, is it still a problem in some parts of Europe (Oz? NZ?) or are there places in North America where you don't have access to a flat rate Internet deal? Alaska, perhaps?<br />
<br />
Anyway, if 90%+ of SOE's customers don't have to worry about it and it has no appreciable negative impact on the rest, then I don't think that the Bazaar was a bad idea, just one that a few people couldn't take full advantage of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>FVDladian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Europe is generally flat fee per month now.<br />
<br />
Quite a few ISPs restrict via download limits, and some 56k ISPs give you a friendly disconnect every few hours to make you buy cable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Sure, most EQ players have somekind of flat rate. But in some countries you can't get a flat rate everywhere (like east europe, south / middle america, africa, parts of asia). I'm not even sure if you can get a flat rate in all areas of the old europe / north america.<br />
<br />
Anyway, on old servers the bazaar reachs the maximum of traders quite regulary. I could imagine that every town has it's own bazaar. Would bring back faction into EQ again too. On the other hand you had to check 6 or 7 bazaars if you are looking for some stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2.  Proposed shaman spell improvements before GoD... sure they gave us almost what we wanted, but not many of us have those spells yet, and I think alot of us won't see them (I'm in sewers 3 times a week, 12 hours a week, for the last 2 months... nothing).<br />
<br />
Frankly, I don't really care what comes with OOW now.  Based on experience, I won't be able to see ANY of the spells at all, not for another 2 years of trying.<br />

Naw the spires were used a LOT back then.  What went horribly wrong with the spires though was that SOE never did fix the bug where you could be transported back UP to Luclin even if you didn't have a spire shard thingy (from the scion) on you.<br />

<br />
Hybrids needed to be fixed after kunark/velious but they over-reacted and made them game-breakers. The reason I say game breakers is that mmorpg designers will tell you that the big no-no, the big game-breaker, is the fighter-spellcaster, they have to be kept in check, kept limited, or they will mess balance up.<br />
<br />
Paladins, rangers and beastlords especially. (And before I get flamed, I do agree they needed improvement, I was happy for them that they got some attention, I'm simply talking about how far it was taken)</div></div><hr />

Wasn't really like that, and definately isn't anymore. The main thing was we had no DSL or Cable stuff anywhere so the only other option was ISDN which would cost a fortune and was really only available to one company (Telstra. THE company). Could get unlimited 56k accounts. Then after a while everyone realised that 56k sucked ass and started demanding DSL/Cable. Optus came in and started providing cable with help from Foxtel (pay TV), and a few other companies started working on DSL. That screwed Telstra because they lost their monopoly so they started charging these other companies HEAPS to use Telstra's equipment. Hard to provide competitive prices when you yourself are being gouged. The other companies got pissed and tried to get Telstra busted for non-competitive practices while starting to install their own equipment. I think Telstra panicked because their own equipment went up WAAAY faster than it was supposed to be done (where I live I wasn't supposed to get Cable til 2012... but I could get it today) to try and compete. Eventually they got busted and had to start providing good prices to their competitors... and there we get to today where I can sign up for 512/128 ADSL with ~30GB cap (after which I get charged 10c/MB) for $80 a month. Which, at least here, probably the best deal I can get.<br />
<br />
So yeah. Internet is still pricey, but my long distance is wikid cheap~<br />
<br />
(I probably missed a bunch of stuff or got some things wrong. The above is just MY understanding of the whole thing)</div></div><hr />

I have the same problem. I have a 65 barbarian warrior who I made before the deities meant anything and made him agnostic just for faction sake. Wish I could do a quest to change to Rallos Zek so I could use that armor.</div></div><hr />
