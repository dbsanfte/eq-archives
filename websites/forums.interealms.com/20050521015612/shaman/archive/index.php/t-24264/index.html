<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scabber</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all!<br />
<br />
Just wondering what everyones opinion is on 2HB.  I am in my 36th level and have never bothered until someone suggested the Barbarian Spiritists Hammer.  I currently weild an Ice Wurm Fang and a Pile Driver while using a Orb of the Infinite Void for my secondary.  Think it's worth switching out on occasion?  Let me know!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think it's worth keeping up all weapon skills as you level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree. Its much much easier to keep them up as you grow than catch up later. Especially in the days when you are leveling at a fairly regular pace. I let mine slack around 100 each for 1HB abd 2HB, then regreted it when I found a cool camp for a charm in LoY I could solo for good XP and drops. It gained power as my weapon skills got higher. I forget the name now, but I raised my blunt skills while camping it, and it was a pain. Of course, I never got the charm, then SOE decided to give out free charms that got better stats with a couple flags than any other charm dropping anywhere. Cant complain though, sold tons of Grobb Hide stuff that dropped, got 3 levels of XP pretty easy, maxxed all my skills, heh.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh duh, was going to answer the question as posted, LOL. I used that one from PoI, crankshaft or driveshaft or something. It did a decent job. This was a while back though, pre-LDoN and stuff, early in LoYs cycle. Probably better available now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would agree its easier to do it while leveling then later. My 2HB was 0 when I got a bone of bertox and even after spending 100 points in training it, it hasn't gone up all too much. <br />
<br />
I don't usually melee with my two hander very often though, don't like giving up focus effects on my shield. The 1.5 epic is a nice 1hb though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Keep your skills up as you grow.  I never used those skills too much once I got 65, but I never considered maxxing them out as being a waste of time.  I find those skills were helpfull with trivial content and travelling (not having offensive spells up but getting attacked while running with green mobs on you).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cronikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I recently got my 8th cudgel and have found that my 1hb is coming along quite nicely down in Nurga, meleeing lb gobbos ... i just keep hasted and FA'd and it ticks by quite happily (13 raises off 2 mobs, no less!).</div></div><hr />
