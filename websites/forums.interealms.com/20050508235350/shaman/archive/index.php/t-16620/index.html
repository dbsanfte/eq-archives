<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zoria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Posting this in both general and spells since im not sure where it should go.<br />
<br />
Our nukes suck. This is a known fact which does not need to be discussed. However, i have found lately that i spend most of my time nuking, both on raids, in exp groups, and especially LDON groups. So my question is this:<br />
Considering our amazing mana regen, over time, how does the damage of a serious shaman nuker compare to wizard damage?<br />
<br />
Please note that i am not interested in guesses or math theories, im interested in parses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't have parses cause I don't parse.  I just do what works good enough for me.<br />
<br />
  You results will be however:<br />
<br />
  Short term wizzie blows us away.<br />
<br />
  Then, someone will post a parse over 5 hours of solid nuking of a rock they found that happened to have 100000000 hp and show that a shaman wins actually.<br />
<br />
<br />
  They are better than us.  Plain and simple.  Nukes are what THEY DO.   Don't expect to stack up against them at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zoria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thats like saying a group HAS to have a cleric and chanter/bard in order to do anything besides single pulls. Its just not true in all cases, hence why i need some solid data.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xzanthos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't have logs anymore since I retired a couple months ago, but on a few raid mobs, Tormax/Aow I would usually top out at about 200 - 220ish dps, in exp groups I would hover somewhere between 160 - 180ish dps.<br />
<br />
This is without max crit aa's, or max FT, could have been higher have I had such. /shrug Wizards nuke, thats what we do :p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Xzanthos gave you dps in an exp group. Exp groups tend to stick around for at least an hr. <br />
<br />
  I guess you want an exact parse to see if the fact we have such good mana regen will eventually run the wizard out of mana causing us to do more comparable damage in nukes?<br />

<br />
Might want to poke around there also than. Not sure if you'll get both parses from here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  I don't see how you think I am saying that, but oh well.  I am just saying that you shouldn't worry about us doing any better than wizzie ever.. in any way, shape or form.   We do just fine by my regards, as stated we can pull about 200dps if we try.<br />
<br />
<br />
  With how curt you are being toward everyone trying to respond, and how you aren't offering up anything of your own (ie - hey, I parsed out my nuking over a couple hours to be like this.... .... anyone know how that would stack up to the average shaman or wizzie?), I dont' think much will come of this thread.   Pity though, sounds like you really want to know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zoria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I offered up an interesting question but it seems nobody else is interested in finding out what the answer is. Which is an even bigger pity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Its compairing apples to oranges. Wiz nuke its what they where made for. Thire nukes hit harder, faster, and at a better mana ratio then ours. Has for tying to figure in Shm cann mana regen in there is no point no mob will live long enugh for it to matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zoria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Its comparing total damage over time to someone elses total damage over time. In a normal group setting, people want consistant DPS. I would be absolutely thrilled to be able to invite 2 other shams instead of 2 wizzies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My wife can drop one 65 mage nuke and do more then double VS in one cast assuming no crit. She usually does 2-3 a fight without mana problems and if all I'm doing after slow is nuking I'm probably getting in about the same number of nukes for a lot less damage. Wizard nukes are even more damaging and effecient and I don't see why a wizard wouldn't be able to do a few nukes a fight indefinately. If you're talking over a long period of time the wizard will still do much more damage then the shaman would as we would need the time and mana to cast three of our nukes for one of theirs. The lack of effeciency eats our mana regen advantage since they are not going to be using anywhere near the ammount of mana to inflict more damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zoria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sounds great. Got any parses to back that up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">anyone who asks for parses without posting any makes baby jesus cry.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, the bigger pity is that you're whining that no one will do your homework for you.<br />
<br />
Instead of being condescending, or talking to people like they're sad sacks cuz they won't answer your question to your satisfaction, how about PARSING FIRST.  <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Fearcazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Here's where I can probably help out as I play a lvl 65 wizard and a lvl 65 shaman.<br />
<br />
I don't 2 box anymore because I moved one PC to my GF's house and retired my wizzy.<br />
<br />
As a Shaman, in LDoN or EXP groups with a Wizzy (or Druid) I don't even nuke at all. I just use my right click slow and dog, nothing else. I'm always FM. Using our nukes takes too much time and it's not even worth it. I can get 2 or 3 cast on each mob which only does 900+ damage (I don't have crit aa) before the mob is dead. Groups with 2 melee players can do that (900 damage) in 1 or 2 seconds so my nukes are not even speeding up the kill by that much.<br />
<br />
Here's something about wizards with Epic, pet AA, Crack, FT15, harvast AA, and harvest spell. They never run out of mana in LDoN or in exp groups even if they cast their best nukes twice on each mob that's 5,000 points of damage without crits. I crit for 7K with a bard in group and I have crited 5 times in a row on Vindi.<br />
<br />
Don't even compare Shaman's nukes to a Wizard. Shamans cast way too slow (I think it's 6.2 seconds for my best shaman nuke) to be effective.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't even compare our nukes with a Necro's life tap. Their 850 life tap (which also crits) is hardly ever resisted.<br />
<br />
Having another Shaman in group over a wizard is not effective at all. Unless you like to dungeon crawl and take your time in LDoN. I think during a LDoN over 45 minutes is too slow as it is. I beg my cousin (lvl 65 war) to take on another wizard instead of a druid. I can do heals since I'm always FM. I can keep him alive no problem but that's another thread about our heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zoria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You very highly overestimate melee dps, especially if one of those melees is a tank. And since when was 900+ damage &quot;only&quot;?<br />
Thank you for giving your point of view, it was most helpful, but i still see no hard data. I know full well how convenient it is to slow and forget about the mob, its what i do a lot of the time too. But thats just not playing to full potential.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">More I read the more I smell troll</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">More I read the more I smell troll<br />
<br />
You're quicker than me.  I whole-heartedly agree.<br />
<br />
TROLL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zoria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">So either of you know of a melee who can dish out 200-450 dps then?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">So either of you know of a melee who can dish out 200-450 dps then?<br />
I know Wizards that can do that. Most damage melee I know are in the 120-150dps range (Rogues, Monks, Rangers). My shaman really has to work to beat 100dps.<br />
<br />
What's more, a Melee will never have to med and a Wizard's mana regen is almost totally passive. It's like 50-60 mana a tick for a good wizard. That's more than enough to keep up with Canni/Q.<br />
<br />
When you can post a parse of 5-6k+ per exp mob over the course of 2-3 hours you'll be able to start challenging the melees. Meanwhile the wizards are effortlessly doing 7k+ and the only thing holding them back is the tank's agro-cap. The average shaman can pull about 3k if they really try.<br />
<br />
You are not and will never be a DPS class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">...You are not and will never be a DPS class.<br />
<br />
I don't know about that.  It's just like most of the other stuff that shaman do, we can do it, just not as well as the classes for whom DPS is a speciality.  Also, I think you might want to check your numbers, I can dump 3500 hp into an xp mob that lives 1 minute without trying, and I'm a very average shaman gearwise.  That's only 55 DPS not including G-Bob, I'm sure there's shaman who can do more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Anyways, if I ever took the time to parse myself over time on any higher raid level mob, I could easily probably pass 150 - 250 dps depending on the mob and what my roll is.  Certain mobs like the Warlord in PoEb, I start casting both AE rains at 95% and do not stop until the mob is dead.  Most of them are not resisted, and depending on where I'm standing, I can keep it up the whole fight (use the mod rod when I can, canni5 when available, bard mana song, and on the horse).  Not sure what the exact dps is, but I'm willing to be you that it's pretty high.<br />
<br />
Really, over certain long ass fight that I've been involved in like Rallos Zek in Time, I've put up prob a good 150 dps depending on where i&quot;m standing and how venturous I want to be.  <br />
<br />
Right now, in certain time trials, using a mage bracer and my two new curse dots, I have broken over 1500 dmg per tick.  This was very nice, but of course, it easily led to me getting summoned (did it on the trash stuff so I wasn't hurting too bad getting hit).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">ZORIA IS RIGHT... ALL HAIL ZORIA... THANK YOU ZORIA FOR GIVING US YOUR WISDOM.<br />
<br />
  Sheesh, you won't be happy till we post exactly what you want and even then only if it proves whatever it is you want to prove I guess.<br />
<br />
  Also, there ARE melee with that kind of DPS, and I believe that Fearcazic would know.  If you look closely he said he &quot;right clicks my slow.&quot;  ie - he is Time Equipped.  And so would be his groupmates.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Anyhow, I'm done with praising my new god Zoria...  I gotta go submit a couple petitions and letters to GMs to get the change updated on my character, still says Tribunal for some reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">A wizard's mana regen is nothing to scoff at.  All of their mana regen tricks are mostly passive, except for their first harvest, which stuns them for 10 seconds.  Their AA harvest also gives them free mana, but it doesn't stun, so its just free mana every 10 minutes.  Combine that with FT15, their AA familiar, their epic, pot9, spiritual dominion, voq, and bard song, and they are a mana regen machine.  In addition to great regen, most wizards usually have a significantly larger mana pool that a comparably equipped shaman does.  On top of that, every wizard specs in evocation, where almost no shamans do.<br />
<br />
So, wizards have evoc spec, great mana regen, and large mana pools.  These factors, combined with the fact that their nukes are vastly superior in efficiency and DPS potential, means that a wizard's nukes are going to blow ours away.<br />
<br />
Also:  They get more nuke AA's.  They get a detrimental haste AA, an aggro reducing AA, and more crit AA's than a normal caster gets (in addition to an innate ability to crit).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Zoria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">We get FT15 too. We get pot9, SD, VoQ, bard song too. Size of mana pool does not matter for regen. We can specialize in evoke too (although any shaman worth a damn wont).<br />
<br />
Filtering all that out, wizards get: 2 harvests, familiar, epic (3 mana/tick), more nuke aa.<br />
Shamans get: Canni 4 and 5.<br />
<br />
In conclusion: PROVE that our regen dont let us come close to wizard damage over a period of time (see my FIRST post), and i will shut up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Do you people understand what Troll means? lol<br />
<br />
Thank god for the ignore feature.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How about you prove it does?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Zoria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">As i have already said, im planning to. But i must say im very disappointed with how people are reacting to this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Wizards have a better selection too.  We get stuck in an area thats CR (like plane of water), we gotta rely on asstastic poison nukes.  Wizards?  Oh just switch over to SoS which can crit for 6k+ or Agnarr's Thunder which is like 3-4.5k.<br />
<br />
I've played an elemental wizard with elemental gear and all the good stuff.  They blow a shaman away no contest.  If you factor in a shaman stacking in 2-3 dots on a mob that will last a while (ie: boss mobs), a shaman *may* pull closer, but will still fall short.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now a more sane question, how well do Wizards stack up with shamans on slow!111  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Your parameters are silly.  In a real parse [normal group], a shaman will always come out below a wizard because we have responsibilities beyond just nuking.  Likewise since our superior mana regeneration is all active it means that we have less time for nuking. <br />
<br />
Also, parsing spell casters seems flaky at best.  Logs don't catch alot of spells for whatever reason, so any data is suspect at best.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I amused myself and checked my logs.  The only time I had all spells on and I was in a group with a wizard, I had a twink wizard in the group, level 64 at the time with minimal AA.  FWIR, the group was Monk, Bard, Rogue, Wizard, Shaman, Paladin, with a Cleric and Enchanter out of group for buffs and heals.<br />
  <br />
<br />
This was in Codecay last June.  Things might have changed by now, but I had full AA and Fury of E'ci from the Cloak of combustion at the time.<br />
<br />
Providence (Wizard 64)  362,502 dmg.<br />
Gugek (Shaman 65) 228,269 dmg.<br />
<br />
That was over 110 minutes.  I was using Velium Strike and Blood of Saryn on adds which should be more efficient then just straight nuking.  <br />
<br />
I used Yalp to parse.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">One other note.  This thread just feels like the old SimShaman (tm) wars of last year.   <br />
<br />
No matter what, even in full damage mode, shaman come out way behind other casters with the exception of Clerics.  Because of a series of factors, heavy aggro from our best dots, the worst ratios on nukes, the resistability of rain spells, lack of focus effects for one of our best DDs (Spear of Torment), and the active nature of our regeneration.<br />
<br />
Similarly the nature of the mechanics of EQ mean that damage casters have a real advantage over us in the damage department.  SimShaman is assuming that mobs come at a steady rate, that there is absolutely ZERO down time.  <br />
<br />
Even in the best groups I've ever been in there is no such thing as ZERO down time.  You have to run from spot to spot in LDoN, people have to deal with biological necessities, and people go LD.   <br />
<br />
So for example you spend at least five to ten minutes just running in between adventures in LDoN and within the dungeon itself, time running is time you can't Cannibilize, other damage casters like Necromancers are getting more mana then you in the meantime.  The fact they are getting more mana combined with the poor mana efficieny of our spells puts us at even more of a disadvantage.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">In conclusion: PROVE that our regen dont let us come close to wizard damage over a period of time (see my FIRST post), and i will shut up. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Svarten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">It is realy intresting how many people try to outdo the wizards in damage, forget it, you can't. If the wizard knows what he is doing he will NEVER get oom, he will NEVER steal agro from the tank and will ALWAYS do more damage than a shaman, only class that can in theory rival the wizard in damage over tile is Magician or Necromancer...<br />
<br />
I have a 65 Wizard and a 65 shaman, I love bouth characters, they are so different to play though, you don't play a shaman to be a DPS monster, you play a shaman to slow, buff and help the other DPS monsters do there job!<br />
<br />
Also, some numbers for you to crunch if you realy want to be efficient as a wizard....<br />
<br />
Strike of Solusek -<br />
2740 Damage<br />
640 Mana<br />
8s Casting Time<br />
2.3s Recast<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
Ancient:Destruction of Ice -<br />
1200 Damage<br />
250 Mana<br />
3.5s Casting Time<br />
13s Recast<br />
+<br />
Ice Spear of Solist -<br />
1200 Damage<br />
300 Mana<br />
3.5s Casting Time<br />
13s Recast<br />
+<br />
Iceflame of E'ci<br />
30% Focus selfbuff for level 60 Coldspells (Stack with all other focus)<br />
<br />
-------------------<br />
<br />
Now do the math yourself or trust me with the following:<br />
Strike of Solusek - 4.28 Damage / Mana<br />
A:DoI - 4.8 Damage / Mana + Focus 30% for self buff.<br />
Icespear - 4.0 Damage / Mana + Focus 30% for self buff.<br />
<br />
now the more focus item you add to this calculation the bigger the differance will get, so if you have bouth the level 60 ice nukes, that is the way to go... since you don't want to steal the agro from the tank you will use concussion or greater concussion between each nuke anyhow so the 9s downtime in a chain nuking session between the 2 ice nukes will be used for that.<br />
<br />
Strike of Solusek is SLOW, infact it is so slow it is not even funny in a good DPS group...<br />
<br />
I donno how people are doing there math but they sure as hell can't be using normal math to figger out that SoS would be the best way to go...<br />
<br />
And when it comes to the shaman DPS:<br />
Bane - 430 Damage / Pulse<br />
Blood of Saryrn - 320 Damage / Pulse<br />
Breath of Ultor - 131 Damage / Pulse<br />
= 881 Damage / Pulse<br />
= 146 Damage Per Second<br />
<br />
True Spirit (Buffed) ~= 20 DPS<br />
<br />
Don't realy need a parser to see what damage you can do in the ultimate senario, just use math... Most parses I see ppl present is always in the ultimate senario anyhow...<br />
<br />
Happy dotting...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>eyeball</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Our nukes suck....and especially LDON groups. So my question is this:<br />
Considering our amazing mana regen, over time, how does the damage of a serious shaman nuker compare to wizard damage?<br />
<br />
<br />
Sounds like you just found out shamans are not as necessary in LDoN than in other zones and you're just trying to justify in some strange way that you are still useful.  Well we are useful but not as a dps and especially not in LDoN.  Who picks a shaman in their group for dps?  Doing dmg is not our role, buffing and slowing are, and if you're not happy with it then go start a wizard.<br />
<br />
You want prove that shamans are doing more dmg over time against regular mobs because of our mana regen, well thats just retarded.  In a boss fight maybe, but you don't want to know about that, you just want others to prove to you that even killing a mob that dies in 30 seconds, after slowing and whatever you'll still have time to do enough dps to beat a wizard.  And when we don't justify it for you, you go nuts and yells at everyone for some solid data.  You're one sick twisted person and we refuse to take part in your delusion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Stickygoo Onjooshoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Thats like saying a group HAS to have a cleric and chanter/bard in order to do anything besides single pulls. Its just not true in all cases, hence why i need some solid data.<br />
<br />
<br />
I start my own ldon groups. And many times im the main healer if we cant get a cleric. Last group i was in we had 2sk paly warrior ranger and shaman (me). We owned the dungeon. I was pulling with root and slow and haveing pet hold back the adds till i slowed them. 90% of the time we got singles or 2 mobs. was cake. paly own for backup heals!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Just ask Thot ... maybe he can make a graph or something to show how we nuke better than wizards.<br />
<br />
/sarcasm off<br />
<br />
The numbers are there for a theoretical analysis.  Between the time it takes to cast cann or to cann5 to regen mana and the LONG time it takes to cast our wildly inefficient nukes, there is no way we can theoretically can outnuke a wizard.  Their nukes have a 4 DAM to 1 MANA ratio mostly, our best is 3.083:1 and takes almost 3 times as long to cast.  Add on the fact that they got for crit AAs pretty quick and most shaman don't cap those skills at all.  In addition to the fact that you have to take time to slow a mob, possibly debuff resists, cann a few times, then drop nukes and that some of your better nukes (ie: ToS) don't do well on the last few ticks of a mob's health where wizards don't have problems delivering a whole arsenal of lethal nukes, there is no way you're coming close.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Lumor2000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Why not run the math, to see if you could even imagine a scenario in which a Shaman can outdamage a wizzy.  I have no idea why you wouldn't want to run the numbers first, to at least see what ballpark you are in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">This is a fairly meaningless discussion; the bottom line is that if, by some miracle, I ever outdamage a wizard in a group then that says *nothing* about me and it says *alot* about the wizard (ie: /disband him). <br />
<br />
I actually have done parses of LDoN adventures in which I was grouped with wizards (mostly because I wanted to see how much overall damage I was contributing) and the results were predictably that the wizards and rangers and magicians in the group did alot more damage than I did.  Depending on the wizard, it was sometimes 50 percent more and sometimes 100 percent more.  Pretty much what I would have expected.  What surprised me is that I was able to outdamage most of the melees in the group -- didn't really expect that.  I was also a little surprised at how much damage the enchanters were putting out (considering they had to mez pretty much every fight, with multiple mobs).<br />
<br />
In the end, you just need to accept that certain classes do certain things really well.  Wizards nuke.  Magicians nuke a little less effectively, but they get that snazzy pet.  Shamans slow, heal, and nuke but they do it all with pretty much middle-of-the-road effectiveness.  And that's fine.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Personally, I am NOT going to worry about the math atm, or parse.  But I will make some blanket observations, and thoughts.<br />
<br />
At the low end of the game, I would not be surprised to say Shaman offers more DPS than a wizard.  By the high end, no way.<br />
<br />
Look at it this way.  If you take 65 Shaman/65 Wizard give them each<br />
25 to 50 AA.   At this &quot;low end&quot; I am going to say FT5 on each.<br />
As thats not unreasonable to reach for outside raids.  Going to say epics.<br />
MC3/Can5 for Shaman.  Nuke Crits for Wizard.  At this point, a shaman's mana regen advantage IS HUGE.  Standing your talking 3+5+3 = 11 Shaman and 10 Wizard.  Add in Can5 alone is 1250-200=1050 every 30 tics or 55 FT.  - Harvesting which i don't feel like looking up.  So your looking roughly 4 times the mana potential.  <br />
<br />
Now, go high end.  Mana Regen Standing Maxes out 60+.  This means that the shaman advantage drops from 4* the mana to dish out, to under 2* the mana.  With Specialization Edge ((how many shaman are nuke specialized), + more efficenient spells + faster dps, its easy to see that Wizard is going to outdps a shaman.<br />
<br />
Can5's mana advantage is a fixed amount over other casting classes.<br />
At some point, the percentage advantage drops enough that other classes are better offensive dps.<br />
<br />
Also, you have to understand that Mana is not the only limiting factor to dishing out spells and damage.  The other limiting factor is TIME.<br />
Shaman spells are slow in terms of casting time and dps.  This means we often dont have enough time to use up all our mana advantage.<br />
<br />
Time works against shaman especially if you single pull.  Mobs dont live long enough to give you time as a shaman to dish it out.  If you multi-pull however the gap isnt as large.  Then your comparing Poison Rain, to say Druid/Mage/Wizard Rain and poison rain stacks up better to other rains, than our nukes do to other nukes.   Plus you can pick a mob or 2 other than the one the melees are fast slashing, to DOT to get the maximum advantage of Bane, Blood, Anethema.<br />
<br />
I know for a fact, in an elemental level guild a shaman can't outnuke a wizard.  We can come close to a druid.  And really at that level, Shaman make a better healer than almost anyone.  I usually main heal with Quiessence's efficiency on Elemental Level Tanks.  ((LDON vs Normal))<br />
at 200 mana (less specialization) for 1800 (rare 2100)) there isnt much that's used atbetter to 9 to 1 ratio.</div></div><hr />

Oh oh I've got another interesting one!  Since we can wear haste items and the precentage of our spell haste is greater than that of a Knight's self-only haste buffs, surely a parse will show that we do similar, if not better melee damage then them.  Throw in Billy and avatar we'll likely have a higher attack value as well!  I demand somebody parse it! Now now now!

The whole thread should be locked down or just deleted; it was started with the intention of making people angry, and its done just that..move to the grey now?<br />
<br />
and to the troll itself:<br />
math theories (done correctly accounting for every occurance) is going to be your best bet if you want to compare potential damage each class can do.  Potential and actual arent very far from each other (again when you account for everything--not a thott graph).  If the shaman is slowing, then you've wasted at least 5 seconds right there you could have nuked, and if they are casting malo..another 7 i think (5 second cast? +2 refresh).  The wizard is already ahead of us by a couple of nukes.  Also gear and AA play a HUGE factor in all this..so simple parses by various people SHOW YOU NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  But you didnt want parses..you just wanted to start a fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Mudcrush Durtfeet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Vs mobs that don't resist bane too much I get up to 851 a tick (+1-30% damage from a focus effect).<br />
<br />
   It's a bit situational but not a horrible thing.<br />
<br />
   When fighting multiple non mezzed mobs at once I've gotten much more at times (up to about 1491 a tick, +1-30%).   In such fights my damage per tick will vary a lot, anywhere from 111 to that 1491 peak (bane, pox, 3 blood).  That's about 21-285dps, not bad at all for a shaman.<br />
<br />
   I'm not saying it's versus every mob or every fight but kinda fun when you have the opportunity.</div></div><hr />
