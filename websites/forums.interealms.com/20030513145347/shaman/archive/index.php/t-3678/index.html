<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ryakin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know how to get the Shaman Trainer on Luclin in Shadowhaven to train a Barbarian Shaman? The Spell Merchants will sell to me but the Trainer won't train me. <br />
<br />
And are their any other Shaman Trainers other than Halas? Seems strange that they would scatter Beastmaster Trainers all over the place, but only 2 Barbarian accessible trainers ( one of which won't speak to me )<br />
<br />
Thanks for any assistance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>celebel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">there is a faction quest in shadowhaven, it takes about 15 minutes to do and gives you an item to change your faction with people there...<br />
<br />
prolly you will find the quest on allakhazam...it s an easy one...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is a shaman trainer in Cabalis, Oggok and Grobb.  You're welcome to try and train at any of them. ;)<br />
<br />
I can train at the Ogre Camp in West (east?) Karanas...so I suspect there might be a few barb friendly trainers scattered around...maybe in FV?  I've never been there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd try doing the faction quest. It starts with Trade Commissioner Henry, and involves a run to the Bazaar, and Fungus Grove. Should be totally safe for someone over level 20 or so.<br />
<br />
If you do the quest about 10 times you can max your faction and not need the faction amulet you get as a reward.</div></div><hr />
