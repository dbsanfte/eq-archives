<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Impossible to say, but unlikely.  SOE said that they aren't balancing us for the short fights, because we're so great at long fights, then admitted they weren't putting any more long fights into the game.  Not promising.<br />

Of course, who knows when you'll hit 65?  For some it's literally a week, for others it's three years.  A shaman is a great toon to powerlevel other toons with, so if you can use EQW to play two accounts at once, you will get a fair amount of use out of a shaman even if you just use him to power up other toons you make.  The difference between playing just one account and playing two is so great that it's like playing two different games.  And a shaman is a great partner.<br />
<br />
By the way, you can do that with EQW(EQ Windows) on pretty crummy systems with pretty awful connections, you just have to turn all the options off(including sound).  And some people can't do two toons at once in big laggy raids, just when grouping/duo'ing.<br />
<br />
The shaman is a fun but very intensive toon.  You have to canni a lot and be very busy.  Great if that's what you're into.  But not the most relaxing toon to play, and not one with a very bright future at the moment.  Easily one of the very best partners if you duo or need powerleveling, though.</div></div><hr />
