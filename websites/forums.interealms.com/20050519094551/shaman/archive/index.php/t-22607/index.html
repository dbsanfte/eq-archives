<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Seriously, changing the cast and recast time on this spell would be not too much of a class balancing issue, other than reducing the hassle of debuffing multiple monsters and freeing up time to do other things. One might argue that since it's no agro and debuffs many resists, it should have severe limitations. I'm of the opinion that those benefits are already countered by the mana cost of 400, which needs to be cast on every mob in a raid OR exp group setting.  when doing any enounter with multiple mobs, the 10 sec recast on malos seriously leaves me banging my head against the wall.<br />
<br />
I'm suggesting malos be dropped to 3.0 cast time and 2.25 recast. Yeah, I know that would make it close to tash only with no agro, but the damn spell costs 400 mana. That's the same as a complete heal, only it doesn't do any damage, nor does it heal anyone. All it would do is speed up the debuffing process overall and let us focus on other things (spot healing, cannibalizing, applying damage) for which we need as much time as possible due to the spells being ineffective (moderate casting time for low output. See Spot heals, spear of torment) or ridiculously long for moderate output (velium strike, any DoT).<br />
<br />
If anything is killing us, it's lack of time to be able to work with the situation.<br />
<br />
Comments?<br />

Edit: That post on the eqlive forums is asking us to address issues that are hassles or otherwise simply inconvenient, this would be a great one to push.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I usually have malos/malo memmed on raids and alternate to get around it. But yeah, would be nice to just use malos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In total agreement, my malos cast time with spell haste/bor isnt too shabby, but the recast is the killer....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yeah, the recast is a pain<br />
i too use both malos and malo on raids for chaindebuffing, it worked quite fine, but the better your spellhaste item gets, the more you have to wait until one of the two spells pop up again -&gt; the &quot;rhytm&quot; of debuffing is no more consistent but rather techno-like, hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If they could make all our spells faster casting, I would accept a decrease in the efficiency of canni.<br />
<br />
I think with upward scaling mana pools (with every expansion) that we could see the decrease in cast time in exchange for no increase in canni. Fixed hp/mana canni with people having 1-3K bigger mana pools is making even Can5 less useful. I would trade no Cani upgrade for faster casting since I could actually do more in shorter time and I could can4 in the downtime to make up for the scaled loss of mana regen efficiency.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If faster and faster battles is going to continute to be the norm as the game moves forward, then I agree wholehartedly. Even with the new slow, I would like to keep Malos handy &quot;in case&quot;. <br />
<br />
One of the biggest problems with the way these people run the game is HOW they develop content. they give a class a spell, lets use Balance of Nihil as an example. They add a -40 resist modifier. Now, when they create new content, I think they sit there and go &quot;Well, there is that new slow with a -40 modifier, so we should add +30 to the resist of these mobs to compensate&quot;. This kind of logic is so self defeating, but saddly, it gives the players a false sense of &quot;progression&quot;, when in reality, all it does is further unbalance older trivial content. <br />
<br />
So yes, shorter cast/recast times on Malos are probably going to be a factor (or maybe the new MalXX will have this already)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I agree.  It's rediculous to load Malo and Malos just to beat the recast time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Glencannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The BL's I raid with don't need Malos or Malo to get slows to land....they routinely have everything slowed before I get around to it.<br />
<br />
Is there a resist mod on BL slow? Anyone know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The BL's I raid with don't need Malos or Malo to get slows to land....they routinely have everything slowed before I get around to it.<br />
<br />

<br />
No, there's not.  What you don't see is their resist messages.  They get resisted about as much as we do on Turgurs.  The only thing that makes a difference is that Sha's Vengeance or whatever is gotten several levels higher than Turgurs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">but guys think of it malos 10 second recast    we are shamans we do well in long fights !!!    :p<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
on a serious note   :p    yeah i agree meming malo + malos can get around the recast  but i rather have 1  spell memed rather then 2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">beastlords have no resist mod on their slows.  I have a twink beastlord and it's just as hard to land it without any debuffs as it is for for shaman to land theirs.  Really, the only reason that you see them landing it faster, is that they don't have anything else to do other than cast it.  So, typically they prob land it right after malos/tash has landed.  It's also a quicker casting spell, so it seems like it's landing all that much easier.  I've exped in earth alot with my beastlord and I can tell you that depending on who I have in the group, sometimes I have to break out the tash stick in order to get slow to land before I'm beaten to a pulp.<br />
<br />
Also, Griz. I honestly think that that is part of the reason they put a resist modifier on Balance of the Nihil too.  I think that they gave this to us, so that we can have something to land on a mob while we are waiting for malos to refresh.  Typically in an environment where two mobs come in (usually raid) I start casting malos when I can on the pull.  I'll use TA to hit the first mob and then switch targets and hit the second with nihil (assuming that the TA cast landed).  If the TA landed but nihil didn't, then I hit malos on the second one and cast TA immediately after that.  There is still a split second recast time in there that I'm not able to cast malos, but it's better than waiting again for Nihil to refresh or using TA or an non-malosed mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Malos is an extremely powerful spell.<br />
<br />
They are going to increase the recast time on it actually to improve shaman stackability at raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Somehow it seems all our most powerful spells are somehow gimped.<br />
<br />
Lure-slow is incredibly short lasting. Our dots generate insane aggro. Our nukes either take forever to cast or hits like a sissy. Malos takes forever to cast and recast. Our group speed is worthless because our single speed is better percentage. And dont even get me started on Ferine Avatar... Are there any other class that have as many issues?<br />
<br />
Just because we like to eat ourselves and remember the pain of our ancestors and whatnot to regain mana, does not make us masochists.<br />
<br />
Removing some of these blocks would really be a feather in the hat for SoE if they claim to understand class balance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly , ALL our spell. We only have slow spell....</div></div><hr />
