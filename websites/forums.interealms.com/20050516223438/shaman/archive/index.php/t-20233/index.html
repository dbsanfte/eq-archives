<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jvrebi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The more I play my Shaman ( level 65 – 150 aa’s – Elementals ) the more I realize this is true.  When I’m looking for a LDON, if I’m asked to a group, 95% of the time it’s because my slow is needed.  The other 5% is when I’m asked to be the main healer.  Just got an invite to join a Plane of Fire group?  It’s because I’m needed to slow.  Just got a tell from a guild taking down RZ.  They’re short of Shaman atm can I come help?  They need me to Slow!<br />
<br />
There’s a lot of discussion on our boards about where our class is falling behind and what areas we need to ask for improvements in.  There are a lot of things we can do and bring to a group.  They’re all eye candy compared to slowing.  Do I think our heals need upgrading? Yes.  And yes to all the other areas mentioned here where we’re falling behind.  But if you take away the need or ability to slow mobs, or make another class as good or better than me in that area, than I will be forever sitting there with my LFG tag up.  That’s the difference between SLOW and all the other things we do.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You could ask for complete invulnerability, and you would be more likely to get it than any real slow upgrade. Get it through yer skull... slow is overpowered. Its why half the crap in the game resists it. We need something to compensate for losing an ability that broke the game. You WONT see anything to get past slow mitigation, and if you do, content will just be tuned assuming you are already past mitigation. So you will be spending aa's for zero sum.<br />
<br />
Are you even aware there are other classes who slow about as well, and offer more? You are a security blanket, a throwback from a time before 65% beast slow.</div></div><hr />
