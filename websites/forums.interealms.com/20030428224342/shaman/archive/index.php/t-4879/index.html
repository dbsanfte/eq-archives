<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Unfortunately, there is no memmable spell called &quot;primal essence&quot;.  Primal essence is a right click spell-like effect from the Hammer of the Dragonborn from VP or from a 2hb weapon (name escapes me atm) from Acrylia Caverns.  The PE from the 2hb is a group effect; from the VP 2hb, it's single target.<br />
<br />
Both weapons are no drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Damal Iceroot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is a spell &quot;Primal Essence&quot;, drops in SSra second floor. Level 52 spell.Got one about a month ago.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">OK my apologies :)  I've never seen nor heard of this spell dropping, but EQ casters realm has a reference to it, so it must be true (*buehller? buehller?*).<br />
<br />
So if it drops in Ssra and it's a level 52 spell, what dropped it?<br />
<br />
Let us know when you find the group acumen spell.  I'm keen on that one too ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Damal Iceroot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It dropped from &quot;Shissar Mystic&quot;. From the people I was there with they said that this was first time they had seen him there before, so needless to say i was rather happy when he dropped that spell. He's supposedly drops our group Acumen as well. I hope that helps some.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I wouldnt worry too much about primal essence.  Its fairly rare and copies wont start trickling down to the general shaman population for quite some time probably.<br />
<br />
Its a stat buff anyway, 20 to str/dex/sta/agi.  True thats probably some HP for casters, and stacks with our other stat buffs, but not too big a deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've seen it in the bazaar on Xegony for 30,000pp - not sure I'd be able to bring myself to spend 3,000pp on it though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It really depends.  Where your tanks have primal, they don't want pe, because it doesn't stack with the proc'd avatar, but the casters (especially wizards) are always asking for it.  Pre-primal, and everyone wants it.<br />
<br />
Generally on raids I'm not carrying my spear because it's too much of a pain to unequip shield and spear and re-equip hammer over and over, so I just keep the hammer out.<br />
<br />
If I had to cast this as a spell buff, I'd be doing a lot of feedback about making this a group spell along with acumen, etc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Beemine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I heard this spell doesn't stack with agi or sta making it annoying? If you have it... which spells have you yourself confirmed it stacks with?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It wont stack with any single target or group agility.<br />
