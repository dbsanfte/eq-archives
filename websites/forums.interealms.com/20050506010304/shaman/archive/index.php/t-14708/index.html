<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi!<br />
<br />
Anyone know if our pet shield us? And what are the conditions? Low HP? Asking because i am wondering if i should get pet discipline or not...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Supposedly it does, but I've never seen it. You'd have to be standing very close to the pet I would assume.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lethis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, the 55+ pets will shield you. There are several conditions that you have to meet. Your health has to be depleting rapidly and second you need to be positioned directly beside your pet. I wouldn't count on it saving you anytime soon though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You don't need the pet AA skill for this either.</div></div><hr />

My pet (49) has shielded me on many occasions, it is usually when I have dropped below 50% health and I am standing right beside him. Not sure what difference it makes though, I haven't seen anything change when he does shield me.</div></div><hr />

My 44 pet shielded me.<br />
<br />
From what I can tell (talking on boards, observation when I spot it, etc), it requires you to take a sudden drop in HP or be low HP...<br />
and it only lasts a short while.<br />
<br />
That and, as was said, the pet has to be very close to you. This is never a problem for me, as I'm generally right there with my pet tanking away (hence my low hp\sudden drop in hp)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">my 44 pet shielded me many times when we were both toe to toe tanking a mob. Since the jbb became active I have tended to let the pet tank while I chuck dots and chain cast jbb. The only time I get into a tanking situation now is if I need to shield the pet while we finish off a mob, or if I overdo my damage through jbb etc and get agro, or if I need to get my weapon/defense skills up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for answer. But actually, i was thinking to bring my pet during every raid and let it /pet hold so it wont aggro anything, but will keep shielding me.<br />
<br />
Will get that lame Pet discipline and try it during raids as living shield hehe :). WHo knows, maybe it will save my butt once !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hibbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The message for this can be filtered out sometimes.  I noticed my friend's warder sheilding him, but he never got the message himself.  I have no idea which filter the message is under, but it apparently can be filtered out entirely.<br />
<br />
So your pet might be sheilding you without you knowing.  I've never noticed a huge difference when mine starts shielding me though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Our pet can shield others as well, just not it's master. <br />
I have had mine on different occasions protect another guild member during a boss encounter and they were getting the beat down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">my suggestion is dont waste your 6 aa points on pet hold for JUST the off chance it will shield you or someone else on a raid, unless you want the aa for better use while in groups/pulling for groups.  <br />
<br />
And my anecdote for this is i was in HS soloing for glowing iksar skulls (why must the final one elude me after 10 hours here why why!!?),,anyway  (61) pet was tanking and i was casting canni4 and pet suddenly decided to shield me, and no i wasnt highest on hate list and was at around 70% hp so who knows how it works :) and canni4 is like 5-7% of my hp i think so it wasnt dropping THAT fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Since they gave the shield ability to warrior pets, mine has shielded me often when i get Low on hp for whatever reason. <br />
<br />
I've also seen the Pet swarm dogs shield me as well.<br />
