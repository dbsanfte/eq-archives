Commence running.<br />
<br />
Some Rogues (duh) were takling about this command in /gu last night while I was trying to get two corpses from MPG ZI to NC ZI for a res last  night.<br />
<br />
When they explained it to me, and I used it I declared next time I see this either of these Rogue in person I will offer to have thier babies.<br />
<br />
Great stuff, a wonderfull discovery, a little dampened by the fact that I got raped yet again on my way to NC ZI but at least my 3 corpses were all TOGETHER!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, but did they tell you how to STOP dragging them? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not for a while, they were having a good old laugh between them selves in /gu about whether to tell me or not...<br />
<br />
/corpsedrop for those who like I dont want to guess ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its an awesome feature. You can only have 2 corpses on /corpsedrag, but you can now EASILY write up a macro to drag a few more. The old way was a pain to drag more than 4, not anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">make a macro with 5 lines of /corpse<br />
tie it to a turn key.<br />
in options set your &quot;last 2 targets&quot; toggle to the same turn key<br />
target a corpse,<br />
target a second corpse<br />
start running while tapping left once in awhile.<br />
<br />
never tried the new one you posted I suppose with the new drag range that macro would work. I can tell you from personal experience that with the old track range dragging multiple corpses was usually easier to do one at a time.<br />
<br />
<br />
(edit)<br />
<br />
ok posting while still asleep is bad, thats a whole new COMAND...wonder if it works with my set up? that would rock 4 at once!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kilgaroz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've seen one of our guild roges dragging 6 corpses after a wipe before, the old corpse macros do work in tandem with /corpsedrag.  To anyone who's new to this feature, you need to drop the corpses before they can be rezzed, btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Are you sure that they need to be dropped?  Seems like I have gotten a rez before while it was being dragged.  Not that it matters that much I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kilgaroz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Am I 100% sure?  No, but about 95%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>dennman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Am I 100% sure?  No, but about 95%.<br />
<br />
not true at all. it's a common practical &quot;joke&quot; that res someone in and then see them chase their own corpses hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">you do not have to drop before rez</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You don't have to drop them for a rez, but if you're a corpse puller running out to get more corpses, it would be NICE to drop them so the person could loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Now Gloriana where would the fun be in that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hehe, that reminds me of my brother's bard dragging around my other brother's mage's corpse, the mage was trying to run around and catch his corpse, cause he's a noob and didn't know to take away consent.</div></div><hr />
