<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tahar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK <br />
Im doing the totemic armour quests. I heard that dufrenite drops in unrest.<br />
Im not rich or twinked So earning enough cash to buy all the dufrenite i need is very expensive.<br />
<br />
If it does drop in unrest how rare is it. I just dont know how im going to hunt for the other parts I need buy all the spells I will need and still buy dufrenite and not be 40th lvl by the time im done. <br />
<br />
I guess Im just a little discouraged becuase spells are so expensive and the mobs at 25th lvl dont give me all that much cash.<br />
<br />
Any ideas would be a great help. Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>thorvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes dufrenite drops in Unrest...<br />
<br />
But you'll be there for, forever and a day before you get one. Might I suggest just scrimping and saving as much as you can to buy them. Totemic will get ya by through till you're in your mid 50's in all honesty. I still got a couple pieces on me yet at level 52 and I'm doin just fine. <br />
<br />
Course.. I'm hopin to get some drops on better stuff... But I'm not too worried till then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sepisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its pretty common from clock works in SolA as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dufrenite drops rarely in unrest, and is a much more common drop from SolA.<br />
<br />
However, in terms of return for time invested, neither is a particularly effective strategy. In the time you spend waiting for dufrenite to drop, you would probably be able to have earned enough money to buy it anyway.<br />
<br />
My tip, get a couple of friends and spend some time in Runnyeye - The Blackeded ally armor is actually quite good, and some pieces are quite valuable. A BA Coif (8AC +8 all resists) or a BA Medallion (6AC 5wis 5 int)  should sell for 200 - 300 plat, and even the BA belt (8AC 5sta) can go for 100+ plat. Even the normal BA armor sells quite well - it is a bit better than banded and a lot lighter too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>wyrm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">with the eception of the helm isnt ry'gorr considered better then totemic? i know he will need to be in the 30ish range to hunt it with a group. just curious</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Krubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Starting in your high twenties you should be able to solo mammoths in everfrost.  The tusks sell for 8pp a piece, and you can easily make a thousand plat or so over a few levels.  Not bad exp either.  If your not a Barb the shaman spell merchant at the ruins is non-Kos to everybody (I believe).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Go to Netherbian's Lair on Luclin.  Excellant zone for level 20-29.  Mobs drop 4-6pp each.  You could rack up 200pp in a couple hours tops and make awesome xp while doing it.  Its got a great zone modifier as well as beng a dungeon for below 30's.  The xp is insane.<br />
<br />
Also a named drops a Shm/Bst pair of legs that is 8 AC 3 Wis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Definitely follow the suggestions to hunt Wooly Mammoths or get in a Runnyeye group. The gnoll spires in South Karana are also pretty good for plat/loot. I got much of my money for dufrenite by camping the Goblin Wizard/Alchemist spawn in Permafrost (you need to kill the Wizard for one of the Totemic quests). While I was there, the Alchemist dropped two Mammoth Hide Cloaks, and I sold one for around 1kpp. The Forest Giant Fort in Warsliks Woods also has decent plat/loot.</div></div><hr />
