<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild was able to take Volkana tonite the 42 man raid that you need to move on in the progress quest. However I have read multiple stories that the reward is 5 extra buff slots but none of us got more than one slot. Anyone know if this is a bug or was it only 1 slot originally or what? Seems very inferior compared to what must be done to get to that stage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I *believe* its meant to be 5 buff slots .... however have never seen a developer post on the subject ....<br />
<br />
I had heard rumors of it being fixed in last patch, but that obviously never eventuated .... I just /bug it every 2nd day ....<br />
<br />
It has happened to everyone that has the AA ... <br />
