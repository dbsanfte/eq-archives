<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Dont really know where to put this, its kinda hunting... =D<br />
<br />
a friend quit so I decided to make a twink pally on his account which has somewhat brought me out of retirement.<br />
<br />
right now its 30 and been in kaesora since 20. he has the fabeled ghoulbane which procs 249 vs undead right now plus the instrument of nife spell which adds another 200+ proc. Id like to stick to undead because of that, but if good exp is found elsewhere then it doesnt really matter.<br />
<br />
I cant find a good place to PL him, kaesora is going to slow down in a level or so. I would like to get him 45+ asap and then head to HS.<br />
<br />
tatics I have been using is pull with slow, malosini and cripple. melee, proc, proc, proc, dead and then pull again.<br />
<br />
was thinking lower guk, but with the fables still around it would be slim pickings for mobs. any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">use a druid to pl him till lvl 45-50ish (DS&gt;&gt;&gt;pally melee dps lol)...i did a bit in kasora, sol b, seb/velks, once he was able to group with me i got a melee and ran around ToFS rapeing stuff with pally in group...that xped him fast....i tried to keep him out of the planes because mobs hit to hard and have to much hp for me to PL there.  i did do CoD with him for a few mid 50s lvls, but that was slow grinding.  once to 58 i did Ldon till 61 (this went really fast).  after 61 BoT group him or solo on the shaman with him in group till 65.<br />
(if you can get him pof access solo with him in group as soon as you can =p)<br />
<br />
i tried to do any camps i needed to do with him while he still got xp for it.  IE shard camps/gate neck camps/ect...that makes a big differance.<br />
<br />
btw my pally is now lvl 61, carpin/bertox short of EP access, and sol ro short of fire access (i would link you his gear but i am to lazy to make a magelo....he is in pritty much the best buyable gear possable and some seru gear.  he has the zek healing proc hammer.  he is a full spell book minuse 2 rune spells).  <br />
<br />
i really hate grouping in the lower teirs so i am reluctaint to lvl him further until he is pof able =p<br />
<br />
basically stick to mobs with low hp and low dps output (older expansion stuff).  Aim for undead if possable and keep the mobs in the yellow/justred range.<br />
hope this helped a little...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">City of Mist, Trakanon's Teeth, CoD, Mistmoore (too low perhaps?), ToFS, LGuK, KC Basement are all zones with some undead.<br />
<br />
CoM and KC basement will be great from 40-50 or so I'd guess, nice zone mod on CoM iirc. Not all undead but a good number of mobs are. KC basement is a bit tougher, but fairly empty these days so move there once you've levelled some more.<br />
<br />
Cypt of Decay is the only undead zone I can think of in PoP, grouped with shaman there it should be reasonable going but by that stage you're often best off in a full group chain pulling somewhere (or doing LDoN)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I gave up on my pally doing the damage (except for LGuk, lovely zone) around 40'ish and took her to nurga with a mage to DS.  Skip the slow and that DS does the trick quite nicely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Gunthak beach undead are your friend until 44 ... though for your expectation I would guess it would work for you up to about 40-41.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Took my pally to Nurga at 29.  He used a Fabled Mithril 2hander(48/40) and before the level recc was added, he was literally shredding red cons at the entrance, albeit they were slowed.<br />
<br />
At 29, he was getting 5-6% EXP/kill down there.  He's 35 now in the same spot, still getting about 3% on kills ranging from white to red.  My method is I pull with slow, let pally take aggro, beat the mob down (heal him as needed), and drop velium strike when the mob drops down to about 35-40% HP.  fetch another and repeat.<br />
<br />
Pre-Lvl recc, I was clearing the first big room with the railroad tracks, the two side rooms, 1 pather, and a few from the pit in the room ahead.  Pulled from bottom of pit (higher cons), and they'd warp up to me and run the suckers back.  COuld use dogdog to finish the mobs off but I dont have /pet hold yet heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">don't go to KC, the xp is horrid there...i tried that, it sucked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Stronglikeox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There are undead in Echo caverns in the Taskmaster room.  Bunch of skellys, can single pull with your shaman, they DO run so be aware.  Taskmaster himself isn't that hard, he's undead as well.  Got decent xp here to 50ish, darkblue to 55ish.  You might kill to fast but there are other, non-undead mobs to pull.  Taskmaster can drop the organs used for the EB necklace quest in Katta.<br />
<br />
Only thing to remember, keep 1 skelly alive at all time or else you could spawn a Thought Horror who is a chanter is isn't a lot of fun to try to fight.  Made short work of a 65 ranger with his AAs that popped in to &quot;show the lowbies how to fight&quot;.  I laughed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">had to slow down a bit on the PLing because of RL<br />
<br />
got him to 32 in kaesora. things are starting to turn blue but he still gets 3-4% a kill there. only problem is that he can clear the church and all the towers and still have to wait for repop.<br />
<br />
I totally forgot about bards/nobles though. that would probably be insane exp in the mid 30s</div></div><hr />
