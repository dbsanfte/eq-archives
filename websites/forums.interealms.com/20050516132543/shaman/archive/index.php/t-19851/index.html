<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Galgor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">No one has really posted any conclusive evidence about Spirit Call V, so I thought I'd make a quick log and post it for all those curious. And yes, those are the pet proc's in there. Note though, the test was performed on a level 65 fully buffed rogue - so the damage seems a bit low to me. I have seen them bite for upwards of 130+ on stuff in plane of fire. I'll try making a log on normal mobs over the next couple days, and post here. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nakukak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The reason for the parse's low damage cap is that pets do 2/3 damage in PVP. Parse on an NPC, or multiple by the reciprocal. I believe both would work  ;) <br />

'Cause melees use pets so much?  Well, SKs and BSTs do I guess.   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When a melee was charmed he hit you for 15s?.... Are you talking PvP or by an NPC?  When you are charmed by an NPC you turn into a friggin monster.  You automatically get some sort of NPC haste attack and you hit for more too.  It's been years and years but I'll never forget when I was in MM with a chanter buddy of mine that someone pulled the whole castle and as we were clearing fools at the zone line Gorgos got charmed and turned on my buddy.  He couldnt mez me fast enough and got smoked because I was swinging too fast.  This is with a Gatorsmash Maul (Yes I know I know like I said it was years and years ago) delay on those friggin things is 70 if I remember correctly.  But the only way I even knew I was charmed at first is my attack was boosted about 300%<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway more recently fighting the Mephites in PoN my bro's SK was charmed and I couldnt get him slowed though being hit, where as typically in the Arena I can get him slowed np at all.</div></div><hr />

I found this to be the most impressive aspect of the pet.  Why can't we get a permanent pet spell with at pet proc that does this?</div></div><hr />

was funny as hell, he  hit alot, so hasted but never more than 15 and didnt really interupt my spells. was htting me for a good 30 secs, untill mezzed and got me to 99% health.<br />

i believe his response was &quot;i suck, and remind me never to dual you!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Why can't we get a permanent pet spell with at pet proc that does this?<br />
<br />
Well, a permanent 640 DD lure (-300) proc would be a bit overpowered to say the least.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, one of the scrapped AAs for GoD was:<br />
<br />
Rabid Companion III  <br />
1:  Add Proc: Rabid Companion Effect III <br />
2:  Increase DEX by 75 <br />
 <br />
Rabid Companion Effect III    <br />
1:  Decrease Hitpoints by 75 <br />
 <br />
Resist: Disease <br />
Resist Adjust -30 <br />
<br />
For reference, the L63 Beastlord proc is:<br />
<br />
Spirit of Rellic<br />
1:  Add Proc: Spirit of Rellic Strike <br />
2:  Increase DEX by 75 <br />
<br />
Spirit of Rellic Strike<br />
1:  Decrease Hitpoints by 155 <br />
2:  Increase Hate by 50 <br />
3:  Stun(2.75 sec/61) <br />
 <br />
(No resist adjust, btw).<br />
<br />
Those beastlord procs go off all the time it seems, as often or more as cleric hammers - and if Rabid Companion had been the same, it would have been a useful DPS boost. Certainly more useful than SCS from my POV, but then I'm not a raiding shaman....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i'm just glad that they upped this again after they initially came out with it.  When they first changed the pets, they did a max dmg of 95 and in three fights I only saw one proc.  This is very interesting and i'm thinking that I'll be getting the pets soon, even though they prob still don't have the hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vannilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">A charmed troll warrior with a blade of war hit me for 100-ish max during the PoF bird fights :\ Also did a late night cursed run, some warrior managed to get charmed and was hitting me with (I think) a bloodfrenzy and rotting fist from Bert, never did more than 20 and missed more than she hit (Yes, I was tanking Cursed). My low 1200ish AC makes player melee look pitiful, I can only imagine what a real tank's AC would do to PVP melee damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Being on a pvp server, I can say this:<br />
<br />
Pets do 2/3 dmg in melee, but spell dmg(procs) are not reduced.<br />
<br />
With melees, if they are NOT linkdead or charmed, will do the same dmg they would do against mobs. Of course, misses and mitigation here are based on AAs/AC.<br />
When melees are linkdead or charmed, the absolute max they will hit for is 2x their weapon damage. Once again, procs are not affected by their being charmed or LD.<br />
<br />
imo, the best way to deal with the birds is to have a bard pull while having only instruments equipped.. he gets charmed, then MT gets agro. 60 seconds later(or whatever refresh is on the charm), the MT gets charmed, and next MT steps up and does AE taunt and gets his agro. A chanter or bard will then rapture or ancient mez the charmed warrior, and will continue to do so until the charm wears off. This mitigates any interruption the charmed tank could cause on the clerics in CH line.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, to the real subject.. do these pets still have like 200 hp? if so I still won't buy them... if that is changed, I would think about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In Galor's log that's 3 x 640 = 1920hp damage over 10 ticks for 32dps PLUS whatever melee damage it does.  Not too shabby. Recast time on SC V is 6.5 min though.<br />
<br />
Well, a permanent 640 DD lure (-300) proc would be a bit overpowered to say the least.<br />
<br />
Ya, guess you're right as a pet proc, but how about giving it to us as a spell?  It's essentially a less efficient version of Spear of Torment (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3379&amp;source=Live) that is unresistable.<br />

Yes, they still only have 200 HPs. It's kind of disconcerting to see them poof after a few seconds if they catch a riposte... :(<br />

Here's a snippet from my log, pertaining to SC5 and normal dogdog:<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Ya, guess you're right as a pet proc, but how about giving it to us as a spell? It's essentially a less efficient version of Spear of Torment that is unresistable.<br />
It's closer to the L55 Wizard spell Lure of Flame - and as such, I'd suspect our chance of seeing anything like it as a directly castable spell is close to zero:<br />
<br />

Xantik is the regular shaman pet. &quot;So and so's pet&quot; are pets summoned by Spirit Call 1-5.<br />
