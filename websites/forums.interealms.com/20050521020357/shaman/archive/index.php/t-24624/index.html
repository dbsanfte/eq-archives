<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I've seen multiple things from Sony on this. They've said the ship date is Nov. 8th and it starts the 9th. I've seen them say it goes live on the 9th. Yesterday they said it launches on the 8th and the same day the EQ2 forums will switch to Station accounts only for posting. <br />
<br />
Obviously the game doesn't &quot;ship&quot; from Sony on the 8th and be on the shelve the next day for sale. Normally a store may have it a few days before the release and can't sell it until the release date.<br />
<br />
So, my question is can we buy it from a store on the 8th or 9th?</div></div><hr />
