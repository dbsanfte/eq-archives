Now, this is hearsay, but if Scott Hartsman really did say this it looks like we could have DoT stacking in the game before PoP.  We all know that Verant does not have the best record of doing what they say, but then again Hartsman was the guy who actually sat down and tested the spell drops and figured out that they were FUBARed, so I have some faith here.<br />
<br />
This would be a very welcome development for multi-shaman raids as well as a long-overdue buff to our necromancer bretheren.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you elaborate please (or point to a thread)? The last I<br />
heard (from the Boston fanfair) was that they weren't going<br />
to change the spell drop rates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stonienogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">what's the issue here anyways? I can stack Bane of Nife, Envenomed Bolt, Venom of the Snake, Pox of Bertox, Scourge, Plague, and epic dot all on one mob at once... what's not stacking there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gorslam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Other people's dots on the same mob</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Kbok, that was a few months back after the big petition thread here.   After two years of Verant saying &quot;shaman/wizzie spells drop just as often as any other class&quot; Hartsman actually tested it and found out, whopsie, that thousands of players were right and Verant was wrong.  He then fixed the code and it went in the next patch.<br />
<br />
Now there is still a legitimate argument that torpor/malo don't drop enough, but that has more to do with the sources of the spells, the increasing number of level 60 shamans,  and their relative importance to a shaman.  But it isn't a broken code problem anymore (as the much higher availability of spells like Pox and VoB attests).<br />
<br />
Stonie, it is stacking the same dot from different casters.  This would pretty much end the &quot;stacking on raids&quot; complaint (valid imho) that necromancers and to a lesser extent shamans have had for quite a while.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hahaha - not laughing at you Kbok - but does this illustrate that there is still something wrong with the spell drops or what ?<br />
<br />
&quot;But it isn't a broken code problem anymore (as the much higher availability of spells like Pox and VoB attests). &quot;<br />
<br />
??? - what server is this? I have never seen Pox or VoB drop. I *think* I saw Pox for sale in the Bazaar for something like 50000 pp. Thats not much higher availability. Spell drops are still completely messed up for anyone not able to mass-slaughter Kunark dragons and the few Velious ones that somehow drop Kunark spells too.<br />
<br />
Saying spell drops are fine now is like saying &quot;ooh nice - thank you dear sir&quot; to the thug beating on your skull with a big club when he stops.<br />
<br />
And DoT stacking is very nice, no doubt about that. But only if our DoTs are not resisted. A stackable lure slow or malo would still be much more beneficial if you want to make more than 1 or 2 shamans needed for raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Buma,<br />
<br />
I was able to buy Pox in the Quellious Bazaar a few weeks ago. It cost me 20k, though. There was actually 2 copies of Pox for sale at the time - the other guy was asking for more money though.<br />
<br />
I also bought Voice of the Berserker on Quellious for 5k, pre-bazaar. A friend of mine was doing the Sebillis crypt and Voice dropped. No shaman was in the group, so I bought it from the guy who won the roll.<br />
<br />
I am not saying that they are not rare as hell - but they can be had on Quellious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually, the spell drops that were improved were Tigir's Insects and Bane of Nife.  I've noticed a definite improvement in their availability.<br />
<br />
The 59-60 spell drops (Pox, VoB, Malo, Torpor, Avatar) were not changed and still remain rare drops from Kunark boss mobs (Gorenaire, Sev, Talendor, Emperor, Protector, Jumpy, Chardok King &amp; Queen) who have a random chance to drop any class 59-60 spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah, I have VoB as gift from a long-gone friend that I gave another spell. And 20k for Pox is just silly sorry Ximix. Never will a long-lasting dot like Pox be worth 20k if it wasnt because it is extremely rare and people for some reason put a value to this rarity. And I never had 20k anyway - but if I did I sure wouldnt use it on a DoT.<br />
<br />
It was broken before and it is broken now. Mainly becuase there are many more shamans now and the primary droppers of the spells still show up with the same regularity. And I bet you have tons of twinks in uberguilds sitting on spells they cant scribe yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">He had a rather long post on the Necromancer board (but it has since been wiped) where he explained why certain spells had been dropping less frequently than they should have been.  I don't remember the details, but something about the algorithm not spitting out enough high numbers or somesuch.  Apparantly the code looked fine at first glance, which is why they had never bothered to actually test it before.  Once he tested it and saw that they were dropping less than they should, it took a while to track down the problem if I recall correctly. <br />
<br />
When he figured out how to fix that, the &quot;fixed the spell drop rates&quot; patch went in.  My understanding, based on this old post, was that this bugged rarity was removed for all kunark spells (unless you are of the &quot;malosini should be malo&quot; camp, which is a different bug, if it is a bug at all)<br />
<br />
Of course, spells that are on fewer drop tables (like Malo, Torpor, etc.) drop less commonly because they drop from fewer mobs.  But they are no longer disproportionally rare within the tables they drop from.  What was once a double-whammy (you could only get it from a few mobs AND the loot table was bugged so they spit out less often than they were intended) is now a single whammy (you can only get them from a few mobs).  Not that they are common drops now, but neither is any other particular spell on that table.<br />
<br />
What anecdotal evidence I have seen supports this.  Of course, it is only anecdotal, but this guy has earned some good faith I think.<br />
<br />
Of course the single whammy problem gets worse and worse because the numbers of level 60 shamans increases every day while the number of mobs who can possibly drop the spells remains static.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I didn't mean for this to degenerate into another spell drop thread.  DoT stacking is news enough, I think.  If it goes through, I think it will be a really wonderful improvement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Hey we screwed up for two years with Shaman and Wizzie drops. To make it up, we're instituting a single group quest wherein Shaman and Wizards can get said spells.&quot;<br />
<br />
Or<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey we screwed up for two years, to compensate for the frustration, we're including Wizard and Shaman 59-60 spells on 57-58 MOBs in Kunark.&quot;<br />
<br />
Or <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey we screwed up for two years, in addition to our apologies, we're adding Torpor and Malo to the vendor for 1 month. 5 K apiece.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes? No? Pipe Dream ? Too easy? Too far-fetched?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">must we have another thread whining about spell drops? I'm not saying they're fine, but we have heard enough already.<br />
<br />
this post is about DOT STACKING, of the same spell cast by different players. would be a great change, plus it would almost force them to look into upping the 15 buff/debuff limit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If DoT's will stack, that, added to the removal of the DoT penalty would be very nice for shamans.  Add the availability of more affliction III focus items, and shamans could become serious damage dealers in long encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">DoT stacking (if they ever make it, on FF they said it was impossible) is all jiggy and nice and funky but unless they fix their resist rates we are still looking forward on insane resist rates on endgame/boss mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">what about the 15 buff/debuff limit on mobs, does that really exist?  <br />
<br />
If so, dot stacking could cause a lot of problems.  I sure wouldnt want turgurs getting bumped because a 25 druids on the raid all click their ES arms/velious bracers.  :)<br />
<br />
But I am looking forward to seeing where they go with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>howjan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Let's look at this from a slightly different angle, should ds's from different mag's/druids stack?  <br />
<br />
If they get there own seperate icon, how is this going to affect the stacking of debuffs on a mob?<br />
<br />
I don't think a mob should be able to get sicker with the same dot (I would view stacking sub-dots as a different form of disease or poisoning).<br />
<br />
You cast poxx...mob x get's sick<br />
shaman x casts poxx...mob x get's really sick<br />
shaman y casts poxx...mob x get's really very sick</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Baldaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">There most certainly is a 15 buff limit (or at least somewhere around there).<br />
<br />
Shaman can do an incredibly high amount of damage for a buffing priest class on the majority of raids (although on some we can effectively do no damage).<br />
<br />
Yes, even enough damage for 4-5 shaman to 'stack' decently.  In the long run I don't believe verant will ever change the code to allow dots to stack anymore than I think they'll make druid and magician damage shields stack, or aegolism from different casters stack.<br />
<br />
What I do think is that every dot in the game needs to be re-evaluated for the current state of the game.  For the most part dots are extremely outdated and can't even be used in the normal course of the one group game.  Lower durations significantly, increase damage slightly (or reduce mana cost) would go a long way to helping shaman, necromancers and druids.<br />
<br />
On another note, do people think that heal over times should stack with each other in the same way?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">So far, I've seen 4-5 Bane of Nifes in the Bazaar for 4-5K, listed at once.   20k for Pox seems.... unrealy steep.   I'll be a jerk and say, I've managed to get all my spells (the hard to get pre-Luclin spells) fairly easy.   I think I had Malo and Torpor before I was even 60 (that was a long time ago).    Basically, guilds just gotta kill those dragons in Kunark, Sont/Kland in WW on a regular basis, and they'll drop.   I know it's not easy as it sounds for some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yes, which makes it self-evident for some, and irrelevant for the rest.<br />
<br />
But perhaps you were merely bloviating?</div></div><hr />
