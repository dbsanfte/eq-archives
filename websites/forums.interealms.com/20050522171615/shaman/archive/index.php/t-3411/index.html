<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I duo with a 60 shaman and monk, both have pretty good equipment including torpor (the best spell in the game imho). Some of the things I've done...<br />
<br />
DN - killed dragon constructs, rats and phase spiders<br />
ME - killed the goranga chief 6 times, still no DI :(<br />
CT - done the entrance<br />
Hole - cleared about half way in to castle<br />
Chardok - cleared past observer<br />
<br />
Anyone else tried other zones with a similar duo? I'm fast running out of ideas. I'm thinking...<br />
<br />
seb - emperor camp (I can get a rogue to let me in) how tough is this? I don't fancy CR in there.<br />
<br />
ssra - never been, think it will be doable?<br />
<br />
Anywhere else??<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ahpok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I play 2 box with a 60SK and 60Shm. I can nearly clear whole xp raid zones. Personally, I like ME's ET hill, OS, FG. whole good xp and items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you could probably do crypt easily enough, just make sure you split up the ICGs so they aren't CHing each other.  Monk should be able to pull back towards room with the fallen monk or whatever for the monk shackle quests.  Then the only thing you gotta worry about is them CHing themselves.  Other than that you should have no problems taking all of crypt (except emp, or only emp/blood cuz of rogue thing)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rigu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">if you do the emp, they cant pull crypt w/o a rogue with them at all times, door to blood is locked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Without a rogue I realise its gonna be either 4r OR blood and emp. Since the main aim is to get malo, pox, bane, tigirs, avatar I'm going to pick blood and emperor. I'll be pretty happy if I can get any of these. Although its not going to be too much fun if he runs through locked door but I'm going to give it a go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Braxton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You should be fine, I have soloed Emperor before, altho not for long as on the 2 Emperor spawn, I got summoned into his room for letting him run and go through locked door and gate. With a 60 monk, you should be fine. Just fight him close to the door to his room in the corner and he usually will not gate.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">UP is fairly easy with monk/shaman combo though the named entrance mob is slow to kill.<br />
<br />
Sol B for the FG's tickles my fancy all the time hehe, easy but fun.</div></div><hr />
