<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stirny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok so after a break in eq, me and my friend are back.  We are planning on duoing most of the time and maybe forming the occasional group.  He decided to start playing a druid again, I however have spent a week trying to decide what class to play.<br />
<br />
I am leaning heavily towards a shaman, a shaman was the first class I ever played but I only got up to 14 and started a druid.  I played the druid to 51 and had fun but I want something new.  I am at a crossroads though, I want to be able to hit stuff simply because I never have but at the same time I love spells but hate hybrids.  I respect the opinions of the posters here so I come to you for help.<br />
<br />
My main question is how is a Shaman's melee ability?  Granted I know there not a melee class but if you have a druid friend, your wolf pup and some decent gear is it possible to get toe to toe while you fight and do good?<br />
<br />
Also, I am not a power gamer, we just want to have fun, eventually we hope to join the high end part of the game but basically we just want to have fun.  Anything you can tell me about a druid/shaman combo, pros and cons...basically just looking for advice so I can start a character and start having fun.<br />
<br />
btw I have about 10k to spend on gear if that matters.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance!  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you want to melee, well, shamans can melee better than a druid, but nothing special. It's just fine for lower levels, but at 50, you won't be doing it that much, or not effectively anyway.<br />
<br />
If you like spells and hitting stuff, I would suggest a hybrid, I know you said you don't like them, but I'm curious as to why. I played a ranger before my shaman, and it was very enjoyable. I miss meleeing effectively sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pally or SK is a good choice these days too, if you decide that hybrids aren't that bad an option. And with Knightemization in the last couple expansions, gearing them up is easier than ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Shaman melee is about the same as a druids:  That is, nothing impressive.  If you want to stand in a mob's face and melee as a shaman, a druid is probably as good a partner as any.  They can heal you and give you a nice DS to increase your overall DPS.<br />
<br />
However, if you really want to melee stuff, why not go with a melee class?  Any melee combined with a druid will be a perfectly viable duo, but once you hit pop, you're going to want to be able to slow.  Thus, I'd suggest a beastlord.<br />
<br />
Another good partner with a druid would be necros.  You do awesome DPS as a necro, and the druid's own dots (which aren't shabby at all) and nukes (also not shabby) can do some pretty impressive DPS.<br />
<br />
Also, possibly the best partner for a druid, is a chanter.  Even at lower levels, a charm pet controlled by a druid's snare, along with heals when your chanter takes a few hits, is an awesome combo.  When you hit 64 and get Command Of Druzzil, enchanter + druid is easily the most powerful duo in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shaman/druid combo works pretty well at high levels.  I have a 46 druid that I dualbox with sometimes and he adds a lot even with the big level difference.<br />
<br />
1. Snare!!!<br />
<br />
2. Ports and Succor<br />
<br />
3. Downtime heals/spam heals during combat<br />
<br />
4. Dots/DDs... ok so this isn't a big deal right now since he's only 46 but I can see what's coming and it will be nice.<br />
<br />
5. Harmony.  Again, hard to get use out of it right now but in a few levels this will be great.<br />
<br />
Yeah, you will be root rotting a lot with this combo.   But then again melee are easy to pick up and usually grateful for the group 8^)</div></div><hr />

You get the idea.  The most fun I ever had with a druid partner was with my enchanter.  Shaman is still the ideal class in my book, but I wouldn't roll one if you want to feel good about yourself as a meleer.  <br />
<br />
Take a look at the hybrid spell lists.  In addition to losing the exp penalty they had way back when, they've got spells now that their parent classes don't even have (for whatever sense that makes), and they've completely lost the hybrid mana cost penalty (though they still have some nasty fizzle streaks at lower levels).  Right now I'd say knights are so good, they're next in line for the nerf bat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't play this class if you want to primarily melee<br />
<br />
You can do it, but as an above poster pointed out whiff whiff, or the damage is pretty small.<br />
<br />
Once I slow the mob its cake though. Mostly do it to amuse myself.<br />
<br />
<br />
Melee - go pally - for ldon they rock<br />
<br />
pacify<br />
decent dps<br />
can tank<br />
heals</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In LDoN, I always use my pet to help with the dps.<br />
I heard I need to hit the mob at least once so that my pet won't take 90% of the exp from me. So I malos, slow, pet attack, can, can can, oops mob's almost dead...hurry in to swing my hammer....miss, miss, miss, miss, miss........more misses.....damn it mob is dead already!!!<br />
<br />
I decided to have SoT loaded from now on for those LDoN groups.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">How about sharing your characters? One of you play shaman at times,  the other a SK, warrior, pally, monk, whatever? That way get great solid shammy love, and can play hitty hitty some too, eh?<br />
<br />
Not to mention playing a different class opens up a whole new section of EQ knowledge, gives you insight in to how other classes work and makes you a better shaman.<br />
