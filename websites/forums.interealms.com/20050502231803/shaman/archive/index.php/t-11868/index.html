<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have only been to the lighthouse in LoY.  I have absolutely no idea how to reach any other zones from there.  I&#8217;d like to try for my Stoicism spell but all the posts say to go to Dulak's Harbor and to give items to an impassive sea spirit in Gulf of Gunthak.  Could someone please give me directions on how to get to these locations?  <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

i had never been there before trying the quest, and the write up gives great directions/locations to get there. Good luck =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Murgok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I read through the posts, but never saw how to get to Dulak harbor, maybe i missed, not sure.  anyway, jump in the water at the lighthouse and go south, eventually you'll hit a beach.  follow the beach to the right and hug the wall you hit.  hell, i'll just post what i have of the map i made.  pretty straight forward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kunderu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">check out this  website  (http://maps.eq-toolbox.com/)for maps and maps for the new LoY cartography system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the help.  I had read the sticky, which was very helpful indeed.  But it doesn’t give any direction on where the zones are.  I can understand that, as most people wouldn’t tell someone how to open the jar of peanut butter when telling them how to make a peanut butter sandwich.  I’m just so new to the zone I don’t even know the basics.  I’ll download some maps and finally try to learn how to use the new mapping tool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">enter gunthak,  cast sow on yourself,  cast levitation(levitate/dmf/whatever) on yourself,  run across the water.  There's really only one way to go and that's south(I think its south :-) ).  Run to the beach, avoid the undead (use invis to avoid the non-undead), find the tunnel on the back wall and then run along tunnel to dulak.  I forget which turns you need but the maps/new cartography system show the tunnels pretty good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">theres a really great map pack of LoY on the foh boards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Has anyone seen an LoY zone connection map?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Or you could check out the zone layouts yourself.  Yeah, it may take a little longer, but you will get more out of it, and it would break the monotony of the same everyday bullcrap you always do.  <br />

Everquest is a game, play it.<br />

I can understand people being afraid of exploring in EQ.  It is constantly pounded into us the whole time we play.  If you explore, you will die and no one will be around to help you.  This idea is constantly pounded into us from level 1 to 65.  At some point you gotta realize that the people that made the maps are the ones having fun.  The ones that got there first and saw things they didn't expect.<br />
<br />
Take a chance for a change and learn for yourself.  Who knows, it might even be fun.<br />
<br />
Or don't, it don't matter to me, heh.</div></div><hr />
