<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Windigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We've done this before in a party atmosphere and it was kind of fun.  I'd be happy to go even though I'm going to get killed many many times over :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not a member (or recruit) at this time, but it could be cool!  Mage's get to use their PETS, right? :)  Cause I don't think I would stand a chance if I wouldnt have a pet.  Hell, i probably wouldnt stand a chance WITH a pet.  heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hehe I suck bad at pvp too. i think i got both of you beat :D<br />
It would be fun if ppl wants to bring friends but I guess I will leave that to the officers to decide if/when this comes to pass <br />
<br />
fun to see there is some interest in this  :p <br />
<br />
<br />
*I suck at spelling as well*</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Welcome to the club :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aneron Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">To be honest I would love to be able to do this, the last time I was in the arena for an event I was in Sons of Steel. I had to fight Romulus and Detren (most know him as Keverian in CoE now) and got my backside handed to me. But what a BLAST!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Andraxson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Originally posted by Aneron Darkbane <br />
 I was in Sons of Steel. <br />
<br />
Wow, small world.  I was OLD SCHOOL &quot;Sons of Steel&quot; myself.  That was way way back when EQ was NEW (like 4 months old).  My primary at the time was my DE Necro Andrax.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aneron Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hmm how long were you with them? I joined them just a little bit after Atkins became guildleader, and stayed SoS till just after the server split and Lazarus Tribunal was formed.<br />
<br />
EQ was still pretty new when I did join them, I think the highest member at the time was level 40, and that was high for the server at the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Andraxson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Not really sure who was the guild leader... my memory fails me.  :(<br />
<br />
I was with them for a while...  but its all blurred together... :)  heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Entium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I would love to do PVP......well cause i rock at it......lol welll my class at least....So bring on the pain!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Orris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">ill be there :-) whenever that happens :-) ill just keep everyone mezzed :-) take u down one at a time :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Taln</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think it's a great idea wina, a chance for everyone to meet everyone, there are a lot of people I have still never met yet, the only problem about the get togethers is.....well.......ummm.....Runt Balll, I hate Runt Ball, it hurts a lot, Klydon and Wulf kick really hard, Ill be glad to go Wina but only if theres no RUNT BALL....</div></div><hr />
