In PoH, we were running around killing inkies for crests...I'm bored, so I load up the old torpor!  Hit monk and paladin midfight.  Reapply to monk.  Monk says, &quot;****er !&quot;  Paladin says, &quot;wierd, i'm snared but no icon.&quot; (The necros up there snare a lot)<br />

Yesterday, was on my monk twink doing an adventure.  Cha aug drops.  We have a chanter, so I figure it's gonna go to him.  The mage however, says &quot;cha lowers your chance of getting attacked&quot; and proceeds to roll for it.  <br />

<br />
How did it not hit the whole group, unless you were away from the group?  KEI is a group buff.  If you were in the group you would have got it unless it was tgb was off, and they were casting individual doses (which would be idiotic in itself).<br />
<br />
One thing's for sure...the game is losing/has lost a lot of the old timers, and with the ability to PL so quickly, people don't seem to know **** about their classes anymore.  My enjoyment of the game is usually 2-boxing now, and the occasional grouping with longtime guild members that have left and come back.  We were once a guild of over 100.  Now there's maybe a dozen of us that regularly play, but not at the same times.  The nice thing is that all KNOW their class, and the abilities of other classes.<br />
<br />
That's what I miss, and why I don't put the LFG up much anymore.  I'd rather spend 4-5 hours 2-boxing with my SK, than putting up with lvl 65 idiots that have about 20 days played.  PoV and BoT is like old DL now.  Some good ones, but a LOT of bad players there, too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Moglyzok Moogleman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I was in a great normal Miragul's adventure group, and we were doing great.  Our cleric played her job extremely well, but she was in a bad mood.(claimed in real life her boyfriend dumped her, probably happened cause she was patronizing us)  So throughout the adventure she would get mad, she was really pissed when I died (which happened because she told me to heal our bard, which i did but it generated enough aggro that i already had from malos for 1 guy to begin to hit me)  The mob got a 2 full damage swing, did it again then another (from my low health) jumped me and killed me.  Anyway, throughout the adventure I was FA'ing, hasting, backup healing, and malos then slowing the mobs.  A little more than average stuff, but my gear is absolute crap (And when i say crap i mean CRAP, an enchanter i grouped with had more HP than me  :rolleyes: ) and I just bought SCM level 2 yesterday (I only had the first rank on this)  So as I said for the entire adventure my mana never went above 60 and never went below 30.  Once we finished I said &quot;Holy crap, this whole adventure my mana was low!&quot; then the cleric said &quot;Why dont you try /sit&quot;  She wasnt a newb at all, but that was amazing, never noticed my HP dropping :D .</div></div><hr />

My apologies, Gwain.  I just thought that somehow, somewhere, a person might NOT have downloaded maps and would not have realized they are marked.<br />

<br />
*Ahem* As the only guy in my LDoN groups who often has the maps, I can tell you, only the assassinate / rescute &quot;named&quot; mobs are marked. The random pops that drop stuff are, like I just said, random. They take the place of one of the mobs that would have spawned anyway. Call it l33t b3t4 inf0z if you must.<br />
<br />
*Gives Gwain a pat on the back*<br />
<br />
Now, dumbest thing ever said in my groups, I was playing my beastie in Takish Hiz, with a cleric who probably thinks the bicycle helmet his mother makes him wear at all times is high fashion. We're talking a mook who used Superior Healing at 58 because it's &quot;more efficient&quot; than Complete Heal. He only used Superior Heal on the pally tank, the rest of us got greater healing. Every rare occasion he would CHeal the pally. Yes, a real numpty, but let's face it. a beastlord isn't going to be main healer in a level 55-oriented LDoN, right, and he was the only cleric we could find.<br />
<br />
Now, a bad pull happens. Lull resisted on the first mob and the pally pulls the whole room. He was doing good up until now, accidents happen. Well, I take one, and pet-mez another while the Ranger and wizard work at the meaty parts and the druid keeps me from dying. The Ranger's HP are dropping as only a Ranger's can... the conversation went like this...<br />
<br />
Ranger: Heal me, quick!<br />
Me: CHeal his ass this time!<br />
Cleric: Incoming Greater Healing for Ranger!<br />
Paladin (from Gunthak, I don't really want to ask): ...WHAT?<br />
Ranger: (From PoK) What the hell?<br />
Five minutes later... We wiped except for the cleric who gated...<br />
Cleric: You want a rez?<br />
<br />
The other thing he said was &quot;OOM, med break&quot; and &quot;AFK&quot;... I swear I never knew they made pull-string talking twat dolls.</div></div><hr />

The Enchanter proceeds to cast boon on herself then melee. She was told 5 times to sit and med because, while meleeing, she says &quot;OOM&quot;. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Im sorry for being grumpy when I wrote that, Gwain.  The point is though, there are maps available for use, and some named are marked.  Even if mismarked, even if its just the wrong situation.  Consider the number of posts there has been because people have spell vendors marked on their god maps.  The person going by them is not necessarily dumb, just misinformed.<br />
Anyway, sorry for being an ass, but perhaps dont be so quick to call a person dumb because they misunderstand what is being told to them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Again, what I mean and the wording come out different.<br />
Let me try again.  Some folks have the maps all downloaded, some make their own, and others just ignore them altogether.  The second two groups wouldn't have any way to know just how detailed the downloaded maps are.  I see what you were getting at, the maps dont show the random named.  I was trying to point out that the person really did have named marked on his/her map(wrong for the mission type).  I wasn't even sure you had seen some of them and knew that (static)named were marked.<br />
Believe it or not, I AM sorry I got snappy at first.  And for making stuff up, you're right, I took 'dumb' from the thread title.</div></div><hr />

51 warrior group asks: &quot;How do I roll?&quot;<br />

I said I had to go after that and went to solo in Nurga.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Silverbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Funniest thing I ever saw was pre-Kunark.  Was in a pu group in the Aviak tower.  Aviaks were conning yellow and red to us and we barely had enough time to med and keep up with the spawns.  A caster took one step too many backwards and fell to her death.  The ogre warrior, clearly played by a kid, was very proud of all his hit points.  After the death he started saying &quot;I'm gonna jump&quot; over and  over - wanting to prove he could survive a fall from this height.  Someone said it was a bad idea, but finally he said &quot;I'm gonna jump&quot; and did.  Lost around half his health.  Then we see &quot;Oh no, there are mobs on me, HELP&quot;.  I think he  aggroed a couple aviaks on the way down.  We figured he would zone, and a mob popped, so we start fighting.  What does he do?  He runs back up to us with 2 or 3 mobs in tow.  By now he is down to about 1 bubble of health and he is running around the top floor in circles saying &quot;HEAL ME, HEAL ME&quot;.  Everyone just stood there and watched him run in circles.  Finally, I couldn't stand it any more and hoped he learned his lesson (I doubt it) and (was playing a Pally at the time) LOH.  Then we had to fight the mobs.  Of course, more spawned and there were several deaths, but the warrior never died.  It is actually one of the most memorable events in EQ for me.  I will never forget him running in circles pleading for a heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Had one ask me for kitty crack the other day, while I was sitting there with my pup. ANd this fool was in thier 60's (bot group), so they logged on thier chanter to kei us and didn't bother to kei the shammy.<br />

How did it not hit the whole group, unless you were away from the group?  KEI is a group buff.  If you were in the group you would have got it unless it was tgb was off, and they were casting individual doses (which would be idiotic in itself).<br />
<br />
We were all spread out, and the moron either was doing individual doses, or they weren't smart enough to wait til we were all back together. Anyways being a shamy I said fugg it and went back to mashing canni (not like I wasn't gonna anywyas, just wanted to through out more damage).<br />
Can't believe your trying to give me crap about some retard not keiing me and ya ignore the entire fact that I got asked for kitty crack. Yes I am smart enough to know that Kei is a group spell thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I was on my SK the other day trying to get a few levels and got an offer for a group in Velks...well it had been a long time since I had been there so I said sure....I get there and it is literally like the group from hell.....its a warrior, SK (me) a chanter, shaman, a ranger and a druid...after forming up, buffing etc, we move up to US and start pulling pretty well, then there are 2-3 adds...the chanter says &quot;off tank plz&quot; so I figured no prob, I can do that... and proceed to off tank one of the mobs while the ranger root parks one.<br />
I didnt think about it too much at the time, but it happened again, and again, and again....so I simply asked in group why she wasnt mezzing the adds or simply pacify pulling...it nearly floored me when she said &quot;I dont mezz, it never works anyway and its a crappy line of spells&quot;.<br />
Well when I thought that it couldnt get any worse I noticed that the shaman in the group wasnt cannibalizing and kept giving mana reports 50....60 etc in group say; he was in bear form so I assumed that he was sitting and by golly I was right. By this time I was getting fairly upset...I am a very nice feller, I dont knock people to their faces or down their gear, especially if they are a newbie, but when the shaman says &quot;OOM med break&quot; and &quot;can you haste my pet please (said to the chanter)&quot; I just cracked....he never slowed, never debuffed, never healed... he nuked and meleed...I just started laughing and cracking jokes about it with the ranger (who knew what he was doing thank god) and we wondered where in the nine hells this was going as a group...well we pull a named (venomous) and a pair of SCHW drops...the warrior of the group didnt have any worn haste so he said NBG and the chanter ROLLED ON THE SCHW!!!!! she said that she liked to melee!!!!....shortly thereafter we wiped (who didnt see that one coming) and after a rez by a passing cleric I /q'd and didnt come back.<br />
I just wonder where people like this come from; sure things can be done differently by different people and everyone plays their classes differently, but come one, ignoring whole lines of spells??</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know a level 62 Druid who thought that he could slow in a pinch. Turned out he was referring to his Ro's series of spells. They are  actually decent spells (just have to watch agro), different versions in the line lower different combinations of ATK, AC and FR, but none of them acts as a slow :)<br />
<br />
My favorite &quot;amazing Druid&quot; example is Random_Druid_01 who rolled on an INT augment in LDON because he had &quot;built his Druid on INT&quot;. He was level 58 at the time...</div></div><hr />

same thing happened.. but i was my shm this time.. so it didnt really matter and we kicked him out after a maybe 20 minutes<br />
and last time i checked this shm was in one of the top 5 guilds on the server  :rolleyes: i seriously hope its one of their main's buffbots<br />
<br />
another one.. this is too funny to leave out, but i love the guy so its not me insulting him :)<br />
<br />
old necro friend who had quit, i guess decided to come back.. i see him soloing fiends in pov.. send him a tell, took awhile for him to remember me, but after that we duo'd for a bit.. maybe 2 or 3 hours after we had started.. he says this in group:<br />
<br />

I was waiting at the ZL of PoFire for some friends, a shaman from one of our servers time-flagged guilds zones in...and asks &quot;hey, do you have any extra batwings I could snag?&quot; Upon futher questioning, he was blissfully unaware of the componentless version....</div></div><hr />
