<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Getting closer to lvl 29 and was looking at the new spells I get.<br />
<br />
Looks like The tactics for a soloing shaman has to change at this level. Still has the same damage output as lvl 24 and have to keep that until lvl 34.<br />
<br />
How reliable is the charm spell? Does the &quot;pet&quot; steal xp? Would a viable tactics be to charm on mob sic it on its neighbour (same type mob) and then when one goes down, kill the one still standing? Would I get xp for on two or 1/2 a mob?<br />
<br />
Or do I change into a tank by applying my &quot;hast&quot; and my new slow. This doesn't seem right as the DSP is WAY to low.<br />
<br />
Or does my buffs/debuffs compensate my tanking abilities enough to compensate for the by now less usefull DoTs?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>extra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it's a possible source of xp, not a very good one though...not sure what the max level you can charm with the 29 spell is....<br />
<br />
the tactic to use is pull one, root him, charm him, then pull another, root it on top and tell charmed pet to attack it.  KEEP INVIS MEMMED.  You want your charmed pet to be almost dead when the other one dies, so use a low level slow.  When it's dead, your pet should be almost dead.  Invis yourself, which makes charm break, then kill your pet...<br />
<br />
I didn't find the charm at 34 to be very reliable though, and i think it's prolly just better to hunt like normal.  Why not go do needlites in echo caverns at 29?  Might be some light blues but they are great for raising defense.  Brute cave in Warsliks wood is filled with easy blues as well.  Or bring a group to dalnir.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Charm is not very reliable at all, I use to charm Grimalkins in LOIO at 29, it would be resisted or fade after 12 seconds. I found it to be useful if I got an add, I would charm one tigger and sic him on the other, most of the time I would end up with 2 angry kitties on me. When I was successful with it, I would charm one kitty and assist him tanking. I would root both the mob and the charmed pet, when charm broke I would back off and recharm and re-root. When mob died I would wait until my charm broke. When it broke I would then kill it....twice the exp, but not very mana efficient exp though, also not very reliable. <br />
Pet does not steal exp anymore unless you do zero damage to the mob. If I'm not mistaken. I found charm animal to be a waste, I've used it maybe 3 times after I got it. I haven't used it since. <br />
<br />
<br />
If mad exp is what you're craving, go to the Golra Iceberg in Timorous Deep. There is a 20% exp modifier in that zone and the Iceberg is basically abandoned. No roamers, so adds will not be a problem. Just pull with Slow, DoT, and beat em down. I went from 29-34 there in a very short time and I'm an Iksar. <br />
29 is the first level you get a &quot;valuable&quot; slow spell...tagar's insects. It is quite an upgrade to Walking Sleep, use it !!Always Slow your enemy, makes them much easier to deal with. For solo exp, what I did was....Haste myself, cast Slow, DoT, and melee. I rarely ran into trouble that way. If I did get in trouble I would root, back off and heal myself. Very easy exp until you get a pet, and life get even easier from there. Pet is a unlimited DoT as long as he is alive. Debuffs at 29 and below, weren't very useful for me. I never used them, unless I had trouble slowing a mob. <br />
For me charm was a waste, after I went to the Golra iceberg, I didn't need charm anymore, because I hit 34 and got Cujo, who is loyal to the death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Think I will skip the charm spell :)<br />
<br />
Was just looking at the lvl 29 spells, and couldn't find anything but the &quot;pet&quot; to let me keep up with the HP and damage output of the mobs. Looks like the haste/slow combo is the added damage/damage protection that I should use.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the clarifications.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The only use I ever got out of charm was the ability to reliably kill Centaur Chargers solo at lvl 30 for the Totemic quests. I'd charm a regular elephant and sic it on a Charger. The elephant would last just long enough for me to land every DOT I had and a slow before he came after me. I would have enough mana to self heal twice and add a few nukes in to the mix and would end the fight with prety well no mana and almost no health, but once I got the system down I killed a bunch of them without dying. Without the charm there's no other way I could take them down at 30 untwinked (man those guys hit HARD. :) ) BTW charm worked incredibly well on the elephants, never once broke and sometimes it would take a few minutes to get the two together. On the flip side I tried to use the 34 charm on the gators in the old Casic Thule and never once got it to stick for more than 1 or 2 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You should try it out just because it's fun for a little while and, who knows, maybe you'll find a good tactic with it. Like Tuga, I charmed Elephants in South Karana with it: they're pretty tough yet are below the level limit for the spell. I guess since I'd never played a pet class before it was great looking over my shoulder and seeing this huge elephant running around behind me. The problem, of course, is when it wears off and you're trying to channel charm through a ton of hits (from two MOBs). But while charm lasts, MOBs go down easy (I barely had to even cast spells - I just stood there tanking).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Niall Graycloak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I may be the exception, but I got great mileage out of befriend animal at 29th-34th levels. (Heck I even used it a bit after 34th as the 34th doggy is a wuss)<br />
<br />
My tactic was simple - I'd keep my charisma buffed (I'm a barb and was silly enough to put points into it, so it started at 74). Pull the first sabretooth grimalkin with charm (if it bounced then just kill it like a regular root/rot kill). Preferably have a target handy before you charm the first one - send the new pet in at the target, hang back - slow the target and keep it rooted.<br />
<br />
It worked rather well, if the charmed one broke free I'd just make a snap decision wether to recharm it or kill it depending on its health.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The 34 pet might be a wussy but he'll never turn on you !! And well buffed the 34 pet can be quite formidable, as long as you tank for him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Had to do a bit of research on this one before posting. In the way of slows at 29 you are better off sticking to good ol' Walking Sleep. Walking Sleep slows from 23-35% (it does lvl/4 + 20%); Tagars slows from 35-50% (lvl/2 + 20%). At 29 you only slow for 34.5% with Tagars,  27.25% for Walking Sleep for a gain of +7.25% for twice the mana.  Not meaning to step on yer toes Stormrazor, but the mana saved at 29 is huge, especialy with even a single resist for us low wis Shaman out there. :)<br />
<br />
edit, found more accurate numbers on the slows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i charm them dogs in GD while waiting on the spires .. fun to play with</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Anything charmed works like a pet until charm drops.  The pet exp thing has been an on and off thing for Verant for quite some time.  Currently, the pet won't cost you exp unless yer not grouped and he does more than 50% of the damage (please update me if this isn't true anymore).  There have been times in the past where the pet cost you EXP every time unless you were grouped.  And way back when I got my first puppy, he always cost you EXP even if you were in a full gorup!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dia Shan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I used to charm mammoths in everfrost, they would beat each other down, and I would have a fairly close to dead mammoth to finish off.<br />
<br />
cant remember what lvl I did this at though, it was a long while ago</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The current situation is that pets dont take ANY xp as long as a player in the group (or you if you are not grouped) does a SINGLE point of damage to the mob.<br />
<br />
If no player does any damage to the mob, the pet gets 75% of the xp.</div></div><hr />
