<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry if this is in wrong section. I just got done camping the undead crusader for all the darn skulls. Was reading ahead in the quest and i see there is a part using alchemy said around 60 for trivial for it. Is it possible to get there with just points? I am lvl 53 and had no desire to work on alchemy but need it for this quest. Would this be a way to go or is it better/cheaper to do it normally? Btw not asking how to raise it the regular way Ive read up on that just not sure how much practice points help. thanks <br />

~ edited to reflect 21 points max ~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Muktuk Wolfsbreath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've been told that if you delay putting a training point into a skill, your first point gets you a skill equal to your level. So, if you put one point in now, you'd have a skill of 53.<br />
<br />
Supposedly, we shaman who put in a point at 25 or so don't notice this effect, because the skill is level-capped to 5 at that level.<br />
<br />
I haven't tested this myself, but it's worth a point expenditure to check.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No, I didn't put any points into Alchemy until around Level 40, and it still would only accept 21 training points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Tradeskills work differently from other skills.  No matter when you put training points into them, they start at 1 (assuming you didn't get any skill ups beforehand by doing combines), and you can only train up the skill to 21.  If, for example, you get to 6 in a particular tradeskill by doing combines before putting any training points into it (tailoring spiderling silk into threads or some such), you will only be able to put 15 training points into it at your trainer.  If you skill up to 21 before putting any points into the skill, you won't be able to put any training points into it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I didn't put a point into alchemy until I was 32.  It just gave me one point.  I put in 20 more and that was that and I started making sow potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hail All,<br />
<br />
I was not going to put any points into Alchemy until I hit 34, then I was going to use 20 Skill points, however if it starts at Level 25 = Skill Level 5 max.<br />
<br />
So I figured at level 25 to 34 = 9 levels x 5 = 45 Skill Level max.  So I'm trying to figure out if the math  and if it will work out well for me to invest 20 points at 34?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for all the info all =) . Not a newbie to the game but i am to tradeskills and i learned something new today. I didnt know about the 21 points and only the first 21. Guess i had better remember to go put some points in first.</div></div><hr />
