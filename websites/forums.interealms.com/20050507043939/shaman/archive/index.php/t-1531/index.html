<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sthaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, well I didn't read EVERY post about stacking and whatnot since the last patch, but I thought I'd mention something I hadn't seen from what I did read.<br />
<br />
Carnage, the effect on the 8th cudgel (+40 str dex agi and attack), no longer stacks with HoS and never did stack with Focus.  However, Avatar (the spell upon which Carnage is based) stacks with both HoS and Focus now.  <br />
<br />
Thanks VI, the effect Carnage is now entirely useless I think.</div></div><hr />

                    We’ll be using this patch to catch a few oddball crash bugs and other pesky issues that<br />
                    came up after the patch.<br />
<br />
                    Thanks a lot for your patience.<br />

I don't know if there is more bad to come but was just looking for a place to post this without making a new thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sthaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Didn't fix it.  <br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
At least the stats make it a fantastic range item, effect or no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They really really need to fix this stacking issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kuai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yeah stacking is more important than rangers hitting ANYWHERE IN THE ZONE with 0 delay bows</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">More of the same?<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;<br />
                    On Friday, May 10th, at 3AM PDT, (11AM GMT), all servers will be brought down for a<br />
                    brief update. The estimated downtime is 3 hours.<br />

                    Will this patch be addressing broken bards?<br />

                    Yes, we’ll be fixing the bard instrument bug.<br />
<br />
                    Again, we’re sorry for the downtime. <br />
