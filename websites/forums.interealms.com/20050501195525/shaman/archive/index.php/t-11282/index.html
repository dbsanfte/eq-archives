<br />
*** The Legacy of Ykesha is now live! ***<br />
<br />
As the afternoon heat grows, a trickle of adventurous folk can be seen moving through the rocky vales of the mountains called Stonebrunt.  These quiet lands, normally inhabited by panda bears and kobolds, are slowly becoming a throughway for heroes, mercenaries and adventures of all races.  Are you one of them?<br />
<br />
And in Gukta tadpoles are growing into young Frogloks.  There is no doubt in the minds of the conquerors of Grobb that the new generation of their people will grow into strong and steadfast servants of Mithaniel Marr, worthy of his respect.  Will you be one of them?<br />
<br />
OOC:  Have fun with the new features, the new race and the new zones.  Thank you for playing EverQuest.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
** Gameplay **<br />
<br />
We've adjusted the entry requirements for some Planes of Power zones.  Several of these zones required each character to complete a quest before gaining entry.  We've relaxed this requirement somewhat as follows:<br />
<br />
* A raid with 32 or more members can enter a locked plane provided that 85% of the raiders have finished the entry quest.  This means a raid group can bring along some friends who haven't completed the quest.<br />
<br />
* Characters who haven't done the entry quest must stay with their raid while they are in the locked zone.  If these characters leave the raid for more than three minutes, they will be transported out to the Plane of Tranquility.<br />
<br />
* Using this method does not grant permanent access to the locked zone.  If a character wants permanent, unescorted access to a locked zone then they must still complete the quest.  The goal of this change is to allow raiding groups to bring along a few friends who haven't been able to complete the quests, but still wish to help with the raid.<br />
<br />
- Several of the flagging events will now only give out a maximum of 72 flags each time they are completed.<br />
- The dialogue boxes for resurrection and translocation will remain for 5 minutes instead of 1 hour.<br />
- Increased the maximum number of members on ignore and friends lists to 100.<br />
- Made some adjustments to the Halls of Honor alternate entry quest that should make it more friendly.<br />
- The horse buff icon will no longer show up for characters using non-Luclin models.<br />
<br />
<br />
** Interface **<br />
<br />
<br />
- Containers now close after zoning.  This prevents a bug that was causing the same container to be opened twice.<br />
- The rogue hide message &quot;You have moved and are no longer hidden!&quot; is filtered as a &quot;skill&quot; message and not an &quot;other&quot; message.<br />
- Fixed a bug that was causing the spell effects opacity slider to always return to 0% when logging out to the desktop.<br />
<br />
<br />
** Items **<br />
<br />
- Happy Dragon should no longer use a charge when the target is out of range.<br />
- The inventory icons for Trydan's Greaves of Nobility, Deathwatch Sword and Wetfang Steak have been corrected.<br />
- Corrected the name of the Drakescale Covered Tunic (was Drakscale Covered Tunic).<br />
- The Manicle of Disruption has been renamed Manacle of Disruption.<br />
- See above for Vorshar's Manicle of the Blight.<br />
- Corrected the spelling of Golden Idol of Rodcef Nife.<br />
- The Rantho Rapier is now a piercing weapon, not a two-hand slashing weapon.<br />
- The Wand of Mana Tapping is no longer labeled as usable in the secondary hand (since it is Enchanter only and could not be used there anyhow).<br />
<br />
<br />
** Quests **<br />
<br />
- Made a change to the way Planes of Power spell quests work. All spells usable by more than one class are now obtained from the same level quest.  If a spell is level 61 (Ethereal) for one class and level 65 (Rune Word) for another, both will have it as a reward on their Ethereal quest.<br />
- Corrected issues with the quest from the Iksar Hermit.<br />
- Corrected a grammatical error in some of Bolli Hillfoot's text.<br />
- Marshal Anrey should be more responsive when talked to.<br />
- The &quot;Bag of Troll guts&quot; is now dropping off of the correct NPC.<br />
<br />
<br />
** Zones and NPCs**<br />
<br />
- Removed the ability for PCs to bind in the upper tier Planes of Power zones.  Binding is allowed in Plane of Knowledge and Plane of Tranquility.<br />
- The entrance to the Plane of Fire now requires the appropriate keys for entry.<br />
- Gods in the elemental planes now have fixed respawn regardless of zone outages.  If the god in an elemental plane is up when the zone comes down it will still be up when the zone comes back up.  If it has two days left before its respawn when the zone comes down it will still respawn in two days.<br />
- Prior to this patch Rallos Zek was changed, he no longer allows anyone he dislikes to stand above the arena.<br />
- Removed a &quot;safe spot&quot; from the Plane of Disease.<br />
- NPCs in the Plane of Justice can no longer be affected by Fear spells.<br />
- Fixed an issue with some level 10 NPCs in the Karanas having about 400 times the hit points that they should.<br />
- Denizens of Aerin`Dar's lair will no longer be getting angry at folks just because they are stomping around on the ground above the lair.<br />
- Puslings now understand how to &quot;enrage&quot; properly.<br />
- Creatures in Fungus Grove will be less likely to ignore people shooting them from a distance.<br />
- Mature Arboreans are now plants.  Just don't call them that to their faces.<br />
- Giant Whiskered Bats in the Qeynos area no longer drop rat skulls.<br />
- Dalin Greskar has given up his hobby of trying to sell blacksmithing gear that he doesn't have and has gone legit with pottery supplies.<br />
- Corrected a typographical error in some of Tarnic McWillows speech.<br />
- Firon Dernkal will no longer add a random &quot;t&quot; to the end of people's names when talking to them.<br />
- Corrected an error in Eirod Haerod's text.<br />
- It seems as though the troll sent to retrieve the Forge from fallen Grobb has returned with Forge in hand.<br />
- Corrected an issue with the respawn of Fennin Ro.<br />
- A Kromzek spy will no longer give a &quot;beta neutral&quot; faction hit when killed.<br />
<br />
<br />
** Spells **<br />
<br />
- Fixed a bug that prevented the owners of charmed warders from controlling or re-summoning their warders after the charm breaks.<br />
- Disinfecting Aura has been changed to no longer cure poisonous effects.  It will now cure disease effects with much more potency.<br />
- Fixed a bug that was causing Bind Sight to fail to land if the recipient had exactly 15 other buffs.<br />
- Convergence should not eat its component as often on some types of spell failures.<br />
- Corrected the spell book icons for several Enchanter spells.<br />
- Shadeweaver port should no longer place you beneath the world.<br />
- In a previous update, we added a message when a person recasts a charm spell on their charmed pet.  Recasting charm on an existing pet did not actually re-charm the pet, it just failed silently and appeared to succeed.  The new message is now displayed intentionally in these cases.  This is not a bug.<br />
<br />
<br />
** Miscellaneous **<br />
<br />
- Attack text for the Vah Shir when punching now says, &quot;punches&quot; instead of &quot;hits&quot;<br />
- Fixed a bug that was causing the reduced statistics to not update properly when the character has low hit points or is encumbered.<br />
- Fixed a bug that caused some sale prices for items in the Bazaar (mostly those with a lot of 9s) to be invalid. <br />
- The /guildmotd command has been modified.  Guild leaders and officers can now use this command to set or clear the guild Message of the Day.  There is a new command, /getguildmotd, that can be used as an alternative to viewing the Guild MOTD in the Guild Management Window.<br />

The zerg-forces will whine about taking 150 people to an encounter and getting only half of them flagged. <br />

I am no different, I also have a whine: Class balance issues, encounter issues, entire zone bugged out the yang....and they fixed them named turds in the Karanas that has 10khp that nobody cared about?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think limiting the flagging to 72 is total bs.<br />
<br />
It's too kludgy, too big-brother and it doesn't encourage guild cooperation at all.  Gee, that's a step in the right direction.  Screw them, if people want to zerg in big public raids, that's cool.  Lord knows it's not easy.  <br />
<br />
Glad to see they &quot;tuned&quot; the HoH alternate quest, because that one was ridiculous.  I merely wasted 30 hours on it before getting flagged on an Aerin'Dar raid.  And it's bs that alternate quests aren't alternate quests at all in that you can't advance beyond the zone they get you into.  Doing the alternate quests is a hell of a lot harder.  <br />
<br />
Speaking of kludges, bummer for the fear-kiters in PoJ.  Why not fix the pathing?  I guess that's harder.  <br />
<br />
And if Abolish Disease worked on Grummus' dot anyway, what does the new DI offer extra?  I guess it's slightly faster.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>TalgurenXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Disinfecting Aura is made into a massive disease cure (curing 48 counters) now so that Pure Blood (slightly worse poison/disease cure than Dis. Aura used to be) can look like a new spell for shamans.  Did they forget about Abolish Disease?  It's cheaper to cast than Dis. Aura.  It casts just as fast.  It has always had enough cure power (removes 36 disease counters) to cure any disease I've seen so far.  Abolish Disease is also an effect on our velious pants.  We also  get Abolish Disease 3 levels earlier.  This looks screwball to me.</div></div><hr />

We really have expected some kind of nerf on horses for some time.  this is a rather docile nerf actually compared to what it could have been.  as stated above it can be worked around.<br />
<br />
Whenever players find a way to skip their content and get the benefit, a nerf will come.  We should have all learned this by now.<br />
<br />
I foresee alot of people selling their horses and going for the new lizard beast mount (for style points) if they have to have the graphics turned on anyways.  <br />
<br />
I just wish our shaman horses were &quot;spirit&quot; stallions like our dogs.</div></div><hr />

- For the love of (insert God you beleive in or Satan himself) don't make those new spells NO DROP. I beg you! I don't want to shell out 20 bucks just to get 52 FD for my SK.<br />
<br />
If these characters leave the raid for more than three minutes, they will be transported out to the Plane of Tranquility. <br />
So you have 3 minutes to get back from LD before being kicked out of the zone. Looks nice on paper ... get on aggro list of anything that lives for about 2 min, don't have a fiberoptic T3 plugged into your room, don't have the latest Cray 2 supercomputer ... and you'll end up taking more than 3 minutes to log in. And this excludes every single bug that won't allow you to time out. Looks good on paper though and that is what counts!<br />
<br />
- Several of the flagging events will now only give out a maximum of 72 flags each time they are completed. <br />
- Grats to the FoH 31337 cR0wD! Now allied guilds will need TWO RZ kills to get into elemental planes with 150 people instead of ONE RZ kill. What a waste of programmer resources. <br />
<br />
- Made a change to the way Planes of Power spell quests work. All spells usable by more than one class are now obtained from the same level quest. If a spell is level 61 (Ethereal) for one class and level 65 (Rune Word) for another, both will have it as a reward on their Ethereal quest. <br />
- They forgot to add this: On a more positive note, shamans are still doomed of getting a crapload of 110.54% useless spells 50% of the time they turn in a spectral parchment. <br />
<br />
Fixed an issue with some level 10 NPCs in the Karanas having about 400 times the hit points that they should. <br />
- Extremely important issue. Glad it's fixed. It probably affected 0.000000000000000001% of the entire EQ population. Fweh, I can sleep easy tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>ludgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">so 15% of people on a raid can be not flagged.<br />

<br />
There was a great loss recently in the entertainment world. Larry LaPrise, the Detroit native who wrote the song &quot;Hokey Kokey&quot; died last week aged 83. The most traumatic part for the family was getting him in the  coffin.Apparently they put his left leg in . . . . . . and things just started to go downhill from there.<br />

Did they ever specifically say that horses would not work without luclin graphics enabled when the expansion went live?<br />
<br />
What about all the people that flat out can't run luclin graphics on because of lag issues?<br />
<br />
Does the horse vendor say &quot;I have a nice nag here, but you must have graphics turned on to use it.&quot;<br />
<br />
This doesn't seem fair at all. Since many horses were purchased for their standing med explicitly. Many classes do this just so they don't draw aggro. Just because you have a slow computer shouldn't exclude these people.</div></div><hr />

They upped the counters to DA&lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
Yes, and it no longer cures any poison counters. Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't Abolish Disease cure just about every disease easily already? Is there any use for a spell that cures 12 more disease counters and uses more mana? Plus I'd still just use Velious legs to cure diseases in most cases, unless it's something that needs to be cured fast. So they gimped one spell to uselessness, then gave us a newer weaker version of it in LoY.<br />

You do not need a 1ghz box to run new models, you do not need a radeon 9700 to run new models, you do not need 512M memory to run the 2 models necessary to use a horse the way it was intended.  For the fella lagging out in pov with a radeon9700, quit blowing smoke.  I can go there with a 1Ghz athlon t-bird, 512M ram, and a GF2mx for gods sake, with all models on and still play.  My box2 shaman can go there on a P3 750 with a PCI GF2MX and 512M ram and all models on and not lag bad enough that playing is not possible.  You want less lag, turn off the eye candy.  Spell effects, high textures, that stuff isn't necessary.  Actually shamans have less reason to bitch than most other horse using classes.  We can shrink and get rid of the horse head at will, the other classes have to use a potion or tinkered device.  And for those that hate the way they look in new models....do you think everyone else sees you in old models just because you have yours turned off?  So maybe you see 1 race in a new model, if you want standing med that's the price you pay.  One thing I am unhappy about is my ikkie shammy is riding a horse and now lizards are available.  Would be nice if they allowed you to trade in your horse for a lizard as selling the horse and buying a lizard will probably net a loss of at least 2K for the cheapest =o\</div></div><hr />

The Wimpy God M&amp;M can just kiss some Troll steel/magic.  Until DE’s and Trolls join up and take over Freeport … this is going to be a burr under my saddle with what appears to be SOE’s laziness with adding additional zones including a new starting city AND that it will be overlooked by the majority of the player base.  LoY appears to be success for the new masters of EQ (AKA Sony Developers) by being a cheap code release coupled with very cheaper marketing costs with this “pay as you go” download feature.  People are just acting like sheep here because it was the Troll’s that were hit by it … if it had been any other starting city … across the board people would have been out for blood.  As it is, … this is just sloppy “near creative” writing trying to cover up a lack of developer budget and management commitment coupled with brain trust loss to SWG/EQ2.<br />
<br />
Couple of bitches:<br />
<br />
 - Gods in the elemental planes now have fixed respawn regardless of zone outages. If the god in an elemental plane is up when the zone comes down it will still be up when the zone comes back up. If it has two days left before its respawn when the zone comes down it will still respawn in two days. <br />
<br />
Why do this now?  Given all the bitching and screaming from ever other expansion for top mobs … why react now?  What is different with PoP that is not different with Emp, Seru, or even Naggy/Vox?  Moreover, if they are going to do this in PoP why not implement this across the board as a universal fix?  This just seems to be a knee jerk reaction instead of a well thought out solution.<br />
<br />
 It seems as though the troll sent to retrieve the Forge from fallen Grobb has returned with Forge in hand. <br />
<br />
What was so HARD that this took weeks to get fixed?  Was this just another jab at Trolls or more sloppy oversight on the whole “kick the Trolls” out of Grobb story line?<br />
<br />
 Disinfecting Aura has been changed to no longer cure poisonous effects. It will now cure disease effects with much more potency. <br />

<br />
You do not need new textures to run the new models.  Textures are just the bitmap that covers a model.  You can have textures set to low with new models and use little extra resources.  Slow load times are directly related to your hard drive.  Based on your hardware I am guessing you have at max a 20 gig hard drive unless you upgraded it, and it probably spins at 5400rpm.  Things that help load times are keeping your hard drive defragged, and installing EQ in it's own partition.  Also unless you use winxp win 98 will still load info into your swap file even if you have free conventional memory.  This also can be sped up my making a separate 400meg partition and setting it as your swap file.  But the biggest difference is using a fast hard drive.  Blazing fast would be to use 2 7200 rpm drives and a RAID card, but more reasonable would be to just get 1 7200rpm drive and an ata133 controller.  Basically eq is an evolving game and your pc will have to evlove with it.  I can not expect to play quake3 with the same pc I played quake with.  And you cannot expect to play modern eq with the same machine you started with 3 years ago.</div></div><hr />

When Luclin first came out, I thought the new models were awful.  However, I put the new models on anyway, just because I'd paid for them.  <br />
<br />
After a couple of weeks, I switched back to the old models, as I was going on a Hate raid, and could not believe that I'd ever liked the old models.  I think that they just take some getting used to.  The one complaint I do have is that they took away the cool Iksar sitting and swimming models.  <br />
<br />
As for the new spells, the big problem I have with them is that they took a useful spell, Disinfecting Aura, changed it so that it is fairly useless, then added the same spell, under a different name, and are forcing us to quest for it.  I can only hope the quests for those new spells aren't too bad, but judging from the Canni II quest, I'm not that hopeful.</div></div><hr />

I'm thinking yes, because I still stick to my guns saying that I highly doubt that many of you play on a computer (other than the guy that plays on his laptop when he travels) that is incapable of running 2 models.  I am not bashing shamans, I love my shaman, and even though I didn't own any of the affliction focus items I think you all took it in the rear with the change to foci effects.

Couple things I'd like to see.  Somewhere in the options you can turn off levitation effects.  You can still levitate, you just don't bounce up and down all the time...  The same should be on the horse.  Starting and stopping slow is one thing, bouncing around everywhere is another.  I don't see myself out accelerating a horse at any speed though.<br />
The other thing is spell interupts.  Click off horse, duck, click on horse.  How about stop chanting the spell, or waving your hands.  /spell off.  They fixed the backend nerf, without adding anything new the current horse models.<br />
Also they should make items in inventory useable.  You can put casting spells, discs in there.  How hard would it be to have a /useitem implented.  At least that way we could script interuppting horses.  Well, we'd still have to click off the icon, and lose three seconds to recast.</div></div><hr />

Also, the fact that they are trying to be realistic magnifies every one of the many imperfections that they have.  Not to mention the fact that the animations are complete ass.<br />
<br />
Have I mentioned that the animations are complete ass?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">The facts are:<br />
Some people don't like the look of new models.<br />
Some people can't run new models.<br />
EVERYONE slows down when running new models, there is no way around it, more polygons equal less frame rate.<br />
Horses were NEVER required to run the new models.<br />
Luclin NEVER required new models.<br />
The horse vendor does not offer a full refund for something that has been status-quo for 1 year.<br />
No patches, messages, forums every said that new models were required for buying a horse.<br />
<br />
The fix:<br />
Offer a full refund on any horse purchased, OR<br />
make horses useable in old models (with the negatives if need be)<br />
<br />
It's as simple as that. And until one or the other is done, I am going to feedback it daily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">I knew the horse thing would happen, which is why when I got my horsey I used new models on purpose to get used to it.  At first it was annoying, but the benefit far outweighs the inconvenience, and having a horse isn't a hassle anymore-- it becomes second nature to click off the horse in emergencies, and click on the horse bridle when I need it.  Anytime I use my horse I usually shrink myself twice and that's the end of the hassle really.<br />
<br />
The ogre male models are actually good-- better than the old ones in my opinion.  I hate the female ogre new model, but seriously, how many people play female ogres?  The trolls look butt ugly-- one of the reasons why I decided on an ogre in the first place (my main reason was because of overall stats) =P<br />
<br />
With my slow computer, it ran fine just having ogre and horse/elemental models on.  Now with my new computer I have everything on and all the new models look perty and stuff.<br />
<br />
Seriously, stop thinking this is a huge nerf-- if you take it with stride, you will find yourself adjusting pretty easily after time.  It is less convenient than before but you will find you feel a lot more &quot;legitimate&quot; for not taking advantage of a bug.<br />
<br />
Don't sell back your horse; that's just plain silly.  The advantage way way way outweighs the inconvenience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Ok, so I turned on only the Male Ogre+Horse models.  I'm seeing about a 25-40% slowdown in zone load.  I guess I can handle that, I was loading faster than most before anyway.<br />
<br />
The slow startup and slower-than-SoW run I can deal with.  If I need to run fast, I can click off, and in fact did so a couple times.<br />
<br />
The no-duck thing is irritating, but I did a couple times manage to quickly enough, click-off horse, duck, then put it back on a bit later.  I should hotkey /dismount and will probably get used to that.<br />
<br />
Horsehead?  Shrink, shrink.  Fine, done.<br />
<br />
The wobbling back and forth is annoying.  But, whatever.  I'll get used to it.<br />
<br />
But the #1 problem by far is I LOOK LIKE TOR JOHNSON.  I picked the Ogre face I did because he's just so darn lovably goofy-lookin' and none of the new Ogre faces are like that.  Sigh.  Oh yeah, and just in general I noticed a marginal performance hit just tooling around.<br />
<br />
All in favor of &quot;old&quot; model horses or invisible things with the same effects.  I can take that.  I don't want to look like Tor though.  =1<br />
<br />
Also, they REALLY need a limited-time 100% horse buyback offer.  After thinking about it, I don't think I'd do it, but the offer would be a move in the right direction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">What they should do is add a low polygon version of the horse and lizard mounts, just like they did with the vah shir.  That would solve any problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Numzan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">This whole add-on is bull****, plain and simple. Sure those frogs look neat, but come on Give only special UI features to those whom pay for it? BS something that should be free to all. What did they gain for including it in the addon? nothing.<br />
<br />
SOE didnt release this addon for anything but a special promotion to encourage newcomers to the game. It will be in there next gold edition, instead of buying 5 pack you will get a 6pack all for the price of $99.00 cdn.<br />
<br />
They didnt put it in the stores across the country, instead they gave a few copies out and allowed everyone to buy it online. They shut me and a few others up by throwing about 3000 copies on the market and sell the rest online. Then 1 month down the road introduce a gold 6-pack.<br />
<br />
And to think, i wish i knew this was coming 4 years ago :(<br />
<br />
Numzan <br />
&quot;dont know if i am pissed off at SOE or discouraged with there greed&quot;</div></div><hr />
