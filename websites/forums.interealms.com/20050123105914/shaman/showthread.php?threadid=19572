	<p>Found this <a href="http://www.warcraftcentral.com/resources/articleview.php?dbase=res_articles&amp;select=19" target="_blank">article</a> and wanted to share it as I liked it alot. A very long read but its worth it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I’m going to start this article out talking about class depth because it’s an important point which I don’t think I can devote an entire article to. However, it ties into something of the most vital importance to what makes a good MMORPG. Bear with me and you’ll see where I’m going with this.<br />
<br />
When I played EQ, I had two characters. My main was a Bard, my alt an Enchanter. These two are generally considered the two hardest classes in the game to play, and for good reason. They have a variety of important tasks in a group or a raid, chief among them being crowd control, something which requires you to be on your toes at all time, and for which mistakes can be very lethal. I enjoyed it though, and loved the two classes. They may have been difficult to play, but they were two classes who rewarded the player’s skill with power. Bards for example, are considered jacks of all trades. They can fight decently, wear heavy armor, heal, do magic damage, crowd control, etc. However, for most skills that a Bard possesses, another class can do better. Warriors can fight better, Wizards can nuke better, Clerics can heal better, and Enchanters have better crowd control. So if just played on those abilities alone, the Bard is a pretty worthless class. But, when played with some real skill, the Bard is probably the most powerful class in the game.<br />
<br />
Not every class in EQ required the amount of skill a Bard does, but they all do take a certain amount of competency and strategic know how from the player. At higher levels, if you don’t know what you are doing, it will show. I’ve seen instances on many occasions where somebody will buy an account off of e-bay, and try to play the higher level characters, only to fail miserably. These ‘E-bayers’ are really proof of how hard EQ is, as it is not a game you can just pick up at any point and succeed. Like them or not, the players in the highest end guilds like Fires of Heaven or Afterlife are all very smart (yeah, it hurts to call Furor smart) and know their ****. You do not do content like they do without having a keen grasp of not only the game play mechanics involved in Everquest, but also some strategic know-how, and to a certain extent, the math behind the game. Each time something like a God or Dragon is taken down, a lot of thought has gone into it. I have lead raids before, and can say from my own experience this is true.<br />
<br />
DAoC on the other hand is a much different ball game. Each class has a very specific role from which is cannot operate outside. By level 20 or so, each class will possess lower level versions of every ability they will ever have, and mastery of the class is almost a moot point. An idiot can play any class in DAoC well; I’ve seen this first hand more times than I care to remember. Raids in DAoC are a pure zerg affair, due partially to the absolutely horrific job Mythic did designing raid encounters, and also do to the fact that classes don’t mesh together to create an efficient killing machine as they did in Everquest. It’s truly sad watching magic users going at it in melee against boss mobs right alongside tanks. There is no thought, no strategy, and no art to it at all. The success of a raid is totally dependant on how many people you can get together to swarm the target.<br />
<br />
So, let’s compare two classes from each game. How about two hybrids, the Shadowknight from EQ and the Thane from DAoC. The Shadowknight borrows a number of skills from it’s Necromancer side, meaning that they can fear kite like a Necromancer can (using magic to slow a creature’s running speed, then causing it to flee, then finally using a number of damage over time (DoT) spells and their skeleton pet to kill it), but using themselves in the place of the DoTs. They have a pet who can take some hits while the Shadowknight can use any number of nasty spells to do things from lifetapping (a series of spells that damages an opponent and heals the caster), throwing fear back up, or buffing / debuffing. In raids, they can influence how a creature generates agro (the factor which decided who the creature attacks), and add a considerable amount of damage to the mix. This is just the tip of the iceberg, as they have quite a large number of other spells and strategies open to them.<br />
<br />
The Thane on the other hand has a couple of buffs which they can throw on before combat to boost their strength and damage output, a Direct Damage (DD) and Area of Effect (AoE) damage spell. And an insta-cast DD and Point Blank AoE (PBAoE). They can fight pretty well too. That’s it. They are warriors with some ranged spells and buffs, most of which become useless when engaged in melee. Take 5 minutes to see what each spell does, and you have mastered the class. Is it any wonder that raids are such simple affairs in DAoC?<br />
<br />
This brings us to a rather simple conclusion, EQ is harder than DAoC. Indeed, this is true. Take an upper end guild from DAoC and have them try and do a harder raid like the Avatar of War, Seru, or the Emperor, and chances are they would get torn apart. They would lack the skills needed to kill one of these nasties. Interestingly enough, the converse isn’t true. Conquest, one of the ‘Uberguilds’ from EQ went to DAoC and totally dominated in the PvP there. As Conquest hails from the same server I played on, I have interacted with their members on several occasions, and can say that they are all a really bright bunch of people. In DAoC, the majority of players I met made me remember the idiots who I played Diablo II with back in the day.<br />
<br />
If you remember Diablo II, you’ll remember such templates such as the WW-Barbarian, the Strafazon, and the Frozen Orb/SF Sorc. These classes relied on spamming one or two skill to slaughter hordes of monsters with no thought or effort at all. It is the total opposite of the way EQ works, the easier the class was in DII, the more you were rewarded. The most powerful class templates were mind numbingly simple, while the ones that took skill to play couldn’t fight their way out of a wet paper sack. And with this simplicity, do you remember the type of players who played DII? The idiot 12-14 year old griefers who thought they were the **** because they had a Windforce and could take you out with one shot from 2 screens away, then sit on your corpse and kill you time and time again?<br />
<br />
Griefers existed in Everquest too, but not only were they much rarer, they were hunted down themselves. As a courtesy to their victims, other players often made life hard for griefers, ranging from refusing to help them to out right killing them. By and large, the EQ community was a good bunch, and was more than willing to give you a hand if you needed it. These people were much more mature, friendly, and dare I say, smart than the people involved in other games. Some of my closest friends in EQ included a UNIX admin, a Math Professor, a Corporate Lawyer, and an Engineer. In DAoC and DII, I can’t think of anybody I grouped with who was even through High School.<br />
<br />
This may be sounding like a bitter rant, but there is a point to all of this, and it’s vitally important to what type of game WoW turns out to be. Harder games attract a more mature audience. The type of people I enjoy playing with aren’t those who have a blast grief killing some hapless newbie 50 times, nor are they ones who want to forgo the entire skill thing just to get lots of nice items. These are people who work with each other to perfect team tactics, who have a blast seeing just how far they can push their class, and in large enjoy the social aspect and the challenge of the game over the end results of their endeavors. They will retire from the game and still talk on the same class/server/guild forums they did when they played just to keep in touch with the friends they left behind. These are the people who make the entire MMORPG experience worth it to me. Without a smart, friendly, and mature base audience, the game will be crap, no matter how much effort the developers put into it.<br />
<br />
That is why Everquest is a great game. Sure, as a game it really sucks, but due to the community that has grown up around it, I can’t say I have had a better experience playing a video game than I have playing EQ (well, besides DDR, but that’s in a different league imo). Quitting Everquest was one of the harder things I have ever done because I left a lot of really good friends behind when I quit. I mean it too; a lot of us were real friends. We have been together for going on 4 years and have gone through a lot together, but overall, have had a hell of a time together. I have thousands of great memories from that game, and few of them involved me alone. THAT is why EQ is good, and anybody who knocks Everquest has no clue what they are talking about. I’m the first one to say the game sucks, but as an experience, Everquest was more than I could have ever expected from a simple game. And you know what, if given the chance, I’d go back and do it all over again. I’ll bet the majority of ppl who bitch about how the game is so boring are those who soloed their entire time playing, and never went out of their way to make friends. My fondest memory in EQ was probably one time when I soloed a dragon, a very difficult feat for a Bard. It wasn’t the fact that I killed it that made the even so happy, or that I got some great items off of it, but that most of my friends were there watching me do it and cheering me on (from a safe distance). I don’t remember actually killing it so much as I remember all my friends going totally wild when the thing dropped.<br />
<br />
That is the heart and soul of a MMORPG, and as Blizzard works on WoW, it’s something I desperately hope they remember. Diablo II and DAoC failed here, as they never attracted quality players. If WoW fails here, then they are going to lose the market to Verant when EQ2 comes out, plain and simple. There is no way the kind of people I play with, nor myself, will play a game where there is no community. If WoW cannot foster a community, then no matter how much better the game play is than EQ, it’s still nothing. A MMORPG is its community. There are no ifs, ands, or buts about it, without a strong community, even the best MMORPG will be pure ****. And you know what, that’s they way things are shaping up with all games. All my friends know I’m a Dance Dance Revolution fanatic, and I can’t think of a better example of how the community makes the game great. Every time I step up to try and do a perfect run at something like MAX300 (widely considered the hardest DDR song there is, getting up to 340 beats per minute in parts), I’m not doing it alone, I have a crowd of fellow DDR players behind me rooting for me. That’s what makes a simple video game become something more than an entertaining way to kill a few hours, and become a way of life, like a hobby or a sport. I value the time I have spent playing EQ and DDR just as much as I do the time I have spent getting my Black Belt in Karate or mastering Kendo. Some people might say that I’m some sort of loser because of that, and that I have problems. To that I say f*ck you. Video games have always had a stigma attached to them that they were the domain of the type of losers who shoot their class mates because they are too much of a ***** to deal with things in a normal fashion. To an extent, that’s true, these are the griefers and powergamers who I mentioned earlier, who use video games as their only means of possessing any sort of power.<br />
<br />
Blizzard, these are not the people you want in your games! People like dEmOnKnIgHt, 0wnzj00, Pimpdaddy and 1337DEMONHUNTER aren’t the kind of people who bring anything to a game. People like Stranoth, Sadany, Rorex, Taoleen, Mojo, Catonic, and the many other friends I have shared my EQ experience with are what make a MMORPG into an unforgettable experience, not just some lame hack and slash dungeon crawl. So keep in mind while you polish WoW to the quality that we have always seen from your games, that if you aren’t attracting the right people to the game, it’s all for nothing! EQs difficulty and complexity are what fostered its community. Sites like EQ Atlas catalogued the huge world Verant created, Allakhazam’s Magical Realm collected the most comprehensive list of the tens of thousands of quests and items that there still is to this day, while sites like EQ Diva gave all the Bards in EQ a place to compare tactics, or just to chat. Sites like the Lanys (my server =D) Community Forums gave us a place to reinforce our community spirit and for us to get to know the thousands of people we shared a server with, while sites like /GU Comics poked fun at the world us EQ players were so familiar with and Mobhunter kept us all up to date with what Verant was up to, which classes were whining about being nerfed, etc. DAoC never had even a fraction of that, neither did Diablo II. They never had the resources to do so. People like Tarot, Allakahzam, Woody Hearn, Kocho, Muse, or Moorgard were never drawn to these games, but were drawn to Everquest. I just pray that WoW developers into a mature and sophisticated game like EQ. The people that made EQ a success and people who will follow in their footsteps will need to move on eventually, and I think WoW might be where they go. Make a good game and we’ll do for WoW what we did for EQ.<br />
On a side note, some of you have keenly observed that I swear in my articles. You can take comfort in knowing I'm much worse in actual conversation =D</p>

	<p>Based on the track record of all of Blizzard's previous online multiplayer games, it will most likely be a) Simplified b) Addictive c) For teens<br />
Diablo II + WC3 + EQ = WoW<br />
<br />
No doubt a lot of people from the EQ community will go to WoW, but more than likely you will have more of the PKPK-OWNJOO types from the already established and larger Battle.net camp.  And since their player base is already larger than the EQ player base, do you really think they aren't catering the gameplay more towards those types of players?</p>

	<p>Aye its a valid point.<br />
<br />
Blizzard are mass-market on a scale other PC-game developers can weep at. And to be mass-market their games have to be readily accessible, not take ages and ages to get involved with.<br />
<br />
Hopefully they will manage to make it something easy to get the hang of, but take ages and ages to really master the intricacies. That way there may be some balance. But I think you can be pretty sure that there will be a lot of immature kids* playing too.<br />
<br />
Great original post though, definitely hits a spot there about the community being greater than the game.<br />
<br />
* Nothing against kids in general, many are very bright and intelligent and mature. But I guess we've all met their opposites and boy can they be annoying.</p>

	<p>Blizzard hasn't made a MMORPG yet.  They made Diablo - a hideously successful and quality game of its genre.  They made the warcraft/starcraft series - tremendously successful and quality RTS games.  I have little doubt that they'll do as phenomenal a job in this genre as they've done in the others.  Blizzard programmers PLAY GAMES.  We all know that the people in charge of making decisions for the shaman class in EQ do NOT play the game....  This in itself gives me hope.<br />
<br />
All in all, hearty applause for the article.  I think some of his comments were over the top, but his conclusions were bullseyes.</p>

	<p>Blizzard has a great track record for making immersive games - but also for having the worst security of any online game.  Unless they realy got their act together and plugged the hacking holes they usually left in their software WoW will die of the huge imballances a dubbing economy creates.  Who wants to learn a fight for 4 weeks when you can buy the loot for pennies on ebay from the nearest dubber?</p>

Every Blizzard interview I read, they beat their chests about how they play their own games to tune and balance them. Big deal, all developers do that. It's not that special.<br />
<br />
Contrary to popular belief, Blizzard does NOT have a good track record for producing balanced, bug free games. They make huge balance tweaks in patches, way more than other companies. They also have a long history of producing games that have glaring security holes, and that are easily hackable, as other people have already pointed out.<br />

	<p>As someone who is looking forward to WoW, I am really worried about the security measures they utilize for the game.  Heck, they've already had a leak of the 'alpha' code hit the internet and it took 3 days for a group of programmers to build the existing world based from that alpha.  With that much code already out on the internet, how tough will it be to find that cracks in it?  <br />

	<p>I pretty much threw out the credibility factor of the poster when he said enchanters are hard to play.  I have an enchanter that has been so badly power levelled she can't even rune herself yet the one time I acutally bothered to play her I got compliments on my skill.  <br />
<br />
Enchanters are a heinously overpowered class that seems to attract people that derive their value in life from thinking they are smarter than other people because they hit "enchanter" at the character select screen.</p>

	<p>I have my hopes for WoW.  Frankly,  there are security measures taken in MMORPGs that are not done in games like Diablo II.  For one, there are far more servers, and need for constant support.  You really can't compare it with Battle.net.<br />
<br />
But all that aside, I just have one thing to point out...<br />
<br />
I am sick of everyone always putting a "Griefer" in the 10-12 year age group.  Thats ALL I EVER HEAR.  Hes a griefer?  Must be a middle school child.  Must be a 12 year old.  <br />
<br />
Lets face it.  Most griefers are probably - and i'm not proud of this - in my age group.  College students.  And you know you can't deny that.  If they aren't college students, then they are probably older people with harsh jobs that get burned out IRL.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to pass judgements on WoW any more then I do on SOE for Gates of Discord.  Theres NO possible way to know anything about either of them right now.<br />
<br />
There are some good points, yes, but there are bad ones, and oversights.  It's a good post overall, but it's hardly comprehensive about ANY of the topics he covered.  (Griefers are NOT rare in EQ and they are NOT often hunted down.  Not on blue servers, not on the PVP servers)<br />
<br />
But, I have to go, so I will leave you with this final word.  And I think you'll find, after reading it, that it gets harder and harder to argue with me.  <br />
<br />
Spoon!<br />

Gratz. If you were PL'ed and already had a 55+ class then you already had a headstart and a clue on what an Enchanter's role is in a group.<br />
<br />
Enchanters are not "easy" if you take them to the maz - which is CC + Charm.  Certainly there are more split second decisions to make versus say /assist + /auto-attack.<br />
<br />
Oh - and there are a lot of CRAPPY Enchanters out there. If you got a compliment for mezzing a single add, consider it "damning with faint praise."</p>

	<p>yes plenty of griefers are older too...  I used to have some friends who were heavy PK in UO and they were mostly Adults.<br />
<br />
Blizzard games do appeal to a broad age group.<br />
<br />
But one very important point to keep in mind, with Blizzard specifically DII and WC3 ON LINE - those are FREE services all you need is to have bought the game, no monthly recurring:  so you will get:<br />
a)  younger players because there is no monthly payment.<br />
b)  people who are more reckless and have less concern for the consequences of their actions because they have less at stake in terms of not investing that monthly fee.<br />
<br />
I am very much hoping that WoW isnt like so much of UO was, or the stories I hear about DII, or what I have seen in WC3.  It's hardly the best article but I do VERY much agree with the general sentiment behind it about the importance of community.</p>

	<p>This is what I have been saying for months, since i started playing everquest even. The attractive part of Everquest is the strategy. Period. The people who play it more than two weeks play it for the strategy. The twisting of songs, the art of debuffing, perfectly timed nukes, disciplines, feigns, DoTs, it's all strategy. And that's what makes it so much fun.<br />
<br />
I know zero hardcore players who haven't tapped into the strategy part of Everquest. Even those who refuse to join raiding guilds where the strategy is most self-evident, do hard difficulty LDoN adventures, extremely risky group combinations, and record-breaking solos. <br />
<br />
Its the trend that is everywhere. Warcraft III is breaking the mold the same way Everquest is, but in the opposite direction. Warcraft III is an RTS that introduced RPG elements. Everquest is an RPG that introduced RTS elements. <br />
<br />
I guess to summarize, I hope dearly that World of Warcraft keeps a deep level of strategy, and the proverbial levelling treadmill is done away with.</p>

	<p>This guy thinks EQ requires some major skill? No it doesn't. EQ is hard? No it's not. This guy sounds like an EQ fanboi with illusions of grandeur.<br />
<br />
<b>Not every class in EQ required the amount of skill a Bard does, but they all do take a certain amount of competency and strategic know how from the player.</b><br />
- The only "skill" EQ needs are: Common sense, basic mathematics, patience and time. Nothing really spectacular, other than time and patience, the rest should be mastered by every single human being (Yea I know it's not the case ).<br />
<br />
<b> These ‘E-bayers’ are really proof of how hard EQ is, as it is not a game you can just pick up at any point and succeed. Like them or not, the players in the highest end guilds like Fires of Heaven or Afterlife are all very smart (yeah, it hurts to call Furor smart) and know their ****.</b><br />
- EQ is far from being hard. Infact it's the easiest game I played. Total Annihilation is hard. Master of Orion II is hard. Chess can be hard. EQ is not hard. And also, every major guild has a core of players that have deep knowledge of game mechanics, they know every little detail about their class, and those few people lead the zerg armies into Time. You don't need 72 people to know every little game detail All you need is a select few to know. The rest of the pack has to be able to operate a mouse and keyboard and has to be able to understand basic english.<br />
<br />
<b> Raids in DAoC are a pure zerg affair, due partially to the absolutely horrific job Mythic did designing raid encounters, </b><br />
- Unfortunately you can't design PvP games with PvE content and hope to remotely balance it. Since we programmers, haven't come up with a real AI (the ones you read about in sci-fi books), we have to compensate the lack of thought process of a so called NPC AI with brute force. This results in mobs having gigazillions of HPs, insane AEs, resists and whatnot ... oh they hit a tad bit harder than PCs do. Downside: NPC AI is 110% predictable. Human "AI" is not.<br />
<br />
How did Kasparov get beaten by Deep Blue? Brute force. How did Kasparov beat Deep Blue? By being human. Of course, Mythic, the same time has to make sure people can kill these mobs AND be viable for PvP. It's impossible. You can't balance a level based PvE game with PvP, not until true AI is invented. And if Mythic designs poorly encounters, what the hell is VT or Inner Acrylla (before revamp)?<br />
<br />
<b> The success of a raid is totally dependant on how many people you can get together to swarm the target.</b><br />
- How is that different from EQ? Unless a guild has 9-10 clerics lined up, with a certain number of DPS classes and certain number of support classes, they are going to be sitting in Plane of Tranquility fishing.<br />
<br />
<b>This brings us to a rather simple conclusion, EQ is harder than DAoC. Indeed, this is true.</b><br />
- That's not true. DAoC takes 2 skill sets: PvP AND PvE. EQ takes only one. And classes are not that different, I played a Cabalist on DAoC and it was nothing but a clone of a necro. People think that DAoC is easy simply because the classes are pretty much clones from EQ and most importantly the game (PvE part) is an EQ clone. And of course EQ is nothing more than a DikuMUD clone. And that is nothing more than an D&amp;D clone and so on ...<br />
<br />
Someone who played EQ will have a very easy time in DAoC, hell , that person will have an easy time in every level based game. Because they are all pretty much the same. <br />
<br />
Even games like Earth And Beyond that look like a radically new game, it's nothing more than EQ in space: Martian Ships = tanks, Jovian Ships = casters, Earth Ships = mix of both (hybrids). You kill X mobs to get level Y. You gain X power, mob gains X^2 power. Same old leveling game.<br />
<br />
<b>Take an upper end guild from DAoC and have them try and do a harder raid like the Avatar of War, Seru, or the Emperor, and chances are they would get torn apart. </b><br />
- Let this guild play EQ for 2 weeks and they will destroy those mobs. There are far more variables in large PvP battles than PvE battles. PvP battles are far more unpredictable than PvE, thus PvP players have a much better reaction to things when they go wrong, not to mention they tend to pay way more attention to what's going on. Paying attention in PvP = survival, paying attention in EQ = easy kills. Organizing and leading a guild in large PvP battles takes far more energy/skill than any EQ encounter. Nothing in EQ is unpredictable, every mob has a certain behaviour that NEVER changes, human opponents however are different. The example of Conquest is an exception to the rule.<br />
<br />
<b>Griefers existed in Everquest too, but not only were they much rarer, they were hunted down themselves. </b><br />
- Actually that's quite the contrary. Guilds cockblock others. Guilds train others. Guilds blow blowable spawns. Guilds monopolize spawns/zones. Guilds grief. I remember the good ole flame wars on how FoH was griefing the server by monopolizing spawns. Griefing in D2 was exploits, griefing in EQ has moved to a much better organization: guilds. Internet anonymity + loopholes in games = people will grief. I also wonder what kinda crack this guy is smoking when he said griefers were hunted down. Yes, every guild that cockblocked others was hunted down. Every guild that trained others was hunted down.<br />
<br />
<b> Harder games attract a more mature audience.</b><br />
- PvE games or games with PvP switch attract a more mature audience, it has nothing to do with difficulty. EQ is not hard, far from it.</p>

	<p>Just a couple of things about WoW from someone who isn't really a fan of any mmorpg (as a fanboi anyway)..<br />
<br />
The "security" issues for WoW are moot..  The reason is, mmorg's use a client/server protocol where as Diablo is a peer to peer game.<br />
<br />
Sony/Verant didn't have any exp in the mmorpg market when they launched EQ.  Look where it is.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has a track record for making complete, and addictive games.<br />
<br />
The look of WoW is amazing (from game play movies and screenshots).  This will draw alot of people at first, but you are right, some will return from where they came.<br />
<br />
The PWNJOO crowd?  that is what ignore if for, you don't have to play with them, or let them in your groups.<br />
<br />
All online games have griefers of some sort...<br />
They either PK lowbies..<br />
Price gouge..<br />
Kill steal..<br />
the list goes on, but all online games have them..<br />
<br />
The PWNJOO crowd is very much apart of EQ, it's just that the older more rounded guilds don't ever deal with them, they are there, I can vouch for it as a recently new member (2 months) to everquest.<br />
<br />
I, personally, picked up EQ, because i was sick of what Mythic was doing to DAoC, and had no plan of sticking around.  I'm going to play WoW when it comes out, and i'm neither a fanboi nor in the PWNJOO crowd.<br />
<br />
I play with a group (10-20) friends, and we are just going to go out and have fun.<br />
<br />
Give the game a chance, or don't, it is ultimately your decision, however, this game (WoW) isn't being "catered" for the "younger" crowd of online gaming.<br />
<br />
Some players from D2/WC3/SC will come over, but I honestly feel when most of the "cheaters" figure out that their isn't an "easy" way, they will go back to map hacking D2.</p>

	<p>EQ is NOT hard.  It does not take any extraordinary "skill" to do well at EQ - other than patience.  I have hardly played in the last year - NEVER been on a PoP raid, never been to LDoN, and NEVER played a casting class of any kind past level 4 (besides shaman).  <br />
<br />
I played around in the GoD beta - and played a 65 version of almost every class in a group or raid.  I have no experience playing a cleric, or enchanter, or necro, or SK, but every group I was in had no idea i was a "noob".  Its all pretty simple.  There is not that much to it.<br />
<br />
One thing I will grant you - you can do stupid stuff - like train your group - and hurt your group.  But as long as you have some common sense, and are not a moron - you should figure out how to play fairly easy.  I would venture to say that 99% of folks who can operate a computer could play EQ no troubles.<br />
<br />
If you think EQ is "hard" - or requires "skill" - I suppose I owe you a compliment for being able to find and read this thread.  I should probably give you a cookie if you can actually figure out how to post <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="smile" smilieid="1" /></p>

	<p>Playing EQ doesn't require much skill.  After all you do what you do so many times that it becomes pretty routine stuff.<br />
<br />
But EQ, when I first played it, did have one aspect that was hard - deciding where to go and what to kill to progress by gaining both experience and by getting gear from drops.  I used to spend hours researching what my options were and deciding how and when I could attempt them.<br />
<br />
That's part of what I hated about EverRaid: a casual player now just farms pp to buy his gear in the bazaar, a raider just turns up wherever the man says the raid is tonight.</p>

	<p>Yeah I have to agree with the majority of posters here Everquest isn't hard. IT DOES have a steep learning curve to anyone that joins the game and has not played a mmorpg before.<br />
<br />
Skill wise? Hmm I don't really call it skill. Or maybe there is but its not obvious which skills.<br />
<br />
Hmm, there are differences intially I would guess of effective managing. Ie combining many roles and choosing which are the best. These verg more towards the same at later levels with usage of community boards etc. In a shamans case in a grouping situation it is balancing debuffing, slowing and healing. If this is considered skill then its marginalized by the lack of variety to test these skills and by the number of times you have to perform these skills.<br />
<br />
Raiding, there is not much skill either really. There are tactics which essentially revolve around a MT and a cleric chealing them. (Obviously there are exceptions, like Coirnav or Rathe.) Raiding requires a lot of organization, and so this could be considered a skill whoever is organizing. (and what elements) There is little in the way of skill on the individual level. There are styles and roles which individuals can differ in.<br />
<br />
So in short I think it is hard to agree with the article that Everquest possesses more skill than most mmorpgs. It does have elements of organization and management skills but these are marginalized by the number of times you have to do them.<br />
<br />
Everquests success in a lot of ways is getting people together to do things. And having a interdepedent organization. Ie all the best abilities are divided up between everyone and we have to effectively rely on people doing their jobs in groups.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day though,  my reasons for playing everquest never revolved around skills. It revolved around immersiveness, interacting and discovering.(+Character Advancement) Elements which have dwindled away as everquest has progressed.</p>

	<p>Folks honestly you are all smarter and more skilled than you think.  This is almost like the old "I would not be a member of a club that would have me for a member."<br />
<br />
Compared to most other games, hobbies, activites EQ is pretty difficult.  The vast number of items and skill and content in the game demands that one has to be pretty good at sorting out the complexities of the game.<br />
<br />
Just think how hard the game would be IF we did not have extra-Sony resources like this message board?  I can remember four years ago when I was not savvy to using other websites to gain some advantage and my character was hitting a wall.  I don't think I am an idiot and I found the game to be pretty difficult.  One of us saying EQ is not hard is like Bobby Fisher saying Chess is easy.  Of course Bobby Fisher has said stranger things.</p>

<br />
If you think that playing an enchanter, a class that is given all the tools they need to do their job successfully, is hard you are sadly mistaken.<br />
<br />
Thanks though, for a textbook example of someone that thinks they are superior because they picked enchanter at character select.  Try playing a warrior without discs and see how a hard class is played.</p>

You think.. *gasp*  there's someone in charge of making decisions for EQ shaman spells ... *snicker*  who PLAYS a shaman?  What are you smoking and can I have some?  Do you even REMEMBER the proposed buff from the last expansion?  The one with str/dex/sta on it?  Do you actually USE disease dots?<br />
<br />
Not that I think shaman is the only class being thrown together by a process somewhat resembling the flinging of feces by monkeys at a stick of wood.  SK's getting spellcasting subtlety?  Proposed enchanter AA for their DoT's....  I'm flabbergasted to think that anyone is under the delusion that these spells and abilities aren't organized via some kind of spreadsheet somewhere, with little numbers tallied at the bottom, at which the devs look and sigh with satisfaction, "Well, THAT certainly looks balanced!"<br />

Provided a good laugh, though.  Thanks!</p>

	<p>Love this article.<br />
<br />
I'm really looking forward to WoW.  My only real fear is that it will be too WC3 and D2 like.  While I enjoyed both games, they both got old because of the same things.  <br />
<br />
a) The griefing in these games is insane.  As a beginner in WC3, I would hate people just crushing me, and they would say things like "Have you ever played this before?".  At level 1, why is everyone so good in WC3??? <br />
b) There was only one path for each character.  In D2 if you had a barbarian you ended up a WW machine.  If you played a Necro you ended up a revive corpse machine.  A little creativity could go far here.  In WC3, you had a set build order and you stuck to it, no realy ingenuity there.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping WoW will be better, but I won't be surprised if it isn't.</p>

	<p>E.Q. is as hard as you make it, <br />
if you think playing a chanter is easy then take a 30ish lvl chanter into castle MM and charm up the Dark huntress deep inside and solo with that monster as a pet. if you can pull that off I will give you kudos for your skills. if you can mez/tash mobs on a raid, grats you are perfectly normal.<br />
if you can keep 6 mobs mez'd while your group ganks the 7th and not lose a player and not lose mez on any of them, while calling targets for the tank to kill next. you get kudos, if you pop off an ae mez and scream evac your just plain old normal.<br />
<br />
of you can duo a rogue/monk for exp off of red mobs with ultra crappy gear and do so with minimal deaths and a decent kill rate you get some credit for understanding the game, if you instead spend hours in pok lfg with your rogue monk duo you are just plain old normal.<br />
<br />
eq is one game that will allow you to truly push the limits of what you can do with what you are given. of course its easy to do baxic crowd control with a chanter, duh thats their primary role. you only know who shines as a chanter when the **** really hits the fan and the come out clean on the other side with a look that says "what you guys were worried?<br />
<br />
the fact that most of us can play any class at an acceptable lvl of skill on a raid doesnt say jack. most of use are 65 and have been for some time, most of us have at least 2 toons that are 50+, most of us have spent literally MONTHS of our lives playing this game. if you can spend that much time at something like eq and NOT pick up the other class's basics your a moron. <br />
the only true test of skill would come with playing the class in its role in its most stressing type of game play.<br />
<br />
how many of you have done the rogue solo run in PoH for the epic drop?  (pre sos)<br />
or solo'd in a place or mobs that you never thought you could handle with your shaman and trusty Dog Dog? <br />
most of us are accomplished shaman, some are acomplished at other classes as well. but admit it, you have all met that Paly/druid/ranger/chanter/bard/rogue that just amazed you with the skills they displayed at the time. <br />
raids are a piss poor example of skill displays, there are dozens of people to make up for mistakes and little for individuals to do 90% of the time.<br />
<br />
as a shaman I think my personal best night for pure raid skill was doing seru with 3 bane rangers and 5 wizzy/mages for most of our dps. I was the only shaman, the only RGC, and of course the only FA. I had to keep seru slowed, malos'd, decay'd, cycle FA on the rangers, handle requests for RGC and slow/malos adds...I worked my ass off that raid and we won. I consider that raid a person victory, there is no way we could have done it without me there and theres only one other shaman (I think) with Rgc in the guild. <br />
<br />
showing up casting malos/slow on the boss mob is something a bot can do.<br />
<br />
what the hell am I rambling about? hell I dont know anymore, but if WoW doesnt allow for the ability to really push the envelope the it fails like most of them do.<br />
<br />
<br />
and *** eq HAS PVP SERVERS! grats daoc blows, in large part to having ONE ruleset for all servers. morons.</p>

<br />
Hi - I'm a caster - I'm TIED to spell DROPS or the randomness of parchment / rune TURN-IN's.<br />
<br />
My efficacy is severly downgraded if I do not have certain spells.<br />
<br />
Hi - I'm a melee - I get my disc's for free. Or I can go purchase them in EC.<br />
<br />
Yes - you are tied to your equipment - but so is a caster. Flowing thought, hit points, int / wis gear. <br />
<br />
To say that casters are "given" their tools is to demonstrate YOUR lack of anything resembling a clue.</p>

	<p>In the beginning, EQ was much harder than it is now. There were no big sites to look up information. There was no insta-travel to anywhere you please. The game has become dumbed down quite a bit, and continues to do so. Can't blame SOE, though, I think it attracts more players that way. And there is still enough challanging content to keep most of the "smarter" players happy/</p>

	<p>I agree EQ is a challenging game and it is something I really enjoy about it, but the exetremely long camp times to do anything is well - awful.<br />
<br />
Go to a named spot, find the ph clear the area for hours hoping the named you want will pop and if and when it pops hope that it will drop what you are looking for.<br />
<br />
Need faction for a hand in or something else be prepared to do hours/days of killing the same mob over and over for small changes.<br />
<br />
Need a key, spell anything - <br />
<br />
Hard and challenging is not the same as repetitive and boring.<br />
<br />
EQ has both, get rid of the camping and I'd play EQ forever.</p>
