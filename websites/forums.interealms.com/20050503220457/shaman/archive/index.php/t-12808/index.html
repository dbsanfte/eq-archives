<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Before the forums got revamped, there was a great post listing sites which explained what every buff did and which ones to use on which raids and such.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No idea what you're talking about, but I can tell you about buffs real quick:<br />
<br />
Cast focus on everyone.<br />
Cast stamina on everyone.<br />
If someone wants something else, they'll send you a tell.  Give them what they want.  Agility is a pretty worthless buff but if someone asks for it, don't go off a big tirade about how useless the buff is (which many people on these forums claim to do when they are asked for agi), just give them the damn buff.<br />
<br />
That's all there is to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Cast Focus<br />
Cast Sta<br />
Cast talisman of alacrity if there's no enchs around.<br />
Cast billy if you're outdoors (yay for 20atk).<br />
<br />
It's not very complicated.   :p</div></div><hr />

I tend to give my groups / smaller-sized raids the full suite of buffs.  Focus on the tanks/druids/shamans and Infusion of Spirit on the rest.<br />
<br />
Followed by Talisman of the Boar, Talisman of the Wrulan, Talisman of the Diaku, Spirit of Bih'Li, Talisman of Alacrity, Blessing of Replenishment, Tiny Terror x 2, and Talisman of the Tribunal if necessary, followed by other stuff like resists and Acumen of Dar`Khura if they need it.<br />
<br />
In a group, you can usually finish up buffing by the second pull or so (in the meantime malosini/turgur/crippling when necessary).<br />
<br />
It's not that hard to fully buff people.. It's kinda fun once you have all the best group spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I recently made this post in my guild forums. It is geared towards training them how to ask for buffs but it gives you an idea of what buffs do what. This was written for one buffing shaman on a raid, which I usually am.<br />

How to Get My Buffs On Raid<br />
<br />
I will cast MGB Focus if available when all raid force is present.<br />
If MGB is not available I will cast Group Focus on Full Raid groups one at a time.<br />
I will cast group stamina and group agility on full raid groups.<br />
<br />
You do not need to ask for focus/agi/sta buffs personally unless you arrived late after they were cast, died, got dispelled and need rebuffed. These buffs will be done last, when raid and groups are formed and the majority of the people are there.<br />
<br />
When I have the mana I will /rsay something like /tell me for Primal Essence. When you see this send me a /tell asking for a Primal Essence. I will be getting a lot of tells sometimes up to 15 at a time or even more so please be patient. I may miss you since I will be getting mass tells. Please wait for me to /rsay /tell me for Primal Essence again and then ask for it again if I missed you the first time. Please Do Not ask for sta/agi/focus at this time. I will be doing MGB Focus and Group Sta/Agi in its own time (see above).<br />
<br />
If you would like any of the other buffs that I can cast send me a /tell asking for it by name. I will get you when I can. <br />
<br />
After asking for a buff in tells and I buff you please do not respond with a thank you or something in another tell. Since I use /rt to target the last person who sent me a tell so I can buff them easier sending me a tell after you get the buff messes me up.<br />
<br />
If you know I am in buff request mode please don't start chatting with me in tells since it makes it hard to handle the buff tells and chit chat tells all at once. if you do you will likely just get ignored until i am done buffing.  :wink: <br />
<br />
I do not respond to buff requests that are not asked for in /tell but instead asked for in /gu or /rsay. I will respond for buff requests in group chat. I do not respond to any buff requests from Nludien.<br />
<br />
Since Ferine Avatar is a short duration buff I will not constantly be recasting it on everyone for general mobs. Just stick with Primal Essence in general. If we are going to engage a tough mob I will avatar as many as I can before we engage, but I cannot get everyone since it is a 30 second recast.<br />
<br />
Pay Attention to call for buff requests in raid channel. If you slack off and miss your chance for buffs too bad. I will not be buffing you during the middle of a fight or 1 minute before we engage.<br />
<br />
If you show up late on a raid and missed my buffs just send me a tell saying that you just got there and let me know what buffs you need. I will get you when time/mana permits it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you and have a nice day....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This is roughly what I end up casting in raids...<br />
<br />
Pure casters and clerics: Sta, PE, IoS<br />
<br />
War: Sta, Acu, Cha, Feral/Ferine Avatar, Daiku (if REALLY hurting for str/dex), Focus<br />
<br />
Knights: Sta, Acu, PE (if no Primal/Prismatic), Focus<br />
<br />
DPS: Sta, PE (if no Primal/Prismatic), Acu (monks are ALL blind), Focus, Regen<br />
<br />
The rest: Sta, Focus, PE<br />
<br />
There are usually quite a few other shammies around to help out (WOOT!) and buff needs change with certain encounters, but those are the basics. :)<br />
<br />
*Just a note*  I always request that buffs are in tells because it keeps /rs and /gu clear of unecessary spam and ensures that people do get what they request instead of assuming someone else has it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In my guild the only buffs we cast are focus and stamina.  THey have learned to not ask for agi, for the most part.  Also have the lower lvl shamans giving the tanks charisma for DI.<br />
<br />
We use avatar sometimes but only for big mobs and we plan ahead whos casting on whom etc etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok, let me clarify what I was looking for.  First off, I know what shammy buffs do, I've been casting them since I started the game :-)  What I was looking for was a web page that listed all the different buffs in the game (the important ones anyway) with recomendations on which to cast under which conditions (for instance Po9 and Marzin's instead of Virtue for casters).  There used to be several good web pages with this kind of information out there, but after digging through several pages of google results and not finding anything, I figured I'd have better luck here.  Basically, I'm looking for a site where I can find out exactly how much spell haste Blessing of Reverence gives, or which of those Brell's Barrier spells is better.  Yes I know I could find all this on Lucy or Caster's Realm, but I find it much easier if all the relevant info is on a single page.  So, with that clarification, can anyone recomend any sites?<br />
<br />
P.S.  Thanks to all that have responded thus far, I'm sure you all would have been much more helpful if I had been clearer in my initial post :)</div></div><hr />
