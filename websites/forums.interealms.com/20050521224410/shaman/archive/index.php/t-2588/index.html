<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dobbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Need some help.. I wanna twink a troll shaman im making but im not sure what I should get... I have like 35k but looking to spend about 10kish.  Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Buy an ikky regen bp, i love mine, fungi would be better, but you probably wouldn't be able to get anything else. Thats about 5k on my server, then 6/65 ac/hp rings, jb arms, boots, gaunts, helm, good ac, and pretty cheap. For a weapon I'd get spine chill spear, or howling harpoon, and slime coated harpoon for range. For 2ndary get a charred gaurdian shield, or clay gaurdian shield. Earring, forest loops, owlbear claws, or 2ac 35/25 hp/mana earing are all nice choices. Bracers, not sure, sentry, or RMBs. Belt, try for a flayed Turmoil Skin belt, or cheaper, crystalline belt, if ya wanna level fast through newbie levels, get a FBSS instead. Legs, rygorr, totemic, all good choices. Neck, ivory imbuded collars are very nice, mask, bone mask of the jarsath, or maybe a acrylia studded mask for cheaper. Back, i would get something like cloak of the rygorr orcales, or Kunzar Cloak. Shoulders, dunno, i have tattered mantle right now. Thats about all, hope i helped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You might want to check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=2353&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=2532&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, etc.  There are a bunch of 'em out there.<br />
<br />
If you're starting out fresh with 10k, you basically want to decide on one or two nice items and filling out the rest of your spots with something serviceable.  First you need to decide on your big items...  and while AC, HP, and WIS are all nice, they're not your most important stat. <br />
<br />
Your most important stats are Regeneration and Mana-free damage. Think about it, the more mana you have, the more time it takes you to med it back... you are looking for a way to get your mana back faster- and that's what regen is all about. <br />
<br />
Here are my recommendations: <br />
<br />
1. Get an iksar regen BP. 5 hp/tick = 3000 hp/hour = 1500 mana/hour (if you're a cannibalizing fiend.) <br />
<br />
2. If you spend plan on spending a lot of time outdoors, get a horse. Get the cheapest horse, and turn the models OFF. Turning the models off allows you to cast SoW on yourself without it being overwritten by the horse speed effect (and you don't have to look at a horse-head all the time.) While on a horse, if you are standing still and not auto-attacking, you are medding. Even while standing. Even while casting. The ability to med while standing/casting is huge. <br />
<br />
3.  When you hit level 35 (and if you can find a reasonably priced one) get a fungi staff. They definitely have limitations (they snare you, the effect needs to be reapplied every 5 minutes, and it doesn't stack with regen spells) - but it's mana-free Regrowth... 9000 hp/hour = 4500 mana/hour. Stacks with the iksar regen BP or fungi tunic, too. <br />
<br />
4. Your longer-term items are (of course) the JBB and fungi tunic. <br />
<br />
For now, you'll probably just want the iksar BP.  For the rest of spots, here's what I recommend:<br />
<br />
Get the cheap Jaundiced Bone pieces where available (helm, gloves, arms, boots- each a few hundred pp and great AC.)   <br />
<br />
Get some 6 AC/65 HP rings- a steal for the money.<br />
<br />
Get a &lt;a href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6020&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Black Alloy Medallion&lt;/a&gt; - stats are pretty good, it's cheap (couple hundred PP) and it will make every spell you cast under level 45 cost 10% less mana.  That's a good thing.<br />
<br />
Get an &lt;a href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=5289&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Arctic Wyvern Mask&lt;/a&gt; - nice balance of AC and WIS with the mask for a few hundred pp.<br />
<br />
Get a &lt;a href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1137&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Clay Guardian Shield&lt;/a&gt; (Ac 25, +50 HP) - a few hundred pp, and it will last you a long time.<br />
<br />
For remaining spots, grab totemic or ry'gorr.<br />
<br />
Since you'll be tanking your way through the first few levels, a nice weapon will help you out.  You'll want to keep both piercing and your blunt skills trained, and make sure to keep your defense skill maxed as you level.  As a piercer, the slime covered harpoon is nice (10 dmg, 25 dly, +5 wis, +10 mana) - fast and it can go in your range spot when you're not using it.  For a blunt weapon, grab a smoldering brand (9 dmg, 22 dly, procs a minor fire DD at level 1- great twink weapon.)  Both should set you back just a few hundred pp.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Click my profile.  It's all totally free.  Had me at level 12 in an hour.  That was pre-level nerfs, too.<br />
<br />
Clarification:  By totally free, I mean any competant level 50+ character can farm it in an hour or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">2 6ac/65hp rings, or 5ac 30hp 30mana rings<br />
2 2ac 35hp 25mana earrings<br />
1 7str 7wis mask<br />
(above 3 are all jewelcraft)<br />
Do the quest for the snare necklace.  It's decent stats.<br />
Crown of the froglok kings 12ac 20fire 20cold resist.  should cost about 1k.<br />
Iksar Ceremonial BP should be about 2-3k, maybe a wee bit more.  19ac + 5hp regen.<br />
Jaundiced bone arms, gloves, boots should be about 500P-1000P each.<br />
Eboots cost about 2k nowadays.<br />
There's any number of decent +wis 1h piercers with a 1:3 ratio.  Also some good 1h blunts.  Dark Ember is about the best one you can find for the cost.<br />
Charred guardian sheilds should be under 400P.  sarnak battle shields sell for about 2k now.  clay guardian shield is about 1k.<br />
goranga idols sell for 500p.<br />
engraved bone pauldrons are stupid easy to get if you are on giant faction.  i think i used to sell them for about 250P.  you might want to go with a tattered mantle though for the hp bonus.  those sell for a few hundred.</div></div><hr />
