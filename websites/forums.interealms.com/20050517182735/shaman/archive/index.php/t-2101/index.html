Strange action by VI. Would have thought their new &quot;promotional&quot; campaign to sell people two accounts would have tied in well with EQW.<br />

From what I know of EQW, all it does is take whatever direct x is currently running (in this case EQ) and put it in a window.<br />
<br />
How is it possible to nerf something taking place client side?<br />
<br />
Anyway /rude VI, just started using EQW about a week ago, and It made playing so much less of a chore. The are giving away free account keys,....why in God's name would they nerf a program that would undoubtbly cause plenty of people to USE the bonus account key and add an additional 12.99 a month to there coffers? EQW has not caused Verant to lose a dime, nor does it offer an unfair advantage to people using is (as one may argue in the case of ShowEQ).<br />
<br />
Hope JSD can fix it,....he our only hope</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thordan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">EQW is broken. You have to download a patch now and that disables you from being able to use your keyboard to enter your station name/password when you use EQW. No way around it as of right now, supposedly the guy who made the program is working on fixing it. Traditionally he has been very fast at fixing any problems with the program, so we'll see what happens.<br />
<br />
I just wish Verant would come out with their own type of program like EQW so we can multi-task and play EQ at the same time, although it would be within the limits that they want. Such as not being able to run two at the same time, or whatever they feel is wrong with the current EQW. I think it is pretty lame to make it so we can't use EQW since a ton of people use it and wouldn't ever go back to playing EQ in normal mode.</div></div><hr />

Look at ShowEQ.  It runs on a second box and a hub, hence all incoming packets are broadcast to all the NICs on the hub.<br />
<br />
EQw allows your to window EQ.  At most it allows people to memory hack the system for faster SoW, etc.  This is what VI wants to prevent.  Unfortunately as long as the client remains in the hands of the enemy (namely the user), they will try to prevent hacking of the data stream.<br />

I have never, and will never use a cheat or a hack program for EQ.  The program is simply for convenience.<br />

<br />
They don't need to make a seperate program if they wanted to do that, all they would need to do is stop EQ from forcing full screen mode.   You can already open EQ twice, just like you can open 2 browsers at once, but because it forces full screen mode and they have disabled tab switching you can't get to the 2nd session.  All Verant would have to do is remove the tab switching and full screen force and you could open up 2 EQ sessions and work from there.   Or, if they really wanted to get fancy they could make it like Autocad, Excel, Word, etc and make only one EQ open but allow multiple windows inside the EQ session, but that would take a lot more work most likely.  But the first situation, while using a lot more system resources would work just fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I develop systems that handle an entire country's senitive data for a living so I really dont think anything like this would be terribly difficult to make. And we certainly dont do our best to enforce fullscreen mode to improve sercurity in our applications. Quite the opposite infact because thats what our customers want.

<br />
1) Verant could have easily implented full screen mode, alt tabbing if they wanted it.<br />
<br />
2) They don't test code against 3rd party software to ensure that the 3rd party software works.  <br />
<br />
Maybe I am misreading or just can't understand your post but if they wanted full screen mode and alt tabbing they would have implemented it to begin with.<br />
<br />
I agree with your earlier post about implementing it as part of the code anyways.  :D<br />

Back in the old days of DOS we had TSRs (programs that ran in the &quot;background&quot;) to cheat in games that didn't have built-in cheats.  You didn't have to shell out of the game to activate the cheats either, so I don't see what would be keeping someone from running a canned-hack that uses keyboard shortcuts for what they want to do.  The big issue here is whether or not hacks could even work.  We have &quot;insufficent mana&quot; messages that you get even when the client shows you have enough and you're just lagging on the update.  If HP and MP are controlled server-side, why not run speed and invulnerability?  *shrug*<br />
I'm not a master programmer, and I have no idea how Verant handles all this, but I find it hard to believe that making EQ run full-screen and not let it swap out is to prevent memory hacks that would just provide a perceived benefit on the client side while the server laughs at you.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure the maker of EQW has already sent a complete set of source code to the code-monkeys at VI so they can make sure they don't 'break' it.  Probably with a complete whitepaper on how it works as well.  Yeah, right.<br />
<br />

2. Disable EQW which lets someone run two accounts at once on a single machine.<br />
<br />
That said, I bet Verant did these two things together on purpose.  Their email today was very specific about running the second account on a second machine.  I guess they figured that if they could get everyone to buy new machines to play luclin, they could get everyone to go buy another machine to two-box it.<br />

My understanding isn't that they &quot;didn't enable&quot; alt-tabbing, it is that they actively disabled it (DAOC did this explicitly as well).<br />
<br />
No, originally, they just didn't have code to handle events such as the start menu coming into focus over the full screen EQ console. Hence, when you hit the start menu, you were fuxxored and EQ crashed. Back in those days (assuming the right conditions, OS, etc) you used to be able to ALT-CTRL-DEL to task manager, and then switch to a different task - C-A-D would switch it out of fullscreen mode and in effect &quot;minimize&quot; EQ. To get back you could simply C-A-D again and &quot;switch task&quot; back to EQ - effectively switching back to full screen mode.<br />
<br />
Now, they simply disabled the ability to do that, because it was too buggy. They haven't actively gone out of their way to make it impossible to alt-tab out, they just haven't added the code to allow that.<br />
<br />
They disable alt-tab because they fear it will increase hacking, an equally asinine assumption.  Anyone capable of developing a packet-sniffer can beat the anti alt-tab code.<br />
<br />
Not true. It's a valid issue, because any kid could install EQW, and then run some canned, bought off of ebay piece of code that would do some memory hack locally. If the kid can't get around being able to alt-tab out, he can't run some canned program. Granted you could write something that runs in the background, and it could work, but this would make it easier for some &quot;script kiddie&quot; to just run a canned hack. I wouldn't go out of my way to make that easier either!<br />
<br />
 So, they they claim it is to prevent the more casual exploiter who gets their hacks from someplace like Dr.Twister or Hackersquest.  If people put up hard core hacks there, they will post the windowed-mode hack as well, duh.<br />
<br />
Right, but this would just make it even easier to run these exploits, no point in doing extra work to make it less secure.<br />
<br />
This is even putting aside the fact that it is a disgrace for them to put valuable information on the client in the first place, because anything that can get hacked, will get hacked. <br />
<br />
True, but until you can design a computer game that's fully secure I wouldn't say too much ;)<br />
<br />
I work in software development and hear a lot of complaining... but I see very few people offering solutions - the solutions are NOT easy.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Like I said, they will tolerate EQW, and I don't think anyone has or will be banned for it... but they aren't going to go out of the way to help make some 3rd party wrapper work with their code when they don't even sanction the use of it. I sure wouldn't!<br />
<br />
Until you have developed software, it's very hard to truly understand the level of testing required for even the most basic changes... and when people like some of you are complaining that some 3rd party program won't work anymore (when all they probably did was make some directX change that EQW just doesnt' know how to handle yet, because it wasn't there before) you really have no clue how ridiculous that is.<br />
<br />

Besides, don't worry about it, stop panicing, EQW will work again in a couple days if not later today ;)</div></div><hr />

No doubt this is true, I imagine it is quite difficult to realize the credo that &quot;the client is in the hands of the enemy&quot; when designing these games, which is what you have to do to prevent hacks.  However, that is wholly irrelevant to this discussion.  Disabling alt-tab is not a solution to anything, it is a fool's paradise.  What disabling alt-tab DOES do--especially combined with the cumbersome log-on procedure--is keep people in the game for longer and longer stretches of time, which helps reinforce the ole Skinner Box.  Not saying that Big V intended this, but it is a pleasant side effect for them ;)<br />
<br />

<br />
Wrong. <br />
<br />
From Allakhazam's bug section:<br />
<br />
They designed EQ to disable the ALT+TAB shortcut keystroke in Windows (which swaps between programs); this was intended to stop people from using &quot;trainer&quot; utilities whie in EQ.<br />
<br />
From the official Everquest FAQ:<br />
<br />
3.4.2 . . . .<br />
EverQuest runs in full screen mode and doesn't allow task switching in order to deter the use of third party software that may be used to modify EverQuest gameplay.<br />
<br />
If the kid can't get around being able to alt-tab out, he can't run some canned program.<br />
<br />
Wrong.<br />
<br />
That is the point I was addressing.  Your situation has someone that can make a worthwhile packet sniffer selling that product on EBAY.  For that person, making a windowed-mode hack is less than trivial.  Anyone in class want to guess what our budding entrepreneur does?  Anyone who does not answer &quot;they include the windowed-mode hack with the sniffer&quot; goes back to second grade. <br />
<br />
Thankfully, Verant's #1 project is being controlled by Raph Koster at Verant Austin, presumably far, far away from the people in San Diego who thought turning my PC into a Nintendo64 was a good idea.<br />
<br />
Star Wars Galaxies FAQ:<br />
<br />
11.15 Is ALT-Tab going to be disabled in the game? <br />
<br />
Our current thought is that we are not going to disable ALT-TAB. It might limit some hacking, but a determined hacker can easily get around it, especially in newer versions of Windows like Win2k or XP. It would mostly be a small inconvenience to them and a big inconvenience to everyone else.<br />

Lub Raph.  Except for his neverending policy of catering to gankers :)</div></div><hr />

I read on the HQBoard it may have something to do with the new interface...<br />
<br />
That would be cool. EQW and (finally) a new interface.<br />
<br />
*edit remembered my point*<br />

Surely, it's about time they separated the issues of cheating and using your computer in a reasonable fashion. They have staff to deal with hackers, which is how it should be handled.</div></div><hr />

Yes JSD knows that keyboard input is broken and IS working on a fix. <br />
<br />
Please do NOT hammer the boards. If you can't live without knowing what the status of EQW is every minute by refreshing your browser then you need to goto your doctor and get some heavy duty seditives. <br />
<br />
Oh and Verant are not out to get us people.....sheeeesh.....this is a result of a side effect of the new interface coming our way most likely. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Indeed. It's more likely something VI did not plan to do, but something they don't obviously test after every change they make to the game they do _not_ test compatibility with EQW. Nor should they, it's not part of game but an external software.<br />
<br />
Sometimes it's amazing how fast people in this everquest community are to type out all the Nerfed! posts and cries...<br />
<br />
Get a grip folks.</div></div><hr />
