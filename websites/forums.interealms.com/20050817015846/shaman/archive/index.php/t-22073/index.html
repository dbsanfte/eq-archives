<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is my personal take on what shamans need for GoD and OoW to be competitive with other classes in group and raid situations.<br />
<br />
Yes, I am going to ask for all of this. I have no clue how it will turn out, but I really do feel that this is the amount of reworking the shaman class needs to be brought back in line with the rest of the classes.<br />
<br />
This post is mainly going to address the issues of elemental+ shamans. Some of the changes will of course benefit lower level or lower AAd shaman as well. Overall however I believe that most shaman problems concern the post-elemental part of the game and thus this proposal is centered on fixing shaman issues in that content.<br />
<br />
General Shaman issues:<br />
* Shamans have received less upgrades to every single one of their spell lines then all other classes got to their comparable spell lines for every expansion since Kunark. Shamans want at least some of that lost power back. This includes DoTs, nukes, cannibalize (already being adressed), buffs (partially being adressed), heals and pets.<br />
* Shamans suffer more then any other class from the short fights of LDoN and GoD (and to a lesser degree PoP) as well as suffering more then other classes from slow mitigation. Shamans want increases to their healing to at least partially make up for the lost power of slow.<br />
* Shamans still stack poorly on raids. This can probably be adressed (or mostly adressed) by the improvements outlined above.<br />
* DoT aggro is utterly out of control. DoT aggro should be decreased to the level of an equally damaging direct damage.<br />
<br />
Specific shaman issues<br />
* When acting as a healer shamans rely on slow to be able to heal at all. Any resist causes the shaman to go into chain healing mode which will at best negate the incoming damage. There is no time to attempt to slow again, which is what shaman healing as balanced around. Shamans would like an emergency ability (most likely as an AA skill) to address this.<br />
* The shaman group haste is still inferior to the single target spell.<br />
* Shamans are still unable to shrink their pets.<br />
* The Avatar line has an effect which is not even close to being in line with the mana and time required to use it (not to mention having to lose a spell gem to it). This is even more pronounced as players cap their stats.<br />
<br />
That being said this is the list of specifics:<br />
(Items of minor interest to either the majority of shamans or of low balance impact are in italics. Critical issues are bolded.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Healing<br />
* Spot Heal<br />
Improve Daluda's Mending to heal 1900 damage. Increase the mana cost to 600. (Also adjust the OoW heal accordingly.)<br />
<br />
* Group Heal<br />
Add a shaman group HoT. It should heal 420 points per tick (same as Quiescence) and cost 900 mana.<br />
<br />
* Emergency Heal<br />
Add a Spirit Shifting AA in three levels (4/4/4 points at levels 61/63/65). This ability will drain 12/25/40% of the shaman's HPs and give them to his current target. The casting time should be no higher then 1 second. The reuse time should be 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mana Regeneration<br />
* Cannibalize<br />
Shaman spells are balanced on the assumption that shamans regenerate mana much faster then other classes. As other classes have received a much larger increase to their mana regeneration over the last expansions then shamans did shaman mana regeneration is in need of an upgrade. This can come either in the form of more efficient cannibalize spells or in the form of cannibalize spells that basically combine several castings of cannibalize into one big cast, thus freeing up time for other tasks.<br />
The current ancient cannibalize spell is a good spell, but something so central to the shaman class should not be available to a select few. Make the new cannibalize spell a purchaseable spell in PoK.<br />
<br />
<br />
Damage<br />
* DoT aggro<br />
Decrease DoT aggro significantly. A DoT that does 2000 damage should not add more aggro then a direct damage spell that does 2000 damage.<br />
<br />
* Poison nukes<br />
Increase Spear of Torment to do 900 damage. Up the mana cost to 370.<br />
<br />
* Ice nukes<br />
Increase Velium Strike to do 1300 damage. Up the mana cost to 430.<br />
<br />
* Poison DoTs<br />
Increase Blood of Saryrn to do 400 damage per tick. Up the mana cost to 650 to match that increase. Add a -30 resist adjustment. (Also change the OoW poison DoT accordingly. Also apply the resist adjustment to lower level poison DoTs.)<br />
<br />
* Magic DoTs<br />
Increase Bane to do 500 damage per tick. Up the mana cost to 600. Add a -60 resist adjustment. (Apply equivalent changes to the other spells of this line.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Debuffs<br />
* Balance of the Nihil<br />
Up the resist modifier on Balance of the Nihil to -55 to match Malos.<br />
<br />
<br />
Buffs<br />
* Avoidance<br />
The replacement buff for our agility line has a listed effect of 7% avoidance. In actual play this seems to work out to an actual 4% avoidance. It should be improved to 10% (listed) to produce an actual 6% avoidance effect in game.<br />
<br />
* Damage<br />
The replacement buff for our strength line has a listed effect of 5% melee damage. In actual play this seems to work out to an actual 2% damage. It should be improved to 10% (listed) to produce an actual 4% damage effect in game.<br />
<br />
* HPs<br />
The OoW shaman stamina buff currently adds stamina past the stat cap. Shamans fear that stamina will suffer from additional dimishing returns past 305. If the spell ends up adding less then 200 HPs to a stat-capped 65 warrior it should be removed in favor of a non-capped effect, similar to the other buff replacements (stun resist or shielding seem appropriate).<br />
<br />
* Focus<br />
Increase the HPs on the OoW version of the focus line to 850. Remove the strength and dexterity components and replace them with +melee damage to match the standalone buff.<br />
<br />
* Focus<br />
Increase the HPs on Focus of Soul to 650.<br />
<br />
* Avatar<br />
The effect of the avatar line is not at all in line with it's cost. Either substantially up the effects of this spell line, add a group version of the spell or substantially up the duration.<br />
<br />
* Group haste<br />
The shaman group haste is inferior to the single target spell. Up the haste to match that of the single target version.<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
* Pet<br />
Make the shaman pet innately dual weild (currently it dual weilds once given weapons).<br />
<br />
* Pet shrink<br />
Make the shaman pet shrinkable again.<br />
<br />
<br />
-- Adjust other spells accordingly&quot; means that the spell in question should receive the same percentual improvements compared to the base spell as comparable spells of other classes get in that expansion. --<br />

<br />
10 minutes is a long time. One use every 3 mobs seems more appropriate to me. I am advocating a 3 minute reuse timer with a 0.75 cast time to match Divine Arbitration, which is definitely more powerful.<br />
<br />
* Increase Blood of Saryrn to do 400 damage per tick. Up the mana cost to 650 to match that increase. Add a -30 resist adjustment. (Also change the OoW poison DoT accordingly. Also apply the resist adjustment to lower level poison DoTs.)<br />

<br />
Very problematic, as it will require to adjust the Necromancer DoT equivalents. Other than that, the numbers are fine, *if* the upgrades in Omens are going to scale accordingly.</div></div><hr />

I have no problems with giving necromancers the same resist adjustments. They have exactly the same issues concerning DoTs as we do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Great, run with it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, if we got everything on your list life would be peachy keen but I continue to believe that meaningful dialog with the developers from a macro standpoint is job one.  You can throw out #'s till you are blue in the face, but if you do not convince them of the basic principals of how this game is actually played (vs on paper) and how groups decide which classes to invite nothing meaningful will be changed.<br />
<br />
Also, just throwing a long laundry list of items out certainly does not prioritize things, and having polls asking Shaman whether healing should be 1800, 1900, 2000 is just about the most insane thing I have seen on these boards in years.  Class balancing is not an individual spell at &quot;x&quot; rate, it is all the abilites of the class put together incorporating content and other class balancing.<br />
<br />
But anyway, I have given my 2c.  It is my strong recommendation to whom ever decides to go battle Sony for Shaman concerns that they separate the Shaman items (FA duration, puppy not duel wielding, etc.) that are pure inconvenience and do not make for strategic or happy gameplay, from the healing and damage which is the core of content balancing.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately as many of us think Sony either doesn't know what direction to take, or they realize that by making any big move they will get even more people upset - so they sit on their hands.  I think the latter but maybe I'm giving them too much credit.<br />
<br />
So, you can blast Sony with everything in the phone book and get nothing IMHO, or you can start a real life dialog which always starts with somewhat an agreement with the &quot;problems&quot; first and work from that platform.  I am a negotiator in real life - maybe this is so painfully obvious to me but not to others? boggle.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You mispelled &quot;address&quot; (adress) in the first item under &quot;specific shaman issues&quot;.<br />
I like the spirit shifting aa, that would be really nice.  I think 10 minutes could be reasonable.  Would really take some playing with it live to actually see what the reuse needs to be.<br />
<br />
1900 on daluda's would be nice, but I think it might be asking for a bit much.  Going with the same ratios, that would put the OOW heal at about 2100, and I'm not sure they want us that high.  Of course with the way the GoD one went, asking for too high seems to net you about where you want to be.<br />
<br />
Also of note, where you say &quot;Shaman have received less upgrades to every single one of their spell lines then all other classes got to their comparable spell lines for every expansion since Kunark.&quot;, I think it would be a huge boost to put some numbers on that.  Lay out a table with the abilities of classes in at the time of kunark (assume all spells, even though they were stupidly rare at the time), and now, and the % increase, and compare for all abilities.  Probably should not include OOW, since it's not done.  Something like:<br />
Healing Kunark    Now<br />
 - Shaman    100    200<br />
 - Druid        100    500<br />
 - Cleric       300    1000<br />
<br />
 Heal over time<br />
Shm, Clr, Druid, etc...<br />
<br />
DoT<br />
Shm, Dru, Nec, etc....<br />
<br />
DD's<br />
Shm, Clr, Dru - not sure if its worth listing all classes here or not<br />
<br />
Slow<br />
Shm, Enc, Bst, etc...<br />
<br />
You get the drift.  I don't have time to do it today, but maybe tomorrow night if noone jumps at it first.  I think it would really prove a big point, and SOE seems to like numbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Looks like a decent list. I'd definitely be happier if everything on that list came to pass, however we all know it won't. I agree with purdy that the first step is identifying the problems and agreeing with them with sony, then working on the solutions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i have something to add, maybe its silly, maybe its not something to be looked into atm with all the heal/ dot agro/ lousy buff spells/ and all else that is &quot;wrong&quot; with shaman.. belive me i agree on all of it. i put wrong in quotes simple because i think wrong or broken is not the correct wording.... here nor there. let me get to my point.<br />
<br />
where in the name of ALL THAT IS HOLY is an upgraded INVIS spell??? we are the only class that gets invis that DOESNT get an improved invis.. and i for one am getting really pissed about getting hammered running thru areas that require invis only to have it fail in the middle of 14 mobs (barundi run anyone?)<br />
<br />
i for one, /feedback that we need an improved invis every time i log in and usually if im on for more than a few hours i try to /feedback it as much as i can...<br />
<br />
maybe if i start /bug &quot;shaman invis is broken theres no upgrade to it&quot;  they will start looking at it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Looks great, Murtak. Thanks for organizing the information!!<br />

My only tiny suggestion would be a reduction in nuke cast times.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">So what do people think about the Spirit Shifting reuse timer? Am I the only one thinking 10 minutes is too long, considering how Divine Arbitration has a 3 minute reuse. <br />
I am excited like a little boy over this ability, because it will bring the feeling of making a difference when used at the right time. <br />
I know nothing is set in stone yet and the chances to get this ability aren't great with SoE not grasping our issues, but I feel that this ability can go from &quot;I ****ing own&quot;(something that I used to feel a lot pre-PoP) to being a little more than a toy depending of the reuse timer.<br />
<br />
When I read the VP description a few weeks before the beta(LDoN), I knew it would be a game changing ability(not overpowering in any way), just as I know this will beat the **** out of Can V once people realize how to use it best.<br />
<br />
Anyway, any thoughts about the reuse?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">* Add a Spirit Shifting AA in three levels (4/4/4 points at levels 61/63/65).

<br />
I think 10 minutes is a long reuse on this.  Giac may be right that reuse should be 3 minutes, same as cleric.  If that ruffles too many cleric feathers, I'd propose 4 minutes.  As I figure it, 40% x 6700 (non-uber me with raid buffs) = 2680 emergency heal.  Being able to cast that once every 3 or 4 minutes would add a lot of utility to my role as back up healer, without destroying anybody's game balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">where in the name of ALL THAT IS HOLY is an upgraded INVIS spell??? we are the only class that gets invis that DOESNT get an improved invis..We get to make that LDoN potion that has the effect &quot;improved invisibility&quot; listed  on it:  but in fact it isn't improved, it has the same random duration on it that our spell does.  <br />
<br />
So both our spell and our potion are locked into random duration, instead of having the same improved ability that everyone else gets.  And the insult is that the potion lies about it, and claims to be improved invisibility when it actually is not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Looks good, Murtak,<br />
<br />
Though I still maintain that Healing should be smoothed out across the board, and not just at the &quot;very best&quot; level, since that's less of &quot;balancing&quot; and more like &quot;item upgrade&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Sounds good, just on thing...<br />

* Increase Velium Strike to do 1300 damage. Up the mana cost to 430.<br />
<br />
<br />
No doubt we'd all love to see the damage upgraded but I think most of us are more concerned with the ridiculous casting times on our cold based nukes. <br />
<br />
Personally I'd love to see both the dmg increased by a bit and the casting time lowered but if I had a choice I'd prefer the casting time to be more reasonable.</div></div><hr />

I am not even considering it because its not gonna happen, honestly. I just do not see SOE giving us that ability. If they do, the re-use SHOULD be long, but I would rather get an MGBable raid usable regen than that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I am not even considering it because its not gonna happen, honestly.

<br />
Are you that convinced that SOE is so utterly against shaman having any kind of emergency heal that there is no point in us even considering what kind of emergency heal might be persuasive?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I do think we very much need reduced casting time on our nukes.  In GoD, I'm often literally contributing less by nuking than by doing nothing at all, since the damage is trivial and it just means I have to slow down somewhere to canni the mana back.  Perhaps if I could cast quicker I could get to canni'ing quicker afterward, and at least not effectively contribute less by nuking than by not nuking at all?<br />
<br />
This would help a bit for non-uber shamans too.  In general, I think your list concentrates a lot on top shamans rather than the shamans who are not in top content, but are getting displaced by beastlords and enchanters regularly in lower level groups.  That makes them just as broken as the rest of us and just as deserving of a fix.<br />
<br />
For these people, the items you have classed as minor could be somewhat helpful, maybe even central.  Lower resist rates, less DOT aggro, etc.  I think they might be more important to the class overall than you do.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure I would put the &quot;spirit shifting&quot; AA as critical.  That makes it an all-or-nothing bargainiing point whereas it's really just an interesting notion.  I wouldn't want to give up the whole fight just because we fixate on that one idea.  Not that it's not a good one, but whether we get it or not or whether it's 3 or 10 minutes on the refresh don't seem to me to matter as much as just making work things that aren't so rarely used.  <br />
<br />
I'd rather heal better all the time, and do it without access to rare or even uncommon spells.  Another 100 or 200 hitpoints more of a regular. heal, for instance, means more to me than a spell or an AA that lets me heal 3000 hitpoints every once in a while.<br />
<br />
Same with improved canni.  NO MORE ANCIENT CRAP about our spells.  Or even difficulty whatsoever.  Not while we're this unbalanced.  No more monkeyshines period.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I guarantee, that, if you had the Spirit Shifting AA, you'd change your opinon in a matter of seconds. <br />
An AA like Spirit Shifting would have an overall impact to your game much higher than Cannibalize ever had...as much as people will disagree or shake their heads now reading this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I doubt we can really justify our heal increases sufficently to Sony unless we do something close to what I posted on the Druid boards about the degeneration of slow effciency and couple that with the balance of heals to slows and produce insane amounts of parses.<br />
<br />
There are things that are such minor fixes like Acumen and Group Acumen stacking. Our poison DD being less damge than its level 54 counterpart... We can't even get stuff like that fixed atm.<br />
<br />
The small changes are taking YEARS to be fixed...<br />
<br />
Dialog with them has been very poor on class related issues.<br />
<br />
The first thing that needs fixing I am afraid before any lists like this will receive proper attention is that Sony must open a steady dialog with us and commit to customer satisfaction in a timely manner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I doubt it Giac.  Not if I could use it only every 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
That can work out to a LOT of mobs.  A LOT.  In a LDON or in the elementals while grouped, or in raids.  That ability would come out to practically nothing healed per mob, on average, in a raid considering how fast mobs die then.<br />
<br />
Besides, what happens if a big heal landed just as yours landed too?  It would be your one shot every 10 minutes and it would just have been lost.  Completely wasted.  And now it's 20 minutes before this &quot;fix&quot; to our healing has a chance to matter again...a little.<br />
<br />
I'd much rather have a consistent boost to healing than something tricky.  I want to heal better all the time, not once every dozen mobs in a group or even less in a raid.<br />
<br />
Spending AA to get a nice toy every once in a while would be fine, but it shouldn't be a major bargaining point.  I'd hate to lose out on our ability to compromise with other classes just because we become enamored of a toy that will work every 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
Besides, I can think of problems with that AA.  You often need heals most desperately when things are unslowed.  Now when somebody gets a big heal like that, what will it do to aggro?  Throw it off who you want it to be on?  Maybe not only stealing it from your tank but winding up in the shaman suddenly getting killed because he both got healing aggro and had his hitpoints shoot down, compounding the problem?<br />
<br />
Give me good heals instead.  I really don't want to get hung up on how good the AA thingy is or whether anybody considers it a toy or not.  I don't want to get hung up on it at all.  I want us to concentrate on the real thing, which is regular heals you use all the time.<br />
<br />
Or other things, like shortened casting times for our DD's.  <br />
<br />
Just other more important things.  I wouldn't turn down a freebie, but I wouldn't exaggerate its value either, or make it a significant bargaining point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">As I said earlier<br />
<br />
...but I feel that this ability can go from &quot;I ****ing own&quot;(something that I used to feel a lot pre-PoP) to being a little more than a toy depending on the reuse timer.<br />
<br />
So yeah, I agree there. Divine Arbitration has a 3 minute reuse and Spirit Shifting should too. No healing upgrade would give me the possibility to handle an emergency situation, though. This AA would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Class Balance is not decided in the form of AAs.<br />
Sticking that in bold I do not understand at all.<br />
AAs can enchance a class, of course, but it isn't what makes a class good or not.<br />
Clerics with or without that AA are still easily the best healers.<br />
The AA is like candy sprinkles on top of an already great tasting chocolate sundae.<br />
You don't go to the ice cream stand and say &quot;I'll take whatever you have that has sprinkles on it&quot;.<br />
Our candy sprinkles is c5.<br />
In a big fight where I'm dumping lots of mana, my mana pool is effectively X+2000 if it's a 3 minute fight, where X is the normal size of my mana pool, and the mana pool size is effectively 1k larger for every 3 minutes the fight goes longer.<br />
This is our AA bonus we already have.<br />
<br />
<br />
That AA you mention is not an absolutely critical item for shaman.<br />
Critical issues are things that make us suck.<br />
Not having a made up ability that doesn't exist in the game isn't what's holding us back.<br />
If our other details are fixed, we won't need it.<br />
If slow has less resist, we don't go into the tnarg chain healing mode due to resists.<br />
If heals heal more, we don't go into tnarg chain healing mode because our heals suck.<br />
If canni isn't ancient, then every shaman will have the ability to heal and wince back mana in a timely fashion.  (heal heal heal heal wince taking roughly 4 ticks, as opposed to heal heal heal heal wince wince wince wince taking roughly 7-8 ticks).<br />
<br />
Shaman main issues are (in order of importance IMO):<br />
1.  poor heals<br />
2.  no time to canni<br />
3.  dot aggro<br />
4.  useless stat buffs<br />
5.  insignificant pet<br />
6.  bad nukes<br />
7.  other stuff<br />
Concentrate on fixing what's making us hurt.</div></div><hr />

I do agree with Hyena that just focusing on &quot;top level&quot; is unfortunate; as JuuJuu  points out  an AA is not of itself balancing, but it would be nice.<br />
<br />
Advantage: its a solid proposal that would help in many places we need it;<br />
Disadvantage: its a well defined proposal; thus easily dissed and attacked by the other classes that can't seem to agree on much.<br />

<br />
Are you that convinced that SOE is so utterly against shaman having any kind of emergency heal that there is no point in us even considering what kind of emergency heal might be persuasive?<br />
Saddly, yes I am. I think SOE will give us shiney new toys, I dont think this is one of them. <br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
There is SOMETHING to be said about asking for TOO much, expecting TOO much, and being disaappointed when it doesnt happen. The ideas are great, don't get me wrong. But I would rather focus my effort toward something that is FAR more likely to be considered, that is an MGBable regen similar to the one our HYBRID CLASS has. I just do not see a 10 minute div-arb type spell even making the list of considerations, personally. <br />
<br />
Of course, remember one thing. I am not of the &quot;Shaman as Primary Healers in Cutting Edge, End Game Content&quot; school. I want raid stackability (MGB regen like Paragon and SotW), more DPS for group desirability, and a better heal as a secondary healer in prime content, because we are MORE than adequate in lower level content now. The game is whacked, balance wise. Its just not ever gonna be &quot;perfect&quot;. 1800-2000 base heal, 1000-1200 fast nuke, MGBable Paragon, and I am one happy troll. Even 2 out of 3 would give me wood, honestly.</div></div><hr />

An AA like Spirit Shifting would have an overall impact to your game much higher than Cannibalize ever had...as much as people will disagree or shake their heads now reading this.<br />
I agree 100%. Giving Shaman this ability would be game-altering to such a large degree that I HIGHLY DOUBT SOE will even put it on the table. Honestly guys, lets focus on stuff that POSSIBLE. <br />
<br />
Paragon.<br />
<br />
Cept better, cause I am the PARENT and BLs are the HYBRID. Either that, or give Rangers a better version of Spirit of the Wood than Druids have, /snicker</div></div><hr />

You won't get Paragon, though. At least Spirit Shifting is part of a fix(the other being a better resist mod for Balance). Shamans have to Slow, Slows are resisted and the mobs DPS is going up every expansion, we need something to keep our tank alive in the first 10 seconds in case of a resist or add.<br />
<br />
I agree that Shamans should have got Paragon over Beastlords, but SoE won't accept the hybrid argument. SoE has been creating class specific abilities for hybrids to set them apart from their parent class.<br />
<br />
Oh well, we shall see, I guess. I honestly don't understand the hype about those group HoTs to MGB. The impact is so little anymore and you usually have so many clerics to do it(you sure as heck won't get a better one than the Cleric's, which is only 300/tick anyway). The biggest thing imo is the instant cast time, that can save your own butt, sometimes</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Diclaimer:  I do not play a Druid or a Cleric.  If any of the below spells are wrong for them, please let me know and I can update them.  My sources were Lucy (for current) and EQCR (for Kunark - it's the only place I could find that listed era on spells).  Especially of note is Nature's Touch, which is listed as Kunark era, but heals more than the top Cleric (non-CH) heal of the time.  Is this correct or just more bad info on EQCR?<br />
Class balance is a delicate issue and one that takes some time to hammer out.  Shaman were a very powerful (and fun!) class during Kunark (though personally I think we should have been baseline and everyone else of an equal level).  It is likely some of our abilities were perfectly fine being tuned down over the years, but with the advent of slow mitigation, they really need to be looked at for current content.<br />
<br />
Shaman have received less upgrades to every single one of their spell lines then all other classes got to their comparable spell lines for every expansion since Kunark.<br />
<br />
If we wish to claim this, I believe we need to back it up with solid numbers.  Keep in mind, a lot of the SOE devs have actually been working there for less time than we've been playing the game.  I doubt they keep a running graph of relative class power over the history of the game.<br />

Obviously this isn't perfect.  Once past 55, most druids and shaman used chloroblast because of the faster casting time, even if it healed less.  There are also issues of mana efficiency in some of these spells where they would not be much used.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Ok got some more time :)<br />
<br />
This is just &quot;fixes&quot; to existing stuff not asking for new stuff.<br />
<br />
First the little tiny trivial stuff... (some of it already mentioned)<br />
Acumen and Group Acumen do not mutally overwrite.<br />
Unfailing Reverence and Talisman of the Serpent should switch levels and have the same effect.<br />
One for the Clerics AoZ and that whole line should stack with focus.<br />
In turn VoB should stack with everything and the whole line should change to this.<br />
The recast timer on Cheeta needs to be removed.<br />
The recast timer on VoB needs to be removed.<br />
No other classes self buff has a recast like that.<br />
FoS and Fo7 do not have the same str/dex and should.<br />
Casting times on our new cold spell are not in balance with casting time on our previous cold spells. Ice Strike our 54 cold nuke is 7 second cast.<br />
<br />
The semi-important stuff:<br />
Group haste is a less % than the single target haste.<br />
<br />
A minor buff rant:<br />
At 60 we combined Focus with our str and dex lines and Shaman everwhere rejoiced about less buffs to cast and it taking up less buff slots.<br />
This progression imho should have continued.<br />
What we got instead was Diaku going backward.<br />
What I would propose would be remove single and group Diaku.<br />
Up the str/dex on focus.<br />
THEN removed single and group Agi and add them to Focus.<br />
Now to replace those 4 spells we can actually get something else in their place. I would suggest we get increases in other &quot;forgotten&quot; spell lines. A VoB upgrade, A Bear Form upgrade, a group Avatar, and Ferine Avatar Dropping in level to be replaced at 65 with Group FA.<br />
If they didnt want to give use a group FA shoot there is lot more forgotten spell lines. How about a Tigir upgrade? A 4 Target Malos?<br />
Or shoot how about simply improved invis. Improved Shrew?<br />
Lots to fill in there on forgotten lines.<br />
<br />
I would even suggest that would could move our Cha line into Focus at this point since we got no PoP upgrade to that and don't want one...<br />
That would make Focus a bit more desirable for Chanters and Bards along with Druids and Cleric. Classes that charm and pacify.<br />
<br />
Now what to do with Focus in OoW?<br />
Move our Sta line into Focus.<br />
That will free a ton of buff slots and leaves us a TON of room for other spell lines like a 5% avoidance buff like they are thinking and guess what we dont lose our agi stat cause its built into Focus now.<br />
Would leave room for a group Q if they wanted to help our healing etc...<br />
<br />
The end result of that wold be more free buff slots. People still get their stats and Shaman are free of the useless stat syndrome that plagues us now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
This unfortunately is highly flawed, because you aren't factoring in the cast time for the spells. Paladin now have two lines of heals, the ultra fast, smaller 1 second one and the 5 second bigger one. HPS is all that should matter here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Jaruden:<br />
Paladin heals - as has already been pointed out paladins have switched from their shared cleric heal line to their own fast cast heals, thus are no longer comparable.<br />
<br />
HoTs - Celestial Cleansing is a Velious spell.<br />
<br />
DoTs - Bane of Nife should not be compared to Bane but to Blood of Saryrn. Necromancer DoTs have changed a lot. The best one to list would probably be the Boil Blood line.<br />

Really great job overall though.  Much easier to work with ideas that way than in descriptive prose.<br />
<br />
I do agree with the remarks about casting times being relevant.  I think our slow casting times across pretty much our entire spell line need completely to be redone.  We are not in slow content anymore, and they were VERY slow even when we were.<br />
<br />
Also, it's true that bane of nife should be compared to blood of saryrn.  That's the direct upgrade, and further, it's not a spell you have to go to LDON for.<br />
<br />
P.S. -- don't clerics get extra healing benefit to the same spell?  I thought they healed more for any spell than we did or anybody else did.  <br />
<br />
Don't remember if it was a higher specialization or whatever...but I seem to remember this used to be common knowledge in the game.</div></div><hr />

I think the 5% healing bonus for all cleric heals still exists, though the 10% penalty for all other healers is gone.</div></div><hr />

Most of it still applies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Removed paladins altogether with the notes on their healing.  Added HPS, but it really shouldn't make much difference because all the compared spells have the same cast time.<br />
<br />
I don't know what to do about DoT spells.  I thought about leaving them off altogether, because they're just so hard to calculate.  Right now, it's the best single DPS (total dmg / total time) for any DoT at that period.  However, that doesn't really show anything useful, because shaman (if fighting something that you have time to dot) usually will use Bane and Blood of Saryrn, while necros generally have 3-4 dot's that they might use.  If anyone has any ideas, I'll be glad to try it, but I'm just having trouble coming up with a meaningful way of showing that kind of info without making all sorts of absurd assumptions (like assuming 4 dots can be laid simultaneously or something like that).  I don't want this to turn into a Thott graph =)</div></div><hr />
