<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For like a year they have said they would rework the top 10 of all classes. For nearly 7 months those lists have been on the developers desks and they are untouched. But of course they say &quot;Under evaluation&quot;, &quot;Currently being considered&quot;, and what not, but they have had the same status for 5 to 6 months. Thats a hose job, they can put out a complete expansion in that time. They are not interested in your comments nor anyone elses comments and issues with their classes. Give it up already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What the heck are you talking about?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What the heck are you talking about?<br />
<br />
I'm guessing he's talking about the Nadox guy for Epic 1.5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh...<br />
<br />
Yes, I believe that SOE will address the concerns with the bugged Nadox spawn for epic 1.5. <br />
<br />
The quest designer for the shaman 1.5 epic quest has responded to me twice directly - once on the guild summit forums and once via email. I met this person in real life during the guild summit and exchanged a few pleasant PMs with her on this board. I trust that she will fix the problem.<br />
<br />
In her email earlier today she said:<br />
<br />
&quot;Naturally, the intent was to prevent bottlenecks&quot; and she outlined a plan for looking into the issue.<br />
<br />
It's her quest, she designed it to work a certain way and it's currently not working that way on all servers.<br />
<br />
If she had responded &quot;No, sorry Nadox is only a 3 day spawn, that is the intention&quot; and I were trying to change her mind, I wouldn't feel this optimistic. But instead she said &quot;Nadox is supposed to spawn when a shaman is at that point of the epic quest, if he's not doing it on all servers, I need to investigate.&quot;<br />
<br />
She is being responsive, she agrees there is a problem, she says she is going to investigate further tomorrow, why shouldn't I believe her?</div></div><hr />

Here's my original update on the summit:<br />

http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=21804&amp;highlight=summit<br />
<br />
From just my roundtable, the following player suggestions have been implemented already:<br />
<br />
* Improved corpse drag <br />
* Improved raid features (organization of the raid)<br />
* Re-using augments<br />
* Sounds (player voices)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Furthermore, unless I am out of the loop, Gloriana is NOT the Class Representative, which is where such inquiries SHOULD Be directed.<br />
<br />
I am quite sure Glori is busier than a one legged man in a butt kicking contest, what with conspiring with the 'Evil Empire' to take over the (known) cyber-world, serving as a Moderator to the collection of whacky kids on this web site and cheering till her throat goes hoarse for NC State University. (# 25 in the coaches poll - # 1 in your heart)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I believe we are currently class representative-free. While Sudedor was class representative, I made an effort to stay out of his way let him gather feedback and communicate with SOE (I wasn't 100% successful, but I did try!). I didn't want to step on his toes too much (too many cooks and all that).<br />
<br />
Since Sudedor did step down last week, I was happy to tackle the bugged Nadox spawn issue. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ah...well, they asked for feedback and I linked our thread to their original request thread. I honestly don't know if they will use any of our suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">From the old list:<br />
<br />
1.  Fix Shaman healing! We need larger, more efficient single target blast heals to deal with GoD mobs as well as group heals (perhaps group HoT is more in line with our class) to help in raid situations (MGB Option would be very helpful).  [currently being evaluated]<br />
<br />
We get a new direct heal and a new HoT in OoW.  We also get 2 group heals: Ancestral Aid and epic click.<br />
<br />
2.  Improve shaman DPS and burst DPS.  [currently being evaluated]<br />
<br />
Two new nukes in OoW, but they really don't solve burst dps.  We also get an AA to increase crit nuke damage.<br />
<br />
3.  AE Malos or lose the insane recast delay on Malos. [new item]<br />
<br />
Nothing done here yet.<br />
<br />
4.  Make FA less of a hassle, 25 minute duration, 5 second recast.  [new item]<br />
<br />
We got Champion, a targetable group avatar.<br />
<br />
5.  An upgrade or addition to Cannibalization, allowing (at the same ratio), greater or more frequent conversions of HP to Mana. [currently being evaluated]<br />
<br />
Pained Memory.<br />
<br />
6.  Add direct combat effects to all of our level 60+ stat buffs. [new item]<br />
<br />
Spirit of Might: +5% damage modifier<br />
Spirit of Sense: Avoidance +7<br />
Champion: +10% damage modifier<br />
<br />
7.  Reduce DoT aggro!  [new item]<br />
<br />
Nothing done.<br />
<br />
8.  Endurance regen buff.  [currently being evaluated]<br />
<br />
Removed endurance regen from Ancestral Aid, but they gave melees an endurance regen AA.<br />
<br />
9.  Reduce the cost of alchemy components.  [currently being evaluated]<br />
<br />
Nothing done about this, but they made alchemy an important part in making new, attuneable augmentations.<br />
<br />
10.  MGB Shrink.  [currently being evaluated]<br />
<br />
Nothing done.<br />
<br />

They have been addressing our comments and I have no reason to believe they will stop implementing reasonable requests as we give them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I haven't had any involvement with that list. Both the guild summit meeting and the request for game improvement are not class definition/class improvement oriented.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Seen in that light, they did adress quite a few shaman concerns wether you agree with the choice of changes or not.<br />
<br />
Gloriana seems like a natural for new class representative Imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>redribbit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well the changes they made are well and good but you shouldn't need to be 66+ for some of those abilities.... god knows it's hard enough to level through the 50s let alone some of the time suckage that lvl 65+ brings to the table. <br />
<br />
AOE Malos is a huge deal and needs to be addressed heavily for mana efficience alone. In a raid it's almost impossible to malos everything in sight and even when you do there is no mana left to do anything else. (we are lucky enough not to get agro from Malos which is unresistable). <br />
<br />
and yes alchemy is obsurdly expensive. I realize that gate potions are a (prized item for melee) but 250-300pp each.......? yikes and this is but one of the many of them that has a crazy price on it.... illusion potions are also a bit heavy in cost for what they do, resale doesn't help much either LOL. <br />
<br />
A set duration invis should be much earlier in the game btw, LOL, considering some of the areas we end up walking through lately<br />
<br />
Either way it's not unreasonable for them to make these changes, especially with all the new competition they are getting. Even I am tempted to go to say... Lineage 2 to check it out. Keep it up Glor or whomever and i'm sure we will see results at one point even if it seems mundane to others.</div></div><hr />

It would only come in handy when you use AE killing techniques or during raids where many unmezzable adds come, using it during clearing would be wasteful.  Trash mobs during clearing die in less than 10 seconds, they don't even need to be slowed unless they're unmezzable.  You're better off nuking during clearing than slowing mobs.  I never use Malos during clearing anymore, because it's not worth it.  Enchanters can mez mobs and tash them, then I'll slow the mobs waiting to be killed.  There are only a few mobs where we raid that are highly MR and require malos to be slowed.  Turgur's or Balance will land the first or second cast in most cases.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So we need to buy an expansion to get the heal,where mobs hit harder yet our % vs druids and clerics is down.<br />
Epic click...Do me a favour this is an Epic ffs shouldnt NEED to get your epic to balance you it should be something that takes you up and above non epiced shaman.<br />

How does your answer have anything to do with the wish ?.Oh slightly less of a hassle but only slightly.<br />
<br />

Yep thats 1 thing we asked for.<br />
<br />
Removed endurance regen from Ancestral Aid, but they gave melees an endurance regen AA.<br />
<br />
Thats kind of like saying we asked for a better canni so they gave Ench a better manna regen buff instead.<br />

I was thinking more along the lines of single group fights or final fights where it requires more crowd control without a chanter present. i.e. PoJ trials, some Epic 1.5 fights, ring events, etc. Sometimes there just aren't any enchanters around and impatience prevails. Though I see why you thought what you did from my original post.</div></div><hr />

lol so true</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">*shrug* I used them as examples because people asked for them to be changed and SOE changed them. I also limited my search to the round table meeting I personally attended (can verify players asked for changed). <br />
<br />
Except for the sound thing, the other changes are very welcome. You aren't loving /consent raid or the fact the raid leader can now pop a wizard/mage together in 2 seconds for a COH? I also benefited from reselleable LDON, I had bought a pair of everfrost pants and BA 4 aug right before looting elemental pants and a symbol of the planesmaster. I was able to sell em back and buy some needed 40 hitpoint augs.<br />
<br />
I stand by my selection of these changes, sometimes it's the little changes which makes gameplay more enjoyable. These changes also illustrate why I *do* believe SOE is listening, they already have.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Figuring Brenlo made a few appearences over on the Rangers Glade, asked rangers to list what they had for issues, and then said that rangers will get some minor adjustments but no major fixes, I doubt that shaman will get anything.<br />
<br />
Rangers have a problem in that they were once a outdoor puller.  This is no longer true in many higher OoW zones.  You see, we had the Harmony line of spells (a outdoor Lull), and they worked fine for 5 years.  Well, Bards, Clerics, Chanters, Monks, and Druids got a upgrade in there Lull to work to level 70 yet giving a outdoor lull of lvl70 mobs to Rangers woulf be too imbalancing.  Additionally, for us to get something would require us to give up something.  It doesnt matter that monks got lull as a freebie.  Or that most of our utility has been farmed out to other classes making benefit to a group worthless.<br />
<br />
After that, I have ZERO belief that devs will address issues of the classes that need it (Rangers, Shaman, and Mages).</div></div><hr />
