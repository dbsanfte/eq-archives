<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>FenrisBound</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've never been to this zone, and I was just wondering if it were possible to solo at 44. For the last two lvls I’ve been hitting the RM and DL, the exp in DL is lagging, and RM is so over camped its not even funny. Any other advice would be appreciated.  :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dsalcedo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you are wanting a decent spot for XP as well as loot I would suggest Echo Caverns.  The XP is pretty decent and the loot isn't bad either.  I usually 2 box in here with my monk, but you can solo pull the underbulks and tank em easy.  The plus side is that they are rather low MR so pretty easy to land slow on too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>FenrisBound</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ya, I tryed EC. EC is always camped on my server, its not even worth trying to get a spot. But thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Boraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think you could solo flowers and lightcrawlers.   I'd stay away from cheetas and revenants.  <br />
<br />
At this leve every was blue to my monk, I was buffing him up with 60 shaman spells so its hard to say exactly how hard each mob was but the flowers and crawlers where definitley easiest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>galendar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've been doing this for the last few days.  It's not easy but doable.  The sunflowers and lightcrawler are what you need to stick to.  The major problem is that the level range for these mobs is HUGE!  some are rediculously easy while<br />
others eat me and my pet for lunch.  Just stay by the zone line and zone early.<br />
