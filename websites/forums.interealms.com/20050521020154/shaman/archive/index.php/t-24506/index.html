<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I would like some fresh community feedback on the state of our healing ability in current Everquest . Content level regardless . If you are a level 22 shaman in PC or a uber shaman in some highend zone I dont have acess to I am still interested in your opinions .<br />
<br />
Can you fill a reasonable role as a &quot;back up healer&quot; ?<br />
Can you fill a role as a &quot;Main healer&quot; ?<br />
<br />
For my part I am a 70 shaman , Elemental geared , almost all healing AA's . I do NOT have dalduas or the OOW heal quite yet . I still use Quiessence and Tnarg's .<br />
My &quot;primary hunting grounds&quot; are WoS , PoFire and Proving grounds .<br />
In WoS I find I can backup heal VERY adiquately easily and I can even Main heal quite well .<br />
In PoFire I find I can do a fine job backup healing and if the Cleric LD's im good to Main heal for short stints of time or longer if pulls are slow .<br />
In MPG's I find I can keep up backup heals well enough , however I cant quite cut it as a Main healer . I can keep the tank up ok vs one mob like if the cleric LD's mid pull or something but thats about it .<br />
<br />
Im looking to gather feedback on this Issue . So if you have time please list the areas you commonly hunt and how well you feel you serve as &quot;Backup&quot; or &quot;Main&quot; healer in those zones .<br />
Also give me a general idea on your Level/AA/Gear level .<br />
<br />
Thank you to all who contribute . Remember , Im interested in hearing from everyone level/AA/gear regardless .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm 69, have 180ish aa's, FT11 and pretty much preelmental level gear in all slots but 2 (epic 1.5 and mask). <br />
<br />
I have 2 levels of crit heals and marr's gift. I have Q and just recently got the omens heal. I have 35% spell haste on heals with cleric haste. <br />
<br />
I spend almost all of my non raiding time in ruined city of dranik. I can backup heal here ok, but there is no way I could main heal with my shaman. The 66/67 mobs usually take a supernal elixer and 2 cheals, the elites generally an elixer and 3-4 cheals with the cleric. I could do it for a mob or two if cleric died or something, but would not be able to for any time. <br />
<br />
I can fill in ok or toss a decent spam if needed here as I usually do on named mobs. I have healed a SK in tipt while cleric was down for a few mobs. It was taxing but possible with bard slowing on pull. <br />
<br />
The group heals have been great though and make a huge difference in my playstyle. That was a great improvement. <br />
<br />
The major issues I have with being an only healer now is a single slow bounce = wipe or at least a few deaths if I'm only healer and slower. Against an unslowed mob I cannot heal more then it is inflicting on the tank or myself. <br />
<br />
On raids I do spam heals on fights like general reparm, its really disappointing to not even heal a red bubble on an elemental tank with the new heal. I feel like I make much more of a contribution doing dps then heals, but whatever is needed I do.<br />
<br />
Other then raiding I'm fairly happy with my healing abilities though. All heals could use a bump of 25% due to minimum of 25% slow mitigation on all new mobs. I hate being healer with my shaman, but need to do it occasionally and would like to feel like I'm doing more then filling a bucket with an eyedropper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The problem with trying to evaluate healing is it's also very dependant on the tank your healing. This is especially true for a shaman. We are most effective at healing with our Heal over time spells. They are much more mana efficient than our heals to start off with and just get even better with aa's and focuses. I find that pretty much anything where I can primarly heal with hots is very easy for me to heal. Anything where that doesn't keep up things get much harder quickly.<br />
<br />
Personally I'm time/ikkinz geared and have about 500 aa's with the first levels of OoW regular healing aa's and second level of HoT crits right now. Haven't done much MPG and have only raided in walls but doing a level 70 dranik instance I can easily be slower and main healer. I'd say anything elemental or earlier I could easily heal also and I'd expect I can heal an Ldon hard.<br />
<br />
That is all taken in context of the &quot;weak&quot; tanks I group with now are typically 10K+ hps and 2k+ ac and my usual tank is 13k hps+ and ~2600ac with 15% shielding and 20 or so avoidance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I can't improve my healing abilities currently, as I have SS, YM and the highend GoD foci, which are currently on par with the best ones I have seen in Omens, so my opinion should probably reflect what the state of Shaman healing is like at one side of the spectrum.<br />
<br />
The high-high end Shaman can currently heal adequately in any non-raiding environment. I can main heal in any exp group, no matter in which zone for several hours.<br />
<br />
That said, when you pass this along to a Dev, it should be mentioned that there are 3 fundamental issues with Shaman healing:<br />
<br />
1)<br />
In order to be up to the tasks mentioned above, Slow needs to land too early. I say too early, because Shamans lost any durability they once had and are just as vulnerable as a caster anymore. Any other Slowing class will survive longer in a pinch.<br />
<br />
2)<br />
In order to be up to the tasks described above, the Shaman relies on a resistable spell that generates relatively high aggro. The Shaman has no choice here. <br />
He must cast the spell over and over till it lands, disregarding anything else.<br />
<br />
3) The Shaman is highly dependant on his tank. Not only does the Shaman need a high-high end tank with supreme durability in order to perform above mentioned tasks, but he's reliant on the aggro generation of his tank, too. Which, in part, is random and varies with the number of procs early on in the fight.<br />
<br />
Of course I am just looking at the Shaman class here. Everything is relative and even more so in a game like EQ. The gap between Shaman - Druid - Cleric healing widens each expansion and things will never be designed properly, if this issue isn't solved first. In short, the healing ratios need to be reviewed. <br />
The healing utility of a Cleric is incredibly powerful, so that reducing the ratios to 100/95/90 (for HPS) would not hurt the Cleric class. <br />
The Druid would be lacking in the efficiency department in that picture, which should be countered with an upgrade to their CH(95% of the Cleric's). Shamans would never get any form of large CH-type heal forcing them to bridge their fast heals constantly with HoTs.<br />
<br />
That's my picture regarding the unavoidable healing revamp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ghwerig-AO</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shaman healing effectiveness is largely dependant on three things.<br />
<br />
1) The content you are fighting<br />
2) The tank you will be healing<br />
3) The gear, AAs, and spells of the Shaman doing the healing.<br />
<br />
As a very high end Shaman, I can heal high end tanks fairly easily in most challenging environments.  But give me a bazaar geared tank lacking defensive AAs and it starts to become much more difficult.<br />
<br />
I honestly believe that Shaman healing power is about right where it should be.  I also believe that the huge disparity in gear between the high end raiders and your average non raiding players has exasperated this issue.  Given enough time I think we will start to see this gap closed since Omens has quite a bit of nice loot thats relatively easy to obtainable.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, at level 62 I feel like I can heal ok in certain circumstances on what most people would consider trivial content.  I think I could heal in an LDON normal adventure, but I would have to have KEI or I would be seriously slowing down the group by having to stop and get mana back.  This is mostly because of me usually being the slower in those groups and mobs seem to hit for about 350.  <br />
<br />
In PoV fighting Crystalline Golems, I've healed while the cleric or druid was afk and did not have any trouble keeping up with the healing, but I could see it going bad quickly if Slows resisted 1 too many times.  For this reason I am always Malo'ing everything before slows, and that doesn't always guarantee that Turgur's will stick.<br />
<br />
In BoT, I think I could handle healing in the Courtyard if the tank is tough enough, and I had KEI, but one resist of slow and either I or the tank is going down quick.  If there is an add, and we do not have CC, that is pretty much the killer for me, literally.  <br />
<br />
Last night I was in a Hedge event raid, and it made me feel like I didn't deserve to be called a priest.  I couldn't even save our group's cleric once when he got aggro from healing.  For the last 3 or 4 waves, every single time our cleric healed anyone, he got 2 or 3 mobs on him and Tnarg's mending did not budge his hitpoints one bit from the damage he was taking.  I tried slowing mobs to get them off of him the next round, and every single time my slows were resisted.  So the next wave I tried Malo first, then slow, and before I finished casting Turgur's on one mob, he died.  After the raid was over, I was apologizing to him for not being able to save him once, and he said it's ok...I only have 4700 hps and 1300 ac.   To think that I couldn't even heal our cleric to half health with my highest level heal, or even my 10 second heal (that wouldn't have landed before he would have died), made me feel like I should just not bother casting heals ever again :(  <br />
<br />
Oh, and I did try Torporing the cleric right before the last wave hoping that might save him....but I think it just made him die snared :(<br />
<br />
I think all of our heals could use a boost, or we should be given a new percentage heal that is at least better than the level 58 druid percentage heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Early Ep's here - no healing AA and only ornate level focuses.<br />
<br />
I struggle massively to keep a tank up that a cleric with equivalent gear and aa's can breeze through, and a druid only suffers due to their relative inefficiency but still is a better MH'er than I am.<br />
<br />
I can keep a group up in WoS, IF slow doesn't get bounced and we don't get an add with no cc but it is inefficient, risky and ultimately boring because of having to take med breaks where a group with a cleric and a slower just cuts through the mobs like a knife through butter.<br />
<br />
Sure, Shamans with 500+ aa and Time/GoD focus items can MH almost anywhere, I would expect them to because they are then healing like a cleric at my level.<br />
<br />
There should not be such a disparity in healing that I have to attain that level of gear to be able to keep up with a cleric at my level.<br />
<br />
As I've said before - Shamans are penalised in healing becasue we can slow BUT clerics and druids 90%+ of the time have a slower in their group as well as far superior heals - I do not understand this stupid logic. <br />
<br />
I would like to see cleric healing reduced on a per mob basis if that mob has been slowed - that would be fun to watch, and give them a taste of what it has been like for shaman since PoP :p<br />
<br />
I'm not asking for CH, but unless they remove slow mitigation it needs to change from 100/70/47 to 100/80-85/60-70. Slow mitigation hurts shaman massively when it comes to healing but our healing is still stuck in the dark ages.<br />
<br />
If SoE have decided that the shamans role is to be a backup healer then let them tell us - a bloody ranger in my guild can crit a heal for almost as much as my base heal for gods sake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">70, Time - EP equiped, all healing AAs but the OoW Crits (1 level of HoT crit), Marrs gift focus, Spiritual Serenity and Yopps Mending:<br />
<br />
I can main heal with ease in medium content like WoS and Ruined City. I can main heal in MPG but its much more difficult, and I end up working twice as hard as a Druid or Cleric would. I can main heal in Riftseekers, but dont, nor will I ever offer. Just too intensive, unless we pull slowly and that defeats the purpose of being there. <br />
<br />
Speaking for myself, I am content with my ability to heal. I do not WANT to be considered a &quot;main healer&quot; at this point. However, that being said, I wouldnt turn away a 2200 base fast-heal or a 7500 CH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">(This is from the perspective of a level 70 Time/Qvic shaman. I have both Yoppa's Mending and Spiritual Serenity, and all of the healing AAs except for HoT crits. Most of the tanks I group with have tons of AA and similar or better gear than I do.)<br />
<br />
I am very much in agreement with Taraddar and Giac - in considering our ability to heal, the single most important factor is the tank. If the tank has sufficient HP, AC, and AA to allow you a second or third slow attempt, that makes a huge difference. Some tanks are so weak that you can't use HoTs effectively, and this puts shaman in a really bad spot. If you are constantly stuck in a Yoppa chain, you're only one small mistake/bit of bad luck away from a group wipe.<br />
<br />
I think we heal much better in OoW than we did in GoD. The mobs are weaker in general. I am pretty comfortable as MH in MPG, but I have to watch out for damage spikes from the lightning guys (they flurry) or the nocs/kyv (because of procs). There is always the chance of an unlucky chain of events causing a wipe, but there are usually rezzers around so it's not a big deal most of the time. Unlike the GoD named, the OoW named do not seem to be too much more difficult than the regular xp mobs. Any of the named Kyv in Kod'Taz were whirling blenders of destruction - after that, taking on Blind Master Rekamu just isn't so scary. As always, if my heals can do the job against mobs that always mitigate slow to partial effectiveness, a cleric will have absolutely no trouble. <br />
<br />
I don't know that the role of &quot;backup healer&quot; has any real place in OoW. In any group with a cleric, I spend almost no time healing anyone but myself. Even in Riftseekers, the toughest OoW zone I have done so far, we have had no need for a backup healer. Sure, I occasionally save the tank or the cleric with an emergency heal, but my heals are not a particularly high-value ability if I am not the MH in a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Can you fill a reasonable role as a &quot;back up healer&quot; ?<br />
Can you fill a role as a &quot;Main healer&quot; ?<br />
<br />
<br />
First off, I'm 67, with 4 FT, have no healing AA's or focus effects (unless you count SCR1 and 8th Shawl after patch affecting Q), and no GoD or OoW heals.  So maybe some healing AAs/Focus Effects/New Spells would help.  But ...<br />
<br />
I cannot main heal.  Well, that's not true:  I can main heal in HoH or PoV when screwing around with a couple friends, and I can main heal in LDoN normals.  But in any serious content, there is just no chance.  In many places I can fill in for a cleric if they go LD, so long as we have single pulls or a chanter.  But trying to slow, maintain buffs, and heal using our insanely innefficient heals drains my mana way faster than even CannV, CannIV, C3, my 4 FT, and my Drogmor can replenish it, so I can't do it for very long.  And in places where the mobs hit really hard, or if our tank isn't so uber, I can't even main heal for more than a single mob (if the mob hits hard and the tank sucks, then not even for that), because I don't have enough time to slow and tnarg's before the tank is dead, so I just have to chain Tnarg's (with Q thrown in whenever I can fit it).<br />
<br />
IMHO,it just comes down to the spells: clerics get CH (7.5k HP for 400 mana), and druids get CH Lite (4.68k for 600 mana), but we get &quot;this doesn't deserve to be called a CH&quot; (1.95k for 400 mana).  And since 1.95k every 12.25 seconds just doesn't cut it for healing, we have to use Tnarg's/Daluda's/Yoppa's instead, which are even more inefficient.  Even with our great mana regen, we just can't compete because of our massive inefficiency at healing.  And then if slow doesn't land, or we get an add, or there is any other sort of damage spike, we are basically screwed because unlike Clerics we don't have a quick heal.<br />
<br />
Now, backup healing I can do more consistently.  In fact, I generally assume that after landing slow my biggest responsibility is keeping everyone but the tank healed (and even throwing a tnarg's at the tank if the CH gets started too late), and I haven't really had any serious problem meeting this responsibility.  The thing is though, with all the clerics I've grouped with (and many of the druids), backup healing is really not needed, since they know when to start CHs and are capable of keeping everyone at full health without my help.  If a mob starts beating on them my heal is nice, but they (well the clerics at least) have DA/DB to handle that if it's just one mob, and if we have several then my heals aren't going to make a difference anyway.  So it sort of seems like maybe backup healing is something which eases stress on the main healer, but certainly isn't necessary to a group.<br />
<br />
I largely agree with Giac that we need a serious revamp of healing in the game, because with clerics being everyone's first choice for main healer in challenging content, and druids (second-class citizens of healing) being the only real alternative (except for high-high end game shaman like Giac), there really just aren't enough healers to go around IMHO; this explains why you can always find hordes of DPS classes LFG, and usually find both CC and tank classes LFG, but the sticking point most of the time is finding a healer.  So I agree that Druids should be upgraded to near-cleric level healing: what else do they have going for them? They can't rez (before 70, and even then not for exp) and most people prefer V over 9, so their only advantage over clerics is their nukes, which they don't get to use much when they are busy healing, and their DS, which is nice but doesn't add that much more damage (and clerics even get a DS too).<br />
<br />
However, I don't think the solution for shaman is to just to give us cleric healing abilities:<br />
A) We would actually be better healers than clerics if we had their spells, because with Cann we could cast them more often<br />
B) We have slow, and if we could heal as well or even close to as well as clerics and slow at the same time, nobody would want a cleric.<br />
<br />
Now, I won't say that I would be devastated if shaman were actually more desirable than clerics or anything, but realistically SoE will never allow it.  But since there are 2-4 (depending on if you count bards or necros) other classes that can slow, and only 1-2 others that can heal, it really would be nice if we could fill both roles depending on who is and isn't LFG.<br />
<br />
So, here's one thought: what if SoE gave us new heals that were 80%-90% as good as cleric heals, but tacked on a restriction that all of them responded to slows the way every spell responds to Voice of the Berserker.  In other words, if you cast Turgur's, Tigir's, etc. you are then unable to cast any of these new healing spells for 1-2 minutes.  This way, if the group already has another slower but no cleric or druid, you can use your new healing spells to play a main healer role.  But if the group has a cleric/druid and no slower, you can slow and use crappy old heals just as you did before.  No matter what though, you couldn't replace both a chanter and a cleric, because the moment you act like a chanter, you get put in the healing penalty box for a bit and are prevented from acting like a cleric.<br />
<br />
This is just one thought that I found appealing, but I'm sure there are  many other ways SoE could increase the healing abilities of other classes (mainly shaman, since we are the &quot;clerics&quot; of the savage races, and druids, since the game has enough DPS classes already, but I'd even be cool with seeing Necros or Mages given significant healing powers) to the point where making every group does not revolve around finding a cleric, while at the same time not making the existing healer (or healers if you count druids) undesirable.  The only question is, will SoE ever see past their blind love of their golden child (clerics) and recognize that the game would be better off if more classes could heal well, and if they did would they be willing to put some effort in to figuring out how to make it happen?<br />
<br />
P.S.  A lot of pretty high end shaman say they can heal in most challenging content, including planar and OoW exp zones.  I don't doubt them.  But I also don't think this is really relevant for healing balancing, as the power gap between end-game equipment and bazaar gear is so extreme that it in my opinion it equates to at least five exp levels of power, and I don't think anyone would say that because a 65 shaman can heal in Sebilis everything is ok ;)  If you consider the really tough places, where a cleric of that level can heal just fine but a shaman wouldn't stand a chance, I think you'd see the same disparity in healing abilities, or at least close since  the more AAs/effects you throw in to the equation the less unbalanced CH (as CH is not affected by AAs/effects, while all other heals are).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Level 70 Shaman here, with EP arms as a focus, FT 15 or so (keep losing FT to upgrades), no beneficial spellhaste outside of Tribute and all pre-OoW healing AAs maxed, plus one level of Healing boon. If the Cleric dies, I can keep the group going, albeit slowly, in C2/Fire, until the Cleric gets back. It's tedious, and my mana is better spent elsewhere because of the inefficiency of my heals. (The Druid can Nuke, DoT and Heal ... I can slow, heal, heal YAY, CRIT HEAL ... time enough for a nuke or DoT depending on MoB life and go back to healing. I don't even have time to Malos if it's a caster heavy group, thus screwing efficiency further.)<br />
<br />
Honestly, it feels to me like we're being penalized on our heals because we can slow, but that every other healer's ability is balanced against our slow, too ... yet we're the only ones suffering for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Just yesterday in Bloodfields, we were doing that Gargantuan mob, and one of the yellow (I'm 68 atm) Dreamweavers attack a pally guildmate (a very, very well geared pally). I slowed it (mitigated of course) and then started blast healing as fast as I could. Tank when from 80% to dead in about 7 heals.<br />
<br />
&quot;The high-high end Shaman can currently heal adequately in any non-raiding environment. I can main heal in any exp group, no matter in which zone for several hours.&quot;<br />
<br />
The one thing I lack is a good heal focus item. I guess that is the big difference, because I certainly cannot main heal continually in harder content.  <br />
<br />
However, bazaar geared druids and bazaar geared clerics can MH in that content.  I guess we need to decide whats &quot;average&quot; gear, and then decide what level of healing is &quot;average&quot; for that shaman.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I think our blast heal needs to gain ground on the other two priests.  Since slow is nerfed, I see no reason why our ratio to druids and clerics shouldn't change as compensation.</div></div><hr />

Was healing a bazaar geared pally with about 81 AAs, LR 5...roughly 1300 AC (I think) and about 7500 HP buffed. However, he was healing himself the times he noticed it was taking a bit for me to slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Are you sure the cleric didn't Divine Aura/Barrier?

<br />
He may have the first time, but he would have had to remem them after the first death and he wouldn't have been able to use them for a while, much longer than it took for him to die a 2nd, and 3rd, and maybe even 4th time.<br />
<br />
Also, he never actually stopped taking damage, so I have a pretty good feeling he didn't use either of them.  He drew aggro almost immediately after the wave of mobs would spawn, and then he would die in less than 10-15 seconds.  DA lasts for 18 seconds, so there would have been enough time for us to get the mobs under control if he had used it.  As it was, he didn't live long enough for me to get more than 1 mob slowed and off of him.  <br />
<br />
The first time I tried healing him, he was at 60% when I started casting Tnarg's and dropped to 30% before it hit, then his health went to 34% (I outhealed a round of attacks by 4% I'm guessing) and I started casting again.  He died before I finished casting the second time.  After that I tried Slowing mobs to pull them off of him since heals were useless...and while slowing did save other people's lives (mine most likely), it never was able to save the cleric.  Luckily we had 2 other clerics in the other groups who didn't appear to be having such bad luck, so the healing situation never went too far south...but for me it was disheartening.</div></div><hr />

I'm comfortable with my healing output. I'd like a bigger heal, maybe something to the tune of 2k.... with the same efficiency as Yoppa's. That'd still put us 400hp pet heal base behind druids even.

I can main heal in almost any one-group content before GoD that I can get to (with a similarly developed tank and group) pre-GoD/OoW, from Hard LDoN to BoT to HoH. <br />
<br />
I cannot main heal (but can backup heal if needed) in Tactics and unlocked GoD zones.<br />
<br />
My heals don't even appear to slow the rate at which the tank's health bar drops in zones like MPG (where it's have-pity-on-Samanna day when a group of five level 70s needs someone to malos and slow) or in Tipt/Vxed/Sewers.</div></div><hr />

I find that the group make up as well as the MT's gear is a very important factor in my ability.  Like someone pointed out a bazaar geared person will wipe your mana bar fast.  In a high DPS group I could heal a paladin all day in any zone.  <br />
<br />
I think that a unlucky string regardless of your ability could wipe a group easy.  In most situations though it comes down to crit heals, if slow is unresisted, and the gear on the MT.  If all the planets line up shaman healing can be very powerful.  <br />
<br />
If one of those items mentioned above is out of sync, it all goes to hell in a hand basket.  I think this is where things need to be for the simple reason we are not main healers, but versatile.  I think we pick up the slack in most groups.  I would say we should be able to pick up slack if sh!t hits the fan, but not be reliable enough to group heal for a whole party.  <br />
<br />
This adds adventure, the realm of uncertainty, which general equals more fun.  It keeps folks on thier toes.  I think that as shaman we all adapt and overcome.  If we can't mez we root park and how many shaman based a character career or a name for yourself on that ability alone?  <br />
<br />
I think these situations make or break the class and define our role.  I don't want to responsibility of main heals, but think that we should be considered a good back up if things go haywire. <br />

<br />
the nuts: 70, yoppa's, trushar, healing adept 2, healing gift 1, Improved Healing 4 (working somewhat on yoppa's due to scaling, yay!).<br />
<br />
my best friend is an 8k/1500 SK, and i group with him a bit, BUT i also spend a lot of time with 12k+, 2k+ tanks in MPG, KT, etc, so i get to see it from different angles.<br />
<br />
at ANY time when i'm serious about doing something, there's another healer to main heal in the group. i never ever do that job in a real xp situation--ie, when i'm looking to push the pace and blow through mobs. that's not a job i even care to have. in those groups, i'm hitting MT with Trushar on inc (before mob engages) then malos, turgur's, pained memory, bane, blah blah. i use the new poison nuke a lot as well to help dps, and this suits me fine. i'm debuffing, dotting, support healing, maintaining buffs, etc--much more fun that stand heal sit stand heal sit stand heal sit.<br />
<br />
at other times, when i don't want to push it and just feel like kicking back and relaxing, i'll grab my SK buddy and we'll go duo WoS, NC, etc for kicks and i can keep him alive noooo problems whatsoever. <br />
<br />
<br />
to me, this is the ideal. i dont' feel that we need direct heal upgrades whatsoever, and Spiritual Serenity and/or Trushar make us not need HoT upgrades, either. i'd say the state of our healing right now is great, and THANK YOU, DEVS!!! <br />

If you think you are a fine backup healer, because you keep an HoT on the tank, then I must burst your bubble and tell you that you aren't doing anything. Your contribution is negligeable.<br />
<br />
The back up healer role that existed for a short time is gone again. The term was adequate for the Ikkinz trials when they were first beaten. You were a secondary healer, not equal to the Cleric since he was doing 70% of the healing, but still necessary with your 30% healing contribution.<br />
In Omens or anywhere else, once you have a Cleric, there's no need for another healer supporting him. So I don't really understand what &quot;doing fine as back up healer&quot; is supposed to be.<br />
<br />
You are either a Main healer or you are no healer at all. If you can't keep your group alive on your own, your heals are not needed or adequate. If you want to be a &quot;secondary healer&quot; you are basically saying that you do not want to have to heal at all.<br />
The problem with this is, that *if* you are not healing, your contribution is below average compared to any other class that can't heal.<br />

I don't think we disagree. <br />
The crucial point here is that *you* didn't need the Cleric as you most probably could have kept the tank alive by yourself. You weren't a &quot;back up&quot; healer per se, but a main healer who was partially filling the role because the Cleric was (s)lacking(for whatever reason). <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">It's all about the tank and the resists on slow. Various other poster have referenced the problem with having a bazaar geared tank. I want to mention the biggest problem I see, bounced slow even after Malos. I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here, since I don't own Balance of the Nihil (the spell just doesnt want to drop for me, and these days getting a KT group going is nearly impossible, everyone is sticking to those OoW zones). <br />
So if I Malos on incoming, drop a HoT on the MA, cast slow, it gets resisted, then at that point I am basically stuck chain casting Yoppa's until I get a crit heal. If that happens I may get the time to try to slow again. If the same happens with cleric or druid being main healer they can start patch healing (most of the time stepping up CH casts will do it too) and wait for the slower to recast his slow.<br />
Apart from that I think with Yoppa's Mending we got a fine upgrade to blast healing. I don't own the lvl 70 HoT yet, but I suppose that helps too. I still don't feel like main healing, I consider my job to be pulling (if no FD is needed, which is rarely in OoW zones), slowing, patch healing if a nasty named is giving the main healer trouble and applying some damage with Dots (which finally make sense getting casted as mobs live for 1 minute at least).<br />

I'll be honest. SS(Level 70 btw) is an upgrade to Breath of Trushar, but trust me, it's hardly noticable. If I used BoT instead of SS, I would probably not notice it. The difference is 190 HPs/tick, it's marginal.<br />
<br />
I very much agree with what you say in your first paragraph, however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I am 68 with all pre-OoW healing AAs, Anc. Aid level 1, Marr's Gift focus, spell haste (Tnarg's cast in 2.8 secs or so) elemental gear and group mostly with others at or above my level.  I'm using Tnarg's and Q.<br />
<br />
I can main heal in Fire or Earth but it is a huge drain and the pulls are definitely slower than with a cleric or druid around.  I haven't tried in OoW zones yet but assume I could there too.  All of this has a huge caveat:  it works right up until we get a bad pull.  As long as we get singles or have great CC I can do it.  I just don't have the healing ability or the speed to heal when 2 or more mobs are in camp and beating on people.  Two or three mobs in a row that resist slow also bring us to a stop for mana.<br />
<br />
I'm with several of the others and don't really want to be the main healer in a group.  I do want to be a good back up healer.<br />
<br />
For back up healing we have HoTs and emergency heals.  The HoTs seem to be reasonable.  I am looking forward to Serenity and epic 1.5 for emergencies.<br />
<br />
Heals for emergencies are lacking.  Most importantly we need a faster heal than Tnarg's.  Larger is probably needed too but speed is the biggest problem.  Usually I have a group with a cleric or druid healer.  I don't even worry about the MT until he goes below 2 bubs of health which is where the cleric heals normally kick in.  When that happens I know the cleric has fallen asleep or something and I need to do something.  I ususally start casting at 1 bub of health (approx. 2k hps left on MT for a 10k tank).  Mobs at my level will do 2k damage in a single round.  If I'm lucky enough to get a heal off before the MT dies I'm just holding him near death offsetting a round of damage but I  can't recast fast enough to save him for the second round.<br />
<br />
If I'm trying to save the healer or a caster, well, they go down real fast.  They are at half health after the first hit and are usually dead less than 3 secs later.  The time it takes me to cast Tnarg's.<br />
<br />
To be an effective emergency heal it needs to be fast enough initiallly and either large enough or have a fast enough recast to overcome the damage output of usually an unslowed extra mob.  Where I am fighting the spell needs to cast in about 1 second to be effective in an emergency.  Q does not count for emergencies because it can't be used until the MT has regained enough health for me to take time to cast it.</div></div><hr />

Nirtox<br />
<br />
I honestly hope you don't mind me, but I'd like to suggest you considering changing your habbits/playstyle a little.<br />
<br />
I'll just assume you don't own a Time's Antithesis for the following. Malos on incoming and immediately slow, don't HoT your tank inbetween that as you are being less effective than you could by doing so.<br />
<br />
Here's the scenario(Assuming Malos hits the mob the second it is in camp and the unslowed DPS is about 750):<br />
<br />
0s-2.25 spell gems are greyed out<br />
2.25-5.25 BoT(SS)hits the tank(1-6 second before the first tick occurs)<br />
5.25-7.5 spell gems are greyed out<br />
7.5-10 Slow lands(assuming you have any form of detrimental haste that makes you save 0.5 seconds on Turgur's here)<br />
<br />
Even though you started Malos about 4 seconds before the mob hit the camp, your tank will have taken 7500 damage and BoT has healed 630 of it(SS would have healed 820) on average<br />
<br />
Now the scenario adjusting your playstyle to go straight for slowing as I suggest:<br />
<br />
0s - Malos hit<br />
0-2.25 spell gems are greyed out<br />
2.25-4.75 Slow lands<br />
4.75-7.0 spells gems are greyed out<br />
7.0s-10.0 BoT(SS)hits the tank(1-6 seconds before the first tick occurs)<br />
<br />
Even when looking at just 10 seconds of the fight(meaning that the second scenario is not going to benefit from BoT(SS) because the tick will occur at the 13,5s mark) and assuming that Slow would only reduce the mob's damage output by 40% due to mitigation, you can see that in the first scenario the net damage your tank takes is going to be 6870(with BoT) and 6680(with SS), while your tank in the second Scenario will only have taken 5925 damage in the same time frame, and at the same time you have reduced the risk of having him drop due to damage spikes in the first seconds of the fight.<br />
<br />
Give it a shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">If you think you are a fine backup healer, because you keep an HoT on the tank, then I must burst your bubble and tell you that you aren't doing anything. Your contribution is negligeable.<br />
I will respectfully disagree here Giac. The back-up healer role is negligible on the simple, single mob pulls, but the point of the back-up healer is to be there when the shizznit hits the fan. A roamer pops during a pull, tank gets a spike and wipes, Cleric/Druid gets a spike and misses a heal, THOSE are the times when the back-up healer role kicks in. And I am VERY adequate in that role. <br />
<br />
Another function of the back-up healer is to heal the other group members so the main-healer can focus solely on the MA. Lets face it, despite the lower DPS of OoW mobs, they STILL hit hard. Necro gets aggro and cant FD it off fast enough, I am there. Mob turns and slaps the rogue a couple times cause /taunt is borked, I am the man. Cleric/Druid doesnt have to bother switching targets to the person who just got spanked, I can take care of it. It helps. <br />
<br />
The back-up healer role shines much more in multi-mob situations, no question about it, but it still has value in single-pull spots, due to both the screwy nature of the internet and the general layout of certain spawn areas, where a re-pop can occur while puller has another inc, and you NEED that extra person healing until its all locked down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In Group: I can main heal quite comfortably in PoV, BoT(some of the named are tricky but doable), Tactics, SolRo, LDoN(Normal). I've successfully main healed in Dranik's expeditions (named are very tricky). All of this I would consider trivial content though. I cannot main heal a hard LDoN, though I'd consider myself an adequate backup healer there. I cannot main heal GoD trials, and I am not an adequate backup healer there. I believe I could main heal WoS if I had to, I'm a fine backup healer there. Ancestral Aid at level 1 is a nice manna free canni heal. That's about it. At my level/gear most melee still require Diaku to max their str/dex and the stacking issues prevent me from using AA1 as an emergency heal.<br />
<br />
In Raid: My guild's current roster boasts 2 65+ cleric mains and 2 65+ cleric alts, 3 65 + druids and 6 65+ shaman. Our shaman carry our guild's raid healing currently. As such we've made a concerted effort to ensure our healing aa's are up to snuff (and I'm catching up). I'm currently working on MGB and the prospects of being able to MGB Ancestral Aid is very exciting for my guild (assuming I can get the next level soon, or that they fix the damn stacking). 6 Shaman with MGB Ancestral Aid will greatly increase our guild's ability to handle AE mobs. My guild's &quot;leet&quot; tank is sporting 9.2khp and 1600ac at the moment. My AHA2/IH4 Tnarg's still looks like pissing in the ocean to me. That said, I've seen it &quot;save the day&quot;.<br />
<br />
I believe the concerns most people outside of the end game have would be easily address by spell availability. Daluda is now very outclassed for high end folks by Yoppa. Shouldn't it be easier to get than Yoppa? Those couple hundred points of healing power would have kept me out of the Tnarg's chain of death countless times. Slow is what Sony has forced us to hang our hat on. At least make one that is reliable available to us. From what i've read slow bounce is greatly eased with Balance of the Nihil. I've done numerous GoD expeditions and still have yet to walk away with these two spells (damn RNG). The time is right to make these spells more available to the masses.</div></div><hr />

I am ok on back up healing in WoS and hard ldon, I define back up healing as keeping HoT on the tank or anyone else that gets hurt and casting a quick heal if it looks like the tank is going to go down before CH lands. I think if I had the newer spells (even the ones from GoD) and the current AAs that are available I could handle healing easily enough in the areas that I can go to being unflagged like I am.

If you take the time to slow instead of heal, someone is going to die. I am more inclined to agree with Giac but I guess it is kind of situational where you are hunting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My experience in WoS, I can main heal just fine, depending on the group...did a 2 shaman group, one slowing, one healing, worked fine.  Did a group with a bard pulling, had him mez the mob first so I could slow it without having to worry about resists and healing at the same time and that was easy too.  Would I want to join a regular WoS group as main healer without personally knowing the other people in the group?  Nope, no way.  Also in the bard group, we switched tanks part way through, from a warrior who was pre-elemental to an SK from my guild....the warrior was a lot easier to keep on her feet than the SK was, even tho the make-up of the group by the time we had the SK was a lot higher in dps.  Warrior I kept up entirely with BoT, SK needed a lot of Tnarg's to bridge the time it took between ticks of the HoT.<br />
<br />
GoD is still a nightmare tho.  I still get into groups where a named is pulled in KT and the cleric is yelling at me to patch heal while I'm spamming as fast as the spell refreshes.  My guild just won Ikki 4 the other night and has made it to the 2nd trap in Uqua.  We are still flagging people through Tipt and Vxed on a regular basis.  If I'm in a Tipt group, chances are, if I'm the only secondary healer, the named at the end will wipe us.<br />

I'm probably just really unlucky, but if I try to throw a blast heal on a tank cuz it looks like cheal will not land in time, my heal lands after the cheal does *grrr*.  I personally don't mind the size of our heals so  much but would like to see them have a shorter casting time....that would fix a lot of the issues I run into.  My guild leader and I were talking about shaman issues the other night (he plays an enchanter, often boxes clerics and wizards on raids, always turns whatever class he's playing into a puller, and then xp's with the boxed character to make up the xp loss) and his thoughts on shaman healing, which he feels needs a boost as well, is that shaman HoT's should be better than cleric HoTs, making shamans king of the HoT, druids king of the blast heal, clerics able to do all types of healing and therefore king of healing, and pallies kings of the group heal.  I kinda like that idea too, although I also like the idea of cleric HoTs and shaman HoTs stacking.<br />
<br />
And just on a side note, why does it seem like no one remembers the days when druids and shamans had the exact same heals?  I've had a lot of conversations with people saying &quot;if you wanted to heal, why didn't you make a cleric or a druid?&quot; and I'm sitting there thinking that when I made my shaman I could heal exactly as well as a druid. *shrug*  And no, I don't want to be main healer in a group most times, but I also think it's silly to have a group of 5 people (especially if that group has both a shaman and either an enchanter or a beastlord) have to say &quot;Well, we can't find a cleric or a druid, guess we can't go kill anything.  May as well go back to lfg'ing I guess&quot; rather than just going and killing stuff with the shaman healing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can main heal in any exp group, no matter in which zone for several hours.<br />
<br />
If I'm in riftseeker, my mana goes down way to fast to be an efficient main healer in a similarly geared group.  Our peak healing ability has greatly risen with fast casting heals, and good foci.  But at the cost of our mana consumption.  It would be nice to have an upgrade to Knarg for sustained healing over extended periods of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Tolann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">lvl 70, Time and elemental geared, FT is capped (no AA extensions yet), 380AA, All healing AAs pre-OOW, 1 level each of OOW healing AAs, no healing focus gear (other than Eterninostrum that might help on HoTs), and I use Yoppa's and Trushar heals.<br />
<br />
I've always tried to play my shaman as a secondary/backup healer.  I agree that since OOW heals have greatly improved.   I feel that in most single group situations I could maybe act as main healer for periods where the cleric just died on inc, or is afk on a smoke break.   I wouldn't want to be relied on as main healer for hours on end just because I know my heals are not efficient enough to keep a good group pace.  Like trying to fill a leaky bathtub with a shot glass, I say.  One little slip up such as slow is resisted too much and I end up with too much of a mess trying to keep the entire group healed.  In raids, I feel that our heals are not big or fast enough to save make a reliable save.   Too many times I start casting and say please, please, please crit heal!  Generally in raids, I can keep my raid groups alive for the most part while the clerics are busy in the tank heal rotations.  My only rule to any of my groups is no dieing while I'm slowing/debuffing!  Honestly, I'd like to see shamans get a heal that could put us more on list as a reliable 1 group main healer.   I don't think it would have to be a spell practical to have us doing something like raid heal rotations, but I wouldn't mind being able to fearlessly say lets go to rift's, I can main heal and slow without slowing down the pace of the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Level 70, time geared,  400AA's.  All pre-omes heaing AA's and 1 level of each of the omen's healing AA's.  25% healing focus.  <br />
<br />
I fight in Ruined City and MPG mostly.  I can keep a 10K/1750AC tank alive if  the mob is slowed.  If the mob resists slow then the tanks dies and then the group wipes.  To keep a tank alive as a Main Healer vs a slowed mob in Muramite Proving Grounds I need to chain cast Yoppa's while dropping Trushars on the tank when I can.  The mana cost is ruinously high (40% of my mana on each mob), leading to this being an emergency heal situation and not viable in an XP group.  3 mobs before a med break means I am not a 'good' Main Healer.  <br />
<br />
As a backup healer, I am also generally inadequate.  The typical scenario is a a non-melee getting aggro (i.e cloth wearer over-aggros).  <br />
1/3 of the time they die before I can  I can reactivly heal them.  <br />
1/3 of the time tank pulls aggro back using taunt/stun and that saves them.  <br />
1/3 of the time my heal makes a difference, landing in time and healing enought that the next round of attacks does not kill cloth_wearer_001.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Isazo, level 69 shaman, 125 AA, only have level 2 healing AA granting +5% healing.  I am currently using Tnargs and BoT.  Yesterday I got GoD (Kanleku) sleeves with 45% healing focus.  I just returned to EQ six weeks ago after a very long (two year) break.<br />
<br />
Here's what I see:  On a typical tank:<br />
<br />
No bazaar geared low-aa priest can main heal in Riftseekers.<br />
A bazaar geared low-aa cleric can main heal in MPG with difficulty.<br />
A bazaar geared low-aa druid can main heal in WOS with difficulty.<br />
A bazaar geared low-aa shaman can main heal in Nobles with difficulty.<br />
<br />
Now if we improve the quality of the tank dramatically, maybe every priest shifts up a notch on the chain.<br />
<br />
If we improve the 'bazaar gear, low aa' part to Good gear with Focii and near-max aas, we can slide up another notch as main healers.<br />
<br />
So I would argue that with a very good tank and very good gear and near-max healing AAs, shaman can be effective main healers in MPG.<br />
<br />
I know though, that 'MPG' isn't the last zone in the game for XP -- that's likely to be Trials (can't comment on those) and Riftseekers (Hard to imagine main-healing here).  As the expansion ages, people will gravitate to the better areas of MPG and Riftseekers, and only the best of the best shaman (if any) will be effective in that tier as healers.<br />
<br />
The question we have to answer is &quot;Should only the best-of-the-best shaman be adequate healers in level-appropriate content?&quot;  To me the answer to that question is no, and our healing should see a modest bump in power such that your average 250AA mid-level focus effect level 70 shaman can heal a similarly geared tank in MPG.  I do not think that is the case now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I believe our quick heal should be increased to provide 80% of the healing per second of a cleric, and druids should be bumped to 90% CH/quick heal. That would require a boost of about 60% to the hits healed by each of our burst heal spells. I think the mana ratios should stay the same, so that clerics continue to have a substantial healing efficiency advantage over shaman and druids also over shaman.  Also clerics should be given significant upgrades to their soloing ability, so they have more variety in their play style.<br />
<br />
Our slower role will be declining in harder content--we are too fragile there. A beastlord or an enchanter or a bard make better slowers when mobs can single round shaman since they have more options to survive a round of aggro. <br />
<br />
The real issue is that groups should be able to bring either a cleric, druid or a shaman as main healer. Too many dps and tank groups are sitting waiting for a cleric or druid. The disparity between similarly equipped priests is too great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">As a high end shaman with 700+ AA, I wanted to echo what the other high end shamans have been saying.  With SS and Yoppa's, I can easily keep well equipped tanks up in WoS and MPG.  The only thing I wish I had on many occasions was a very fast heal, even if it did a small amount of healing (~900-1000hp).  I always hate seeing a cleric or caster at 5% health as my casting bar drains down to the end only to have the person die 0.2 seconds before heal lands.</div></div><hr />

If you want to make things better for the shaman hurting the most, make Nihils easier to get.</div></div><hr />
