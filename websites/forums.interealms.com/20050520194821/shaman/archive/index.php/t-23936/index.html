<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kabuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone considered handing a bow to their pet?  Since it dies after 1 round of melee even when fully buffed, perhaps we actually have &quot;Ranger&quot; pets.  Maybe we should give them bows and farm some Tolan's armor for them?  All kidding aside, patch day comes and goes with no fix of the 67 pet it's still the same speed bump we've had since PoP.  But they did manage to take care of refunding warrior AA's etc.. <br />
<br />
At least slow is not being mitigated by many mobs in WoS today so that's a positive step.</div></div><hr />

I was actually just thinking, maybe they should add a DD, equal to the amount of HP our pets have at that time, directed at the mob that kills our pets. Then I thought of how other classes might feel left out, so let the rangers get it as an AA. =P<br />

That's great to hear, I think. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ghwerig-AO</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And some mobs in MPG are no longer mitigating either.<br />
<br />
-G</div></div><hr />

<br />
That would be an AWESOME  AA !<br />
<br />
MT drops, healers die, rangers start droppin like flies, doin 8k damage to mob each time one falls.  Start to smile trying to picture how that would be lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sounds like there is some good news and bad news.  I'm glad to hear that fewer mobs are mitigating slow.  I'm sad to hear that they fixed Spiritual Serenity, but didn't bother to fix our pets :(  I am glad to see on lucy that they fixed Vindictive Spirit.  I seem to remember someone on this board saying that the spell would never make it with the -100 resist adjust...looks like it made it!<br />
<br />
In other bad news....a friend of mine said that named mobs appear...well, he hasn't seen any yet :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Woot killing rangers would be an awsome thing (it's only good atm)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">dog dog wont fire a bow :(<br />
<br />
dead rangers would rock though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Too bad theres no gnome rangers... dead gnome rangers nothing funnier! <br />
Kamakazee AA explode on impact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My theory is the 67 pet is supposed to be the same pet as the 61 pet, but it can dual wield naturally!  They just forgot to add in the dual wield part...  <br />
<br />
On a side note, I remember pitting my 61 pet vs the highest level enchanter pet--pre-GOD-- (both unbuffed without any weapons, etc).  Why is it that shaman have a worser pet than a class that can charm a good majority of the NPCs in the game?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I would roll up a ranger just to name him Splode Goboom.</div></div><hr />

I have been out of town the last couple days, so I haven't had much time to read the Crucible, but I had to reply to this when I saw it.<br />
<br />
I admit I was wrong as I was the one saying that the -100 resist check would have never made it live. I am honestly surprised and the spell looks good(the recourse is sorta useless, but that doesn't matter). Depending on how mobs mitigate Slow now, this will be my initial Slow spell(over Nihil) now as the recourse gives me at least some sort of defense when I get aggro and resists should be almost non-existant).<br />
<br />
Ryan definitely designed a nice spell, even though I doubt he intended it to be what it will be. Guess we'll have to wait and see, if the spell will be adjusted in the future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">When I hear people say the recourse is kinda worthless because you will be dead from so many mobs hitting you or whatever, I don't see how it will be useless.<br />
<br />
You don't always have to use this spell against 10 mobs, you can use it against a single mob as well.  You can even use it on an unslowable mob to mitigate the damage it does.  I don't think people are looking at the big picture here.  Either that, or I just am not understanding how the spell works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I consider it worthless because it's capped way too low, nothing else. As I said, this will be my primary slow when I get it, meaning that I will be using it for every pull(yes, singles) and then overwrite it with TA before it wears off.<br />
<br />
With a cap of 1600 it won't do much and I will hardly notice the difference between having it and not. It's better than not having it obviously, but it's not really significant imo.</div></div><hr />
