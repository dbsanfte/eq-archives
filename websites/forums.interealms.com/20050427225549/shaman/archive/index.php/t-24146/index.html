<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sadly my friend's WoW beta account was recently ganked just prior to the warlock patch so this will be my last post before open beta. I had pretty much stopped playing anyways so it's not a big loss. It's only temporary as I suspect open beta will be late this month (Oct) or mid-Nov at the latest.  With that out of the way, here are more random observations:<br />
<br />
Tradeskill change<br />
Players can have only 2 tradeskills (professions) at present.  I understand what they're trying to do (more player interaction, viable player economy) but I see this adding tedium and reducing customization.  My friends and I have already mapped out our tradeskill muling strategy so odds are we still won't rely on buying overpriced tradeskill gear and we'll continue to make everything ourselves. I would go this route even if I had no in game friends as you only need an alt to be L10 to be the equivalent of expert and make great gear.  To get to the highest level in tradeskilling an alt would only need to be L35, which really isn't bad.<br />
<br />
If I'm not explaining this well, you can basically use your main char to take the tradeskills that will help you gather the raw materials.  You then transfer the materials to your alt that has the tradeskill to make the gear (e.g. tailoring, alchemy, blacksmithing, etc...).  None of the components are bind on loot (no drop) nor are the results of the tradeskill combine.<br />
<br />
5 Second Casting Rule<br />
The game mechanics have been changed so that a spellcaster regenerates no mana while casting a spell and for 5 seconds afterwards. Although mana regen rates via the spirit stat were greatly increased, what this has meant is that as a mage/priest you will constantly have mana use issues in dungeons.  I single out mage and priest because unlike the other casters (druid, paladin, shaman) they do not have a viable non-spell means of contributing.  The lead dev actually suggested that mages should melee to conserve mana in the original thread on the WoW boards.  <br />
<br />
I think this change was flat out shortsighted and will probably (hopefully) be adjusted before launch.  It mostly hurts grouping as I barely noticed it solo.  The only issue soloing is you pretty much need a huge mana pool because as a mage you will never regen mana while fighting, so you need that mana reserve to handle an add.  If this change is not removed prior to launch I will be rolling a warrior or rogue because they both do insane dps, wear armor and don't run out of mana after 1 big fight.<br />
<br />
Class Balance<br />
I don't think it's possible to get 100% balanced classes in a MMORPG.  Right now they're still doing the violent boost then nerf seesaw, which worries me as launch isn't far away and they need to get this ironed out before then.  Based on my EQ experience, I will never play anything as a serious toon unless it is a pure specialist.  In WoW's case, that means warrior, mage, priest and possibly rogue (if mage isn't retuned). <br />
<br />
Why? Because game devs are human.  You know they will use warrior tanking, priest healing and mage dps as the baseline to what other subsidiary classes can do.  Other classes will not be allowed to &quot;beat&quot; any specialist class at their specialty.  It will be the designers' greatest challenge to make non-specialist classes viable for difficult content.  I am simply betting against them even though I have great faith in Blizzard.  I'd also rule out any class that doesn't have a mana bar, but since melee get skills that do virtually the same thing and can still solo, WoW seems to have solved that dilemma.<br />
<br />
Downtime<br />
This varies class to class due to the ongoing class balancing.  As a mage that had been repeatedly nerfed into the ground every single patch since I started playing it's back to the 50% rule.  Basically, you pull/kill a mob in 20 secs then regen mana for 20 secs and repeat.  If you get a huge mana pool you can maybe do 2 mobs in 40 secs, then rest for 33% downtime.  I'm hoping they adjust the mechanics so that players can fight closer to 75%+ of the time as downtime is just plain boring, even if it's in short stretches.<br />
<br />
Dungeon Instances<br />
It looks like in addition to questing/grinding, players will be able to do instanced dungeons from L15 all the way to L60.  This is huge because instanced dungeons are fun and the best way to equip your char if the auction house isn't keeping up.  Unlike low level LDoNs, the gear that drops is level appropriate and you'd actually wear it, at least in my experience.  This is a huge plus and I can't wait to get my crew in WoW and start going at it.<br />
<br />
Raider vs. Casual Content Issues<br />
Read this thread on the WoW boards (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?FN=wow-general&amp;T=377121&amp;P=1)  written by another narcissistic raider from my old EQ server.  A mere month ago 50 raider fanbois would have shouted down any casual poster and told them to go play Diablo 2.  The demographics seem to be changing to match the real world now that they're letting in more beta testers.  <br />
<br />
That having been said, it's still an unknown what end game content is going to offer people and what the rewards will be.  The raider, grouping person and solo player are all waiting to hear what they'll have to do at level cap.  A lot of people including me are not going to continue to play if dungeons and zones are tuned for people wearing raid gear at level cap.  Because little to no raid content will be released in beta, this is something that will bear close watching after launch.<br />
<br />
Addiction<br />
For me at least, WoW is an infinitely more enjoyable game but is far less addicting than EQ was.  I look at playing WoW like I would any other use of my free time: read a book, have a cigar, play WoW, go biking, watch a movie, etc...  Because it is time friendly it doesn't have that immediacy to play in large blocks to get anything done.  In addition, because of the way the rest system works, I was frequently taking a 3-4 day break to keep me in the 200% bonus exp mode.<br />
<br />
I LOVE the fact that I am essentially earning future exp by going about my busy life, which makes the times  I do play that much more productive. Huge, huge props to Blizzard for this system.  The fact that the rest state is character specific and not account specific is just icing on the cake.  If I ever get into the &quot;I gotta play&quot; mode again I will just alternate between chars so that no matter which one I play I'm getting 200% exp.  I really love this as a casual player.<br />
<br />
Summary<br />
Despite some big question marks I will be playing in open beta and purchasing the retail game at launch.  My friends and I will be playing open beta pretty much just to get a head start on working together on our class combos.  There's no doubt in my mind we'll be playing this game for the next year since even if we hit cap on Horde we'll just switch to Alliance and do it again.  The real question is if Blizzard can provide enough content for all playstyles to make this game the 1M+ subscriber runaway success it can and should be.<br />
<br />
Good luck and see you in the future!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Excellent post.<br />
<br />
After the past day or so, I can say definitively that I will be playing WoW, not EQ2, for very specific reasons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the post!  I'm curous, though - I had thought that everybody having decent melee ability was a GOOD thing.  Are you finding mage melee to not be worth it?  One of the many things I liked about WoW was that casters weren't expected to sit on their duffs and WATCH the fight.<br />
<br />
I've been keeping away from the WoW boards, because most forums are evil, but I've very much enjoyed your posts - a kind of methodone for my WoW habit, if you will.  Thanks again.</div></div><hr />

Well, mage/priest melee is pretty pitiful.  I never melee when soloing other than perhaps a wand cast when the mob runs.  For mages at least, you have a staff and possibly dagger/sword if you purchase those skills.  Maybe you can hit 30 dps (assuming you hit with your pifitul melee skill and strength stat) while your spells do 200-300 dps depending upon whom you ask.  You also have to get into melee with all the problems that brings.<br />
<br />
The other option is to use wands.  Wands are also pitiful dps but at least it's ranged pitiful dps.  The downside to this is that, at least for now, there's no auto-attack like there is for melee weapons. Think of the fun EQ rangers have using their bows and you'll get the picture.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is that if they think caster damage is too high, they need to tone down caster dps without removing caster fun.  No one rolls up Merlin to melee and no one rolls up Raistlin to cast 3 spells then sit out the next 3 fights.  Personally I think this will get adjusted prior to launch otherwise there will be a glut of melees (including me) and not enough casters.  Priests are already a hard to find class because they've been nerfed so many times and pushed into a pure healing role.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, I'm thinking if nobody plays these pure healing classes anymore, maybe game devs will realize that nobody actually ENJOYS doing nothing but healing...  Well, maybe somebody does.  Somewhere.  Seems like madness to me.<br />
<br />
I have to agree, though.  I don't fire up a video game so I can sit and passively watch - that's what TV is for.  There's a nice line to walk there between too much downtime and being so frantically busy that I feel frazzled at the end.  I thought they did a really good job with that from the little bit that I got to play.  Hopefully they extend it along the classes and levels.<br />
<br />
That open beta can't start soon enough.  For once, I'm happy they're being pushed to release the thing.  I'd rather an almost-done WoW than any of the other games I have loaded right now.  Well, except Evil Genius - I suppose it can wait till I'm done with my Doomsday Device.  *maniacal laugh*</div></div><hr />
