<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Our guild has done Vindi once (with 24 I think). This was a while back and we have gained levels since. We are not a raiding guild (and a small guild too), so the times we have 24 online are rare to say the least.<br />
<br />
What does it take nowadays in terms of players level 60 - 65 with non raid gear to down him?<br />
<br />
For comparision our guild capability (skill/gear/level-vise) is to do minis in PoS with two groups, and we always seem to run out of warrior defensive while doing them. It is also not a sure thing. We wipe sometimes before taking them down.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It takes a great tank and some decent DPS.  If you can bottle the DPS in a smaller package and have two good clerics, you can take him with a single group.  For people of your raiding level, I'd say 2 groups would be sufficient.  It's really all about the tank tho, if he's PoP quality and your clerics are awake, you win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If it's a close call with 2 groups for minis, then you need more for Vindi, imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not what you asked, exactly, but the smallest group I have heard of doing Vindi is a warrior, cleric, ranger trio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We are a bit short on DPS. I think that is our main problem. If we can do minis with 2 groups (maybe fail one out of five attempts) does that mean 3 or 4 similar groups for Vindi?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When I was on Stormhammer, a hydra guild named Smooth farmed vindy.<br />
<br />
Looked to be about 2 groups worth of characters but I don't think it was more then 2 or 3 players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you can do PoS minis with 2 groups, you can do Vindi with 2 groups. My guild frequently kills both Vindi and minis from storms with around 12 - and I actually think the Storms minis are harder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree with Ximix, IF you can get the pull single.  We came damned close the other day with 18 people, only one cleric and me for heals, and would have made it if it hadn't been for the Protector of Zek add who showed up halfway through the fight.<br />
<br />
Average raid level was  63.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Id say two groupable if you are really good at it.  In your case, I'd think 3 groups would be sufficient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Vindi have more HP, require rampage tank, hence need more cleric for long fight, at lease 3<br />
<br />
PoS mini have low HP and low ac;that mean can kill them lots faster and cleric won't go OOM</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Vindi is definitely tougher.<br />
<br />
If storms are giving you troubles, put a damage shield on your healers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zyphun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Took Vindi down last night with little over two groups. After a learning session (read: wipe) we killed him nearly flawlessly. I am not positive of the classes, but I think we had three clerics (one a bot), three monks, a druid, a bard, a rogue, a paladin, a shadow knight, a warrior and me (a shaman). We cleared the way to Vindi and then pulled him to WL zone in to keep things nice and simple. Like I said nearly flawless with I think one or two deaths. Grats my roomie's warrior on the BP. ^_^</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is an awful long way to pull vindi, much easyer to just pull him out of the arena, and corner him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We killed him the other day with 2 groups and a few bots and we are far from uber (most near level 65 though), was actually easier than taking the entire guild.  3 clerics but one got rampage immediately and died immediately, so essentially 2 clerics and 2 shaman for healing.  We got one add at the beginning also and fought him in the arena.  Not overly difficult if you have practiced him and know what you are doing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We had a great puller and we were lazy, we attempted to do it at the arena, but at 1am it we weren't exactly in top form. With a bard pulling and pacifyiing mobs as he went it was flawless like I said. No adds at all.</div></div><hr />
