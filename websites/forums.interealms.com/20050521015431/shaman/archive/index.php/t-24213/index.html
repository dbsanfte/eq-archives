<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tohlagos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This message is for all those shaman, and for that matter any class/player that is struggling with a quest...<br />
<br />
After two years and ten months since I started, this last Saturday I completed my 1.0 shaman epic.<br />
<br />
Everything up to Mistmore went smoothly.  (As it should).<br />
<br />
I can remember my second fear raid (remember our first fear raid Poguk?  hehe), and how I had died just as Terror went down (I believe it was Terror).   <br />
<br />
I was looking at my inventory when my rez box popped up.  I didn't think about about it and out of habit closed my inventory.  At the time there was a bug and my rez box poofed.  After repeated attempts of other rezzers, another rez box would not pop up.  <br />
<br />
So I camped and came back.  However, by the time I did the Iksar child corpse has rotted with the tear.  (The child had been killed by some tank who was not not familiar with the shaman epic -thats what I was told anyway.)<br />
<br />
I didn't think much about it and though it would be easy to get another.<br />
<br />
Over the course of the next 18 months I did another 8 fear raids for the tear.  None of the those raids produced a tear or even the mobs to spawn the child.<br />
<br />
...I remember one of those raids where I was the only shaman.  I was buffing and slowing six groups by myself.  We had wiped trying to break into Fear.  Trying to slow mobs, while Scarlings were teleporing me around and I was completely naked because I didn't have time to loot my corpse was &quot;interesting.&quot;.   That raid took over seven hours and after many deaths we started loosing people.   That was a long day and one I hope never to repeat.  :)<br />
<br />
Then PoP came out and Fear started to loose the interest of the higher level guilds.   The raids into fear by some of the higher guilds to take out the epic mobs and just let them rot to keep the lower guilds from gaining items stopped.<br />
<br />
Months passed and one day a friend asked me if I needed my Tear.  I explained how I felt &quot;jinxed,&quot; but he persuaded me to go.  The raid went flawless and an Iksar Child spawned.  I was told it was all mine.  So I ran up to it and slayed it with my REIF.  I stood there until I could loot it.... no one played any games with me that time... no tells from people saying that they wanted it for their alts...no tells that time about how I was not high enough at 58 to &quot;deserve&quot; the tear and  how it should go to a friend...   no rubish transpired.<br />
<br />
The entire raid waited for me to loot it and I got no garbage from anyone.  It was a very cool raid.<br />
<br />
More time passes.... all I needed was Neh and Rak.  (Kurn and the Hole had gone flawless).   But, I could not get people to commit or interested.  <br />
<br />
Then a few days ago I had my computer over a friends house doing a LAN party.  He looks at me and says, &quot;Lets finish your epic.&quot;   <br />
<br />
Neh was over in a minute.  Smooth as silk.<br />
<br />
Rak took a little bit longer, but no hitches.  I looted my icon.<br />
<br />
I ran alone into the lake where the spirt was.  I was the only one in the zone.  I blink and breathed in deeply for a few minutes thinking to myself about how long this had gone on and that it was finaly ended.  I thought a lot of things... then I did my turn in.<br />
<br />
I am happy to be an owner of a Spear of Fate, thank you.<br />
<br />
So, to all those out there that are struggling with a quest, please keep going.  I am glad I did not give up.  Even at 65, it was worth completing.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
<br />

Congratulations for a job well done!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I remember getting my tear on my first Fear raid was jumping for joy, then going back a few weeks later to what can only be the most distastrous fear raid in history. Some how when the party 30ppl zone in they managed no idea how to agro dread and terror to portal, they in turn killed the raid and all attempts at the 12hr CR. We enlisted one top guilds on the server to come help they zoned in and wiped, at that stage ppl had been not rezzed for 16hrs. Eventually GM came to the rescue and realised zone was bugged and had to despawn the place to help rez somewhere in region of 100 corpses. After that i never went back till a few weeks ago.<br />
<br />
Grats on your Tear and Epic for a wait that long you deserve it.</div></div><hr />

Toh<br />
<br />
How many people like me crapped themselves at this part thinking **** after all the hard work i done i bet it eats it :=<br />
<br />
Serious grats on getting it though.<br />
Seems its laughed at by a lot of shaman nowadays but for  some of us a lot of blood sweat and tears went into it and its more the fact of having your Epic than actually worrying about how good it is.<br />
<br />
Guess thats why its called an Epic :)<br />

<br />
man, i remember trembling while cruising thru Freeport as a Troll shaman (who had just recently acquired his invis spell :P ).  man.. all i remember was.. &quot;god if invis breaks, i'm done... if invis breaks, i'm done... &quot;<br />
<br />
then soloing the test of patience, just sitting there with invis-2-animals up and praying it didnt fade when the Lvl 40 shark would cruise by.<br />
<br />
and the endless camping in CoM, every day, wishing for either the army behemoth (Canni2 quest) or the spectral courier to pop.. and the humourous /ooc's with peeps across zone... (/ooc JEEBUZ... SPAWN ME A COURIER...  #@$)@*)#$)<br />
<br />
yes.  it was epic.. and i will always remember every step of the way, including freaking out thinking the dog had eaten my final handin because the spear was stuffed into my inventory and not put on my cursor.<br />
<br />
gratz bro and good luck when you start 1.5<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Those are the events that you will always hold close to your heart.  I remember when I was working on my epic most of my guildmates in the guild I was in showed up for Rak.  I think we had 30+ people.  I literally fell out of my chair at the overwhelming support my guild gave me to help me complete my epic.  It was the first time I led a raid too.  Boy, was I nervous.  :D  I am no longer with that guild, but the memories of events like this will never leave me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Congratulations, Tohlagos!  I spent about 12 months waiting for that iksar child and went on nine or ten different fear raids in that time.  Only other part I had trouble with was the test of patience where you wait under water.  Thinking it trully was a test of patience I waited about three hours going crazy messing with my gamma and tint, swimming around, etc.  I gave up and found out the next day it was bugged.  Went back after it was fixed and only had to wait about 5 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Balzaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Congrats!  Getting my epic still stands out as my favorite EQ memory.  Having the support of the entire guild sure makes you feel good.  I can't say mine took as long as yours, but it was well over a year.  <br />
<br />
Jeis, <br />
That wasn't the SoV raid on The Nameless by any chance?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Congrats...hehe I just got mine recently as well....22 Fear raids over nearly 4 years, saw 63 Minis, never got a tear...eventually Imapercent MQd a tear for me last week and it went off without a hitch....couldnt just run around as a level 67 with no epic heheh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zammatacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Congratulations<br />
<br />
~smiles~<br />
<br />
It is indeed a true victory to gain your epic.  I remember getting mine, and even at 65, wield it proudly even though others think there are better weapons out in Norrath now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Heres what you have to do now:<br />
<br />
Hit &quot;shift&quot; and &quot;t&quot; simultaneously. Choose a new title. I would suggest Heyokah might be appropriate, don't you think?!<br />
<br />
Big congrats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I agree 100% with Weyalan.  Congratulations on finishing your epic.  A milestone to be sure.  A guildmate of mine has been trying for a year or so now too.  The fear raid I ended up gettin my tear on was thrown together by my guild to get a prominant Enchanter her piece.  I reluctantly joined knowing I only had an hour or so before RL would make me log.  A friend of mine logged me in and played ghetto shaman, and looted me the tear.  When I logged in later that day, damn I was happy.  I digress however, WTG!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">BIG congrats to you -- wield it with pride, Heyokah.<br />
<br />
I remember my epic fights well, from the anonymous invitation to Fear for my tear (which was wierd cause the guy, who I'd never met, had done a /who all shaman 50 65 and chose me off the list to come loot an extra Tear with another guild shaman) to the death-loop I got stuck in after fighting Rak ... wow, good times. I still remember taking an entire group with me on the test of patience because I was scared of the sharks. I carried my epic until I got to the point where I wanted more HP/mana, and I still carry it in my backpack. I'll carry it there until the day Tordail is retired; it's NEVER being relegated to the bank. I sill use it for soloing and honestly, there is NOTHING cooler-looking than our spear.<br />
<br />
:) Enjoy it!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Tohlagos,  I don't think I have ever had more sympathy for any other player than I have had for you.  I am so happy to hear that you finally got your epic.  Your situation did much to shape my philosophy in regards to the management of family or balanced style guilds.  In effect a guild's leadership should do for their officers only what they are willing to do for their rank and file members.  In addition the reputation of a guild with outsiders is of no more inportance than a guild's responsiblity to even its newest member.<br />

I hang out with Poguk a lot now-a-days so I  will also pass the news on to him in case he misses this thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Nicely written account! Well done for sticking with it and Congratulations!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I didn't miss this thread, Sion.  :)  Gratz Toh!  Woot!  You were a &quot;Heyokah&quot; way before you got your epic, imo.</div></div><hr />
