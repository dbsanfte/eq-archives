its tradeskills.  It's brewing.  It's for the pottery made spiritstones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">where's the mushroom spawn at?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tienen Crazywolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">can spawn anywhere really, pain in the patoot to find. Takes a while to find them, but it gets easier once you see what they look like ( but not by much ) .</div></div><hr />

In my lowbie Troll Shaman leveling days, I found a bunch of these mushrooms, probably around 4-5 of them. I just picked em up as I was hunting in the swamp. An Ikky monk whose name I didn't take note of asked me if I had found any. So I gave him the lot.  Anyway, if I had known what they were used for and how tricky they are to find, there is no way my little troll would have given em away.<br />
<br />
My own fault I know, but /rude Monk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The kicker is that they spawn under water too... so you have to go swimming.<br />
<br />
I turned into bear form to drop my height so I could look below the water line.  Now you can cast shrink and get the same effect.  Just pray your swimming is at or near 200 or it will take a long time.<br />
<br />
When I went looking for them I think I spent an hour and got maybe 20 of the mushrooms and vegetables.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Oh, once you find one if you look in the area you will most likely found 3 or 4 more ... they seem to spawn in patches.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I found some straight out from the Feerott zone, next to the 3 trees on the little jutty of land as you come from Feerott. I also found one near the bard in Innothule, on the shore of the pond that he resides near.<br />
<br />
they look like blue or pink shrooms.</div></div><hr />
