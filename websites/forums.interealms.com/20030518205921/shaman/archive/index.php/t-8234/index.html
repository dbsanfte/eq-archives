<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>a_shaman_0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
<br />
Tired of melee characters I finally retired my old shadowknight. From searching the boards I learned that some 2box a necromancer and a shaman with great success and that got me thinking if I should try the same thing?<br />
<br />
So now I'm asking for some advice on strategies and tactics to use when playing these two together. My shaman got decent AC and HP gear so I was planning to tank for the two pets using horse+JBB and have the necro supply extra damage from behind. I read something about it being impossible to get the necro pet to tank instead of the shaman pet due to level and/or melee range difference, anyone care to comment on this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I duo pretty regularly with a necro and poor dogdog gets eaten virtually all the time while the massive damage lvl 60 spectre pet (compared to dogdog) gets ignored. The necro tells me it is because pet aggro is 90% distance related and dogdog attacks at short range.<br />
<br />
It is possible to use them but it means you have to place the mob directly under the necro pet leaving dogdog at long range, this is a pita to do on every mob.<br />
<br />
I ended up not bothering with pet when duoing with necro unless we were fear kiting.<br />
<br />
If you are going to tank then it will be np as mob will always focus 90%+ on a PC rather than a pet.</div></div><hr />

Thats what I've heard too. Care to try shrinking the necro pet and see if that gets it closer to the mob?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do this: Grow your pet, shrink the other pets. While this wont solve your problem 100%, and you'll still have to do some pet jockying, it makes things much easier.<br />
<br />
Mages regularly shrink thier pets now that we get the shrink spell in PoP to avoid stuff like this. :P</div></div><hr />
