<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A friend researched a copy of the enduring breath spell for me.<br />
Just finished 2 days of camping greens and light blues in LoY.<br />
I just finished scribing blood of nadox.<br />
My spellbook is 100% complete at this time containing all spells that shaman can currently mem.<br />
WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Grats man;     my spell book is like 30% complete, because ..... I delete most of those low level spell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Very nice work Juu, that is a very impressive feat.<br />
<br />
Its definitely a goal of mine to have a complete spellbook. Eventually I'll get it... I just need to get my necessary spells first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nice going JuuJuu ;)<br />
<br />
Finished runes and Sp here a few weeks ago, bloody guild awarded me RGC from arch lich as well, the bastards :p<br />
<br />
I'm missing ancients, loY, and some of the luclin/SSra spells (PE, grp acumen, levi and EB I think). <br />
<br />
Kunark, Velious and PoP are all done (apart from infusion of spirit..)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shammann65</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">WOOT nice one bro....<br />
You even have: &quot;Primal Avatar&quot;?<br />
There are only 3 shaman on Povar who have it....<br />
I'm one of them :) But I still need 5 more spells before I'm complete. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ya.  I have Primal Avatar.  I got my Sleeper's Key about 2 years ago, and got Primal the very next raid.<br />
<br />
As for the other harder spells, I got PE on a raid in Ssra one day when the Mystic was up, and bought the other spell for 10k in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
I camped my Levitation spell in the Deep for xp duoing with a SK friend.<br />
<br />
I just got EB made for me by someone in our guild who's organizing the hard to find research combines.<br />
<br />
After about 15 or so complete VT raids I think all our shaman have every Ancient spell so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">betcha don't have Ancient: Group True South<br />
You're not a real shaman without that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You are missing 2 spells:<br />
<br />
Pure Blood <br />
Charm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&quot;pure blood&quot; doesn't exist anymore.. it's now &quot;blood of nadox&quot;.<br />
<br />
and i have never heard of &quot;charm&quot;, unles it is &quot;charm animals&quot; ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Grats Juujuu, nice accomplishment.<br />
<br />
I shudder at the thought of your playtime  ;) .<br />
<br />
Got me curious, what is charm??<br />
A spell from stone-age, that got removed or something else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Shaman once had charm, but then it was removed, so there are a few with it in their spellbooks, but that's it. <br />
<br />
It's not castable, so Juujuu's book is complete imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Does he also have all the imbue spells from back before they made them only scribable by the deity in question? =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">He is not missing 2 spells (charm and pure blood) because by his standard he has all spells that shaman &quot;can currently mem.&quot;<br />
<br />
read the OP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Are me and Shamam the only 2 who delete 50% of the spells out of our book because they are useless?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">No, I deleted everything that I don't use, including all forms of single target str/dex and all spells that are needed to buff charachters under 46. Befriend and charm animal, the Rage series except VoB, all heals cept tnarg's , Q and torpor (I keep torpoer to heal charmed pets with before breaking to re-charm). <br />
<br />
All regen cept replenishment, every nuke in the book cept Ice and BoF, all the low level slows, all the goofy stuff like Assudious Vision, etc, etc GONE. <br />
<br />
THe only person who would actually spend time getting a complete spellbook is that same dork you knew in middleschool who had to have ALL of the smurf collectables. <br />
<br />
<br />
But if that's yer cup of bikiniwax...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Look who's jealous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pure blood does exist,  but it's for other classes.  Blood of nadox is for shaman's only.<br />
<br />
the good thing BoN is group while everyone else suck with PB is single target.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have pure blood from when I quested it before the change (to Blood of Nadox), and I can still mem it and cast it, hehe.  Anyways, grats on the full book.<br />

In case your are wondering, I'm seething with jealousy over here!<br />
<br />
HAHAHAHA, Grats and good work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Kkrush, what did you do when Slow mitigation was horribly broken, and you NEEDED walking sleep.  :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Shammann65</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Keep all spells imo. After every major patch or expantion I cast all spells (even level 1) to look for that exploit program bug. Have not found anything yet... but one day :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Grats either way, its nice having a full book.<br />
<br />
I do have pure blood scribed, when I right click on it I get NOT USABLE though and cannot delete it.  Did the quest soon as I found out about it/did it in like a day or so.  The upgrade is sweet as well.<br />
<br />
Acumen of Dar Khura is the only one I am missing now :(  Dang shissar mystic never is on track/spawns for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Easiest way to get acumen of dar khura is probably to check bazaar for research components. I've gathered material for 2 combines of acumen dar khura this way (Havent tried combining them yet though). Cost me less then 1k for components</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Up to the Luclin expansion, I managed to get every shaman spell.<br />
I think it was some time around then that they added the ability to remove spells from your spellbook.<br />
I thought about doing that, but there's times when people ask me random questions about spells that I have to mem the spell to check or cast to check (like &quot;do I get a Str spell at level XXX and if so how much does it give me?&quot;).<br />
You also never know when certain other spells come in handy that you wouldn't expect.<br />
And after the difficulty in acquiring certain spells like Malo, I just don't have the heart to delete it.<br />
It's the same kind of reasoning why I have 3 bags full of older gear that I used to wear but have outgrown, like my rune etched armor, vindy BP, kael quested armor, etc etc etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Why would you ever delete a spell? Even the most 'worthless' spells can be used as crap buffs for AOE dispellers. I guess I dont understand why you'd permanently remove anything from your spellbook. Maybe you just find the shapes and colors confusing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Why would you ever delete a spell?

<br />
First of all, you can delete all your obsolete spells that you will never ever use for anything except possibly crap buffs, and you'll still have plenty of buffs left that you use very rarely that can be used as crap buffs.<br />
<br />
Second of all, a clean spellbook is just a nice thing to have.  I don't like having a cluttered bank or a cluttered inventory, and I don't like having a cluttered spellbook either.  All those extra useless spells are just clutter, so I delete them.  If you are ever going to need them for anything again, you will most likely know in advance, and can simply buy them back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">My spellbook is a clean spellbook.<br />
I have all my old spells arranged very neatly.<br />
For example, page 50 has all my strength spells sorted by level of the spell, except for the ones I currently use.<br />
page 49 is stamina buffs.<br />
page 40 or so is my HP buffs<br />
page 39 or so is my collection of heal spells (including torpor and stoicism)<br />
page 38 would be regens<br />
page 35 or so is my DDs<br />
page 34 or so is my poison dot page<br />
page 33 is my disease dots page<br />
page 32 is my malo line page<br />
page 31 is my cripple and DR debuff page.<br />
etc....<br />
It took all of about 20 minutes to sort it out while waiting for a CR one day.<br />
<br />
Having an empty spellbook isn't having a clean spellbook,<br />
it's just an empty spellbook...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Zamiel Breezeplease</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Well, guy, do you have Imbue Justice?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">That's how I do it too Juujuu, thanks to the patch that expanded the number of spell slots in your book from 250 to 400. But I am not close to having all spells.<br />
<br />
I count 231 Shaman spells, is that how many you have scribed?</div></div><hr />
