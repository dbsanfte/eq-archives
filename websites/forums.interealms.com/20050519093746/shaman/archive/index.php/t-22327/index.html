<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Why can't we re-invest our AA's to other areas if we take an AA and it isn't something we like?  What would it harm?  I understand you should still only be able to pull up to a 30 banked amount.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Seems like there'd be too much potential for abuse...  Train up scrm and buff, then untrain that and train up spirit call, sic pets, untrain that, train up crit dots, dot away, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Saffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I partly agree. I believe that if you have trained a skill that you truely don't want at that point in time ( thinks back to suspended minion when i was level 52 )  then you should be able to /petition and get a GM to remove the skill and restore your aa points.  but being able to do it yourslef shouldn't be allowed due to the training and untraining acording to your mood/fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Why not add a quest like the one for changing your specialization.  That would make it an option but keep it time consuming to do so it wouldn't be done often.  Maybe even add a flag to it so it can only be done once.<br />
<br />
I would definately like the 5 I spent on innate wisdom back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Geal Icehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hehe you could then take all the points you spent on stats and have 105 (15*7) another 75 if you also sold your resist AA's.  So when the next expansion comes out you would really have 210 AA's you can use to buy the new ones.</div></div><hr />

An innate +30 to all resists is priceless for raiding. I would never want to refund those.  I never spent a single AA on stats, because I knew gear would more than suffice to max those even without buffs.  I do wish they would refund AAs that don't function correctly (Call of the Ancients, Persistent Casting, Advanced Spirit Call).  CotA completely sucks, I want the 3 AA I spent back.  Does Persistent Casting even work?  ASC sucks because the pets have like 200hp and die to cheap DSes and single ripostes.</div></div><hr />

Am I way off or didnt they change this like 2-3 months ago?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I like the idea of resetting AA simmilar to the spec reset.  Make it cost a blue diamond or something or have a quest associated with it.  Not a quest that requires rare drops in VT or Pofire or Vext, but something that might take a little work but isnt a 5 hour camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They changed ASC, pets have decent hps and do great dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">just have it like name change can only use 1 time a week, and 1 aa. that would stop most of the abuse or make it not worth while.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes they have been fixed for quite a while now. <br />
<br />
Call of the Ancients, Persistent Casting, <br />
<br />
These 2 however are still questionable on their worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">They could do it easily just like in Planetside.<br />
<br />
You can give up one AA skill and retrain every 24 hours.  If they didn't want to do that they could make it so you could untrain 3 AA points every 24 hours.<br />
<br />
I don't see what the big deal would be about this system.  Give people that trained &quot;Innate Strength&quot; at level 51 some leeway, or if you don't like an AA etc., give us some freedom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Haagen, the reason is easy: There are shamans with maxed AA. They have 30AA banked when a new expansion comes out. When the new expansions is out he surrenders the pet buff AA. Now he has 50AA free. Next day he gives up 2nd fort. 65AA free. On day 3 he says bye to FoMM3. Now 80AA to place into new AA. Day 4 quicken curing3. 95AA. Do you see the picture?<br />
<br />
I know you can have max 30AA banked but the AA he sets free from old skills can just dumped into new expasion AA. If SOE wanted you can buy all new expansion AA at once there wouldn't be the 30AA limit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">There should be a limit for sure.  No doubt about it.  We earned those AA we should be able to move them around.  Sure let you move a total of 30 per week and have there be a lock out time to use them of 7 days and a Reuse time to drop AA's of like another 2 weeks after that So basically in a 1 month period you could move a total of 30 AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm still kinda upset that I spent points on call of the Ancients because it said ENDURANCE REGEN and in fact, it was HP Regen. Would really like to get those points back</div></div><hr />

Haggen my idea would equate to the 1 AA a day but would make it more useful.  A little more all at once then a long long recovery time.</div></div><hr />

Little bit of common sense goes a long way, dude.<br />
<br />
Ok, now they've got all the new expansion AAs, now they have to go back and RETRAIN all those old ones?  I don't think people will be using it like that.  Also, if you have 30 AA banked you .. uh.. can't get anymore, so surrendering more wouldn't be an option.<br />
<br />
Sorry if I'm coming across like a dick, but people proposing outlandish, unrealistic crap or complete misunderstandings of every topic at hand frustrate me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Those skills may not be as desirable as the new expansion skills. All they would have to do is spend the 30 banked AAs, then refund those AAs one at a time while spending the AAs they receive from refunding them on the new expansion AAs. Its not that outlandish, unrealistic or a complete misunderstanding of what this topic is about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ive never had 30 banked. Can you go over and have to spend before you zone. I thought when they did some paybacks on like manaburn and MC3 they said if you went over 30 you had to spend before you zoned or lose the overage. Is that the case or am i making things up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yes.  Just like you stated: If you're reimbursed you can go over 30, but will lose anything over 30 when you zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Haagen, as Bruin already said: there are WOW! AA skills, good ones, and finaly AA skills you buy when nothing else is left. Let us say we get quicken cannibalisation with OoW (-10% to recast time). Has 3 level for 10 / 20 / 30AA. What would you prefer? Pet buff AA (would give 20AA back) and 2nd specialisation at 100 (15AA) or 2min refresh on canni5?<br />
<br />
I think we both agree that there must be a limit. Let us say the limit would be 1AA / day. How would you manage the AA skills that require more then 1AA / level to buy? I could imagine that the surrendered AA points get into a pool. And every day you get one AA back into your normal unused AA pool. For example: You surrender 2nd fort and you get 15AA into the &quot;to refund AA&quot; pool. Over the next 15 days you would get one AA from the &quot;to refund AA&quot; moved into your normal unused AA pool. Of course we have to add rule unused AA + to refund AA &lt;= 30 to prevent the abuse of refunding AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Actually, rather than time limits and all those restrictions, I would like it to be a simple matter of being able to fully refund any AA you purchase UNTIL YOU ZONE.   You buy it somewhere you can test it, see if it does what you expected, and if not, dump the points back out immediately.   Would lead to people thinking through the spending more carefully and probably storing up enough AA to purchase 2 or 3 levels at a time to see a noticeable effect for testing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Given the sheer volumes of information available on the net with the click of a button, there is very little excuse for buying a truly crappy AA. Sure, maybe the &quot;consensus advice&quot; recommends something that you dont particularly LOVE, but even then, if you did your homework (and its not a lot, 5 minutes you can find 10 threads on AA recommendations here) you shouldnt make any real blunders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I agree with Blazz, I don't see a need for this.<br />
<br />
If you have already gotten the really good AA's, then you have a lot of AA's and earning more for the new expansion won't matter.<br />
<br />
If you haven't gotten the really good AA's, then you probably won't blow the 30 banked limit anyway, so your choice is to either spend it on a good AA now or save it for the expansion.<br />
<br />
The only reason to allow refund of AA's would be in the case of a nerf, and they have in the past refunded those AA's when something got nerfed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">All valid points.  What if it wasn't a matter of not likeing what you have currently but a matter of wanting something else more?  <br />
<br />
For instance you had your fun with SC3 and ASC2 and now you want to use those AA for something else?<br />
<br />
Now you shouldn't be able to give back prerequisite abilities and keep the advanced one of course.<br />
<br />
This was more of a &quot;if there was a system&quot; kinda thought.  Just the same thanks for the replies.</div></div><hr />
