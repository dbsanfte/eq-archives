<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">dang, i spent up to lvl 40 on Vallon Zek, i was standard.<br />
<br />
then i spent to 52 on Sullon Zek, i was better prepared.<br />
<br />
now in the Prexus arena at 65, with VP, with Spirit Call, with 50+ AA; who the heck do we beat?<br />
<br />
i loved pvp on vallon, but it was broken.  i liked pvp on Sullon, but it was the sewer.  now at 65 and unlimited time to buff and pet equip, i cannot hold my own.<br />
<br />
is it just a server thing?  are all the peeps in the Prexus Bazaar all Time geared?<br />
<br />
seriously, you don't see any chanters in the arena, they all have charmed pets somewhere.  you don't see any 65 AA+ Clerics there either.  <br />
<br />
but out of what is left, what do you beat?<br />
<br />
while it may well be my gear, i buff everything.  including our resist fire from lvl 24.<br />
<br />
please, go to the arena in the bazaar, shout how uber you are and how you pwn the place, then come back and tell me the results.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is nothing wrong with shaman pvp under level 51.  We kinda got shafted with AAs as far as PvP goes, thats why I dont ever plan on leveling past 50.<br />
  First let me introduce myself;  I play an ogre shaman on rallos zek, the toughest, meanest PvP server that exists.  If you don't know how to defend yourself you will lose your gear, over and over again.  Also, I am a player killer, meaning I spend all my time hunting down other players so I can take their items.  (no one ever said ogres had to be nice)  In the last 4 years I have fought countless battles as a shaman, mostly solo but some in group.  <br />
<br />
  I think alot of people underestimate us as a PvP class, and this has worked to my advantage many times.  Recently an SK laughed at me when i meleed him with my crappy looking stick, then when tash procced I stacked malosi and proceeded to mop the floor with him. -150 MR against a skilled shaman pk means ur dead.  I looted his shell inlaid collar and sold it for 55k.  It was a great =D<br />
<br />
  My point is that shamans are fine in PvP.  I hope verant doesnt change a thing.  I make tons of money killing players who underestimate me and it really just comes down to being smarter and sneakier than your opponent.  Anyone who really thinks shamans are broken, log on to rallos and throw me a tell.  You can follow me around and watch me pick fights.  You might even start saying shamans need to be nerfed =p <br />
<br />
  Versatility is a huge advantage in PvP when you know what your doing, and I have yet to see a class outshine us when it comes to offensive and defensive trickery.  (/laugh at druids and bards)<br />
<br />
  I hope someone else is interested in discussing shaman PvP tactics, I am always looking for new ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Joril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you missed the point of the post.  he said at 65.  everyone agrees shaman 60 and below ROCK.  I was never beaten in PvP back when i was on karana during kunark and before.  not that i did alot of it, maybe 10 to 15 total fights, but they were always against top end tanks and casters.  some of the tanks never even landed a blow.<br />
<br />
that all changed during velious and beyond when they started missing with resists and then AA's and ungodly weapons or spells for casters.  shaman power did not scale.  i remember vividly playing with some friends and using malo then malosini (sp) during velious to lower their cold and PR to like 5 and i still could not land one freaking spell, dot or nuke.  it has gotten worse since then.  <br />
<br />
they have changed the way resists work, but now everyone has their resists so damn high that even knocking 150 off them barely makes a dent.  ya you can land 1 out 3 or 4 nukes or dots, but the casters are spitting lures at you for full damage and melee all you can do is run from them since you cant land anything on them (the smart ones learned to use 2hand weapons on you if you tried to melee them, DS potions rocked for a very short period... namely the one time they came close to dying from it).<br />
<br />
PvP for shaman at 65 like the rest of our game is seriously gimped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bozer try that at 65 :(<br />
<br />
tash+malos=squat, I can empty an entire mana bar and not land a spell in endgame pvp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Since a shaman at 65 is utterly dependant on spells for PVP, and the shaman class is based on dots for damage we are worthless damage dealers in PVP beause of resists and cure spell/potions. Unless the PVP retune does something about it, the only viable way to make any damage would be crit nukes.<br />
<br />
The best thing about a shaman i PVP is he can stay alive for a long time if he got the resists...<br />
<br />
We CAN kill. But in most of those situations we are of either much better geared/skilled/level or facing an idiot. Neither is really a fun and entertaining PVP situation.<br />
<br />
At lvl 50 i did never PVP very much so i cannot comment on what Bozer said, but its probably true. At 50 we were kings. Especially back then when noone had any resists to speak of and noone had enough HP to whitstand a few Ebolts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did PvP vs a druid with Time gear.  After 40 minutes or so, I gave up trying to kill him and called it a draw.  Between heals, FT, high resists, and other things, I couldn't do him enough damage to kill him before he could just heal up and regen plenty of mana in the process.  <br />
Tried a Time geared shaman, same result.  We ended up in a swing-fest clubbing away for 20 minutes or so and getting nowhere.  I finally talked to her:<br />
Me: &quot;What's your hps/mana at?&quot;<br />
Her: &quot;nearly full, and you?&quot;<br />
Me: &quot;full too, sigh&quot;<br />
<br />
We gave up after half an hour.  Nothing worked, neither could win.<br />
<br />
Now monks.  Monks own me.  I spend the whole time running away and dodging.  My pet nibbles at em but can't keep up with time gear regen.  I can't land crap.  I can't melee em, i get owned.  I can't slow, root, dot, or nuke em.  I'm rather toothless actually. <br />
<br />
I think &quot;toothless&quot; pretty much sums up high level shaman PvP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">well, this went better than i thought.  i didn't check rep points, but i was worried about the responses.<br />
<br />
they came out truthfull.  in single PvP we suck at the top end of the levels.<br />
<br />
everything bounces, even after multiple debuffs.  our melee is so sad after no skill up grades in 15 lvls as to make me want to say bad words about Sony.  (i just can't think of any new ones to use)<br />
<br />
and as a side note.  IMHO rallos zek is not the hell hole it once was.  everytime you augment an item with an LDoN it is no drop and cannot be looted.  (even the cha augs)  also rallos has lvl limits on attack.<br />
<br />
go to Sullon and visit the real arm pit of EQ.  52 there was an actual accomplishment, try and just get to 20.<br />
<br />
we're broke.  broke in the high end game.  broke in pvp.<br />
<br />
and imho we will never be fixed in either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We are not entirely broke in PVP.<br />
<br />
In mass PVP we can heal and Malos wich is VERY good.<br />
<br />
In mass PVP shamans are always one of the first classes to be targeted, wich should tell us something about our threat value in pvp on a group or raid sized battle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Koridar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">True. But landing malos on someone with 350+ mr is not really all that useful.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Youre right Koridar. Malo/Malos used to be more powerful. :(</div></div><hr />

I could get anything to stick. :( Spirit Call is useless in PVP, even with 6 pets hitting for 30 most players can out run them or the DPS from them is uterrly crap :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Dog-factory is still better than no dog-factory. If they hit, they hit, and they have chance of interupting casters by either beating on them or by forcing them to move. Supposedly they make enough damage to eat through an enchanter rune aswell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I can only beat up those with inferior gear or few AAs which isn't much fun.  If I can make fight last long enough to wear out opponent then I can win.  Been a while since I won an even match though.  Comes down to the DPS thing again.  Other classes generally have advantage over shamans in duels now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>wakonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Its true we are not good at killing really anyone in high end pvp.  last night my Guild had a required fun night, a night away from the tediousness of GoD.  We all went to the arena off Lake Rathe and one of the contests was mass destruction.<br />
<br />
   Group up quickly and try an kill everyone else, I ended up with only  enchanter and bard in my group and we almost (lasted) till the end, don't think we actually managed to kill anyone.<br />
<br />
    My spell line up was Trusher,Daludas, canni4,Cheetah,annul,disenfecting aura,malos,True spirit. only form of damage I could get off was epic, spirit call and dmg shield potions for those pesky monks had velium strike out for a tiny bit, but after I got a crit for 143, I bagged it for the pet icon.<br />
<br />
    Guess the point is like the others are saying single pvp way broke, mass pvp, we can last a while.</div></div><hr />

Heh, damage-shield kills against rogues, thats a classic :D Just pray they dont have the Pillage Enchantment (4xDispell) from VT.<br />
<br />
Paladins were tough to begin with, then they got their all-cure, remove greater curse AND radiant cure... Talk about shaman-mitigation.<br />

Clerics, well, that would be like watching two paladins fight eachother - its like watching the grass grow...</div></div><hr />

<br />
PVP is being looked at. THere is a PVP beta server open to people with characters on the Zeks. My friend and ex guildie (Phroak) was just appointed to PVP corespondant. I soe even listens a bit to what the corrs have to report, they will get a ton of info from Phroak. This might be able to help casters vs melees and stuff like that. However, im not sure if it will make the shaman class any stronger in comparision.<br />
<br />
One of the things being looked at is a resist cap for certain spells, making them more balanced in PVP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Koridar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Dear God Not Phroak.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>JuyshinRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">i have played around on the beta pvp server, at first it was good fun with 15+ VZ vs SZ vs RZ.. now the server is abandoned and i have finally got to fight 1v1... like people said before, group pvp is our niche and it really did not change that much on beta. malos, heal, nuke. dots do not land against someone with equivelant resists as i have (time gear+). in large groups, i malos and call targets, heal. small groups, malos and nuke, heal. one vs. one, i couldnt be killed, but i still could not land enough (or at all) to kill. most of the people i fought were geared similar to myself, so this is how it went. <br />
<br />
the few people that didnt have the resists i could land dots on and simply owned them. i was channeling through multiple people meleeing me and when i found someone dots would land on, i could get them to 15%      in that situation before i had to zone away to save myself. then there was the sams; 1 person 6boxing 4 wizards, 1 cleric, 1 enchanter.. but they are geared for ****... me vs. ench + 4 wiz = bad news, but me + 1 other could drop 2 of them before the rest gated away.... <br />
<br />
<br />
so, as far as i can see, pvp (on beta) is still black and white. its either, they have the gear to resist everything or they have **** gear and it all lands. nothing really changes.</div></div><hr />

Whats cool about our (sowed) pet is that it bash a lot and that its annoying for many casters class. The AA pets are nice for that too.<br />
Of course 90% is about having high resists.<br />

<br />
About dispelling. The problem is that most serious PVPers have clickies enough to counter most dispelling attempts (VT dispell bracer *cough*). Depending a little on situation and skills/attentiveness of who youre facing, dispell ranges from worthless to really good.<br />
<br />
Also about see invis and invis, most people have items for see invis so this is almost never a factor in PVP. But come to think of it, it is actually the same as with dispelling as with see invis as with resists, and that is that sometimes you encounter people who are worse of with gear, skills and braincells. In those cases we can win, but that is really not fun in the end, to win against someone inferior.<br />
<br />
Yer damn right about pet-factory though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  I think i was pretty clear in the beginning of my post that I agreed with the fact that shamans are limited in 60+ PvP.  Maybe I wasn't clear enough /shrug.<br />
<br />
  But ever since I rolled my shaman people have been crying &quot;Shaman's are broken in PvP blah blah&quot; and instead of joining the whining chorus I have tried to make my character work; and I don't regret it for a moment.  Any other caster class can whine that high end resists ruin their game play as well, and no one can argue certain classes shine in the 65 game.<br />
<br />
  But that said, Im decided to level up to 59 and see how I fare against opponents with sick AAs that we are not blessed with.  The pet patch that allows dogdog to zone with me fully buffed will be a plus.  Of course epic mages are going to totally dominate now unless I can figure out a counter strategy.<br />
<br />
  Any one have any suggestions other than &quot;Shamans are broken lets have a group hug and reroll as mages&quot;?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dark mace of thought, drops from Diabo Xi Xin Thall.<br />
<br />
Procs a 400 mana drain. Its unresistable too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Bozer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Based on some battles Ive had in the last week since the pet patch, I think shamans have gained some ground against most other classes; at least in Zek style random pvp.<br />
<br />
  Heres why:  All pet classes have gained a big advantage (and a fair one) with the ability to zone with a fully buffed up pet.  Mage pets are the meanest, with BST following a close second.  But I think shamans and enchanters come out the best of all.<br />
<br />
  How can this be? When our pets are so weak?  Because chanters and shamans have effective anti pet spells.  Mez and slow, respectively.  In some nasty fights I had the other day I (finally) discovered that after using my best slow spell, my buffed up dogdog can actually TANK an epic mage pet long enough for me to kill its master.  <br />
  <br />
  BST can take longer to kill, but we can tank a slowed BST pet for long enough to strip all the buffs from its master and stack enough dots to at least put them on the defensive.<br />
<br />
  Again, Im just level 51 now so strats are bound to change as I get closer to 59.</div></div><hr />
