<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rooke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yeah what subject said... been doing iceclad. I like the chain fear kiteing method myself KEI and just keep at it but exp is slowing way down any other nice spots you guys know of ???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ginzu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I Dont KNOW!  But am quickly getting to the level that I to would like to know the answer to this =)<br />
<br />
Read somewhere that the zel's in DSP can take you to 40-41, although I see plenty of greens at 32 with some still red Large Zelniaks - the hunt for the blues at 38 would be somewhat a bummer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">None of the Zelniaks are green at 32. At level 30 i traveled to DSP and hunted at the Mushroom temple till i was 36. After that i fearkited Large Zelniaks. Got about a level every 2 hours or so. Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kyrviel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At 38 you might be able to do the Kodiaks in Great Divide.  I don't remember what lvls I did them but it's worth a shot at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ginzu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Maybe you are right about Zelniaks not being green at 32 - I could have been 33 or 34 by then, but by 33, 34 they definately started greening out.  Of course, those were the regular Zelniaks. <br />
<br />
I think Kodiaks in GD are in the same category as Zels.  I believe they are no longer very good at 38-39 range.<br />
<br />
Point being, I am looking for a place at 38-39 that can be fear kited and take me into my low-mid 40's easily - does it exist?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Yayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">dunno where you are, but at 39 they were still blue to lt blue</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rooke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm 38 and all the zelniaks are blue even small ones Ltblue but blue...<br />
I'm not to big on DSP its way to laggy at peak times</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">38-45 = just kill Zels and Large Zels then Wolfs<br />
45-49 = group in Dreadlands<br />
49+ = solo in Jaggedpine (can also be done 45-49 but harder w/o wold form)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Khavari Reborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The basilisks in JaggedPine will take you to 42.  No adds unless you are doing something wrong and the exp rolls in fast.  Also no waiting for spawns since they are all on like 8 minute timers and there are many of them.  All single point static spawns too.  Loot is rotten though.<br />
At 40th I took my 32nd friend there to PL him and lvl 32 took him just under 3 hours, start to finish.  Averaging half a blue per kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kalvarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If money doesn't matter Walrus's in EW (there's dozens of them near Kael) are great xp.<br />
<br />
I did 37-42ish there pre-Luclin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Magrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Check out Stonebrunt.  More animals than you can shake a stick at, a few decent quests (Kejekan Tribal Headband, anyone?  Three for a buck fiddy), and almost never anyone else there.  Bring lots of bat wings and empty bags, and never fight anything where you find it, because its brother will be along soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>forsaken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Walruses is what i just did, the loot is the worst I've ever seen in the game, lots of pelts that vendors won't even buy &amp; are otherwise useless, and some meat. The rare loot's a walrus tooth that's not worth much &amp; is lore, with some pages and words &amp; other stuff if you're real lucky.<br />
<br />
Wolves are better loot I think, &amp; mammoths too. Also there's kodiaks &amp; wolves in EW and GD, so there's some variety with them.<br />
<br />
At 38, any of the blue ones you can kill, any of the white ones with some work, and I did yellow cons some, but they wern't worth the time it took.   Because of the time stuff, I stuck to the blue cons mostly.<br />
<br />
I'm probably going to go back and do some more of them mostly becasue at this point I've optimized the harvest. <br />
<br />
2 things to watch out for that're life &amp; death:<br />
<br />
1. Avoid letting your mobs path around left side of the Kael arch, allthough they'll travel in a nice straight line along the edge by the entrance to Kael, there is a trap there. Basicly you'll be fighting &amp; if you're lucky a Dwarf will appear from `under the snow', &amp; eventualy will despawn if you leave him be. If you're not lucky, and chances are more that you won't be, you will be &quot;ambushed&quot; by a Krommif Death Squad, which is like 4-6 Elites, right on top of you. With SOW &amp; immidiate &amp; non-stop flight, you -might- live, but odds are not good. I died the first time from it, but the second 2, I managed to outrun them (onetime to the iceclad bridge, &amp; I needed to re-sow on the way, quite dicey...)<br />
<br />
2. The entrance to Kael has a huge courtyard, with big brown stone walls around it on the outside, along with a huge, deep `Trench of Doom' leading into it, that's not well marked. It is -very- easy to walk into it. So pay a lot of attention on the approach. You will most likely die if you don't. I got lucky the one time I fell into it, and only took 600+ in damage, that on approach after I'd spent a lot of time there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Suddenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Doh lol sorry should have read last few post before i posted ,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Asylumdweller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Honestly you should group up as much as you can at 38.<br />
<br />
You'll be lacking defense skillups when you need them later on, and moreso you'll be that much more sick of fearkiting when you get to 50 and the Rockhopper/Jaggedpine blues set in.<br />
