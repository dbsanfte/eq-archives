<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I'm buying my wife a new EQ machine for Christmas and I'm wondering if anyone has info specific to EQ that I should consider.<br />
<br />
I have never owned an AMD processor, but I'm considering going Athlon for this one.  What are the pros and cons technically, specifically with regard to running EQ?<br />
<br />
We will most likely be running Windows 2000 on this machine since she also needs to use it to VPN into work and her VPN software is Win2k-based.  If that's a severe problem she'd probably put XP Pro on the new machine and use the old machine for work.<br />
<br />
And wrt graphics cards, I can go NVidia 5900 or Radeon 9800 Pro for about the same cost.  Any opinions here?  I have a Radion 9600 Pro in my machine and can't fully enable all the graphics on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Unless you can afford going for one of the new 64 bit athlons AMD's precessors are pretty outdated and usually loose all performance benchmarks.  The Intel P4s usually also are better in heat dissipation due to their larger die.<br />
I found processor speed secondary to memeory speed and quanitity.  Make sure you order a processor and memory combination running on the same FSB speed, e. g. the 800 FSB P4s and PC3200 memory.<br />
Video cards are hard to evaluate since they found that all companies cheat to optimize bench mark results.  ATI seems to have the upper hand right now in new games, but Nvidia is usually the better for EQ driverwise.<br />
You might have a problem getting Win2k to run on some new motherboards due to the way 2k installs. Make sure you have the motherboard IDE drivers available on a disk.  So most win2k software seems to run well under XP.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The EQ engine wont be able to fully utilize the processing power of either of those cards.  I recently upgraded from a Ti4200 64MB to a 9800 PRO and noticed almost NO difference in performance.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest going to the next model down for the video card and put the rest of the money into the CPU + Memory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bendarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just say no to Windows 2000.  If you get a new machine and stick with that dog you are handicapping yourself.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There are some distinct differences between Intel and AMD chips.  Short version: The Intel chips are superior for intensive processing, but significantly more expensive.  The AMD chipset is usualy easier to tweak/overclock.<br />
<br />
In a gaming machine you will not see much of a difference.  The faster FSB is relevant, but not to the point you will see a difference in gameplay.  You might be able to detect a difference with newer games, but not with EQ.<br />
<br />
Buy whichever fits your budget better.<br />
<br />
RAM and video card are where I would spend my $$ for a gaming system.  A faster HD will noticeably reduce zoning times in EQ.</div></div><hr />

I agree wholeheartedly. I noticed a pretty decent performance boost by switching to XP Pro. And I don't have to deal with 2K's horrendous boot times.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks, guys.  This advice jibes well with what I'm hearing from two independent friends of mine knowledgeable about PCs.<br />
<br />
My next decision is build-or-buy, but that's more something to be negotiated between me and my wife, since she wants a complete system with support and I would rather have the extra $900 and build it myself :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">BTW, on the graphics card issue -<br />
<br />
I recently built myself a new computer (well, 8 months ago) and upgraded to a Radeon 9600 Pro.  I agree with Larns, there wasn't enough performance improvement to justify the cost.<br />
<br />
However, a friend upgrade to a recent GeForce model and got a substantial improvement.  It is possible that the development team uses NVidia chipsets and optimizes more heavily toward those cards.  So regardless of whether the Radeon is a better card or not, it may not work as well for EQ specifically.<br />
<br />
He's running his system with all graphics options enabled on 70+ person raids, so I'm convinced.  The card is only $237, which ain't that bad.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice about XP Pro, I do know that if I go XP I'll go Pro.  I don't have any XP systems now but I've heard.<br />
<br />
Is a second gigabyte of memory worth the $230 or so that it would cost?  I think I'm just going to go for 2 512-MB memory cards and get a motherboard that will take 2 more.<br />
<br />
I built a quick system like I'm thinking of at Newegg, URL is  http://secure.newegg.com/app/WishR.asp?ID=447027.  Just under $1100 and includes everything except an optical drive, which I'm going to pull from my recording studio computer when I upgrade that machine to a DVD+-RW drive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">EQ does have a number of optimizations towards nvidia cards.  From what I've seen, ATI cards perform better gaming in general, but nvidia has the edge in EQ.  <br />
<br />
I use XP at work and 2k at home, I notice 0 difference (machines are pretty similar, 1.5 ghz'ish, 512 ram).  Home machine is an amd, work is a p4.  I've never noticed a difference (except the price, amd usually a bit cheaper).<br />
<br />
I'd stick with 1 gb of memory to start with, but make sure you have room on the MB to expand to more when you feel it's beneficial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">EQ is simply a hog and not optimized well enough to make a difference.<br />
<br />
Yes, I know some people have better performance, or more models on... but I've played EQ on 3 different systems now... the low end being<br />
<br />
P2 450 / 192 MB ram / TNT1 (and then 2)<br />
<br />
and now<br />
<br />
P4 2GHz / 768 ram / GF 4 Ti4600 w/128<br />
<br />
And ... yes... this system is better... but OVERALL the performance increase really isn't mindblowing like I would expect.  My new system is faster in every way, down to the hard drive.. and I only notice bits and peices of better.  I still lag to help walking around the bazaar with full clip... I still stutter spinning around in a room full of people (especially new models)... etc...<br />
<br />
There are two things that greatly affect your EQ speed.    <br />
<br />
- Internet Connection<br />
- Amount of Memory<br />
<br />
If you have a great connection, and loads of memory, you can get by with just a &quot;good&quot; cpu, video card.<br />
<br />
Just my experiences... big upgrades... produce minor results in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">get alot of memory<br />
<br />
get a decent processor, i use AMD because ive found their generally cheaper than similar performing intel chips<br />
<br />
bleeding edge on anything isnt worth it, the 200-300 range is usually the sweet spot for video cards, i have an ATI, but when i build a new system i will most likely get an NVidia<br />
<br />
on the XP vs. 2k issue, i use 2k because ive got a copy i can install on any number of machines, XP needs a new liscence per macine, also, XP uses alot more memory than 2k. So personally for an EQ machine i would go with 2k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">regarding build or buy, I bought my last full system in 97, tried to upgrade and haven't touched a storebought system since. I tend to buy the retail packages to get the rather nice extended warranties the reputable manufacturers offer (and in my experience honor too).  Too bad that most of my computer parts never reach &quot;warranty age&quot; ;).<br />
If you don't feel comfortable in building your own, get a local store to build you one to your exact specs.  That way you can make sure that your $300 cpu and $200 memory chip isn't running on a $50 motherboard driven by a $12 powersupply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">In order of importance (all of these are important, however):<br />
<br />
Memory<br />
Graphics Card<br />
Motherboard<br />
CPU<br />
<br />
For memory, just get tons of it, preferably the DDR SDRAM that takes full advantage of 400 MHz FSB.  1 GB minimum.  If you ever want to run two accounts on one machine, get at least 1.5 GB.  Get single sticks of larger size when possible, as that usually is more reliable.<br />
<br />
Graphics Card:  I agree with what another poster said on the $200-$300 range.  There's no point in buying a $400 graphics card (unless it has some special features that you need for something else).  Likewise, be careful going below $200.  For reference, I'm relatively sure my Ti4600 is not the bottleneck in my system (I only have 512 MB RAM).<br />
<br />
Motherboard:  Do not scrimp on a motherboard.  You may see a $75 motherboard and a $150 motherboard with the same specs, and wonder what the difference is.  The difference is, the $150 motherboard, assuming it comes from a reputable company, is likely made with a better process.  Generally, what this amounts to is more layers of silicon in the board, means the traces on the board have more z-axis to work with, so they will tend to be shorter, meaning a more reliable supply of power to key components (especially memory).  I didn't know this when I built my last computer, and ended up with a motherboard that uses a 4-layer process when the design spec for the chipset calls for a 6-layer process; although it has four memory slots, I can only use two of them because otherwise it cannot supply enough power (and yes, I've verified that it's not a power supply issue).<br />
<br />
CPU:  Anything within reason.  Generally 2 GHz and above should be plenty.  Your hard drive, memory, and graphics card have far more potential to bog down your system than your CPU.</div></div><hr />

Plain and simple, no. I don't care what you think you helped create, 2000 is quite simply a better operating system. For god's sake, analyze your xp baseline vs. your 2000 baseline, the 2000 will have much better performance.<br />

Why on earth would he need a VPN for home? The entire point of a VPN is to be able to tunnel into a remote network. There's no reason to do that if you're at the location of the network.<br />
<br />

<br />
Okay, now my advice. Go Intel, better performance. If you're only running EQ, go NVidia. If you're running other games, go ATI. If you're operating a computer, go 2000 over XP. Voila :)</div></div><hr />

Using Windows XP, I can run 3 accounts on this machine with minimal video lag:<br />
<br />
Athlon XP 2600+<br />
512mb ram<br />
geforce2 MX400 64mb AGP graphics card<br />
<br />
Using Win2k I can't run 2 without my video lagging beyond belief. 1 is fine.<br />
<br />
Plain and simple, no. I don't care what you claim on the internet, I do this for a living, and XP is: more secure (when patched), higher performance, and has more features. It's all a matter of optimizing it properly, and frankly I didn't even have to do much of that.<br />
<br />
Okay, now my advice. Go Intel, better performance. If you're only running EQ, go NVidia. If you're running other games, go ATI. If you're operating a computer, go 2000 over XP. Voila :)<br />
<br />
I agree with the video part, but AMD athlons are optimal for a gaming application, while intels are optimized for more number crunching (video compression is a great example). Athlons run hot as hell though, and unless you keep them in a good temperature range, they will drop to horribly slow speeds until they cool down again, in many cases. A really good CPU cooler is essential with an athlon.<br />
<br />
If you can afford it, AMD Athlon64 &gt; *.Intel, even when running in 32 bit mode.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'd say intel processor - more pricy but.  Get the 800MHz front side bus for the hyper threading technology.  Not going to improve your eq much but other apps it will.  Get at least 1 gig of ddr ram, either two sticks or one stick.  As for motherboard, if you get the intel processor spend the few extra bucks and get the intel one.  They have one that has a copper gigabit card built in, not that this is a super special performance boost just makes you feel all warm and fuzzy.<br />
<br />
AS for the video card, i'd go with the nvida just because its probably cheaper and like previous people said eq wont optimize video cards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">XP runs off the Win2k kernel with some modifications ;)<br />
<br />
The point is that the modifications are crap. They degrade performance heavily and offer little-to-no increase in usuability. There's more than a GUI to an OS, people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">And obviously, you don't know how to optimize a WinXP system.<br />
<br />
I am too lazy to type out my certifications, but I assure you that I have more than enough to know how to optimize any operating system, especially any MS.<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
I have the same setup with 32mb on my geforce2, and I can run 3 with no lag in Win2k. See my comment about optimization.<br />
<br />
Plain and simple, no. I don't care what you claim on the internet, I do this for a living, and XP is: more secure (when patched), higher performance, and has more features. It's all a matter of optimizing it properly, and frankly I didn't even have to do much of that.<br />
<br />
And I don't care what you claim on the internet, either. The fact of the matter is that I do OS performance tuning for major corporations in my area, and hands down 2000 is better. When optimized to their peaks, 2000 wipes XP off the map. The usuablity modifications in XP quite simply hurt the performance of the Win2k Kernel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">OK, OK. Lots of people can work with MS products, hell my CV probably mentions MS more than the XP home page does, there's no need for people to fall out over it. When 2k OR XP are trimmed and tuned in to specific applications on specific systems there's really very little difference between them. Example: What's the first thing you turn off with both features? The fluffy-bunny user graphics. What's the first thing you download? The latest Windows Update patches. My point? Both OSs need skimming, the end product's differences are so small it's not worthy of an argument tbh. It does, and probably always will, boil down to personal preference. Mine is 2k, but only because I've worked with it longer and it has less 'user friendly' garbage littering it on default. I do have XP systems at home and they're fine, like I said, it's just personal preference.<br />
<br />
NVidia are releasing some new drivers next month (maybe make the end of this month) which are meant to kick new life into their cards. We're talking serious performance boosts (50%+ when combined with the about-to-release DX9.1) if they're to be believed. My opinion is that it's worth holding out to see if that's true, cos it would make the NV more preferable than the ATi to me.<br />
<br />
I run AMD and Intel. I've always found Intel to be more stable and more reliable. I recently built 2 new systems and deliberately built one of each. I've had one problem with each box since, so they're level there, but the Intel one runs cooler and quieter and I trust it to be more stable. And considering you're building this for the good lady, you won't want her ranting at you for any reason at all, so that would be reason enough for me.<br />
<br />
As for memory, everyone's agreed really, get at least a gig and make sure it's speed rating matches your board/cpu. And expandability is good, but don't write off a good board that only has 2 slots - you can easily buy bigger sticks and use the original ones on another system. Better to have a great board with expansion problems than an expansion-friendly board with greatness problems.. :)<br />
<br />
Basically, look for value for money. If price could be scaled from 1 (leading edge) down to 10 (omg put that in a museum), then always aim for the 2-3 area. Unger and Asyn were both on the mark with their advice on that aspect imo.<br />
<br />
FWIW, my next system is going to be Intel running 2k (personal preference) with NVidia graphics (providing the driver rumours prove true) and, as always, will have 1gb+ of RAM and probably a 3.0/800 P4 chip. So that would be my advice. :)<br />
<br />
Edit: Was thinking a bit further, and as the increase in speed on the NVidia's is only in conjunction with DX9.1, it's highly likely that ATi cards will ramp up their speeds too. Maybe it's just down to personal preference after all, although EQ has never settled as well with ATi cards for some reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I use AMD and have always been pleased with it.  Mainly due to the cost:performace ratio was better than Intel.  If intel chip prices have come down, then a P4 might be better for the noise factor (AMD fans do generally run a little loud).  I wouldn't spend tons of money to get the fastest chip out there.  An athlon xp 2000+ or a 2.2gig P4 would be fine.  I have an Athlon XP 1600+ and I'm happy with it.  Biggest thing is get over 1gig processor and lots of ram.  I have 512mb PC2100 DDR ram and I am planning to get more.  I also have a Geforce 4 ti4600 video card.  With the newer Nvidia cards and ATI cards the geforce 4 series should be reasonable in price and offer plenty of performace. <br />

Get at least 512mb ram, more if you can afford it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-Get a dx9 compatible video card for down the road.<br />
-Nvidia FX cards are loud.<br />
-If its a custom system, buy the most robust parts (i.e. asus)<br />
-don't put less than a gig of ram in it<br />
-stick to win2k or XP (linux/unix with wine is a good choice too)<br />
-get a case that your wife will like<br />
-give her the present wearing your birthday suit (optional)<br />
-AMD=better bang for the buck<br />
-Intel processors has the fastest poo available on the market currently<br />
-If buying proprietary then stick to dell or falcon<br />
-did i mention shiny pink case with pink cathodes?<br />
-dont forget a sentimental gift as well the the system<br />
-when comparing hardware the best info will be found at overclocker message boards and toms hardware<br />
-shoot for a quiet system rather than a hurricane inducing overclocked beast<br />
<br />
ok thats all for now.<br />
<br />
I run a overclocked athlon with an ati 9700. runs like a dream. (athlon 2600 running at the speed of the 3200). EQ runs flawless, never lags.</div></div><hr />

Dave Cutler<br />
Sr. Distinguished Engineer, Windows Base Team<br />
<br />
Dave Cutler, Sr. joined Microsoft in 1988. Currently responsible for the design of the 64-bit release of the Windows Operating System, Cutler is generally considered one of the top few programmers worldwide. After arriving at Microsoft, he launched the Windows NT group and has since then led the development of three major releases of the product, now known as Windows 2000. In addition to leading the Windows 2000 team, Cutler contributed to the architecture of all parts of the system, and even wrote the kernel himself. In recognition of his significant contributions to the field, Cutler was awarded membership in the National Academy of Engineering in 1993. Prior to joining Microsoft, Cutler worked at DEC, where he designed and delivered several successful operating systems, including VAX/VMS, RSX-11M and VAXELN. Originally from Dewitt, Michigan, he holds over 20 patents and is affiliate professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of Washington. <br />

I mentioned the VPN, because it was in the original posters specifications.  When a customer specifies a use, you address that use in your solution :)<br />
<br />
Nerun,<br />
<br />
I wont debate code with someone who was involved in the design -but in practical terms the difference comes down to the ui and some optimization choices.  <br />
<br />
I personaly have never encountered any real-world difference between the two that was not a matter of tuning.  I maintain that anything that can be done with one can therefore be done with the other equaly well.  XP is easier for an end user.  2k is friendlier to a system administrator.  Use whatever works for you.<br />
<br />
I am a bit surprised that you run a 512mb XP system.  That is the (practical, not the published) minimum for an XP system.  It doesnt seem to perform really well until about 1mb ram.  At 1.5mb+ you can disable the swap file and see some significant performance boosts.  Is there a reason you are using 512mb? or just havent bothered to upgrade it?<br />
<br />
Sony has published that EQ has optimizations in place for nvidia chipsets.  I cant say whether you will see a differnece in a high end Nvidia vs ATI card.  I wasnt able to see the difference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use 512mb purely because when I bought the components, I was saving money till a CD matured, and then I never got around to ordering the other sticks of memory when it finally did :)<br />
<br />
I still have plans to go to 2gb eventually, I just haven't bothered yet.</div></div><hr />

This post in addition to your first post is pretty damned funny.<br />
<br />
Look &quot;Dave,&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe you should spend a bit more time working on fixing the next release of windows and less time defending thecrapformerlyknownaswindowsxp  to random people on the shaman's crucible.</div></div><hr />

I doubt Dave Cutler is reading your reply.  Like I mention early I do not think Dave Cutler is a dipstick.  All I did was give evidence that he is not.  I stopped working on NT over five years ago in part so I would have time to read forums like the Crucible.  Did you misread something?</div></div><hr />
