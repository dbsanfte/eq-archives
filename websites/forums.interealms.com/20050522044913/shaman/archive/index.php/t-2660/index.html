<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok...What I understood was that you put the items for STATS into your range slot, never intending on actually throwing them, correct? OK...<br />
<br />
When I saw this magelo profile in another thread, I was wondering why the Shattering Hammer???<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=257741 <br />
<br />
Can anyone explain this to me? I saw no extra stats on there...is there some extra stats that it's not showing, or does this profile just store the hammer for fighting?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bamana DeMoro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That hammer is in the ammo slot, not the range.<br />
<br />
This is commonly done to give you an extra item you can leave on your corpse.  In this way you can loot all of your important items and still leave an item on your body so it might be rezed at some future date.  <br />
<br />
This is much preferable to leaving an important piece of armor or a bag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I use the ammo slot with fishing bait.  The bait is light, usefull (I can fish ... *hears crickets*), cheap (thus expendable), and can be used to hold a corpse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have a swollen fungus beast gland in my ammo slot.  :)<br />
<br />
but to answer your question... range slot gives stats.  ammo slot does not give stats.<br />
<br />
shaman CAN actually throw shattering hammers.<br />
put a shattering hammer in the range slot.  Then put a stack of shattering hammers in the ammo slot.<br />
<br />
Then go to your combat hotkeys box and click range attack and you will throw hammers... not with any skill of course, but you can do it.<br />
<br />
Beware hitting that range attack button though, if you have an item in your range slot with a range modifier (like a spear with Range: 100) those items can be thrown as well.<br />
<br />
like the other folks said, people leave items in the ammo slot, so you can loot your corpse and just leave one thing to hold it for a rez while still wearing all your gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I also use the hammers in ammo. For a very simple reason, I can leave them on the body that needs a res while still being able to loot all of my gear and packs. Has for useing them to throw better to use slow to pull. And some sort of a stat item in ranged itself</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I keep my bridle in the ammo slot now and leave the Medicine Bag behind if I have to leave something.<br />
<br />
If I wasn't lazy and didn't hated switching out items all the time, I'd still leave the hammers  there.  I still keep the bracer though in case some melee desperately needs a range item for pulling once in a blue moon. :p  (ok ok, I just like clicky items)<br />
<br />
In case you didn't know, those with the shattering hammers in the ammo slot have likely done the Bracer of Hammerfall quest so these hammers are readily available to them at all times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tailen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Worms do make a great ammo slot item!  Great for keeping a corpse around and unmatched for fishing while waiting for yet another boat. ;)  Grubbs used to be better but now they can't be thrown anymore, now that would have been amusing to see!</div></div><hr />
