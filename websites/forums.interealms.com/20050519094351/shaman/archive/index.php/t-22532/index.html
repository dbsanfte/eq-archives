<br />
Was just wondering what a good mana amount is for us!!!<br />
<br />
Logged in today, clicked all my buffs off, and got 6240mana ....<br />
<br />
Curious to know if thats high / low / normal for a 65 Shammy these days :)  So if ya don't mind, post em!!!<br />
<br />
Tek<br />
<br />
PS. yeah yeah, I know I could search Magelo's, but I always assumed they were inflated .....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed. <br />
<br />
All they need to do is put the average cash I make per hour in numerals to push a poor bear over the edge and have him throw himself off the top of Gfay Spires in defiance.<br />
<br />
Granted these days with current HP pools it'd take a few jumps, but still!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">6240 sounds good to me : )<br />

I would go back to below 200 wisdom if I could. <br />
<br />
<br />
All these complicated thoughts are confusing and scary. It was much easier and more fun when I thought like this.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm Kill. Ow.. Bad. Kill faster.&quot;<br />
<br />
I mean 60 wisdom at jump don't make barbarians really smart. <br />

There's a thread somewhere around the Magelo message boards where they're reworking the mana formula they were using.<br />
<br />
Magelo displays 6848, but in game (unbuffed, no tribute, no group) it said I was just over 7k.  That's kind of a big difference :(  Hopefully they get all the numbers ironed out soon though!</div></div><hr />

Wow, you mean you never looked on anyones Magelo to see how much mana they had before they added this.....<br />
<br />
Edit: my bad, just saw your P.S. after I posted</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">my magelo says i have 11364 mana.. i are have biggest penis :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">4400ish here. Had to load default UI to see it. Will probably never see it again, since I don't think Thott will be making revisions anymore, and I modded his.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Patzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">around 3300 here...<br />
<br />
man, i'm lazy... i need to update that magelo... which is funny, considering I pay for the auto update feature, but never remember to use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Magelo seems to calculate mana incorrectly.  The game stats show me as having 100 mana more than my magelo shows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">the bigger problem is can5 hardly makes it move anymore. bout one blue is all. kinda miss the days when can5 was worth over 2 bubbles of mana on the bar. . . . . . . just kinda</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">In a group last night it said 7476 or something like that. Not like it matters, its all about the HP and having replenishment on! That bar just broke 9100 last night! ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I gotta agree with those who say Blue Bar &gt; Number.  While it's &quot; nice &quot; to have a quantifable amount - I watch the bar - not some number.<br />
<br />
And besides, I have died due to lack of hitpoints a LOT. (Amazingly enough every time) I have never died due to lack of mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">i have about that buffed, other shaman in guoild has 6700 odd buffed</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">My e-penis is much smaller than your e-penis.<br />
On an unrelated note, do you have stairs in your house?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Patzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Exes, Magelo premium membership allows you to run its auto updater, which updates your toons info (except flags and keys). It's like 12$ a year (much worth it). It allows you to have three accts on it. <br />
<br />
I'm using one for myself, one for my boyfriend, and we are donating one to our guild for use by our guild vault.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">oh ive got that.. i just cant update it when i had my pc.. magelo would freeze..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Thanks )<br />
<br />
For some reason I can only get to Magelo site on rare occasions (not sure if its ISP / router / some other problem related) ... and I had heard of a descrepancy between numbers ....<br />
<br />
The reason I asked was because I have prioritised AC and HPs over mana, and seeing the mana number, I was just curious as to whether it had suffered due to my AC / HP focus ....<br />
<br />
As it turns out, its doing ok ... so I can keep my focus and not worry too much about the mana number :)<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />
Tek</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Mana's important when you can't canni, which for me is a lot :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Shenen Alquimista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I'm sitting at about 4532 (4682 when I have tribute activated).  My guild has just beaten Quarm for the first time, plus we're just about to break into Uqua.  Keep in mind - I just got back into game 2 months ago, not bad for being gone for 8 months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Grumpf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">5k mana are enough for a shaman imo...<br />
there are hardly times when i get below 70% of my mana pool.<br />
beside when i am chain healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">It's going to vary hugely based on what kind of zone level/equipment you play in.  Our guild is in the qvic+ zones, and I raid buff up to about 9600 hp, and about 8244 (I think!) mana if I am rembering correctly.  Keep in mind some of those hp will probably be group leadership and raid leadership hp, and it did include 150 from tribute.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">About 4400. Pre-elemental of course.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is totally unrelated, but no I do not.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Hail,<br />
<br />
5460 with Bearform &amp; VoQ for me.<br />
Bearform bumps me from 338 to 348 wisdom, giving me an extra 62 mana.  I'm going to snag one more wisdom augment this week so I'll be capped, which should put me just over 5500 mana when grouped (no mana from tribute or group/raid abilities).<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
