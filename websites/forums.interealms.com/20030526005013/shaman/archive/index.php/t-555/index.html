<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shakasa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello All:<br />
<br />
I have been fighting RED mobs for well over 10 levels and I have noticed that now at lvl 44 I can group with a group of high level 50 - 55 players and do High Level places like KC (Hand Room), CT, Vamp Fort, KD etc...and my spells hit 90% of the time.<br />
<br />
I am curious if this is due to the fact that by casting on RED mobs for 10 levels and being very close to maxing out most of my spell abilities has assisted me in this?  If so this is a great practice for lower level shaman (25 - 35lvl)  The reason I suggest this is due to the lack of Shaman on most servers.   Once groups realize the power of a shaman they will take you over almost any class - minus a Cleric or Chanty.<br />
<br />
Thoughs???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hmm, I find it rather hard to believe that you at lvl 44 can land 90% of the spells on hands in KC. Hands are rather magic resistant, at level 50 I think you would have quite alot of resists, but even I at 60 dont have more than 90% success in slowing hands.<br />
<br />
And CT? Damn thats a high level zone, I admit that the green lizards there aint the most magic resistant, but at 44? You must have a very fortunate bug on your character =p<br />
<br />
btw, you at 44 shouldnt be able to cast on mobs more than about 44*1.2 = level 52, most mobs in CT are level 52 or higher.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Unlike melee skills, spell abilities don't go up any faster from casting on higher-level MOBs. Casting higher-level spells does seem to increase the chance of a skill-up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I wonder if that's true, House (the part about casting higher-level spells increasing the chances of skill increases). Until the more recent levels, I never had to work that hard to max out my spell skills, even for those I don't use much, like divination, abjuration. Now, though, it takes forever to increase my skill levels in those areas. Wisdom is as high as it's ever been and my int is roughly the same, so I don't understand why raising the spell skills has been so rough lately. LOL If it weren't for canni, alteration would probably not even max out these days. I guess I'll give it a try and hope for the best. I gotta catch those skills up, quick. After all, if there's one thing I hate, it's a fizzled spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't think it makes enough of a difference that you should do something like chain-cast pets to try raise up Conjuration. For skill-raising marathons, I would still go with a low-level, fast-casting, low-mana spell. I just know that, in working on Divination by alternating True North and Sense Animals, I have gotten many more skill-ups with Sense Animals (Level 9 spell) than with True North (Level 1 spell).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shakasa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Some clarifications.<br />
<br />
1. Yes my spells where landing about 90% of the time in the hands room.  I did notice that certian spells hit the hands very well and other spells we used for the additional pulls like the warlord and its bodyguards.  Since I was in a group not solo....as no one at 44 could survive the trip to hands much less the room...spells sticking helped with our chanter tashing, and me debuffing the mobs as well.<br />
<br />
2. CT Was extremely hard and in retrospect I should not have stated CT in the above post as it was a bit misleading (my apologies.) We did CT at the zone in...I could hit the mobs but no where near 90% even after tashed!  Plus the loot sucked and the experiance was pathetic.  Decided we would not go back for awhile.<br />
<br />
3. I am not bugged by any stretch of the imagination, nor am I twinked at all.  But because of my limited amount of time to play the game, when I do log on to play I am typically grouped in Higher Level zones as that is where my group typically goes.  When this first started I couldnt hit any of the mobs...but after 10 levels or so, I am not hitting the mobs as often as anyone in my group.  Obvisouly certian spells land better than others due to Mob Resistances.<br />
<br />
If their is one thing that I have learned from this board and from experiance.  DONT DO ANYTHING THE CONVENTIONAL WAY IN EQ.  Too many people are under the impression that you have to follow some sort of unwritten rules ie: Stay in LOIO from 16 - 25 then go to OT from 25- 40 then go to DL from 40 - 50 then go to KC at 50!  That is pure BS.  For example why cant a cleric go to DL as soon as he gets Superior Heal?  Hell half the time I get groups in DL its as the main healer....I DONT HAVE SH!  But I do fine as a main healer...barring the inclusion of a ranger who thinks he is a tank.  So why dont clerics go to DL early on...cause some lvl 50 who thinks he knows how to play says so.<br />
<br />
If you want to be bored that may work just fine...but if you want to have fun...push it to the limit.  Nothing in this game is more exillerating than when your cleric says OOM, your chanter has 20m your down to 20m and your tanks are taking a beating with a &quot;Lizzy Style Pull&quot; (inside joke) and you cannidancing like their is no tomorrow to keep your tanks at atleast 20health untill the cleric can pull off a CH!<br />
<br />
Yeah we occasionally die and we laugh...but you know...its the only way to have fun!  Live on the edge.  Go places where all the lvl 50's and 60s say you cant go...<br />
<br />
To me I love it when our group goes in a zone and we get tells saying &quot;What are you guys doing in here?&quot;  &quot;Why did you guys bring a lvl 44 Shaman in here?&quot;  &quot;Man you guys wont last a second!&quot;  <br />
<br />
Then after they see us play, and play we get their respect.  Now I dont recommend this kind of play to folks who dont know how to play their charecters or train whole zones...if you play &quot;Lizzy Style&quot; you gotta be ready to take the deaths like a man.<br />
<br />
Also where did that formula come from for being able to hit mobs?<br />
Just curious.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for helping me out...and calling me on the CT thing...it was an honest mistake.  You guys are the best, I keep learning more and more from you all and its just too bad we all dont play on the same server so we could group up one night.<br />
<br />
Cheers!  and Happy Killin!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't know where the formula came from as to what levels you can cast on. I remember along time ago the rule of thumb was 6 levels above you, this was when the level 50 cap was in. I'm pretty sure that was an official statement. (Remember 6 level 20 necros before this taking out SG's in Oasis? :) <br />
<br />
Anyhow, I'm with the crowd on casting higher level spells increases your chance to skill up, I do recall reading a statement from Abashi awhile back stating that using higher level spells have a higher chance up increasing your skill. <br />
<br />
The main reason I wanted to respond to the thread was I liked your second post Shakasa. Me and my friends are quite the same in doing things that way. When I played my monk, it was me, another monk and his druid and a bard. It wasn't the most effecient group in taking out things but we survived alot of big encounters. I remember doing the Ghoulbane camp pre-kunark with my lowbie druid and my friend playing a paladin. We had crap equipment back in those days and it was quite a challenge for us to do the camp at 30-35ish, so long ago I forget. But we accomplished that goal and it's always stuck with us.<br />
<br />
Now that I play a shaman and leveling up quickly, mainly from experience of playing the game for so long, our group will be so much more effecient, but now I'll be raising the stakes on what we can take out;) There's a line between a challenge and that's crazy, and we tend to cross it all the time. Anyhow, appreciate those comments, I like seeing others out there straying away from the crowd a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tiqua Sunrise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Graveyard, Chardok - 2 warrior, chanter, cleric, ranger and shaman.  Only one level 60 was one of the warriors.  Always had at least one mob lined up but was usually 4-6.  Now that was canni-dancing like mad.  But sometimes going out of the norm is just plain nightmare (UD Velks with 5 melees and shaman).<br />
<br />
I think the most fun I have is when I partner with a druid friend.  Now there's a duoing combo you don't normally hear about.  I'm with most of ya'll, doing the traditional thing is boring.  I loved ME when it first came out and you had to BRING a group there.  Now it's just filled with a bunch of beggars.  So I'm heading off to kill polar bears in permafrost with a friend.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Did the graveyard in Chardok yesterday.  Me (53 shaman), 60 pally, 59 Wiz, 58 war, 53 Enc and 51 Cleric.  That place was pretty nuts - pathing is sodding awful and clearing it for the first time was pretty fun.  Had a bugger landing slow on a few things till the chanter tashed as a lot of it was yellow or red, but no-one died and the only time it got really hairy was when the chanter popped afk and suddenly 4 mobs were in the camp :)  Dont you just love a 15 minute pop on a room that was taking us about 17 minutes to clear :D</div></div><hr />
