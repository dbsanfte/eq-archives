<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a shaman with 300 aaxp points and I still have not bought Mass Group Buff. And frankly, I am considering Innate Disease Resist next.<br />
<br />
Now, this tells you a few things.<br />
<br />
1) I am not in a large raiding guild<br />
<br />
2) I am not the only shaman in my guild<br />
<br />
However, I am in a guild that does raid 2 times per week with about 3 groups - and we kill some pretty cool targets like Vallon Zek, and BoT Towers.<br />
<br />
I want a Shaman ability or spell that is useful with MGB. I am not talking about MGB Fo7. That is useless for my situation because my guild is already shaman buffed (with Shamans at full mana) before it is cleric/enchenter buffed most of the time.<br />
<br />
I want an ability to MGB that is useful DURING a fight. I am talking about something like MGB Celestial Elixer/Spirit of the Wood/Paragon of Spirit. Group Quiesence, MGB-able would be fantastic. However, I can understand if SOE may not want to give us pretty much the same EXACT thing that clerics/druids/beastlords get.<br />
<br />
I would settle for a MGB-able poison/disease/curse cure ability. Something like Blood of Nadox as a very short duration buff would even be okay. That would give a shaman the ability to mass cure the entire raid of a poison / disease AE one time during a fight. Or a MGB-able group Remove Greater Curse to cure the whole raid of a curse at once.<br />
<br />
Basically, give me SOMETHING useful to make me want to buy that aa skill. I am asking for this for Christmas, but I will accept a late present delivered in the upcoming expansion.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I feel your pain, but I would hate for them to do this.  I raid almost every day I play and find MGB amazingly convenient.  Pretty common to be 1 of 2 shamans with ~60 people to buff, and MGB makes it so much faster.  If I had to go back to single buffing because I needed to save my MGB for in-fight cure/heal/whatever, I would be very, very annoyed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ya MGB blood of nadox or some sort of heal-over-time would be nice.  We are one of the few healing classes that does not get something like that.  You may wanna save up points for the next expansion if you are out of things to buy.  <br />
<br />
I use MGB even in 2-3 group situations occasionally.  Just when people are being slow forming groups or after a CR when you can MGB Fo7 at half mana and get away with it.  Its expensive but it has its uses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't use MGB every day, but it's nice when you do need it. I'm in a guild where everyone that buffs has MGB so there's no way I could be done and full mana before them. Still, I see where you're coming from. I would also like some kind of AE buff but wouldn't want to MGB it. I'd prefer something along the lines of paragon. I could be confused, but doesn't it refresh every 15 or 20 minutes? THAT would be very useful. Personally, I save my MGB for Fo7 and would hate to blow it for some elixir spell. At least, until we get some hastened MGB. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">MGB True North!  Make the entire raid head in the direction YOU want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually, thinking about it more - Group Ferine Avatar would be THE BEST.<br />
<br />
I could MGB FA just as we engage some raid target and every melee would be set for 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
And it would make my life SOOOOO much better in experience groups!<br />
<br />
Hell, they could even give group FA a six minute recast, to prevent it from being overpowered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">From what I understand, using MGB during the TT fight is a standard tactic.  And not just MGB Fo7.  From what I have witnessed, at least in this particular guild, all kinds of things get MGB'd.  KEI, Symbol, Bot9, Flight of Eagles, Fo7, Sta, Agi.....<br />
<br />
Course, that is only one fight.  I hear ya, and agree completely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Its ok, next expansion Enhanced Rabid bear comes out, which is a group version of rabid bear! so we will be able to MGB it and turn everyone into bears! I am j/k btw!.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">MGB Rabid Bear &gt; All!<br />
<br />
Especially if it overwrites HoV or KEI :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Group FA would be awesome.  <br />
<br />
I love that idea.  <br />
<br />
TT is about the only fight I can think of where'd you want to MGB Fo7 during.  <br />
<br />
Wouldn't really be a big deal if you didn't cast focus during TT, but people just flat out spazz if they don't see the same maxed numbers all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You can MGB RC3 if I'm not mistaken.  You can't TGB, but you can MGB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You can MGB RC3 if I'm not mistaken. You can't TGB, but you can MGB.<br />
Nope. If you could that would be great. I like both FA and Blood of Nadox as a nice idea. And I feel the same thing, we SHOULD have something uniquely shaman to MGB. <br />
<br />
It's trivial to group buff even a full raid solo now if you have too, and easy to get each group leader with the raidwindow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I don't think mgb nadox is viable. Something has to have a duration to be a buff to be mass group buffed. Cleric's CE originally had poison and disease cure component in it but they never worked so they just pulled it. A group ferine would be cool and mgb ferine definitely could be handy altho i'm not quite sure I really want that =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I definately could go for something useful to mgb. My guild has 5 shaman at least with MGB and the only thing that we MGB is focus, occasionally tribunal if we need it, STA only if it goes down mid fight (so easy to buff even a full raid with sta without mgb). <br />
<br />
I have actually casted MGB group haste a few times when it went down in the middle of a long fight (like cursed cycle) and the only chanter on didn't have mgb ready.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">i wanna see a cure over time, like cures 6 cure/poison/disease coutners ever tick for several ticks etc, grp fa would pwn too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>krindaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You can only TGB or MGB those group beneficial spells/buffs that have a Buff Icon. That is your rule of thumb to go by. That's why you can MGB Tribunal or Bih'li (as well as the normal Fo7, sta, agi, daiku) but not Blood of Nadox or Tiny Terror etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">right krin but tis is a wishlist so a cure over time would be like a heal over time,thus mgbable</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">mgb fo7 during a fight, hey it's a 544? hp heal and it only costs about 3k mana!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">mgb fo7 during a fight, hey it's a 544? hp heal and it only costs about 3k mana!<br />
<br />
Assuming that no one currently had focus up....... otherwise it would just be a 2.5K mana waste of time to extend the buff that 90% of folks already have... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jorgan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Group FA would be awesome, but for what I'd really like to see, I'm willing to make some compromises:<br />
<br />
My Christmas list from a large raid/few shamans available perspective:<br />
<br />
1)  I would like Infusion of Spirit to overwrite the cleric self-buff line of spells (Armor of the Zealot and its forebears)<br />
<br />
2)  I would like FA to overwrite Aura of the Crusader.<br />
<br />
3)  I would like Wrulon to have a knock back effect and the emote &quot;Someone hears SOE snicker, 'bwahaha, agility!'&quot;<br />
<br />
4)  I would like Primal Essence to have a snare effect, but be able to be cast out of group, perhaps with a pop up box asking the recipient if he really, really wants it.<br />
<br />
I'm a reasonable person and I think these are reasonable requests.  I'm not looking for much, am willing to compromise and sacrifice when necessary. <br />
<br />
Please Santa, I've been good, now let me have a little fun too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shamus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Well, for your case i would say skip MGB because really it's only a Raid type AA.  When you have 50 or more people in a raid MGB is Godly.  For a couple groups it's not really worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Assuming that no one currently had focus up....... otherwise it would just be a 2.5K mana waste of time to extend the buff that 90% of folks already have... :)<br />
<br />
Actually, if they already have focus up, it will overwrite the old focus, refresh the buff, and heal for 544 hp. If they don't have focus up, it will increase their current and maximum hp by 544.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">MGB Charisma, you know you want to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">MGB FD.<br />
<br />
Maybe we can prevent a raid wipe.  That means that we need FD too. :)<br />
<br />
-Finn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Actually, if they already have focus up, it will overwrite the old focus, refresh the buff, and heal for 544 hp.

<br />
Einnod, thanks for that. It is really useful info. I didn't know it would heal for the hp when it refreshed the buff. Not that I will be casting Fo7 as a group heal on a regular occasion but new info is always gratefully received!<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Inner fire is the best heal we had at low levels. Even better then the so called &quot;lesser healing&quot; spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I agree . Look at the &quot;preist classes&quot; Clerics can MGB HoT's ... Druids have MGB Wood &quot;I think thats a HoT with a DS or something&quot; Shamans have no good &quot;In combat&quot; MGB ability .<br />
I mean MGB paragon is a HUGE deal if you really think about it . too call it usefull is a GROSS understatement . I think MGB FA is very viable .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">My guild has 8 shaman and another shaman recruit right now.<br />
I think I've massed FoS once in the past month.<br />
Looks like everyone needs more charisma next raid I'm on.</div></div><hr />
