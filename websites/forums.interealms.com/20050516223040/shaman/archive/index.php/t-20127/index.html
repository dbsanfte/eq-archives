Congrrats to Crimson Talon on Cazic Thule server on their first BErtoxxulous kill!  First night, Crimson went in with 45 men, 3 clerics, and BErtie wiped raid at 49%.  Night two(tonight), raid of 58 (few apps and stragglers from higher guilds needing flag) and something like 6 clerics, walked in, and put Bert down as painfully as possible.  Second attempt for us and we are Non-VT/Elemental/Ssra.<br />
<br />
Massive adrenaline rush after killing him..insane fun had by all, including our monkey pull teams who managed to die on each pull and still be rezzed righ tback with a grin on their face!<br />
<br />
Congrats on a first for us at Crimson Talon!</div></div><hr />
