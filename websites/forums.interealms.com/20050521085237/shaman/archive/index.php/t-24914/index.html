Enjoy, it makes EQ2 looks pretty decent. Makes me wanna play it casualy along with WoW</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My God, a positive report about EQ2 written by FoH?<br />

It has always been kind of laughable to me that people are impressed by a guild in Everquest.<br />
<br />
FoH status has been elevated so high that I wouldn't doubt if someone over there was getting paid by soe to promote eq2.</div></div><hr />

Come on, you can do better than what I have seen so far.</div></div><hr />

permafrost is permadown, befallen is becrashin.<br />
<br />
the game is so unstable, to top it off the game is once again CLERIC dependant.<br />
you don't do jack **** unless one of them logs on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nobody's going to discuss the screenshots? I think they look surprisingly good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I dont think there was any doubt EQ2 would be pretty, but me personaly im of the mindset that i would rather have a zmud that was fun to play then a high end graphicaly pretty 3d game that was boring and crappy.<br />
<br />
Not saying that eq2 is that, just placing them in order of important to me.<br />
<br />
But as far as the bugs and crashes, i kinda expected that cause it was my understanding that the game wasnt ready yet, they didnt even complete the beta stages, however it was needed, if they didnt get the jump on Blizzard i think they would have hurt for it. The game is on the shelves, people are spending their money and if they work hard they will have a potential  player base before WoW hits shelves. They took the first swing, i wonder if Blizz will answer back. This puts the pressure on them to simply be the superior product and since they are the new guy fighting a game that has years of history and backround and fans, itll be tough.<br />
<br />
Either way, this should bode well for us the consumer, you have 2 gaming giants battling it out and the better game will be the winner and will be stronger cause of the competition.<br />
<br />
<br />
So WoW fan or EQ2 fan, looks like a good future for us :)</div></div><hr />

i wonder how many toadies put thier names in this one, i can't wait to see &quot;rytan's balance to shamans the  chain boots of nihillism&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
EQ2 died befor it even hit beta, they used all the profits from EQ1 to make SWG, then milked both games for EQ2, its only a few months befor they start milking EQ2 for &quot;SWG2 !!&quot;</div></div><hr />

Come on, you can do better than what I have seen so far.<br />
<br />
<br />
A friend of mine played a warrior during the closed beta and he said they were the complete opposite of EQ warriors.  Supposedly because Furor had a lot of input on their creation.  My friend mentioned it was really hard for him to die given all the abilities and talents warriors had.  I don't know if much has changed since the closed beta.<br />
<br />
I'm going to start a rogue this weekend when I get a chance to log in to the open beta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ok, some of the environmental shots especially are great.  No doubt.<br />
<br />
But:  A - I'm one of the many people who doesn't have a system that would properly support this game if I even wanted to play it.<br />
<br />
B - character models while being much fancier than EQ and more detailed have also taken a step back.  A large one.  You have tons of races and from everything I have seen everyone has the same basic boring humanoid build, with varying bulk, height etc.<br />
<br />
I mean they stuck a bloody lizard head on a human body for Iksar...  hello that's the way the original run Star Trek used to do aliens...  *** kind of cheap junk is that?  I'm speaking specifically from a design complex.  I loved that Iksar were at least somehow different, still quite humanoid but EQ2 has only made them moreso and it's total JANK to me.<br />
<br />
Bland cookie cutter uncreative artwork and design on that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Furors just a minor quest writer, at least at the moment, don't give him too much credit. And I'd be more worried about the other guy they hired for the same position, and ex Horizons dev.<br />
<br />
There's no shortage of EQ2 fanboy's on the FoH pages. I still think the game is way under-impressive for what SOE should have been capable of. It's not a bad game, it's just not nearly as good as it should have been given the time and money that went in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I guess I haven't had the same luck as others. I have played it since the day it came out and my server hasn't crashed a single time. They have come down for scheduled stuff, but never crash out of the blue. I have been playing mostly on Blackburrow.<br />
<br />
I think the game is amazing looking. I don't have the best computer in the world, but it runs decent on most settings medium and some high. I have played both WoW and EQ2 and imo, WoW can be just as laggy. In fact, I have crashed twice while playing WoW and none while playing EQ2.<br />
<br />
I think WoW is fun as well. There are tons of quests and its cartoony with that fun feeling. I'm definitely going to play both for a while to see which one turns out being more fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">EQ also crashed what seemed like every few minutes at release and it took quite awhile to get the game relatively stable during peak hours.  Hopefully, SOE has learned a few things in the past 5 years and game stability won't be an issue for long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ranlron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">They have come down for scheduled stuff, but never crash out of the blue. <br />
<br />
Why would there be scheduled stuff the 1st week of release? That's a rhetorical question btw. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Why would there be scheduled stuff the 1st week of release? That's a rhetorical question btw. :P<br />
There's &quot;scheduled months in advanced&quot; scheduled.  This is major feature updates and large, non-critical, bug fixes.<br />
<br />
There's &quot;coming down in two hours&quot; scheduled.  This is usually for game breaking bugs (e.g. Bards after most of the above patches in the first three years of EQ).  These patches aren't really planned or wanted, but they still involve the operations team bringing the servers down at a planned time.  You try and avoid these down-times as much as you can, but accept the fact that they are going to happen (which is not the same as saying they are acceptable when they do).<br />
<br />
Lastly there's server crashes.  These aren't scheduled.  You try and avoid these at all costs.<br />
<br />
So, to answer you (rhetorical) question; there are scheduled patches during the first week because there are bugs that weren't caught in beta that can't wait for the first previously scheduled patch.  If they are scheduled an hour in advance, they are still scheduled.  <br />
<br />
The fact that they are happening could be a sign that the product wasn't tested fully.  If WoW doesn't have those kind of problems when it goes live, then it might say something for the relative length of it's beta program over EQ2's.  If WoW has these same kind of patches week one (or worse, server crashes), I guess it may proove that perhaps SOE had the right idea (push it live and deal with it).</div></div><hr />

<br />
If anyone has a Furor comment on the latest warrior taunt (or lack thereof) changes, I'd *love* to see it.  Bliz had a rationale behind it that was very Sony-esque.  My warrior is being out aggro'd by a shaman (*gasp*) and I hate it hehe.  Warriors miss like crazy on mobs more than 2 levels above them whilst spells still hit and draw aggro.  It's horrid.  Can't believe Furor would let those changes in.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, it was all due to PvP whiners too.  When will a game company realize you can't balance PvE and PvP with the same ruleset... grrrrrr....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The warrior taunt changes are excellent. Increase the agro generated by normal actions so you can decrease the dependance on spamming taunt. Which means taunt becomes a reaction ability. It was also done so a warrior can't lock down as many mobs, which they want to avoid so gameplay isn't as static.<br />
<br />
They may well have screwed up on the balance, but the logic is sound and shows the depth of thought that SOE can't manage these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Fair enough.  I understood their logic, I just havent seen it played out yet.  Other players are going to have to get smarter about aggro-management or they will die.  That's fine with me.  Coming from EQ we know this, new people to the genre might not.<br />
<br />
BTW, the patch preview shows they are removing the rage cost on taunt and improving defensive stance!  Yay!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Whoever said that WoW's quest system was dumbed down, needs to seriously consider what they consider a &quot;smart&quot; quest system.<br />
<br />
Last night, I did a quest that required me to kill a Zhevra (zebra), take its carcass to an old dead tree, and lay it on the ground.  From around the tree came walking a named Raptor, whom I had to kill to prove my strength.  That quest was worlds above any quest I ever had in EQ, or any of the ones I had in the EQ2 beta, or any game I've ever played, and it was just 1 quest.  If Furor wrote that quest, I'd have more respect for him than all his days in EQ.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like the quest for Vah Shir to free the spirit locked in the stone in the pit beneath Shar Vahl, at least from a mechanics perspective.</div></div><hr />

The screen shots loot ok, but what about the game play?  How is it any different from EQ?<br />

I don't play a game for eye candy....Hell, I've had the sound turned off of EQ for years now as well...I play for content.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Tenjhai - you must have some crazy luck.  I have never yet played EQ2 without having the server go down, or half the zone booted at least once during my session (I'm also on the Blackburrow server).<br />
<br />
It's pretty hilarious that I regularly get kicked out of (or can't log into, like now, &quot;unable to locate test server&quot;) the game I'm paying for, and end up logging into the WoW stresstest beta, because it's MORE STABLE.<br />
<br />
/boggle<br />
<br />
EQ2 feels like a beta test, much more so than the beta I'm currently in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Bufr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Server crashs seem population related. Given the great success EQII seems to be enjoying most of its first wave server are buried by their population. I switched to Oggok last Friday. Other than scheduled downtimes the server has never crashed nor have people been booted. (At least to my knowledge.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">When will companies learn to anticipate opening day server issues?  Maybe EQII wasn't anticipating a huge success and a huge rush to play?? ;)  You'd think they'd have learned from SWG, it's the same company fore pete's sake, or maybe from every other MMORPG's release.  DAoC was about the smoothest I can recall.  I think WoW has experienced as harsh a stress test as they could with the open beta sign ups, so hopefully they will handle release a bit better than the rest... we'll see.<br />

<br />
Kithicor is same way....I think I have been booted once, maybe twice since the game came live. Heck, I leave my vendor on all night and hes still there when I wake up. <br />
<br />
I hear horror stories about how often mistmoor crashes though...hopefuly they do a movelog soon.</div></div><hr />
