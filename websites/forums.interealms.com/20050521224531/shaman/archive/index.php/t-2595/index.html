<br />
Ok...I was reading another post, and the guy says that &quot;For a weapon I'd get spine chill spear, or howling harpoon, and slime coated harpoon for range.&quot;<br />
<br />
Can someone explain range to me? From what I had read, I thought Range was &quot;throwing&quot;...I wouldn't want to purchase a &quot;slime coated harpoon&quot; or any other item, only to throw it away. <br />
<br />
What am I not understanding here?<br />

<br />
I'm not even sure if the weapons you mention are throwable; there are quite a few items which are equippable in the range slot, but don't have a listed range; such items can't be thrown.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Do shaman even have a throwing skill? I don't think we could throw something if we really really wanted to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I thought you could throw them on accident if you were charmed...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We do have throwing.  I don't know if we can train in it, but we can hotkey it and throw things.<br />
<br />
So far, charming hasn't made me throw a weap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yeah I can throw summoned shattering hammers. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hehe, i said that, yeah, on the slime coated harpoon(can go in range) you get 5 wis and some mana, 50, i think. You can alos put a howling harpoon in range, but not the spine chill spear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">OK! So it's in the slot for stats only...I get it now!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I dont think you can throw a magical weapon, or something like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Eclectik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No range listed=no throwing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">A long long time ago, almost the only item that could go in the range slot were throwing items or bows.  There were a few weapons that could go in the range slot for stats, but not many (runed bone fork for example for 10mr fr cr).  When Kunark came out many many more items were able to be put in the range slot.  The problem that happened, though, was that most of those weapons also had a range: X which indicated how far away you can throw it at a mob.  Probably after many people petitioning about losing items from range slot due to accidently throwing items, or from being charmed and throwing them away, Verant removed the range: X value so you cannot throw the weapons at all.  They realized that no player in their right mind would ever throw an item from range slot that is there solely for the stats.<br />
<br />
FYI some items have stats that will go in the ammo slot too, but you don't receive any stat bonuses from items there.  The shissar fangs from Ssra temple are a good example of this.  Best ammo slot items I can think of in the game are summoned coldstones from mages, or the fungal fluid thing from Fungus Grove with 10 charges of snare.</div></div><hr />

Mr Garrison: &quot;Yes Eric?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cartman: &quot;Why do po people smell like sour milk?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr Garrison: &quot;I don't know Eric - they just do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cartman: &quot;Oh.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr Garrison: &quot;And remember class, there are no stupid questions, only stupid people.&quot;</div></div><hr />
