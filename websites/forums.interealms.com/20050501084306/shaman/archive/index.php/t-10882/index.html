<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I jsut asking all you shammies out there where can  i find a correct list of shaman spells/there effect/where they drop or where they're sold. I was using eqshaman but that way off. 43 shaman bte getting to 44 soon (finally, i get to raid with guild!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Casters realmn has an accurate list of spells ... not accurate on where to get them.  For npc drop spells look under the spells forumn here.  There is a very good list on which npc drop drop various spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">casters realm http://eq.crgaming.com has a nice listing but a lot of the spell information is out of date. They have replenishment listed as 400 mana when it's actually 275 for example. People can comment on the spells too making for some amusing reading like the guy that claims the 61 pet hits for 73 lol.<br />
<br />
Lucy http://lucy.fnord.net doesn't have the nicely organized listing like CR nor  comments from players but all the spell info is up to date.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dissonant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Casters Realm doesn't have the correct imbues for shaman either.  We get disease, war and justice... they have something different, but don't feel like looking it up :p<br />
<br />
Other than that, it's a pretty good list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In effect, Lucy gives you a full list:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have a list here (http://www.nytmare.org/eq/shamanspellvendors.htm) that shows where to buy the vendor-sold spells.<br />
This forum has a sticky thread here (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=23) for where dropped spells drop.<br />
And as said, Lucy (http://lucy.fnord.net/) gives the most accurate data on effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>iamagator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">....in other words, there is no SINGLE place to get an up to date, comprehensive, reliable listing of Shaman spells  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">have you tried Shaman of Justice (http://www.planeteq.com/shaman) ? I'm trying to keep it up to date to the best of my abilities, any problems just email me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lucy.fnord.net is actually perfectly accurate, it's a direct parse of the database.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>iamagator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">correct me if i'm wrong but Lucy has spells listed that aren't actually even in the game yet (and perhaps never will).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Fuudce:  Just checked out shaman of justice, very well done!</div></div><hr />

correct me if i'm wrong but Lucy has spells listed that aren't actually even in the game yet (and perhaps never will). <br />
<br />
The link that Roxxanne put up only shows the spells that are classed as live, and so should be in the game. Granted we may not know where to find them (Donlo's Dementia the group shrink) but, it is correct.<br />
<br />
Also Fuudce's site gives you a good breakdown of the spells and where you can buy them from a Barbarian perspective. If you are not a Barb then check out Nytmares link for where to buy them for your race.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bufflo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">http://www.eqshaman.com/spells/allspells.html<br />
<br />
Only has up til ancient spells, but it gives you good info on most of the spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">thnx, ill use lucy, i know about the site but never jotted down the adress, btw the eqshaman one hasnt been updated and some spell info is inaccurate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Briony</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Haleice, do you mean where to find Donolo's Dementia other than on the Umbracite Swarm Orb from VT?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">iamagator<br />
<br />
You're thinking about Castersrealm, they have spells listed that don't exist anymore. Lucy really is correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Originally posted by Briony <br />
Haleice, do you mean where to find Donolo's Dementia other than on the Umbracite Swarm Orb from VT? <br />
<br />
Yep I know it's an on the Orb, but wasn't it supposed to be a level 55 spell too isn't it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">between caster's realm and lucy I can find what I need.  Lucy is great for raw data.<br />
<br />
Lucy has not just all spells but spell effects.  So for example you can look up an item focus or a &quot;spell&quot; that only a specific mob uses.  It's quite helpful.<br />
<br />
Donlo's Dementia does not exist as a spell scroll.  Only on the Orb, which I was fortunate enough to get a week or two ago actually =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Briony</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Haleice-- yeah, rumor was group shrink was gonna appear with PoP, but like Khura's mending, it got cut from what I understand.  Irked me, shrinks are mandatory on our raids, and can get to be a real hassle at times.  MGBable shrink would really help there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">personaly i dont trust castersrealm at all, they have some info but a LOT of there spell info is very wrong.  only thing lucy doesnt have is spell drop location which is on this board, on the other sites people have linked.</div></div><hr />
