<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eorendil</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, last night when I got on Underbrush was in Kedge.  I soon joined him there and was treated to a few lessons on the inner workings of Kedge (and I definately plan on a return visit) while we (more he than I) camped the south room.  We chatted for a bit about various thing, especially Kedge as a few spawns cycled.  I knew his time was valuable and was not at all disappointed when he said there'd be one more spawn before he had to go work on other things.  My middle name is now &quot;lucky&quot; cause that last spawn was the Goldenhaired Mermaid.  Needless to say I was ecstatic and with many thanks headed off to Freeport where I acquired the mane attraction, returned to Faydwer and traded it the vain little Mr. Featherhead for the fairy wing. <br />
<br />
I arrived at the fairy village in Lesser Fay just in time to see the guard go into the little house but she came back out.  I guess the Princess wasn't feeling good that day.  Having accomplished a great deal I got some much needed rest and when I woke up (checked in this morning just to see) there was Princess Joleena.  Upon giving her the wing she happily rewarded me with a bag of golden fairy dust.  <br />
<br />
Unfortunately for me my first attempt to talk to Kinool met with disaster (I guess I was so excited I hit the attack key in error) and he chased me all the way to Kaladim.  I was far more humble and gracious the second time and he seemed to respond much better to my inquiries.  After giving him all that he requested I had a short wait and then the my transformed Trueshot, now Rain Caller, was reverantly placed in my hands.<br />
<br />
I am now the proud owner of the Rain Caller bow.  Special thanks go to Ladas, Telloran and Underbrush for their willingness to help with that wiley goldenhaired mermaid.  Extra Special thanks go to Underbrush for the lesson on Kedge. :D<br />
<br />
Thank you everyone.  My new middle name is &quot;lucky&quot;;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry I wasn't on last night. I had intentions of logging on since Morrowind is kinda buggy on WinXP and it's starting to annoy me but other things came up. If you need any help with anything else (Ivy Etched quests possibly?) I'd be happy to help out if I'm not busy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hebuorn</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yea gratz waiting to get mine soon hopefully</div></div><hr />

<br />
Panic moment, I go LD and Eorendil was in the hall outside of Goldie's room. I'm worried that the server went down and I've left a 30 ranger in a location that is certain death to swim up from. Thankfully I was able to connect quickly and rejoin without crisis.</div></div><hr />

I had forgotten about that thing...  Grats on the bow, as was mentioned, as much a rite of passage as anything else these days.  Every new (non-twink) ranger should have one of these in their future.  :)</div></div><hr />
