<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Medican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This morning I was fighting a few mobs and after them I decidedto sit down and let my regens heal me while I get mana and do some RL stuff. When I cam back I only got back lik 15% of HP. I had 3 regens to my knowledge: natural troll regen, regnation spell, and the bear spell. So why did my Hp go up so slow? i was gone for like 5 or 10 mins. Is something wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm...well.  As a troll, if you are sitting and at level 29 (which I think I remember you saying in another thread somewhere) you should be getting 6hp/tic.  Add to that the 5hp/tic from regen and you're at 11hp/tic.<br />
<br />
You say you were gone for &quot;5 or 10 mins&quot;.  Lets take half that spread, so 7min 30 secs.  There are 10 tics in a minute, so you are looking at about 75 tics there.  At 11hp/tic thats 825 hp.<br />
<br />
You also had bear form going.  Thats another 1hp/tic.  Add the 75hp from that to the other total and we get 900 hp.<br />
<br />
If 900 hp is only 15% of your total hp pool that means that you have roughly 6000 hp.  At level 29.  wow.  That puts all shaman everywhere to shame.  <br />
<br />
Im thinking that you were not gone nearly as long as you think you were.  I suppose it is possible that you got caught in some kind of bug where you didnt recieve any updates from the server during that 5 to 10 minutes, but if that were the case the client would have most likely decided that you werent online anymore and caused LD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Medican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm pretty sure it was at 10 mins or so because during that time I made my toast which is at least 5 mins and got the water boiling to make some hot chocolate and that usually takes me 10 mins.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it was a bug becuase my bar was going wild: yellow and red the whole time.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think in total there is the follow max possible forms of regen:<br />
<br />
1. race regen<br />
2. our regenation line of spells<br />
3. illusion regen<br />
4. worn regen<br />
5. our potion regenation line<br />
6. possible hitpoint buffs such as skinlike nature regen (from druids)<br />
7. beastlord hp/mana regen buff<br />
8. Bard song<br />
<br />
which all stack</div></div><hr />

If yes, you may have been attacked while you were away and your pet killed it before you got back.  No loot would mean the corpse would rot in 30 seconds so there would be no body to find either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">health and mana regen stop when you're out of food. Another possible solution.</div></div><hr />
