<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Crocodillia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I leveled my shammy in Dawnshroud Peaks from 29 to 39. Grouped until 34, but once I got pet, it was time to solo. There is a little valley half way between the Grieg's End zone and the mushroom house. I parked pet here and buffed with SoW, Talisman, Haste, Regen, and Dex ( I like my REIF to proc a lot ). Pull with slow and tank for pet. I would come out of fights about 20% health down and about 20% mana down. If you have a horse/droggy you can cut med time in half if you canni mounted. If you don't have decent gear, try buffing more. I fizzled Fury too much to use it all the time, hehe. By the time you are 37 you should be able to chain pull with very little down time.<br />
<br />
If you worship CT like yours truly, you can do the Disciple Symbol of Cazic-Thule quest in Paineel. Taking a little time to become amiable to Paineel is a small price to pay for a clicky panic animal amulet. Didn't have a snare but there are no adds here so I would just click and go...38 to 39 I chain pulled with NO down time what-so-ever due to my little fear toy. On a side note, if you worship Inny, now would be a good time to do your Regent Symbol of Innoruuk for a clicky snare amulet ( clinging darkness ).<br />
<br />
Dawnshroud may not have been the fastest and best place to level, but if you are a casual player like me, it may work for you. I like to log on for 2 hours or so before I go to bed so I don't want to spend a half hour running somewhere before I can even start exping. Being only two zones from the Nexus, this was perfect for me, and with occasional drops of acrylia ore from the tribal gatherers, I was able to finance my level 39 spells and start alchemy. Over all, it took about 10 hours of play to go from 34 to 39. Good luck to you all, and much trull love!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>chilekiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Good guy but trust me u should be an innky worshipping troll because the regent symbol of innoruuk has the necro snare/DoT effect....cast fear and your kiting all the way to the planes! Plus that the regent and slam makes trolls the best shammy's on Norrath!!!<br />

&quot;. On Rallos Zek, death can come at anytime, from any direction. Keep your eyes open and keep a eye on the zone lists.&quot;---Budaddar 51st Barb Shaman Rallos Zek(not me)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lethe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I love the south wall of DSP. You can get a group at GE zone if you want, you can pull from mushroom house if you like that. (I pull with malaise, which means no adds.)<br />
<br />
Then you can get tribals when mushrooms get boring. Don't do too many tribals before you are bored with shrooms though, they sometimes path all the way up to the east entrance to shroom house.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ghobster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm, I dont even need pet to solo. I just malosi, root, disease + poison dot and wait till they run out and recast. <br />
<br />
I would usually be in bear form and have regeneration casted on myself and health buff and SOW, of course. I come out of fights...nearly fm and fh :)</div></div><hr />
