<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ipkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am an old EQ player who quit before SoL came out.  I just bought SoL, PoP, and LoY and will be back on Prexus soon.  Verant has assuerd me that my 51 shaman is still there awaiting my return :)<br />
<br />
What kind of major changes am I looking at?  What new spells do I need to know about?  What kind of equipment do I need now?  Here's my profile from Allakhazam: http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/userinfo.html?char=28836<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I tried that link:<br />
<br />
&quot;Character does not exist or is private.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lots new, plenty of spells - check the spells list at Alla's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">With SoL, and the introduction of the Bazaar zone, trading with other players has become much easier.<br />
<br />
I can safely say that you will be needing to upgrade every single item that you are currently wearing, and thanks to the bazaar, and the 15k plat that you have, you should be able to get started immediately (and I do mean each and every slot)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Prepared to be shocked :) Sounds like you quit around the same time I did, only I came back last november. Changes off the top of my head:<br />
<br />
- No more hell levels<br />
- No more spamming shout/ooc in EC for goods, the bazaar is your friend<br />
- Easy travel with PoP books<br />
- Pets are not KOS unless already engaged in battle<br />
- Pets immediately back off from mezzed mobs<br />
- Pets always summon at maximum level instead of a range of levels<br />
- Pets can dual wield when given two weapons<br />
- A 2+ hour c3 spell called KEI<br />
- Slows casted on players by mobs can be removed with our cure/abolish disease spells instead of dispelling the crap out of them.<br />
- Alternate Advancement (AA)<br />
<br />
Lots lots more..<br />
<br />
Oh and just about everybody uses magelo now(www.magelo.com) to list the eqiupment on their toons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">for a bit of history on game changes you can check out the patch archive at casters realm.<br />
<br />
http://eq.crgaming.com/patches.asp<br />
<br />
<br />
check out Lucy - http://lucy.fnord.net/ for spell lists.<br />
<br />
check out Magelo for equipment profiles ( http://www.magelo.com ) - on the equipment front, WIS is out, HP is in.  Ditch that velium wis jewelry.  ;)<br />
<br />
Also on the equipment front, focus items.<br />

<br />
You can now customize your Everquest UI.<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/<br />
<br />
If you buy Shadows of Luclin expansion, you get the nexus and the bazaar system.  The bazaar is a place where you can sell your items to other players while you are AFK.<br />
<br />
If you buy Planes of Power - use the book system in POK for easy travel.<br />
<br />
If you buy Legacy of Ykesha - download an awesome set of maps for their mapping feature.<br />
