<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering, what do you guys prefer for all arround hunting, 60+, necro or SK? Will be going to some raids, some exp farming, and some old world farming with one or the other, just not sure which would be a better choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Overall, I prefer a necro, but for tougher stuff a SK is probably a better duo partner. There isn't much a necro and shaman can't do... if the **** hits the fan, the necro can always feign, then res you back :p</div></div><hr />

exp mobs in pop typically (in my experience):<br />
<br />
-have 50000000000000000000 hp<br />
-hit VERY hard<br />
-are snarable<br />
-don't summon<br />
<br />
- a necro can easily push 150 sustainable dps at 63 with their rogue pet (and 100dps pre 63) and a couple spells - what's a typical sk gonna be? 50 - 70dps - unless the SK is quite exceptional, the necro would be douing roughly double the damage - and since you can kite stuff you can spend more mana beating the crap out of stuff and less mana healing your tank - sustainable dps is the only issue when you can kite<br />
- doesn't mater how hard mobs hit when you're kiting them around with snare<br />
<br />
sometimes i think pop mobs were designed just for necros (or chanters)<br />
<br />
when you need a tank, SK wins - sure.. but exp grinding, you don't need a tank.. plus SKs have gimp mana regen.. they'd need to go to nexus every 2 hours to get a kei or something<br />
<br />
my main is a necro, and no other class works better with us than a shaman, which is why i'm leveling one up now..<br />
<br />
as for old world stuff, the 61 necro pet is an awesome tank on anything that hits for 150-200 damage, when you're landing 75% slows</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd have to agree with necro, for 60+ PoP exp.  Mobs just hit too hard, and while you can keep the SK alive, it really drains your mana, and doesn't let you focus on doing much damage (meaning even longer fights).  Root dotting is generally much more efficient, and necros are vastly superior at that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have a 45 SK on a 2nd account i'm levelling up<br />
<br />
I'm really not interested in min-maxing, I made him to dish out some melee damage and to have a compliment as far as utility goes .. and if i ever get Q .. it should become fairly easy to keep the Sk running even in pop</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nazzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nerco's are the only way to go.  I have grouped with my friends nerco for the last 10 levels now 52-62 so far.  Between the two pets and the necro's dot's and the shaman dots you can take down most mobs with ease.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Necro DPS &gt; SK DPS. Necros are low-maintenance. Necros have more tricks up their sleeves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shadow Knights have some of the best mana regen of all the classes.  Shaman and Necromancers are the only two I would say that have greater.  Pact of Hate has the same mana regeration as KEI. The recent changes to mental corruption when combined with the Soul Abrasion AA can net vast amounts of mana. SKs get the Mental Clairity AA abilities as well and have access to a great number of Flowing Thought items.<br />
<br />
Higher end Shadow Knights can put out some very respectable DPS as well all though it does drop off considerably when tanking (due to riposte/parry/dodge etc of the mobs.)  The latest SK pet is a pure monster and with Augmentation of Death he is a buzzsaw. The new spears coupled with fast running high DPS dots and great offensive new AA (Speed of the Knight, Knights Advantage) really allow them to push the upper ends of DPS.<br />
<br />
Having said that a Necromancer would be a great partner for exping.  They can snare split, FD have great DPS and in a pinch ressurect as well :)<br />
<br />
Do not sell any class short, there are many people out there who will suprise you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">At 63 SK's get this spell that gives FT10 to everyone in the group, and at 64 they get a lich spell that's just as good as KEI.  Duo'ing with this SK works very well.  Before he hit 63, and was too lazy to get a KEI duo'ing with a necromancer was clearly better.  <br />
<br />
Overall, I would say it's situational.  If you are somewhere where you don't have to pull far, like the corners in Plane of Disease, then the necro is better.  If you end up having to pull long distances, like in PoV, then having the SK pull would be better.  Of course duo'ing stuff in PoV isn't really an option, I thought I'd throw that out as a for instance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">SK is good when mob summon or not enough safe room; but SK need to get Virtue+ KEI to be good<br />
<br />
Necro is limit to spot, a good spot mean they can solo there almost same good without duo with you, plus better exp rate without you</div></div><hr />
