It's also possible that pigs will fly out of my a55 or I'll be shacking up with a Jenny McCarthy - Monica Belluci tandem tonight, but I ain't squatting over a frying pan or making a run to the store to stack up on condoms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't want to be negative, since this is a good start(can we call it a start 2 weeks from Omens release?), so I'll just say that this is close enough to what we have been asking for direct healing wise. <br />
<br />
Add the Spirit Shifting AA and raise the Shaman DPS(both DD and DoT wise by lowering resists and raising the actual damage to be on par with the upgrades other classes got) and you solved most issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ancient spells should be upgrades, period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">all priest get an ancient heal spell. but it is about the right amount atleast, depends how hard ancient are to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I am kinda hoping the Ancients are going tobe on a Quest based system instead of dropped. Sorta like LoY spells, but harder, maybe. That would work for me. Its hard to tell, honestly. And the DID make wholesle changes to Gates spells, even after its release. <br />
<br />
I am getting more and more optomistic. Either way, I doubt the issues with Shaman in OoW will be severe enough to force me out. If Gates hasnt made me quit,   then OoW, in its current form, isnt gonna. And personally, I think its going to get better. I can see our Curse DOT being adjusted upward, and perhaps even our fast nuke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Guess I jumped the gun on this. <br />
I thought that they were closing the gap between the priests some by giving Shamans a better ancient heal and leaving the other two priests' heals as they were.<br />
<br />
Raising the heal spells for all priests across the board is not helping us one bit. It's actually making things worse.<br />
<br />
That's what you get for being optimistic. They(my buddy Rytan) just don't realize that we need &quot;fixes&quot;.<br />
<br />
As far as DoTs and DDs go, Blazz, I am afraid that, *if* Rytan bumped ours he would bump everyone elses' as well, which basically accomplishes nothing.<br />
<br />
The guys over at SoE are ****ing stupid.<br />
<br />
4150 &gt; 2660 &gt; 1965<br />
<br />
100 &gt; 64 &gt; 47<br />
<br />
Good job, Rytan. Hope they pay you with bananas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You know i think i figured out sony on one point. I think the ancient spell system is a way to shut us up without giving us what we really want and ask for. They put these spells in the game that we beg for and put them in a place 95% of us will never get so they can say &quot; well we gave you what you want, you guys are never happy, thats why we arent giving this other thing you want&quot;.<br />
<br />
I know its a lil conspericy theory, but its just seems to fit so perfectly, mostly cause if i was sick of hearing people complain how they dont get the upgrades they want, but disagree with the upgrade they want, this is what i would do.<br />
<br />
Makes ya think. Sadder part is it doesnt even matter if im right cause no one is going to ban together and make a stink about it, we dont have the unity, so basicly it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The sad thing is that they aren't even giving us what we want via ancients. <br />
They probably just noticed that Clerics needed better healing to keep up with the damage NPCs will do in Omens and therefore adjusted the other priests' heals accordingly.<br />
<br />
They basically underlined that their 100/64/47 formula for healing is here to stay and perfectly fine. Anyone, who thinks healing is balanced, is mentally retarded, period. Rytan needs help, badly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Along with that 100/..../47 garbage they have kept to the same mana to hitpoints healed penalty:<br />
<br />
Cleric: Ancient Hallowed Light<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6140&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
4150 for 775 =  5.35 per mana<br />
<br />
Druid: Ancient Chlorobon<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6141&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
2660 for 665 =  4 per mana<br />
<br />
Shaman: Ancient Wilsliks Mending<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6142&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
1965 for 585 =  3.36 per mana<br />
<br />
But remember, these are the ancients. Top of the line, class excelling spells. For the majority, the new heals are:<br />
<br />
Cleric: Pious Light<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5265&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
3770 for 740 =  5.1 per mana<br />
<br />
Druid: Chlorotrope<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5355&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
2420 for 627 =  3.86 per mana<br />
<br />
Shaman: Yoppa's Mending<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5395&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
1785 for 558 =  3.2 per mana<br />
<br />
So how else does this really pan out for shaman and druids?<br />
<br />
Just looking at the regular versions, the &quot;100/64/47&quot; rule applies. 3770 = 100; 2420 = 64; 1785 = 47. Now if we compare cost of casting to equal the cleric heal of 3770 (note - this ignores the inherent 10% cleric heal benefit as well as any aa/focus effects; just dealing with base numbers for a bare minimum view of the variances in mana cost):<br />
<br />
Druid: at 3.86 hitpoints per mana healed = 977 mana to heal 3770 = 32% more mana to heal the same number of hitpoints.<br />
<br />
Shaman: at 3.2 hitpoints per mana healed = 1178 mana to heal 3770 = 59% more mana to heal the same number of hitpoints.<br />
<br />
The discrepancy between healing is not a singular element. It is not just how much a heal &quot;heals&quot; it is also about how much a heal &quot;costs.&quot; On both ends - shaman are being minimized in this role to a greater extent. Considering the cost of casting, if the situation presents itself where shaman can actually keep up with incoming damage by chain casting these heals, they will soon find themselves unable to keep up with incoming damage because of their mana pools. It is a lose-lose situation.<br />
<br />
So, the tradition continues. The double whammy of minimal heals comes with the price of minimized efficiency. Their really is no logic to this. Minimize the ability to deliver higher value heals - that is a done deal, apparently regardless of all arguments, parses, rational, well thought out points made to the contrary. But compensate the minimization by - at the very least - equalizing the efficiency of the heal cost. Or explain why it is necessary to have this dual limitation as a part of game balance.<br />
<br />
At the very least ... were they listening ... had a clue ... gave a damn ... the hipoint per heal:mana ratio would be equal already. It is not like this would be that big of a bone to toss. It is not like shaman are not doing anything else in a group except healing. It is not like shaman are not already strapped with the highest mana cost, lowest efficiency set of spells in the game in every other &quot;skill&quot; are they have. <br />
<br />
If this were done, the shaman heal would cost 370-380 mana; druid cost 495-510. At least then there is an argument that on a basic level healing was even ... druids just need to cast more often and shaman need faster than is possible.<br />
<br />
Here is an amusing side note: Cleric and Shaman Ancient versions are level 70 spells. Regular versions are level 68. Druid Ancient and regular are ... level 68. No big deal, at least to me. Just an ironic observation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">So both our canni upgrade and our healing upgrade are Ancients?  <br />
<br />
That would be remarkable.  This batch of developers has no clue how this game functioned when it was running great.<br />
<br />
I was more optimistic about Omens, but I'm losing steam on that.  <br />
<br />
People are really tired of retarded spell acquisition BS.  At least, this person is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Its for reasons like this that i am seriously thinking of ditching the shaman for a beastlord. We can't heal to the point where i don't need another healer in my bot mix so why not get a slower who provides something more like dps and buffs that I really want like beastlord crack. Sony is killing the shaman class, and knows it and doesn't care. We can solo mobs 5-6 expansions old that virtually every other class but pure melees can at 65 so we must be overpowered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">So both our canni upgrade and our healing upgrade are Ancients?  <br />
<br />
the ancient canni (lvl 65) is available as a regular spell about 2? levels later, so thats not so bad. The heal is a different problem, it is what we would need it in GoD, not as an ancient in OOW. And I do not believe that there will be any change to the way ancients are aquired. They will be in the one locked zone that requires your guild to have gone through all of GoD (which I understand it is going to be).<br />
<br />
Whoever invented this 100/64/47 formula and then declared it to be gospel should be fired. It is not possible to lock down numers based on one expanstion (Luclin) that has a diametrically opposed combat philosophy and stick to that gospel in an expansion that is clearly the absolute opposite (GoD). It is simple unprofessional, I can t understand what the developers are thinking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">the ancient canni (lvl 65) is available as a regular spell about 2? levels later, so thats not so bad. <br />
sorry, just saw there is another canni coming as ancient at lvl 70, so I have to take that back. Canni as ancient sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just wait till you find out that you can't use both canni spells together....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">100/xx/xx is pointless.<br />
<br />
Unless they're basing that off of a Cleric healing a tank off of an unslowed MoB, Cleric healing is balanced with our slows in mind as well.<br />
<br />
Or maybe I just need coffee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">As long as there is a new canni in between 4 and the ancient at 70, then I could care less. This is exactly what ancients should be, upgrades to spells that are already adequate in their &quot;common&quot; format. Canni 4 is far too weak, but the lvl 68 one looks fine. Having the lvl 70 Ancient is just convience, not balance. Besides, depending on the final re-use time for the Spirit Channeling AA, I may actually not have a Canni memmed for the first time since I can remember. <br />
<br />
The heal is is a different story however. We SHOULD be getting that heal in our normal progression. Instead of a heal, I recommend the other Ancient be a DOT upgrade or a FA upgrade, similar to the upgrades in Luclin. A longer lasting FA isnt balancing, its convienence, just like the canni.</div></div><hr />
