<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SamTheMan67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was surfin the web when I saw this..<br />
For example, today I logged in, summoned a Fungi Tunic and my epic weapon, made myself level 65 with 100 AA points, soloed Innoruuk, then threw the Fungi Tunic and epic weapon away.. because there are so many better items in the game! <br />
<br />
Wierd , I was wondering what is an everquest emulator and is it legal??..Not exactly sure what this is so don't flame me to bad<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">an emulator is a program that simulates the real program.  Basically, its like running fake EQ.  Perfectly legal, and not against EULA.  With the emu you can load zones and mobs and gear and such and screw around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Where could one find such a program?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>steveo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">http://www.eqemu.net/<br />
<br />
Dont expect to zone into a zone that is setup just like the real eq zones (mobs etc...)  or to have mobs behave like they would in the real eq either... Other than that, its fun to play with.<br />
<br />
Edit: And for gods sake, dont pay for it!   I saw the exact text you posted above on a site that is making people pay 14.99 for it... <br />
It's free and hosted at sourceforge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SamTheMan67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Lol i made a monk with 6k unbuffed hp level 60 maxed aa's .. 54 32 2hb with 1500 ac 1500 atk .. perfect shm partner =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Urnti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've played with it a bit.  Its nice to just screw around it, but doesn't work like Eq would (Mobs don't move etc).  But to explore zones that you currently can't get into its kinda cool. (PoTime etc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I find its great for exploring zones you have never been in before.<br />
<br />
Other then that its usless really, would like to see EQemu in 2 years when they got all the bugs worked out, would be fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Damn... I really wish I knew about this earlier, made a Rogue and got him to 25 to reliably Hide/Sneak to explore new areas =p.<br />
<br />
and he's naked usually... can get back a few levels worth of dying by going to Paludal for 30 min. :D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Would anyone mind PM me a quick little walkthrough on the best way to set it up? I'm currently unable to play, but I bet I could enjoy this emu program some :). What programs do I need...etc.?<br />
<br />
Help a fellow shaman out  :D.</div></div><hr />
