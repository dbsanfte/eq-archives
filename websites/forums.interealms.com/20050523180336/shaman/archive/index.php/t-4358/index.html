<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Dots might be changed to stack in the near future (at least rumor has that), and in my opinion that will open up some rather interesting opportunities for us Shaman.  We have all read and applauded the solo accomplishments of some of our fellow Shaman, and I am thinking, once our DoTs will stack, a whole new class of encounters might open up to the &quot;Shaman-Shaman&quot; duo...   Any thoughts?<br />

<br />
IMO, I think it's going to require the retuning of alot of Boss Mob fights.   At least we'll have more things to cast, including Insideous Decay to lower those Disease resists ;).  <br />
I mean really; a single shaman, layering Epic, Nife, Pox and EB can do around 84 damage per second.  A single Necro layering 4 of their dots can do around 90 damage per second (Lucy's down so don't have the exacts, might be more than that.)     That's 5040 and 5400 damage per Minute per Shaman or Necro.  Now add more Shaman and Necros.   The E'Ci raiding public raids average 4 shaman and 2 Necros.    A potential of somewhere around 30000 damage per minute!!!!   Less of course for actual casting times factoring into the mix.<br />
<br />
<br />
Necro &amp; Shaman groups will be very nasty.  With the movement dot penality removed, there's going to be quad+ rotting groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Quad fear kiting groups, surely? :)<br />
<br />
Shaman pulls with a big DoT, brings mob to necro, necro applies snare, fear, more DoT. Shaman runs off to find next mob.<br />
<br />
Sound feasible?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They do, but not with the same spell cast by another shaman/necro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">so does sat tainted breath, sicken, affliction and indiginous fever stack if one person casts these all?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The only problem with that is aggo. If you stack the sheet out of your DOTs on something, you WILL pull it off the main tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">SO Ebolt from you and an Ebolt from another shaman will both stack for ~2200 damage</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I forgot about the 15 slot debuff limit on mobs.  So wont' be able to stack everything we own with everything everyone else owns on a raid.  But using BoN and everyone's fastest DoT would still do some nasty damage.<br />
<br />
For a group situation would still be very handy ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
DoT stacking is referring to our Epic stacking with Necro's Splut.  Our BoN stacking with another shaman's BoN, our EB and a Necro's EB stacking etc.   All of our own DoT line stack with each other.   So yes, you can cast EB and BoN right after each other just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If all the same dots stacked I would think it would be extremely easy to just keep stacking our epic dot over and over.  I don't have the epic yet but I'm thinking if it did stack experience would fly until 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think it would only be stacking with other Shaman or Necros.  So you could NOT stack your own Bane of Nife with your own Bane of Nife.  Chain casting the epic would not be feasible either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Doesn't our epic DoT already stack with splurt?<br />
<br />
DoT stacking (same DoT from from different people) would be nice - certainly with a 2 shaman group, getting 2 EBolts onto the mob would help in some situations. And the 15 buff limit would stop it being too overpowered maybe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Delirios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The 15 buffs limit MUST go if they implement Dot stacking. There's no question about that. Only the essential debuffs and few of the best dot's will take most mobs close to the limit. Think about a raid with about 40 shamans, nec's and druids, 15 buff slots is nothing!  Dot stacking wouldnt do any good if it only effects on 2 or 3 fastest dotter, and rest will have to wait for the previous dot's to wear off, and while waiting they would furiously spam their dot keys to get the dot off before anyone else does:)<br />
<br />
This whole idea of dot stacking would surely be nice, and I dont see how they havent done it already. Think of it, the wizards can nuke for more than what our best dot's do, and the damage is instant, and thus stacking.  However it will change the gameplay a bit, so I'm still a bit curious about how theyre going to handle it without trivializing much of the pre SoL content.<br />
<br />
 Of course the class that gets most out of the dot stacking would be Necromancers. No doubt about that. They can easily do sustained 100dps on right mobs, at least if they have FP. That 84dps for shamans doesnt sound too far off either, but I am pretty sure that stacking Ebolts, Bon's, Plagues, Poxx's and Epics worth of 8dps will get anyone killed in no time...  <br />
<br />
 The Nec's have much better situation in regards to this. They have very low aggro dot's, and they can Fd, harmshield and Qvox if they draw aggro. All these &quot;escapes&quot; also lead to the mob going back to MT, because the aggro is dropped immediately if someone becomes invulnerable or Fd's, so the raid isnt endangered either. I kinda like to see that my favourite int caster class will get back to where it was supposed to be. Among the damagedealers, not a twitch boatch or corpse summoner who only gets called if the raid wipes.<br />
If dot stacking is done like people hope, the necromancers will gain huge power as a raiding class, and maybe people start recruiting them again too, when guilds see what uber damage they do, and also realize their value as an utility class also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Delirios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Oh yea, our epic dot really does stack with Splurt, has done that for a good while already. <br />
 There used to be times when it didnt, but it was changed long ago so no problems with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i stacked vos/bane/bolt/epic on a vt diabo last night for almost the entire fight without getting aggro, for a nice total of 93 dps(granted, they obviously wore off between casts, so this wont be actual dps.)<br />
<br />
it certainly depends on the mob however, on say seru, keeping bane/bolt up + the occasional heal got me killed within 5 mins :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">hmmm if other shaman have the same resist rate than me on dots on high end encounter, I don't see the point of stacking dots.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Briljin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The first version of DoT stacking will be going to the test server next patch. This is the first *TEST* implementation, which is absolutely subject to change and refinement before it goes live.<br />
<br />
It doesn't solve everyone's problems about everything, but it does cover most of the important parts:<br />
<br />
* Multiple casters can land the same spell.<br />
<br />
* No exploits with zoning/LDing out allowing the same person to stack the same spell multiple times.<br />
<br />
* While it was fun to watch myself get DoTted to death a few times, we've disabled the ability for NPCs to do this to PCs. (Edit; Clarification: This means that NPCs don't gain the same new stacking abilities that PCs do.)<br />
<br />
* Due to concerns about seriously imbalancing PvP, the first run will be going in as Player-casting-on-NPC only. <br />
<br />
* Unfortunately, the 15 effect limit is a totally different beast. It's one we'd like to tackle at some point, but not likely in the short term. Anything that PCs and NPCs have in common is a real bear, as I hope you can imagine.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hopefully there's still enough meat there to where the majority of folks will consider this to be good news.<br />
<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

<br />
Recently posted upon EQNecro.  So it appears DoT stacking is coming and hopefully a removal of the 15 buff slot limitation.<br />
<br />
Update from Scott<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes - That was the downside. Each copy of a DoT takes up its own slot, due to duration, focus, and damage credit differences. <br />
<br />
We definitely know the effect that would have on DoT casters on raids. (Between Rowyl and Jahaar and the boards -- I get it. I swear. ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
However, after some massive late night rewriting, we have an answer to the 15 slot limit for NPCs. We should be able to extend it out at least a little now.<br />
<br />
We'll have to see how far we can take it, though - Adding a pile of new slots to every NPC in the game could have some pretty bad side effects that we'll be monitoring and tuning on test.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Umm..just curious..how do we KNOW that mobs have the same 15 debuff limit as players?<br />
<br />
I thought this thread would look more like this : <br />
<br />
OMFG! We have a new and useful role in raids as the 3rd 4th or even 5th shaman!  In exp groups multiple shamans will be VERY useful..just as when you have multiple melees or multiple wizards.<br />
<br />
In raids we will have a CHOICE...and with proper teamwork we can dish out a BUTTLOAD of damage.<br />
<br />
You think perhaps I'm being too optimistic? Tough Cookies...there's a new sherriff in town..and she's got a stacking epic.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I think it's going to require the retuning of alot of Boss Mob fights.<br />
- No it's not.<br />
<br />
On our regular raids of 55+ people, we have 2 shamans if we are lucky and 2 necros. But even then, shamans are torpor hoes, druids are mostly assist healing and nuking and that leaves necros. With our 2 necros on raids stacking dots, it won't matter much for encounter balance. Yes mob will die maybe 4-5 ticks faster. Wow. Big deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Murphy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Some of you folks don’t seem anywhere near as happy about this possible change as you should. Especially now since they are testing an increase on the 15 spell limit.<br />
I admit that for 2 or 3 shaman on a raid we are very busy elsewhere, and possibly too high on the aggro list to plant a few dots. It will now be an advantage to have several Shaman/Necros/druids present on a raid, some being free to dot, albeit with the added risk of causing pong.<br />
This will help alleviate the monotony of many current top end encounters as mobs have way too much HP (including VT yard trash) to make many of the fights enjoyable.  Unfortunately Verant’s current method of tailoring these fights is to just add HP to the mob. Guilds just find means of increasing mod rod production to counteract. So I disagree that any mob HP increase is needed.<br />
 Hopefully in PoP, Verant will listen to the opinions of players that have posted some great ideas on making  fun and involving encounters on many of the  popular boards.<br />
For now, I’m grateful that this is being worked on. Now all I want is a useful out of group heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Dia Shan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">This will be interesting.<br />
<br />
DoT casters stacking DoTs doing x amount more damage to ubermob_01.<br />
<br />
VI gives ubermob_01 x+z more Hpts.<br />
<br />
Hope i am wrong, I doubt it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Think about a raid with about 40 shamans, nec's and druids, <br />
<br />
Why would the necros need the shamans or the druids?<br />
<br />
Necros may've been asking for DoT stacking to stack on raids, but having experienced the tone of the necro boards, I think it more likely that they want all-necro raids. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I think it would be great for raids, it may even be good for exp grouping.<br />
<br />
But...<br />
<br />
Its going to make us much much more powerful solo, I mean just think of the mana-free damage we could do stacking like 4 epics right off the bat, not to mention throwing a couple of banes and pox's in the mix.<br />
<br />
I don't see VI making Shamans (and necros and druids) that powerful solo... but I wouldn't complain heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Its going to make us much much more powerful solo, I mean just think of the mana-free damage we could do stacking like 4 epics right off the bat,<br />
<br />
Reread. We wouldn't be able to stack our own DoTs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Harlas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Since I am usually one of 2 shaman on raids MOSt of the time--I almost never get a chance at dotting.<br />
<br />
   But when we do have 3 or more shaman--sometimes I actually get a chance to blow my mana on resisted BoN's.<br />
 <br />
   My question is--some have said aggro would be a problem-but if you can control aggro when dotting --adding 3 or 4 or more shaman to the dotting crew and all knew how to control their aggro (meaning not casting each and every dot available at once). You still wouldn't get aggro right?<br />
<br />
   Or are you saying that it would be HARDER for the MT to keep aggro due to everyone else adding to the damage?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">After the initial slowing of the mob, only one shaman is on reslows till it dies usually.  The rest can spot heal or sit on their asses for all it matters.  My guild is large, we have up to 5 shamans on a large raid.  That's a lot of potential for damage there if you ask me.  Just stacking bane and epic would be a lot . . . and not hard to keep up on the mob.  Poxx would add a bunch more and is easier to keep applied due to longer duration.  <br />
<br />
Anything that = more DPS for the guild = a good thing IMHO.<br />
<br />
DPS is the defining factor of the raw power of your guild.  You either have it or you don't win the harder stuff.  After you have it you can apply tactics, strats, etc and win or lose based on how things go.</div></div><hr />
