<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Geldarea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ive been grouping in OT from 29-31 and the exp seems to crawl with the others in my group being higher level.  Whats a good palce i can go to possibly solo, or get a good group around my level?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chamelius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You could solo there although it would be tough, its easy to accidentally pull two or 3.  Or you could get in a group, exp isnt great but the loot is quite good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mebosh Uhed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At 31 I was soloing Greyhoppers and Stonegrabbers in Marus Seru (Luclin) quite successfully. Soloed and duoed to 34 there. (Once you hit about 32 or so you may as well just go after the Stonegrabbers.)<br />
<br />
Easy to slow mobs. Not all that many HP (I would generally hit with one EBreath and then melee it dead.) and some of the best exp I've seen for 30-34. Oh and its an underused so you don't have a ton of competition for mobs most of the time. (Most I've ever seen was 11 people in the zone at once. Three of them were 60th levels hunting for quest items.)<br />
<br />
Word to the wise tho, Recuoso (sp.) always seemed like garbage XP and you take a laundry list of faction hits for killing them. Leave them alone and go after Rockhoppers/Stonegrabbers.<br />
<br />
Oh and if you get a Zelinak or Lightcrawler add or two (Only two types of aggro mobs in the zone.) just run to the guards. They'll kill off the Zelinaks and Lightcrawlers but they don't touch Stonegrabbers and Rockhoppers. =)<br />
<br />
Good luck to you on the final 3 of your most boring levels.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>chasekila</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I play an untwinked 31 iksar shaman.  At 30 I went to iceclad and hunted cougars ( soloing was tough but then I found a good group ).  At 31 I went to the Crystal Caverns, and I have to say that, on Vazaelle at least, this is the most fun zone I've been in.  The xp is great if you can partner up with a melee type ( which I have had no difficulty doing even playing in a non US timezone ), you can solo orcs near the Coldain city as well.  The loot is phenomenal too, so far, in three hours of play, I've bagged numerous velious weapons, over 100pp, a frozen long sword and a herbalist back pack, and I've lost rolls on a CCS and a few other items.  I imagine the zone can get a bit crowded with farmers and such, but I've had no problems so far and intend to remain here for the next 3 or  4 levels at least, possibly even up to 40th, as there is plenty to do here.  Sure as hell beats grinding in OT for zero loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My solo favorites at 31 currently are:<br />
<br />
1.) Marus Seru using befriend animal to charm greyhoppers and using them to kill stonegrabbers<br />
<br />
2.) Dalnir...nice exp bonus, groups take all the healing they can get.<br />
<br />
3.) stonebrunt mnts...lots of animals to charm, hardly any competition for spawn. <br />
<br />
4.) Gnolls in Karanas...easy to solo and decent exp. Move into splitpaw for even better exp. <br />
<br />
All told, I prefer grouping at this level. It seems much more efficient to find a monk or tank pet, buff em up and let em rip. At 34 when I get my own pet soloing might be more efficient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yes from 29 to 31 grp inside split paw, if no grp try soloing outside.<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
