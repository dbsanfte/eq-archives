<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aaeamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Temple of Veeshan - Halls of Testing <br />
Where: Temple of Veeshan, Entry area. <br />
When: 7:00 PM Eastern, Wednesday, August 22 <br />
Level Range: 55+ <br />
Requires: Dubious or better CoV faction. <br />
<br />
This raid will be limited to Four Groups. Though the level limit is set at 55 and up, Level 54 healers are also encouraged to signup. We will rotate people in on a standby list as people leave. The raid will likely go until after midnight, but we will keep going as long as we have a capable force. <br />
<br />
Requirements: Attendee's are encoraged to bring some DoTs for Symbol/Rune. Able to commit to at least 3 hours. <br />
<br />
Resists: CR/FR near 100 unbuffed should be your target. MR is a secondary resist to look at as well. <br />
<br />
Objectives: The main goal here is to move to the Halls of Testing and pull MoBs for challenge and loot. <br />
<br />
If you cannot make the start time, please sign up anyway, but include the time you will be able to get on. We will rotate people in and keep the raid going as long as there remains a viable force present.</div></div><hr />

Please accept our apologies on that.<br />

Please join us again sometime and give me a tell if anything like that happens again.  Sometimes there is too much going on for a raid leader to know everything that is going on.  I'll be happy to keep buggin people until something is done.</div></div><hr />
