Time to leave lower dogs so I gate wildaar and go to login the dr00d to port Sarj out.  Another group runs by and the  shaman being a nice guy, casts harnessing on Sarj.  WTH it overwrites focus!!??  <br />
<br />
Verant if you are listening, please feeex that spell overwriting crap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is there really some lower level spells that are better than higher that you want to overwrite?  I can't think of any atm, and spell lines like our Celerity don't count.  Those should be flagged low level and castable on lower levels as is, imo too.</div></div><hr />

I hate &quot;helpful&quot; druids who cast that on me. If I wanted to levitate I would've damn well cast it on myself. I just can't stand bobbing up and down all the time when I don't need to.</div></div><hr />

OMG I hate this.  Seems like everytime I zone into SG I find my sow gone because some druid stealth SOE'd me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
HoS is a great spell if your trying to stack. Instead of 3 spells your only casting one plus the time of spell 75minutes compared to 72 minutes for tuna and 63minutes for str and dex. Granted the time difference may not seem that small but when your buffing an entire raid it's nice to have only one spell drop instead of 3 and you save 25mana per cast compared to casting all 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Agreed with Durich.  It is  VERY useful spell, but making a self only page with Tuna, Str, Rage/Fury, etc.. is probably AS good a solution.  It's still in my day to day page (1 and 3) but when soloing I have a page for that as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Though the more and more stacking issues occur with it, the angrier I get to be honest.  I understood focus, str, dex, but Fury and Rage ..*SIGH* (nm potions)</div></div><hr />

At 55 Kragg+strength+Dex is better but on raids I usually use HoS on my Shadowknight just because her buff slots are so limited.</div></div><hr />

I am a lowbie (level 51) underarmored (ghetto) shaman in a small guild, so AC is hard to come by. It is vital that I max hp &amp; AC with buffs - for me this means I have to have hp and AC buffs -as a minimum this means 'tuna, guardian, stamina, agility and rage. Harness never stacked with rage, so i didnt bother, esprecially since rage does stack with dex</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah and? The HoS nerf does not affect shaman self buffs at all when you are talking about hit points &amp; AC. It's still an awesome buff on hybrid who tend to run short on spell slots. It's also great untill 55 for lower mana cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Necros are almost as bad as those druids sometimes with the DMF. They think DMF is like clarity or haste and everyone wants it. I hate bobbing up and down. Once this necro ran by me and cast it on me and ran off. I didn't want to be rude and yell at him, so I just let him run off and quietly clicked it off. About 5 minutes later he ran by and did it again.</div></div><hr />

No I don't think we are.. glancing over the posts since his, they all seem to complain about drive by buffings. Mine was specifically against HoS being worthless. Maybe you were missing the point of everyone elses posts?</div></div><hr />

Thanks for telling me this. It's time for revenge on all those GOD DAMN druids. I'm henceforth going to cast Spirit of Bin'Laden on every single druid I see masquerading as my pet. God damn mofos wont stop casting SoE. Yelling at them non stop for like ten minutes doesn't help either, they'll keep doing it anyway.<br />
<br />
Muahahahaha, no more pet-form for those buggers.<br />
<br />
It's really #&amp;¤%#%/¤% annoying with people who buff without asking. Each and everyone should be responsible for his own buff stacking, often this fails of course and then it doesn't help that some retarded druid decides that being interrupted and lagging more is a greater benefit to everyone that 20 raw ATK. I mean I could forgive it if they cut it out after you told them once or twice when heading into SG or buffing up for a mob against which ATK might help melees and being easier to push in melee might not. <br />
<br />
But alas they are a terrible plague upon the land and they keep casting that god damn spell no matter how many times you explain why they should not.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Cappi, your opinions are certainly interesting too. They are just not about HoS overwriting FoS. As I read Wildaars post and the title of the thread that is the main issue.<br />
<br />
On the tiny tiny chance that someone from Verant visits this board you want to keep each issue separated to make it easier for them to understand :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Be patient with dr00ds, they like using all their utility trinkets when they can feel useful, very much unlike on a raid :)<br />

However, I still cast this on the melees, as they like the str and dex boost, even though most of them have more than enough of each.<br />
<br />
hos continues to overwrite cleric and pure caster self buffs, even high level ones such as blessed armor of the risen.<br />
<br />
hos overwrites vog, thats just too funny.<br />
<br />
I am almost level 60, and am terrified of what spells group focus will overwrite =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I got my druids trained. They dont cast Spirit of Eagle on the cranky shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Durich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">If you level 55 or over and still casting HoS as one of your regular spells take a few minutes and think again. HoS is a good spell but not the best. For buff-stacking(limited space and time) and pre-krag its great but after 55 there are to many stacking and overwriting issues. I would think if you in a group or raid you want to focus on certain stats for your classes. Not everyone needs a Dex buff and you can cast a far better STR buff.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have never casted a HoS on a caster it's a waste of mana. Most of them have self ac/hp buffs that HoS will overwrite and if you think about it there is a reason not a stacking issue. The only class that would need more hps would be an enchanter who is having a bad night. Otherwise let the clerics hit everyone with hps and ac thats their game. Besides with the new trial account and VI's take on bots everyone should have a pocket cleric soon :p</div></div><hr />
