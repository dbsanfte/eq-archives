<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, just about to throw in the towel.  I'm only level 58, so it is not because of Gates, or high-end shaman issues.  I love playing my Shaman, would not change for another class.  I love what I can do and know that for the next few levels and well into PoP tier 1/2 it only gets better.  But SoE is just killing me.<br />
<br />
They have a new expansion coming, yet there is so much broken with the existing game, that it just makes me sick to my stomach when I think about all the developers working on the expansion and not the bugs.  Are these folks totally retarded?  They have a user base of 400,000, yet risk this large existing base to chase a few more &quot;new&quot; players.  I'm a business man, and rule #1 is you spend 80% of your time keeping your customers happy, which keeps the lights on and allows you to chase new customers with the other 20%.  They seem to have it backwards.<br />
<br />
I've been playing my shaman for almost 2 years, in all that time 2HB has been broken.  I've not used it much because it just ruins the feel of the game for me watching my big, beefy barbarian poking mobs with a big club or hammer.  Hell, I bought a Corpsegrinder and after killing two mobs with it I sold it because it looked so stupid to use a 1HP animation with that hammer.  Could they please just fix stuff like this before we get another expansion.<br />
<br />
In fact, they've added injury to insult by releasing Gates, with bugs and incomplete content, and then moving on to the next expansion as if everything is just fine.  How in the world can they justify a new expansion when the Berzerkers still don't have any class aa's.  Gates is not complete!  Complete this expansion that we've paid money for before you ask for more.  It would be different if this were somehow hidden or hard to realize, but hell, everyone knows that the Berzerker class has been incomplete and broken since release, it's no secret.  It takes some real balls and stupidity to release another expansion before completing the last one.<br />
<br />
OK, did not mean to turn this into a rant, but you know how it is once you get on a roll.  I love this game and would play it for another 2 years or more if it only did what it was supposed to.  But the attitude displayed by SoE makes me sick, just plain sick.  I'm a paying customer and they treat me like a dog.  Pitiful.  Hell, I feel guilty giving these folks my money, like paying to get a butt kicking.<br />
<br />
Even worse, Im playing City of Heroes with a bunch of friends, 3 of whom I played EQ with, and am having a blast.  They all quit within the last 6 months.  At this point, I may have to do the same.  I just can't spend my money on a product by a company that is so blatantly ripping us off for every dime they can get.  Charater transfers, $50-$75, name change $50, etc.  And incomplete and broken expansion after expansion, each more expensive then the last.  Gee, let me pay even more for the latest PoS from SoE.<br />
<br />
Finally, why I'm especially torqued this morning, is that I lost a bag with about 40k in items in it.  Went to pick it up off the ground and because it contained a lore item which my character already had equipped, it gave me a message that I could not pick it up and then it ate the bag.  The bag is just gone, no where to be found.  Graphics bug, or bad code, don't know.  Just know I'm out about 40k pp.  So, I've been petitioning every night and writing e-mails to Sony station since May 5.  It's been 12 days and all I've gotten is the automated reply e-mail.  Been in game for over 60 hours since then, and not one GM has even tried to contact me.  The SoE customer service is just plain unacceptable.  I want my stuff, and no one will even talk to me about this.  And I pay for this?  Not much longer.  I refuse to be treated like the village idiot.  <br />
<br />
They are killing the golden goose, and it's a shame, because I like playing with the damn thing.<br />
<br />
Thanks for allowing me to vent,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ranlron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Why oh why would you have 40k worth of items in a bag on the ground when there are warnings everywhere NOT to do just that. /boggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Why oh why would you have 40k worth of items in a bag on the ground when there are warnings everywhere NOT to do just that. /boggle<br />
<br />
If you must know, even though it is not the point of the thread, I was transferring from one account to the other.  Have my mule on my alt account, and was transferring stuff my main had to sell at the bazaar.  Was in a quiet spot, bag was there, went to pick it up, got the lore item message and the bag disappeared.<br />
<br />
Now, what does it matter?  It is a bug, plain and simple.  Stuff is not supposed to disappear for ANY reason.  And, as with any bug, I've used the customer support channel to get resolution and it has been absolutely dreadful.  That is my point.  To be honest, I could give a Sh_t about the pp, I've got plenty.  Problem is that the game is buggy and they won't even respond to folks that encounter these bugs.  If I did need the pp I'd be furious vs. just disgusted.<br />
<br />
And finally Ranlron, since you are so wise, could you please link one of these warnings that show up EVERYWHERE about not putting bags on the ground.  I read these boards every day, in addition to many other class boards, and have never seen this mentioned.  Hell, a few MONTHS ago I posted about the ability of an NPC to pick up a bag, and the dangers of leaving one near an NPC, but this was not the case.  So please, show me where these neon light warnings are.  And, thanks for your contribution to the thread, very valuable.<br />

<br />
For future reference:  If you try to pick up a lore item that you already have the item will disappear.  It will only disappear for you.  Other players will still be able to see it, and pick it up.  If you zone or relog it will reappear, assuming it hasn't rotted yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes that can happen. A more accidental case of this is when looting your corpse someone hits ae mod rod and you go to loot a bag with a mod rod still in it. Ouch. <br />
btw if you want to trade items a more safe method might be putting the items in a forge or other tradeskill combine item in an out of the way locale. Dropping stuff on the ground is not safe, stuff can fall under the world or under a rug or an npc can grab it let alone a pc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thank you guys, good insight and advice.  I will keep that in mind.  Actually, though a minor part of my post, my missing items issue was also due to my laziness.  I usually 2-box, but with the lag and time it takes to log in the second account, I thought it would be quicker to simply use the drop method and log off/on one account at a time.  Like I said, it was a quiet spot.  Silly me.<br />
<br />
But again, if this is a KNOWN BUG, why is it still there, while SoE works on expansion number 3,557,927, and EQ II?  Could they please just;<br />
<br />
1. Fix the game we are all paying for right now.  <br />
2. Complete the last expansion.  <br />
3. Improve Customer Service.  <br />
<br />
BEFORE asking me for more money.<br />
<br />
A simple and reasonable request that I'm afraid will fall on deaf ears.<br />

<br />
Yes Lit, I read very well, your point?  <br />
<br />
The entire bag disappeared.  Not the ring I was wearing or the one in the bag, but the entire bag.  I did not know that it was still visible to others, or that I could zone or log and come back and it would magically reappear.  There was no one else around.  Anyway, how in the world does that make any sense?  It is clearly a bug.  Instead, I searched for about 15 minutes, making sure that my eyes were not playing tricks on me, checking my inventory, and clicking on the ground in the off chance that I'd stumble upon it.<br />
<br />
Also, since this happened on May 5th, the good advice I've received here today does not help me with my current problem.  The bag, and yes I went back the next day, is gone.  Was gone on the 5th, not there on the 6th, and as far as I know picked up by someone else lucky enough to have gone by and seen it.<br />
<br />
So again, I may be a bit slow, what is your point?<br />
<br />
My point is that I wish to God that they would fix these incredibly annoying bugs so that I can continue to enjoy playing the game.  How many mules are chest deep into the ground in the bazaar?  For how long will we have to use /rewind to get &quot;unstuck&quot;?  How long will my character poke mobs with a 2HB wep?  How long before Berzerkers get class aa's?  <br />
<br />
The game desperately needs an expansion that fixes the bugs and completes current content, not adds a class, or more zones, or new levels and spells.  Just fixes the bugs.<br />

Well first off you can drop the attitude and quite being a jerk when someone tries to help you out. I mean ***. I thought you missed the post so i pointed it out in hopes you would get your stuff back. That was &quot;My Point&quot;.<br />
<br />
Sorry for trying to help dude.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nzaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well thunder if you really want to gripe about this why not do a /feedback in game (I did this the other day)or post of the eqlive boards.  Although your loss sucks, it wasn't a problem with in the game.  Dropping stuff on the ground has been risky for quite some time.  The shared bank slots were installed to help prevent this problem.  So it was safe to transfer between people on teh same account. The bag disappearing because of a lore item has been known for quite some time, I actually think longer than you have been playing.  I believe the rot time on bags in the open was only 1/2 an hour.  It is shorter than that for other items.  So although you are angry about the 40k lost bag, you have no one to blame but yourself.  You don't have any guildmates or friends that you trust for such a transfer?<br />
<br />
I do agree with you about fixing current bug and misc crap that is what my feedback was about.  I am a troll and with the current graphics I look like a troll hooker in a fishnet body suit.  <br />
<br />
Litch - I thought that they fix the forge trick, when you walk away from the forge it drops it back into your inventory?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've done the same thing also, but the forge idea, now that I think about it is much safer. however you have to be in a row with one in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I might agree with your point about customer service keeping customers, but EQ is more like crack and SOE is more like the dealer.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Oh yeah they may have changed the forge thing so people didn't forget their items they were combining. Oh well you still have shared bankslots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, that might be true, that he can only blame himself, for never having come across this bug before, or never having heard about it.  I haven't been playing that long.  I think I started a few months before PoP, but I've never heard of this disappearing bag trick.  <br />
<br />
In fact, the first thing I tried to do was drop something with my level 10 char, and log on my lvl 5 char to pick it up.   Its part of the immersion of EQ to think that the world you run around in is governed by some set of the laws of physics.  That things will not &quot;disappear&quot; for no reason, that mobs will not warp through walls, that players and npc's will not run half in and half out of the floor, that BoT giants do not swim in the air, etc..<br />
<br />
Its not the original posters fault for not knowing about the bag deal, its a SOE BUG.  BUG.  yes BUG.  Its not a &quot;feature&quot;, its a &quot;BUG&quot;, and its been around since almost the beginning of the game.  That is what the original poster's thread is about.  How the game pushes forward without fixing some old issues, and creates new issues along the way that can take a very long time to fix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">&lt;blockquote&gt;I've been playing my shaman for almost 2 years ... I'm only level 58&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br />
I feel sorry for you<br />
<br />
Man, these boards have really deteriorated in the last two years.  Honestly, I make a post concerning the level of bugs and incomplete content in the game, hoping that SoE would somehow address them before shoving another expansion down our throats, and these are the comments I get?<br />
<br />
Litgruv, <br />
<br />
I did not think I was being rude to you, I honestly did not understand your post, since it was after my reply to the one you linked (which I acknowledged).  Even so, you seem very quick to lash out on a personal attack, not what I would expect from one of the more senior and active shaman posting on these boards.<br />
<br />
I tried to get the thread back on topic, the game is buggy and fixing those bugs should be the priority.  Unfortunately, a bunch of folks think I was complaining about losing the bag and items.  Yes, it is an irritation, no I will not miss the pp, it was simply another example of the poor quality of the current game.  <br />
<br />
Nzaz,<br />
<br />
You speak as if a known bug, one that has been around for OVER 2 YEARS, is acceptable.  Sorry, but I disagree.  Yes, I already admitted I was being lazy, should have just logged on my second account and handed the bag from character to character (as I posted, but I guess you missed that too).  The fact that this bug has been around for so long and open knowledge (except to me of course) makes it even more agregious.  Bags should not disappear, regardless of the reason, period.  Bags should not drop under the floor, or vanish to the owner, or be picked up by NPCs (I like to see the code for that one, and the rationale behind it.  Just what exactly will the NPC do with the items?)  This is just another example of a bug (broken code) that should have been fixed long ago.  I guess we can become complacent and just live with the bugs, since they have been documented.  I'd rather not, since I pay every month to play this game and expect some level of quality control.<br />
<br />
Eqphreak, Ungkor,<br />
<br />
Thanks, at least you understood and acknowledged my point.<br />
<br />
Rtugok, <br />
<br />
You sir, are an idiot, and probably the best example I've seen so far of what is wrong with the game.  I guess in your eyes everyone should just PL to 65.  Yeah, I'm sure you did and missed a lot of the game along the way.  I for one play for the enjoyment.  So, it is actually I who should be feeling sorry for you.  Thanks for the constructive post.  BTW, nice sig, jack@ss.<br />
<br />
So, can we just stick to the subject.  I appreciate the constructive advice, really I do.  But my gripe is with the poor quality of the current game.  How many quests are broken?  How many tradeskills are broken?  How many raids are broken?  How many spells are broken?  How many animations and graphics are broken? etc., etc.<br />
<br />
Too many to count.  Yet SoE continues to put it's limited resources on developing new expansions in order to keep their money machine going, vs. fixing the game for it's current paying customers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nzaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">How can you say that the bag disappearing is a bug?  It is not a bug it is how the game handles duplicate lore items. You are so concentrated on the bag you're missing the reason why it happened. <br />
<br />
All of you had to have looted an item from a corpse that is lore.  What happens when you loot a duplicate lore item from a mob?  It disappears and states why you could not loot it.  It does the exact same thing when you try to loot a bag, if you were trading it to another player it would tell you that it can not be done for the same reason.  I am fairly sure when you try to loot the bag from the ground it states the same thing. <br />
<br />
 So it is SOE's problem because you are trying to do an illegal operation? Which is effectivly what you were doing in the eyes of the game. Is it a prefect solution?  In your case no.  But before it would cancel the trade and drop all the items on the ground.  The little line telling why you can't make the trade and the items going back to into your inventory was a fix.  If you still think that it is a bug use /bug.  Yes, it is not your job to but EQ is an huge app and they can't catch everything.   <br />
<br />
The NPC picking up an item I have never seen or heard of this.<br />
<br />
I agree that there are many bugs out there but this one in my mind has no priority.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Stuff<br />

I read it differently, thats the fun of reading emotion and sarcasm and stuff from text I guess.  Its all good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">not to point out the obvious but bags rotting in game isnt a bug. if every dropped item stayed in game til server reset you wouldnt be able to move in zones like pok. the foaragers are always dropping crap, it has a short rot time, less than 10 min is my guess.<br />
<br />
if you need to transfer a lot of gear the best local I have found is erudin, near tox there is a forge/loom/pottery wheel/kiln all next to each other in a deserted zone. and theres an oven in teh building next to all that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">&quot;How can you say that the bag disappearing is a bug? It is not a bug it is how the game handles duplicate lore items. You are so concentrated on the bag you're missing the reason why it happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
I consider any &quot;feature&quot; that causes physical items that you own to disappear a &quot;bug&quot;.  <br />
<br />
If cars had a feature to prevent speeding, whereby, the car turned itself off and refused to start if you went over a certain speed, I'd consider that an inappropriate solution to a problem.  I'd consider it a &quot;bug&quot; whether or not the manufacturers considered it a bug. <br />
<br />
I'm 100% positive that the full bag disappearing because one lore item is in it is an unintended consequence of SOE's &quot;feature&quot; to have lore items disappear when you already have one.  <br />
<br />
The fact remains, that you shouldn't have to guess whether the physics of the EQ world are going to work as one would reasonably expect them to do so.  <br />
<br />
I shouldn't have to guess and work around bugs in VT, whereby using mounts who's tails poke through the floor, aggro mobs beneath us and have them warp through the walls and wipe our raid.<br />
<br />
I shouldn't have to see BoT giants swimming in the air. Totally ruins the immersion.  <br />
<br />
Both of those issues are probably, like the bag, an unintended consequence of a &quot;feature&quot; (the dx9 upgrade).  Regardless, those unintended consequences are in fact, bugs.<br />
<br />
&quot;not to point out the obvious but bags rotting in game isnt a bug&quot;<br />
<br />
Aye. things rotting is one thing.  Things disappearing instantly is another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">OK, if the ring disappeared, it's one thing.  But the entire bag with all of it's contents is another.  You can call it &quot;the way it is&quot; or a bug, either way, it should not be this way!<br />
<br />
IMHO, if I try to pick up a lore item, just like when I try to buy one from a vendor in the bazaar, it should not let me.  Drop the bag to the ground, or just the lore item, but don't destroy the entire bag and it's contents.  And the fact that others can see the bag and grab it, or that I can zone out and back in and get it, means it is not intentionally a part of the game mechanics.  This is a BUG.  I can not believe that any rational person would think this is good game mechanics, or that a developer sat down and purposely wrote code that would destroy ALL ITEMS in a bag because one was a duplicate lore item.<br />
<br />
So, call it a bug or incredibly bad game mechanics.  Either way, I expect better for my $12.95 a month.  There is no good reason this should happen, period.  So don't give me the, &quot;oh, that's just the way it is&quot; and &quot;you should have known better&quot;.  Show me where SoE has posted this little game &quot;feature&quot; anywhere, manual, online, knowledgebase, etc.  It is a bug that should be fixed, pure and simple.<br />
<br />
I just can't understand the mind set that forces people to defend the crappy coding and bugs currently in game.  I love the game.  Have played it longer than any other game, ever.  But I've also paid more to do so than any other game, well over $600 for software, expansions and monthly fees over the last 2 years (I 2-box so I have 2 active accounts).  So, I can not turn a blind eye to the deficiencies that take away from my enjoyment of the game.  <br />
<br />
I would gladly pay $30, the price of the next expansion, for a patch that simply fixed the current content.  I should not have to, but I would much rather do that then pay for another expansion that does not fix the current bugs and will certainly introduce new ones.  It is a never ending cycle, one which will ultimately destroy this game if allowed to continue.  If I was a new player, in my first 30 days, and saw folks buried in the ground, or crashed in PoK, or had items disappear, or saw my combat animations were broken, etc., I'd have serious reservations about continuing to play and pay for this game.<br />
<br />
/edit<br />
<br />
And why in God's name can't a GM get back to me on this?  It has been 12 days, I've been on for 60-70 hours over those days and petitioned everyday and sent multiple e-mails to Sony Station.  Not a peep.  The customer support, or lack there of, is abysmal.<br />

I don't know as though I would put 40k worth of items on the ground no matter HOW quiet it is. Perhaps that's why the GM's have not gotten back to you ... user error as opposed to game error.<br />
<br />
I don't know what you mean by 2-hand animations being broken. Perhaps I'm not using the right weaps to be able to see it, but I have a 1hb (Dizok Oracle Shillagh, or however you spell it) and a 2hb (Boneshod Greatstaff, I believe it's called) and I get two different animations.<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>GandarrTheletch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">If you put a no drop item in a bag, the entire bag becomes no drop.  Game treats it the same way for lore items, whether or not it labels the bag as lore I have no clue, but that's how it works.   Using your argument about just the ring disappearing, you should be able to hand someone a hand made backpack with 9 tradeable items and 1 no drop item in it and it should strip the 1 no drop item out and hand over the bag and the 9 tradeable items.   Well, maybe it should, but obviously the game isn't coded like that.<br />
<br />
This is NOT a bug, you are screwed plain and simple.   There have been multiple log in messages warning not to use the drop and log technique to transfer things, just as there have been warnings not to trust someone to transfer stuff for you as you might get screwed.  These two things were the reason why they created the shared bank slot (yes, I know in your case it wasn't the same account).  Granted, the messages I'm talking about haven't been around for a while, at least since the shared bank slot came around.<br />
<br />
Oh, and NPCs will come by and pick up stuff, the ones that do will actually say something like &quot;man, who leaves this junk around?&quot; or something funny like that.  It's a nice touch imo.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">BTW..you can put lore items in shared bank and they are in limbo and you can loot another</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Man, why do I beat my head against the wall repeatedly?  Some of you guys just don't get it, do you?  Once more.<br />
<br />
First of all, yes, 2hb animation is broken.  Next time you use that wep, look at the animation.  It is the animation for 1 hand pierce, not 2 hand bash.  2hb is a double handed overhead swing, like in the character selection screen (where it works just fine, just not in game).  You are actually poking the mob with your 2hb wep.  Been that way, broken, for over 2 years.  I believe it is the same with 2hp, you get the 1hp animation, also broken.<br />
<br />
Also, what the heck does it matter whether it was 40k pp or 40 pp?  Bottom line is that it is a BUG, the game should not EAT BAGS FOR ANY REASON.  You folks are making excuses for sloppy programming.  It is poor coding, plain and simple.  It is not meant to work this way.  <br />
<br />
I fully understand and am aware of how it labels the bag lore if an item is in it, still not a reason to eat the item and the entire bag.  Read my post, if this was intentional, then why is it that someone else can pick up the bag?  Or that if I zone and come back the bag is there?  It is a bug, sloppy programming, SoE not caring about the quality of it's product, period.<br />
<br />
If it were intended to work this way, then when you tried to buy a duplicate lore item in the bazaar it would eat your purchase.  Or if you tried to trade a lore item to someone with it, it would eat it and everything else in the trade window.  It does not, because it is not supposed to.  So why in the world would it be different for a bag that belongs to me that I'm simply picking up?  They need to take the same lore item duplication check code (that obviously already exists because it works this way in other situations) and have it apply to bags so that it does something intelligent, like dropping the entire bag on the groud vs. eating the entire bag.  Man, I can't believe I have to go over this so many times. <br />
<br />
Oh, and you seem to think that because they post a message, or used to, that the game is bugged, then that makes it OK.  Gee, why don't they post in the intro that you may get stuck, or drop chest deep into the floor, or lock up in PoK for no good reason, or not be able to cast while mounted, or shrink your pet (ask a BST about that one), or jump/duck when a big race gets shrunk twice (my personal favorite at the moment) etc., etc?  Just because they warn you not to do it makes it the way the game is supposed to work?  Gee, someone should tell Microsoft this, they could just put the bug disclaimers in the users manual for Windows and all their applications and everything would be fine.  &quot;Oh don't worry, Windows is supposed to lock up randomly and give you a blue screen of death, that's just the way it is, try to work around it and thanks for your money.&quot;  That is truly an amazing feat of logic on your part.<br />
<br />
Again, this is just an example, I've given at least a dozen others of things in the game that are broken, not working as intended, or just plain incomplete.  My point is, fix the game, don't keep adding more buggy code with new expansions.  That is my point.  Screw the bag, screw the 40k (I can make more than that in less than a week), just fix the game so it works the way it is supposed to.<br />
<br />
And when something does not work the way it is supposed to, then reply to the God Blessed /petitions.  Even if they were to tell me that it is working as intended (as retarded as that would be), then I would be upset, but at least I'd have an answer and some closure.  But their customer service is so lame, I can't even get an reply.  This is B.S.  Again, we pay how much for this treatment?<br />
<br />
Thunderwolf<br />
<br />
P.S.  I really can't believe that you've been using a 2hb wep and did not notice that you don't actually swing it the way you should.  When you nail a hammer, do you push the hammer at it, or swing it down at it?  In this case it would be a two handed hammer, like the big mallet you would swing at the circus to ring the bell.  Got a visual now?  That is what it should look like in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Dude, first off, chill the heck out.<br />
<br />
The thing with the bag poofing on you sucks, but it's the way the game is coded. Reworking it would have to rework the entire way lore items and containers both work. Hoo boy, you think THIS is a bug, wait until they try to &quot;fix&quot; it, and containers eat everything when you close them.<br />
<br />
I've been in a similar situation. After a long hard day of North Freeport trading back in the day, I handed 30k worth of bagged gear, and 15k plat to the banker. It was late, I was tired, and I'd been working trade windows all day, so I didn't notice until he gave me back a single deluxe toolbox with nothing in it, and nothing in my bank. The GM's response? &quot;We tell you to be careful what you're handing to who&quot;. The GM's would tell you the same thing, almost... &quot;We tell you to not drop things you want to keep&quot;<br />
<br />
Another time I lost two bundles of twink gear doing what you did in Ak'Anon, because, y'know those robotic cleaners? They pick up everything you drop.<br />
<br />
the 2hb animation ticks me off something awful, for the same reason - Corpsegrinder. It's an anvil on a pole, not a rapier, I want to be smashing pancakes, not poking Poppinfresh!<br />
<br />
But my big, HUGE animation problem, is that except for Iksar, everyone runs like Richard Simmons at a tea party. That, and you ever seen a female Vah Shir bard playing a drum? They're diddling their nipples!<br />
<br />
Anyway, to answer how much you pay for this cra, the answer is simple... $0. It's the cancel button. You don't want to buy time in the game, nobody's making you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>milkcarton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">The fact is he stated the loss of his items are of little concequence. I take that to mean his main issue is NOT the loss of the bag, but that he has to come here to have someone tell him the reason for the dissapearance. Why after all this time has no GM told him the reason for his loss? Hardly seems fair to be unaware of a &quot;feature&quot; in the game that would penalize a person.<br />
<br />
 If I lost 40k in items I would most likely quit. I could earn the items back... but with all the current bugs in game I doubt I would bother. Last week I spent a few hours of my time and a few hundred PP on deaths that where the result of bugs. Most demeaning death by far was asking a cleric for a rez after dying in POK because of a game crash while swimming! <br />
<br />
 A death because of my miscalculations or my mistakes will often go completely un-rezed simply to &quot;teach myself a lesson&quot;  :p  <br />
<br />
What lessons are we to learn when characters die because they have :<br />
A - Gotten stuck in graphics during a pull<br />
B - Drowned *sigh* after a game crash and eq servers dont log you out<br />
C - Party wiped due to mobs poping out of graphics<br />
D - (this one is a bug apparently only on my character) If I forage during a fight the game crashes. Solution is simple but unfair - I simply turn off my auto forage.<br />
<br />
How many hours have we ALL spent trying to complete our goals only to have to try again and again due to a bug stopping us?<br />
<br />
(enough about the &quot;bag&quot; issue, it wasn't even a remote point in his post)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Well Dude, I get excited because some folks insist that this is user error.  Yup, just like Windows locking up is user error.  <br />
<br />
Again I can't understand attitudes such as this one from paying customers.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
So are you saying this is OK?  This is the answer you expect to get and accept from the customer service representative of a product/service you are paying for every month?  If you say yes, then I may be the one that just doesn't get it.  I, for some strange reason, expect more for my money.  Yeah, it's just a game, but it is also a multi-million dollar a year business with over 400k users and should be run professionally.<br />
<br />
If it is user carelessness, like dropping the bag in hole and not being able to find it, then I could go along with it.  My bad.  But when I try to do something and the game behaves illogically, and not as intended, then I have a problem.  No, I can't believe that they really coded this so that the bag, or any item, is supposed to disappear on purpose in this situation.  If so, to repeat myself once again, it would disappear in all situations where you had a potential duplicate.  It is a bug.  It should be fixed. <br />
<br />
You also seem to think that because programming the logic may be difficult that it excuses them.  The logic already exists, it happens when you try to trade or purchase dup lore items, why not when you are trying to pick them up?  Because of lazy, sloppy code and an indifferent attitude about it.  <br />
<br />
And, of course, the age-old sage advice, &quot;if you don't like it, just quit.&quot;  Man, what wisdom, did you think of that all by yourself?  Again, as I've said repeatedly, I love to play and only desire that they make fixing the current BUGS a priority, and let their programmers focus on cleaning the current game up before working on another buggy expansion.<br />
<br />
Maybe you folks don't agree with this, and that's where I made my mistake, I assumed everyone wants a bug free game.  OK, maybe it's too hard for SoE, or you've gotten used to the bugs, or you think they should just keep pumping out new content while they leave the current game alone?  I just don't share that view, and it annoys me when people tell me I should, or to just live with it.  Screw that.  <br />

<br />
I agree there are an ass-ton of bugs that need fixed in this game. I keep wondering what they did with the results of that game-startup poll a while back where they asked players if they'd prefer new content or fixing existing content. But the uncaring attitude toward bugs is prevalent across the whole computer industry. Even Windows - the base for all other software to run - the most quality-sensitive piece of software in the world - has literally thousands, maybe millions, of bugs in it that will never be addressed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry Zuksharn, but you are dead wrong.  I'm a VP at a small software development company, 50 employees.  We build applications for mostly government clients in the Washington, D.C. area.  I can tell you, that even with multiple teams, every business has limited resources.  You can only afford to have x number of people on your staff, period.  So, if you put a large share of those folks on one project, it naturally leaves less folks for the rest.  That is simple business practice.  <br />
<br />
Even if they could afford to hire more folks and still make their profit margins, there are other problems, finding good developers and the cost of recruiting, equipment and office space for them, additional overhead staff to support them, learning curve and ramp up time issues, etc.  No company has unlimited funds, not even Microsoft or SoE.  They are expected to work within a budget and an established level of staffing.  So, I'm sure that additional folks are hired to work on expansions, but that does not keep them from taking the brightest and the best and putting them on developing new code vs. fixing bugs.  I can tell you for a fact that the guys doing bug fixes are the new junior developers that have no clue as to how the code was originally written.  Happens that way at every software development company I've been with.  A senior and experienced developer does not want to fix code, they want to generate new code.  Make them fix stuff, other than in an emergency, and they will leave.<br />
<br />
Also, don't forget, working on a new expansion is work that is being done on &quot;overhead&quot;, meaning the company does not realize any revenue until well after it is released to the public.  Therefore, these types of efforts are investments and financially risky, so companies tend to limit their financial exposure by doing them as cost effectively as possible.  That means holding to a release date even if everything is not finished, in order to start generating revenue and recover some of the sunk costs, and using internal resources as much as possible so you don't have the expense of bringing on a lot of new folks.  <br />
<br />
Whatever the corporate focus is, is what will get the most and best resources.  And in this case that is developing new, money making expansions, not fixing the existing game.  <br />
<br />
That is just the way it is.  I just wish they would take a short break from grinding out expansions and focus on existing content, that's all.  But being a businessman, I know that will never happen, I guess the gamer in me is hoping for the impossible.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Thunder.. Brenlo has already said exactly what Zuksharn said in one of his responses to the very same question on the EQlive forums.. in that they have different departments that handle different things.  Which is why they have a team that's working on fixing certain bugs, and other teams such as those that are working on a new expansion.<br />
<br />
Oh, hey news flash.. they are already under development for an expansion after OoW.  Bet you didn't see that one coming did you?  That's just what you have to do though to survive in today's world.. always think to the future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Val,<br />
<br />
You are correct, I did not see Brenlo's post.  But I also know that those &quot;teams&quot; grow and shrink based on priorities.  As they get closer to release day for the expansion, it will become more and more of a priority, which will lead to more and more resources, from all teams, being dedicated to that task.  Whether it is for testing, coding, documentation, art work, clean-up, etc., the resources will be shifted to where they are needed.  In this case, the expansion, not fixing existing content.<br />
<br />
And as I stated, the double whammy is that as new projects come along, the more capable and experienced developers are put on the &quot;development&quot; jobs, not the clean up jobs.  So, you may have x number of bodies on your &quot;bug fix&quot; team, but they are usually junior, less experienced developers.  Who, after gaining some experience and knowledge of the code, are moved to the next development project, because they are more value to the company working on projects that will generate more revenue.  They will in turn be replaced by more junior developers, who once again, must climb the learning curve.  Therefore, it takes them longer to siff through the code (which they did not create) and determine how to fix an issue that may have been around for 2 or more years.  Heck, the game is 5 years old, some of them were still in college when the code they are working on was written.  It is an endless cycle.<br />
<br />
That is also what is required to survive.  Keep the money men (CFO and bank/investors) happy by making release dates, no matter what.<br />
<br />
The only way to break the cycle is to temporarily shift your focus and invest some time and quality resources on the existing game.  I stand by my earlier statements, as someone who has been there and done that.  <br />
