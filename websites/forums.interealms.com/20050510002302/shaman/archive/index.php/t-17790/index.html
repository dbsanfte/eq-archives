<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have not touched EQ for a couple months now and I actually happy about it.  It was a great game but IMHO is heading a bit south in its expansions.  I have been playing PS2 rpgs and such but I am thinking about heading back into the MMPROG world... <br />
<br />
Ive been told to stay far far away from SWG for awhile and I never really liked Dark Age of Camelot...  So that really only leaves me with this newer game.  I love the Final Fantasy games but from what I have read there is a pretty big split between haters and lovers of this game.  I was wondering if I could get the opinions of anyone that I at least have respect for in the Message board realm... I havent seen any professional reviews of the game yet.<br />
<br />
Well thanks and peace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Heh.. it looks like a fun game to try out, but I dunno something about it strikes me as not lasting long term.<br />
<br />
My main beef with FF games are FF fans, who think FF is the epitome of RPG gaming =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">From what I have been hearing from friends its not all that hot.<br />
<br />
You cant chose your server. So to get your friends all on the same server you have to use a world code yada yada. You can only invite one person per week to your server. Yea you can set up a chain but still a PITA. Exta chars over 1 cost extra. Mini games in the game cost extra. And combat skills are a PITA, you have to use mutipal drop down menus or make complex macros.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heres something I posted on my server and guild boards in discussions about FFXI, I'll post it here too since someone asked. I'm playing the closest thing the game has to a shaman, which is the red mage. Since this is kinda out of context without the other replies I do have to say the game is fun and the class/subclass system is the best in any mmorpg. I'd love to add a subclass in EQ. They do charge for each extra character, but its not really a big deal because you can change you class anytime you're in a city without losing levels or anything. You are rather limited in class choices to begin with though and need to reach 30+ do quests to unlock the advanced ones. <br />
<br />
There are a lot of problems with the UI, its ok once you get used to it, but after what 6 years of MMORPG's you think they could come up with a UI that doesn't suck worse then some of the original ones? Theres no good reason the PC Version should have the same UI as the console version. Its really not user friendly and designed for a game pad not a mouse/keyboard. (As far as to &quot;complex macros&quot; that is really no different then eq, just different tags). I actually kinda like the macro system better because I can define a macro to heal any team member without taking my target away from the mob. <br />
<br />
Travel times are the complete suck. Having to spend 20-30 minutes to travel to a leveling area for mid teens is a joke, and last night for example there wasn't even anything to kill when I got there (70 people in highlands). Soloing is completely gimped, which is a real PITA to me because my playtimes don't always match up with my friends due to work and school. <br />
<br />
Theres some real issues with low level mobs using some fairly high level effects. I died to poison quite a lot in the first 10 levels. Only white mages can cure poison or a single charge antidote is 350 gil or so. A lot of mobs use abilities like AE Sleep which is just lame when only the person that was tanking is awake for 3 minutes after the fight ends. <br />
<br />
The death penalty is horrendous considering first how long it takes to walk back to your camp and second how long it'll take to get the exp back, especially if you were soloing. Res I believe is a mid 20's white mage spell, but its still on 25% exp res. Mostly it just saves you a walk back. <br />
<br />
I'd really enjoy some of the higher level story line missions, but I'll have to get past lots of level grinding first and I just don't know if I can do it. <br />
<br />
Personally I'm happy to start on an existing server. For the most part I don't even notice the high level people there until I want to sell something and make some great gil. The really strict level requirements on the armor are a serious annoyance to me, but then again twinking has always been one of the favorite things for me to do. The biggest problem is every item is Required level so you can't use it at all until you're high enough. I really like the Reccommended level system in EQ. I just changed to a whitemage and had to buy a whole new set of gear because all my existing stuff was req lvl 7-11. That also brings me to another big problem, the inventory space is craptacular. To begin with you only get 30 slots and all of your equiped gear takes up inventory slots too. Items don't stack automatically you need to go into the item menu every single time you loot something and hit the command to stack stuff. The inventory system is really sad. <br />
<br />
Will I still be playing it in a month? Not sure, guess that depends more on my friends then me. Since at lvl 14 I'm already to the point of not being able to solo effectively I'll probably on be logging in when my friends are on. I have a lot of fun when with friends, but by myself its the same old wack a mob crap.<br />
<br />
As a continuation, even douing really isn't effective. With a monk/red mage duo we can kill 1-3 even to tough mobs for about 75 exp each or so before needing a full heal/med break. In a full group we can kill 1 Very tough mob for 196 exp in less time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I play it off and on, but I'm still fairly new to it so my point of view is as the n00bie we all know and love =p<br />
<br />
IMO it's got some nice mechanics (granted the xp system is very....EQish, expecially in the death xp loss and deleveling factor, but hey I'm used to that sorta system lol), I like the class systems, quests, and combat/spells so far.  The look and feel is most certainly Final Fantasy, feels very much like a consol game but IMO thats a lot more of a good thing than bad.  It's nice playing an MMO with an actual story and a very nice distinct flavor to it.<br />
<br />
Now for the stuff I'm fairly dissapointed with.  Been out for a year in Japan, which is all fine and well, but at NA realease they decided lets just cram everyone on the Japanese servers instead of opening any new one's and call it inovative =p.  I'm all fine and well w/ multi lingual servers, good idea IMO.....in theory....except:<br />
<br />
1) A hoard of rabbid monky's could of designed a easier to use translation tool w/ a better selection of &quot;common&quot; phrases.<br />
<br />
2) Not everyone wants to be subjected to the tedium of trying to communicate constantly with folks who dont speak your native language &quot;ALL THE TIME&quot; (I'm sure this goes both ways not just the English speakers lol).  A MMO is kinda a joke if communication doesn't come easily, it's a community based game duh.  No communicato = needless frustration.  I like the idea of the multi-lingual servers but I wouldnt' want to play exclusively on one or be forced to play one only, as we all are atm.<br />
<br />
Second is the control setup and UI......once again I must digress to my theory on the rabbid monkies....perhaps frenzied gerbles /ponder...anyway.  I hear if you get a game pad it's a lot more tolerable at least, since it's really designed for a PS type pad etc.  It's not a great ineterface but one can get used to it given time. Square has got a lot to learn about MMO's and interfaces from the other games out there IMO.<br />
<br />
Best thing that could happen for this game IMO is if they released a few North American servers for the english speakers who'd like to actually enjoy a game and not spend hours trudging though a horrible Translation tool in an effort to play a dang game.  Maybe perhaps work on their UI /shrug but thats not a huge deal as you can get used to it (though it still sucks), just dont expect a EQ or other MMO type UI =p  (I've learned not to take the scroll bar for granted in EQ now lol).<br />
<br />
Who knows maybe my oppinion will lax on the the language front as I play more but atm it's needlessly annoying that I can't understand a lot of folks and visa versa.  I'll keep playing though I like the feel of the game and it's fun none the less in it's own right.  A lot could be done to improve it IMO and if you go into it expecting to be totally amazed you'll likely find dissapointment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Horizons is currently due out Dec. 9th.  I'm waiting till it's been out a month to see some feedback before I pick another game to give a shot.  Don't expect WoW before 2005.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A couple of my friends that got in the Horizons beta were less than impressed.<br />
<br />
FFXI is wonderfully immersive and looks beautiful. The interface is somewhat unintuitive and I don't like the lack of customization in the UI. I guess EQ has me spoiled in that respect. Setting up combat macros is a nightmare and a half. I haven't really played enough to judge it, but my inital reaction is very favorable. I couldn't help but smile when I saw the moogle in my house and the chocobos in the stable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'll put it bluntly:<br />
<br />
FFXI is not very fun your first time through the low levels.<br />
<br />
You can't travel very quickly (can't do chocobo quest till 20).<br />
Even match and higher con mobs will tear your ass up in a hurry.  These are the only mobs you can cap your skills on.<br />
The game is not designed for solo play.  Don't expect to be soloing *effectively* past level 8 or so.<br />
<br />
With that said, the game opens up a lot starting in the late teens.  At level 18, you can complete a quest to have a subjob, which is a huge boon.  Your subjob, which you do have to level separately, functions at a maximum of half the level of your main job.  You get about 30% of the stats/HP/MP that your subjob would have at its current level (suppose you were a level 30 monk, with a 15 warrior subjob...you would have your base HP for a 30 monk plus ~30% of the HP of a 15 warrior, same applies for mages and MP, str/dex/agi/sta, etc.).  For mages, you can cast spells in your subjob (for instance a 22 black mage / 11 white mage could cast level 11 white mage spells, as well as their usual level 22 black mage spells).<br />
<br />
This system is extremely versatile.  As you can see, there are some class combinations that don't work too well (for instance, having a melee main job and taking a caster subjob, as your caster subjob would only have 30% of the MP as it would as a main job of its level).<br />
<br />
Combined with the fact that yes, there is a storyline, and you get to play the main character in that storyline (there are in-game cutscenes when you advance through the storyline), this is a helluva fun game.  Most importantly, for me, it actually FEELS like a Final Fantasy game, even though it's drastically different from any of the other games in the series.<br />
<br />
The UI does suck, but then again, so does Camelot's, so does Shadowbane's, and so did EQ's until about two years in.  Given time, I'm hoping the interface will improve.  If not, well, like any game, you get used to it.<br />
<br />
If you want to decide if FFXI is for you, or not, you pretty much have to play it.  Don't cop out if you try it, either.  Give it your full free month's worth of playing (however much that is, obviously varies from player to player) before you make a decision.  For myself, I've played it enough to know that I'm willing to pay the monthly fee, and I've only had the game since November 2nd.<br />
<br />
One note on the world pass system:  depending on how crowded your server is, a world pass will cost anywhere from 500-1500 or so gil, which, under normal conditions, you can earn in the newbie area over the course of a couple hours.  This will allow you to bring *five* of your friends over (not one, as a previous poster said).  The caveat is that they can't bring current characters over, they have to delete and remake on the new server.  Once you have a character on a particular server, if you choose to purchase an additional content ID (so that you can have two characters), all characters will be on the same server.  So you don't have to buy multiple world passes if you have multiple characters.<br />
<br />
The item to create a guild (called &quot;linkshells&quot; in FFXI) costs 8000 gil.  Again, under normal conditions, you can earn this in one night's (4-6 hours) play, if you know what you're doing.  I can elaborate if you wish; but it's semi-complicated and I don't want to extend an already long post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">WEll I tried FFX1 for 2 days. at the end of those 2 days I know what i wasnt to know about it. I do not like it it is visually beautiful ( as one would expect from a FF)  but game play blows and the interface belongs in my toilet. It is almost as though they didnt even try to learn from other mmorpgs as to wahat does not work.<br />
<br />
Oh yea if you cancel fro 3months ... YOU HAVE TO BUY THE GAME AGAIN TO PLAY ... yes you have to dish out another 50-60 bucks to play and your previous characters are gone. <br />
<br />
also 1 character unless you wanna pay an extra dollar a month for another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Onte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I like it, I'm having fun with it.  Lots of quests and missions and tradeskills.  The game is utterly huge and yeah, the UI is a bit weird at first but after a couple hours, I adjusted to it.  I probably won't play EQ for awhile =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">FFXI reminds me a lot of early EQ in terms of difficulty level and strong death penalty... oh, and travel times.  Seems to take forever just to run around town.<br />
<br />
I'm enjoying it so far, with about 12 hours played.<br />
<br />
If you need to sell your wife / girlfriend on this game, show her some Tarutaru models.  :)  They take &quot;cute&quot; and turn it up to 11.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I am playing FFXI now.<br />
<br />
I sort of stopped playing EQ several months ago, joined the Horizons beta test and played that until FFXI released.<br />
<br />
Its an interesting game.  I think that I like it, but it doesnt grab me the way EQ did.  It just doesnt have the immersive quality.  Perhaps because of the cartoonish look/console game feeling.<br />
<br />
The graphics are really good.  The game runs smoothly even on my old Athlon 1600 / geforce4 ti4600 system.  I hate the interface.  Its a console game, and plays best using a controller pad.  Lots of menus to go thru for most actions.  There are keyboard shortcuts, but they arent well documented (ie not documented at all in the manual).  The pace of the game is slower.  You have plenty of time to use the menus to select your actions.<br />
<br />
Combat is very interactive -there are no autoattack and afk fights.  The quests that I have done so far are well laid out and include cut scenes that render your character/group in their current gear into the scene... I find that impressive.<br />
<br />
Installation and patching was a pain.  The play online portal is just horrific.  Figuring out how to add to the friends list took days.<br />
<br />
Most of the players are japanese.  The game has been out for a year + in Japan, and is very popular there.  There is an included translation utility that makes communicating between english speakers and japanese much easier.<br />
<br />
The server selection thing isnt a big deal.  You are randomly assigned a server when you create a character, based on current population.  If you have friends on another server they can buy you a worldpass to play with them -even a starting character can earn enough for a worldpass (allowing up to 5 of their friends to join them) in a couple hours playtime.<br />
<br />
You can change classes anytime you like.  There are basic classes, and once you pass level 30 you can unlock additional classes via questing.  There is a quest at level 18 that allows you to have a subclass.  You can chose any class you have available to you as your subclass.  A subclass is limited to half the level of your main class, but still adds to your capabilities.<br />
<br />
All things considered, I like it so far.<br />

<br />

<br />
<br />
I'm not meaning to reply to this specific post, but Disgaea is a pretty good game.  Sort of like... and i'm using this example specifically because of this thread... Final Fantasy Tactics, except you are evil :)<br />
<br />
As to Final Fantasy XI,  I too have mixxed reactions.  I will definently play it out the free month, but i'm having second thoughts about keeping it past then, at least for now.<br />
<br />
First off, the good:<br />
<br />
*Graphics.  They are beautiful.  Amazing.  Even the people who said they were cartoonish (and most FF games are) said they were good, and thats saying something.  Aside from my connection, the game runs good and I have a fairly average system.  A gig of ram and an ATI 9700 (not even the 9800), and a P4 2.4 GHZ processor.  On a dialup, no doubt.  <br />
<br />
*Job system.  It's unique, and it offers a very wide variety of choices.  Yes, there are some jobs that do NOT go well together, but there are still plenty of options, even for the magic users (though they dont have as many as melee types)<br />
<br />
*Sound.  And cutscenes (which is graphics I suppose) but the sounds are very good as well, and so far haven't gotten annoyingly repetitive like so many others.<br />
<br />
*Quests.  A lot of them, and that is good.  There are quests for everything.  You need to quest to learn to ride chocobos, you need to quest to learn to get a secondary job, you need to quest for each of the advanced jobs.   There are maps you can only get by questings.  These are all standard quests, that some people might claim to be too linear, but thats all there can be.  (I'd like to hear one example of a quest that is not a &quot;Go here, do this, and return&quot; quest.  Even crafting items for a quest is basically the same thing for crafters, but i'm rambling)<br />
<br />
Now... the bad:<br />
<br />
*Job system...kinda.   There is a max level of 80 for any job,  and since you can switch jobs at any time pretty much, it is in theory possible to get to level 80 in all of them.  There aren't any restrictions that I know of against it.  This is all hypothetical of course, but very much later in the games life, it could lead to everyone being one or two &quot;uber&quot; combinations.  <br />
<br />
*Travel.  It's horribly slow, and you can't fight on a chocobo even after you get to level 20.  I started in San d'Oria, and i'm not paying for a second character, so i dont have any other viewpoints.. but even just moving around town takes a bit of time.   Thiefs get an ability called &quot;Flee&quot; which increases movement speed a bit.  Supposably, it's used to ... welll... flee.  But it's not.  I see people using it ALL the time just to get around town and where ever.  <br />
<br />
*Interface.  You know I had to get to it :)  It's cumbersome to learn, at best.  I get the impression that the designers wanted to be able to copy the game to the PS2 version with a minimum of re-programming, which frankly I understand.  Macros ARE hard to learn and are not documented.  But, with time this can be overcome.  You can have upwards to, I believe, 20 hotkeys. (Two pages.. holding down alt or ctrl, gives you a list of 1-10.  Dont know off-hand if alt+ctrl would give a third..)  It's sufficient if you only play one combination, but if you like to switch from a warrior-type to a caster-type, expect to do a bit of re-binding these keys.<br />
<br />
*Language barrier.  There are no servers specifically for any nationality, and the translation feature could have been done a LOT better.  It suffices, and for the most part, the Japanese players are a decent lot.<br />
<br />
*Soloing.  Dont even think about it past 10, really.  It is possible, but you wont get hardly any skill gains from lower-level mobs (Even and up give consistant,  anything less gives Very rare) so even if you do level, your skills will be behind.  If you are on an odd schedule, it is not all lost.  Since the above problem here becomes a benefit.  If you can figure out what each other is saying. :)   Soloing is a poor choice.  Since you can't effectively be a warrior/white mage for healing (because of hideously low mana) the usual combos wouldn't work out too well.  A paladin Might. I really dont know.  (They have paladins and dark knights.  The roles , however, are very clear.  Paladins are tanks.  Dark knights are damage dealers.<br />
<br />
*In a small way, the job system has a lot unsaid that you will have to learn from other players.  Such as not taking a melee and a caster.  And some advanced jobs will NEVER make good secondary classes.  (A dragoon gets a wyvern pet.  But, ONLY if it is the primary class, with the wyverns abilities being based off the secondary.  As a secondary class, you lose most of the point of being a dragoon)<br />
<br />
*Class balance is always an issue, and it'll always be an issue, for EVERY game.  I like to think that I can come up with a setup for classes/jobs/whatever for a game that would be immune, but lets face it.  None of us can, unless the only classes ARE the ones in a 'holy trinity' style group.<br />
<br />
*World passes.  Server choice is random, and the only way to get friends in is to buy a World Pass, which is a code you put in at character creation to get you into a specific world.  They dont cost too much though.   My friend (I mention her in the college problem later, this happened after she brought the game) had someone give her enough Gil to buy a pass, it is not that much money especially at the later levels.<br />
<br />
*PlayOnline.  They use a program interface called PlayOnline to sort out their games (FFXI comes with Tetra Master, an online card game (the card game from FF9 if you are familiar))  This is cumbersome as well, and takes a while to load up any of the games.  Logging out isn't too hard (right click, log out, takes you to the first screen where you can exit) but logging in is slow-ish, and theres a lot to the interface.  It tries to be a gateway chat/meeting ground/email system all in one, i think.  <br />
<br />
****Another problem with PlayOnline.  If you are a college student, you may have trouble getting this to work if your college is cracking down on file sharing.  A good friend of mind is reporting an inability to connect to the server.  She says her college is going crazy with stopping file swapping, blocking all sorts of ports and outgoing/incoming traffic.  Just something to keep in mind, not a real problem with the game.  <br />
<br />
//<br />
<br />
Now, it may seem that since the bad points out-number the good, that i'm saying I dont like the game, or I think it needs a lot of work.  Except for the interface, all the bad parts can pretty much be worked around in some way, if you're willing to put in the effort.  Unless you dont like people and always want to solo.  Then you should not get this game.  You WILL have to group.  <br />
<br />
I brought the game because I love the Final Fantasy world, though I hardly consider it the epitome of roleplaying goodness.  This game released in the US with remarkable smoothness and is a great new game to get if you want to try something a little different and not have to worry about bugs. <br />
<br />
Final Analysis:  DEFINENTLY check this game out for the free month trial.  Hell, it's worth it just to wander and check out the landscape nearly.  It will definently appeal to a slightly narrower crowd (because of the lack of soloing ability)  but the wider playerbase (from Japan) helps add more people to counter that.  <br />
<br />
I still play EQ, and I probably will for a while yet, honestly.  I dont expect EQs graphics to be nearly as good as any new game.  It's silly to think that.  At any rate, I have my reasons, other people have theirs, we're in our Happy Place. :)<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It's definitely interesting, but I don't know that it will draw me away from EQ.<br />
<br />
As everyone else has said, the graphics are very nice, and run well even on mid-range systems. Tarutaru are almost unbearably cute, and I personally like the models for all of the races. The job system allows you to play as many classes as you want with only one character (not all at the same time, mind you). I know that several classes interest me right now, so there looks to be some depth to the game in terms of playing around with the various jobs.<br />
<br />
Installation of the game is needlessly confusing. It's not as bad as some people say, but you do generate multiple passwords, etc. The initial install took me over 2 hours due to massive patch downloads, and I'm on a fast DSL connnection. Overall, the setup and configuration process could be a lot smoother. I feel like I should have received some xp just for completing it.<br />
<br />
It is possible to get the server you want without resorting to a Worldpass, as long as you are persistent. Just delete your new character and make a new one until you get on the right one. You can skip the intro movie by hitting ESC at the screen where you assign your character to a handle (don't ask, I don't understand the handle thing myself). Then just select your character and see what server you got assigned to. It's needlessly cumbersome, but it works.<br />
<br />
The interface... well, the nicest thing you can say about it is that it takes some getting used to. You can have 200 macros, not 20, btw. If you hold down CTRL or ALT and then hit the arrow keys, you will cycle through the macro banks. I bought a gamepad to use with the FFXI, but I still mostly use the keyboard. How the developers can essentially ignore the main tool for communication in a MASSIVELY MULTIPLAYER game is beyond me. You'd think they would encourage people to use the keyboard. Anyway, the interface is extremely annoying in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Gameplay seems okay, so far. Lots of carrot-based leveling, much like EQ. The stick comes out when you die - the xp penalty on death is brutal, and xp rezzes come very late in the game (I'm not that far in yet). Soloing seems difficult, and grouping with people who don't all speak the same language can be a real challenge. Heck, I'm sure we've all had trouble in groups where language isn't a barrier, so adding more complications to the mix just makes things worse.<br />
<br />
Content is a big question mark for me. I like the quests, but I don't know if the game will hold my attention like EQ has. There seem to be plenty of mobs to xp on so far, but after that... I have no idea.</div></div><hr />

What makes you say this? Where did you hear that? I thought mid-end 2004 it would be out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think he is basing it on the fact that Bliizard always takes their time on getting games out and they always seem to be pushed back a couple times. Now to FFXI. Bought it, played it for about 10 days and the only time I will run it again is to cancel my account. To me its like all the other MMORPGs out there, they are ok to start but I just realize there its not as immersive as EQ and just cant hold my attention. DAOC,SB,FFXI,SWG none of those games grabbed ahold of me from the get go like EQ did, with EQ I was in awe with the others its eh.</div></div><hr />

Well they claim open beta sometime in q4 2003.(IE: between now and end of december ) *shrug*.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm having fun playing FFXI casually<br />
<br />
however, it is not the kind of game i think i will find myself playing full time like i did with everquest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I would like to addone thing about the quests. My joy knew no bounds as I was redirected in my SECOND MISSION to go see a character who makes the Final Fantasy franchise: Chief Engineer Cid. <br />

Regarding WoW, Blizzard has notoriously long beta times, but they actually release a finished product, too. I would bet six to eight months in beta, probably leaning toward eight months. Round trip it'll probably be nine months or so from beta one to gold. Assuming they get the beta program rolling by the end of the year, we'll probably see WoW on shelves before next holiday season.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And the installation - especially the downloading of patches - was horrible on a modem.  It took a DSLer 2 hours?  It took me 10.  Literally. <br />

Blizzard estimates are never within a year of the actual release.  I'll gladly eat my hat if they get it out in 2004, but I have no expectations that's actually going to happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, the next time Blizzard gets a game out the door on time will be the first time, which is perfectly fine by me. I'd much rather wait and get a complete, polished product than be blessed with a pile of half-functional crap right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Ok ive played it for a few days...<br />

Some will love it some won't<br />
<br />
Since I am not burdoned/blinded by the EQ habit anymore I can say that this game has the most potential, best release, and cutest race out of any MMPROG to date.  This game is polished.  It has been out for a year in Japan but from the reviews ive read in the past it was a solid release there too.<br />
<br />
Like someone else said the faults are easily trodded around or learned.  If you simply cannot learn, get used to, the keyboard controls like I did... go out and get yourself a 20 dollar gamepad.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, game is huge, beautiful, will run beautiful on an old system (866proc 512ram geforece4ti4600) and is DEEP.  As deep as any out right now.<br />
<br />
Anyone who can say &quot;in final fantasy you just fight the same things over and over just a different skin&quot; with a straight face and then proclaim the superiority of EQ needs to take a break from EQ ;)  They are going crazy hehe.</div></div><hr />
