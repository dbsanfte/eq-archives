<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Dont' want to bore you with too much info, but wanted to show you some parsings that i've done on some fights while raiding lately.  I know that for most part shaman aren't considered dps, and on some fights, we just generally have really hard time landing some things.  However, there are some certain fights where i'm continually ranking in the top 10 in overall dmg done (and this is even after slowing/crippling the mob as well).  <br />
<br />
I'm not saying shaman are great dps, i'm merely saying that in certain situations we can really bring the heat.<br />
<br />
We did the cursecallers the other day and I typically can usually get a huge parsing of overall dmg from the fight, but this time I had so many dots on the mob that I missed the message that one was chasing me and ended up getting killed hehe.<br />
<br />
Keledrix (of note, the shield dmg in there is because yes, I got summoned when the tank got banished, I didn't die, i was healed and the next tank eventually got his agro back from me.  Also, the dot dmg isn't known by the poster of the parser (solesk) so we have to show him what our dmg is if we want it included)<br />
http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v402/stalker1121/EQ%20Pics/kelefight.jpg <br />
<br />
Terms of overall dmg from my guild, this is how it was:<br />
Solesk (rog): 80k, 602dps<br />
Chable (monk): 52k, 387dps<br />
Quixen (rog): 48k, 365dps<br />
Urim (beast): 46k, 352dps<br />
Descanreux (wiz): 43k, 416dps<br />
Scancs (monk): 41k, 310dps<br />
Yaxa (wiz): 40k, 465dps<br />
Valsuvious (sham) 38k, 378dps<br />
Ishalan (ran): 37k, 281dps<br />
Talyen (rog): 37k, 278dps<br />
Headboss (war): 36k, 277dps<br />
Keylonis (wiz): 35k, 316dps<br />
Valsuvious`s pet: 7k, 129dps (not sure if this includes the proc dmg or not /shrug)<br />
Urim`s warder: 4k, 37dps<br />
<br />
So, my overall dmg for the fight including my pet would have put me in the top 5.  Not too bad for a fight that around 3 min tops.<br />
<br />
Solo Askr the Lost kill.  Pet dmg is not included in it, neither was my two spirit pets that I used during it (forgot to turn on pet dmg).  DPS would have been a bit higher, but it took me a minute or two before I realized that I could land poison stuff on him (not to mention I had no dmg shield):<br />

<br />
I have a few other ones that I can post, but I don't want to put up all the pictures cause I have no way of cropping it to remove all the stuff I don't want on it.<br />
<br />
Guess my point is, from everything that I've done parsing wise, to me it seems that the best combo of spells combined with my focus' to get the best ideal dps in a raid, is use Sisslak and bane (all of my parsings have had bane come out ahead dps wise, but then again, i do not have a poison dot focus that I use regularly), use both rains (yoppa and tears of saryrn), and then hit Yoppa Spear because the first rain won't be refreshed when I can cast again.  This will deplete your mana alot and quickly of course.  During most fights, if I know that I really won't have to cure/heal anyone and I can do all out on dps, I demem ancient canni and put something else in that slot for dps.  Usually I do what I described above and put 2nd rain in canni slot, and only use a rod and canni5 to get some mana back.  Normally I end the fights pretty low on mana of course.<br />
<br />
During groups, ideally for me, I like to use one rain, one poison nuke and sisslak.  I will hit ancient canni whenever I can, but this set up usually gives me pretty nice dps numbers, especially since I have maxed nuke crits and most of my dot crits done.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I began toying with the idea of attempting to DPS when fights like (Time) Terris and Saryrn in time became total cakewalks (well, before WoW/EQ2 came out at least)... I Regularly was able to get around 300dps on terris, and a bit lower on saryrn because for some reason we fight her on the mezzable side and thus I can't use rains.  Our bsts  try to slow the adds anyways, why should I waste time overwriting it when it's mitigated anyways and they hit for like 500? Innoruuk is another nice one to try cause his resists are low, but getting feared, or the tank getting feared , or an add stomping you dead can obviously mess you up!<br />
<br />
I recently extended this to experience groups. I was recently grouped in Muramite Proving grounds up near the trial of fear portal, pulling Bluespark and Miseryfiend Ghio. We had a monk in the group using a Segmented Staff of Ceremony (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68941) and I out DPSed him on about 80% of the fights. Granted, they were skewed in my favor as I was able to malos on inc and immediately start casting curse of sisslak after clicking my TA.<br />
<br />
Vals I noticed one thing from your parses, you don't click Pox of Bertoxxulous. I don't know if you just don't bother swapping em in, or you forgot, but for 4 sec casting time and no mana, an extra 120ish per tick. Facade of Fright and Symbol of the Planemasters focus it too, cause it's a spell we can actually cast. When I'm in groups I usually click my pox pants immediately after casting sisslak during the gem refresh, then go right into casting bane.<br />
<br />
Last point I wanted to make is that there's no necros on your top 10 list, and I'm absolutely certain they annihilate us ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, we had been averaging 3 necros for a while there, but when wow/eq2 came out, two of them haven't been seen since.  One I know hasn't totally decided what to do yet, but the other we haven't heard anything from.  The one that I know might not be done, him and I used to have dps fights all the time before seeing who could have the highest.  Best one that I could remember, he did over 500k in dmg not including his pet and I did over 300k before the fight was done (was cursecallers in inktu'tu.. a dotting class paradise fight).  The one necro that is still around doesn't really post her parsings so other than her DD dmg I have no clue what she has been doing.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I normally forget about casting pox, but most of the time, is cause I waste dps when I try to use it.  I say this cause instead of using it, I could be casting rains or poison DDs, and the overall dmg from them is usually more than what the dmg I could get from pox.  <br />
<br />
Then again, some of it is just that I forget that I have it in the bag.  The Askr fight next time I should be able to easily do over 300dps just because I will start using poison dots rather than figuring it out later in the fight.</div></div><hr />

Call me dumb, but I've always wondered why I can't get this to work :(<br />
I can never tell if it's even taking a screen capture.</div></div><hr />
