<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">- was ebolt hugely powerful? or was it dispelled too often to do any real dmg<br />
<br />
- was greater healing a useful heal? i can imagine people not having alot of hp back then, so it should have done atleast 1/4 of the total health<br />
<br />
- are there any sites that would have a list of spells that came out at launch, and before kunark (specifically a list of spells from original.. im aware of lucy :p) <br />
<br />
- were we really all that powerful? or is it just a case of people only remembering the good things about lvl 50 pvp.. and forgetting the bad<br />
<br />
- and lastly.. any pvp tips from that time would greatly appreciated :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">nothing by itself was hugely powerful, it was the combination of what we had that was powerful.<br />
<br />
as for pvp, cancel magic/anul magic are great, as is blinding flash if they dont have high resist and ofcourse malo/ malisini lines and slow for mellee. and always have pet out.<br />
<br />
other things dont be afaird to mellee alittle, but make sure you can root them so you can back off to heal. the greater heal wasnt that good eveen in kunark which is why they replaced it with the non complete heal and the fast heal latter. it was torpor that was good. or the new one they gave below.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Take a look at this, maybe it will help:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Back then resists were hard to come by, and you had to prioritize your gear and/or switch gear depending on opposition. Most everyone put primary focus on mr to resist root/snare/blind and cr to resist ice comet, alternatively fr versus mage and druid nukes. <br />
<br />
This benefited shaman because it was rare to find an unbuffed pr above 70. Disease often lower than that, with only int casters going a bit higher with stein of moggok equipped. The bane of shaman were the ogre butcher gloves with their 25pr/dr, specially on a warrior with indo boots 15pr/dr.<br />
<br />
However, apart from that ebolt almost always landed. Melees got knocked down to half life by it, and any caster who couldnt heal would die from it unless they had some hp buff up. Remember hp gear was very scarce too. Ebolt was pretty much fire and forget. Curing ebolt was only an option for the priests, and they seldom had the spell memmed anyway.<br />
<br />
Root, blind and slow actually landed for crowd control. Add shaman utility, sow speed and resist buffs. Yes we were total powerhouses, only really rivalled by a wizard who got the jump on you. Even then ebolt had a 0.1sec lead on IC cast time, which was always fun to exploit.<br />
<br />
Didn't really need any strat back then. With the basic spell lineup:<br />
<br />
dispell<br />
root<br />
canna<br />
togors or sow, depending on opposition<br />
ebolt<br />
VoS or plague<br />
blind<br />
gheal<br />
<br />
What you have to remember is that back then instacast storebought pumice still existed, 13pp a pop. Anyone who realized the power of this and used it extensively (im talking 10 full pumices a fight) would be very much difficult to beat. Imagine being trailed by a troll warrior who hits you with a dispell every 5 secs. You wont be running away from him. It all comes down to his magic resist and if you can land a blind. Root would be dispelled instantly and togors had too long cast time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What asta said.<br />
<br />
Back then, it was certainly more fun too.  None of this book hopping crap you get today.  Was also always nice to see people run away from the mere sight of you.  As a class, we really haven't slowed down or become less powerful.  It's just that with inflated gear and everything else, everybody else sped up and became so much more powerful than us since then.  Hell, when everybody was lucky to wield a short sword of ykesha, an ebolt and an ice comet were extremely powerful.<br />
<br />
But yeah, those were fun times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Throm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Never pvp'd much except against friends occassionally.  Back then, DOT's had a tendency to cause xp loss if the DOT actually killed someone, so I tended to gimp myself and didn't use EBolt.  As others have noted, EBolt was very powerful, even in pve.  <br />
<br />
As far as original spell list, I know caster's realm lists era the spell was introduced.  Basically, there were no poison DD's and no HOS/IOS.<br />
<br />
I found the pet to be extremely beneficial against casters to counteract shadowstep and they also could interrupt spells.  Incapacitate was fun on melee (except monks) in that sometimes they would be so encumbered as to be snared by the decreased STR.    Of course, flash of light was always mem'd for pvp.<br />
<br />
In contrast to Astra, I almost always had a DD loaded, even though it was only 430 damage.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xysander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I played an enchanter back then and an ebolt that landed on me (which was pretty close to 100% of the time with resists those days) meant a run back to my body unless I was with a healer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Asta hit the nail on the head. I did PvP quite a bit before 50/kunark. Resists were very hard to come by, had to stick with BD gear, but only if you had the money. spell lineups and gear lineups changed with your opponent. good buffs were buried deep no matter who you fought. greater heal was good for our level because we didn't have all that many hp. Ebolt was an extremely powerful dot, as was plague(with quick debuff and plague, people had a hard time resisting)<br />
<br />
I miss the good old days, but my favorite time to pvp was pre luclin at 60</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">sounds good.. thanks for the infos guys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Those were the good old days. I could kill almost anyone. Ebolt was never resisted and life was good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Einnod, gonna be a bastard and nitpick on you a bit. Pardon me.<br />
<br />
BD gear didn't exist back then and bufforder didnt really matter at all since anyone worth their salt had bags and bags of insta-pumices, or even worse had golemwands.<br />
<br />
<br />
And shame on me for forgetting incapacitate! I used that in pvp alot more than togors. Very good tool versus the annoying druids and clerics who could heal our dots. Stick incap on them, watch those weak elves and pecks (except dwarves) getting permasnared with &lt;75agi and sic dogdog. He'd tear through them in no time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">while it is hard to believe, you have to remember back then our melee skills didn't just absolutely blow, compared to other classes. <br />
<br />
then again we didn't have the massive weapons of today either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Good thread, keep it up y'all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">actually, back then BDs and diamonds dropped in PoHate and PoFear, you just had to be in a very good guild to get them, and the guild had to have a highly skilled crafter... so yes, it did exist, but it was very very rare. BD bracers were like 10k a pop back then, and the diamond rings were pretty close to that..<br />
<br />
Other than that, people did have a lot of those egg pumices, but I never got bombed like that, so it didn't really affect me. Oh, and the incapacitate line... I loved landing that on those int casters! gogo shaman snare! tee hee</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Blue Diamond Bracers didn't come out till Velious</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Angilia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I was on Tallon for PVP and it all boiled down to the class and stuation you were fighting.<br />
<br />
Ebolt very powerful. Blind was fantastic. Dog Dog was always out.<br />
<br />
You cannot compare a duel with PVP because a duel your prepared with the correct spells and are aware of the target. PVP meant you could be low health from a PVE fight and BLAM nakid wizzy is looting your tunic.<br />
<br />
Blind a melle and laugh for a few as they run in circles or get caught in a tree.<br />
dot them and hit them from behind with melle.<br />
<br />
Necros were very powerful also because of the pets and dots. again low resists made them nasty to fight.<br />
<br />
the only class we really had issues with was Bards. But EVERYONE had issues with bards. Cant slow em down, they dont need to stop to cast on you and no mana to run out of. Can wear em down but could never kill em.<br />
<br />
Resists were almost tottaly magic cause everyone hated root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">bumpity bump bump</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">When i begun playing, right before Kunark was released, landing spells was so much easier with everyone PVPing naked...<br />
<br />
Back then we had item loot, and if you put your stuff in bags noone could loot em...</div></div><hr />
