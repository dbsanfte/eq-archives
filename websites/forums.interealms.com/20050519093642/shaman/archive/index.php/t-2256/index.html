<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Snakeking</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have heard different things from many people regarding the regen rate of a Troll while sitting or standing.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know the correct figures? I know it goes up as you level.<br />
<br />
I am wanting to purchase a Ceremonial Iksar BP to stack with the innate regen, and was told that they do, in fact, stack.<br />
<br />
So, I'm assuming that at lvl 24, a Troll with Iksar BP, and regen cast on himself would have a damn nice HP regen rate.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thats phenomanal regen<br />
<br />
18(sitting)+3(AA)+20(regrowth)+~20(fungi tunic)+40(potion)+2(Bear Form) = 103 hitpoints a tick regen<br />
<br />
w00t!<br />
<br />
edit: Also any Aura of Battle item you own +2 regen a tick</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just remember that you pay dearly for this as a Troll/Iksar with a experience penalty ... the current worst in game.    AA doesn't factor penalty's ... Thank God.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Snakeking</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i played an iksar shammy up to lvl 21, and it didnt seem much slower than my barb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Note... <br />
<br />
Regrowth is only 15 hp per tick (last time I looked)<br />
Fungi Tunic is also 15 hp per tick (last time I looked)<br />
I don't think the potion will stack with regrowth (but not sure)<br />
There is a fungi stick does something like 25 hp per tick but doesn't stack with regrowth<br />
<br />
So I think this would actually be the numbers<br />
<br />
18+3+25+15+2  = 63<br />
<br />
Also level... by the time you hit 59 as a troll/Iskar you would be level 60 as a barb.  (I think)  And if I remember hearing right 59 is a hell levels hell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lol - Just wait until you're grinding it out in a real level...  It took me significantly longer to clear levels than many people that I play with (especially those pesky halfling rogues ;-)  Don't get me wrong - the exp penalty is well worth it, but if you try to compare it to any low level experience rate (say pre-45 or so), you're just setting yourself up for a major disappointment when things start slowing down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just a bit of information.<br />
<br />
link concerning the subject  (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=836) <br />
<br />
Cats have 0% racial penalties<br />
Barbarians 5%<br />
Ogres 15%<br />
Trolls/Iksars 20%.<br />
<br />
A little OLD birdie once told me that exp from lvl 57 to 58 was something like the following:<br />
<br />
Troll/Iksar - 49,599,600<br />
Ogre - 47,532,950 <br />
Barb - 43,399,649<br />
Cat's - 41,200,600 (?)<br />
  <br />
By the numbers it's easy to see what the penalties effects are by  each class in the high fifties.   A 2 million point swing between Troll/Iksar's and Ogre ... to over a 6 million point between Barb's ... and higher between Cat's since they have no exp penalty.   Alot of extra mob's to kill to make up that differance.<br />
<br />
The earlier levels require smaller pools of experience to lvl ... so the penalty doesn't hurt/show as much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&quot;and it didnt seem much slower than my barb.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well then, it gets exponentially worse as you level up. Starting around level 40 I really began to notice the penalty. Trolls and iksar basically consume entire levels in exp penalties.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Snakeking</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">yeah, i can imagine it gets MUCH worse from 40+.<br />
<br />
hmmm...still deciding between troll, barb, and cat.<br />
<br />
started a cat and he did look DAMN cool twinked out with <br />
barbed bp and some JB stuff.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hmm well I must say grinding exp at level 58 as a Troll really doesnt bother me, I dont notice the difference at all.<br />
<br />
/shrug I guess maybe because I dont think about it or worry about it because their is no reason too, I new what I was getting into when I created this character.  <br />
<br />
Hrmm you think this is bad try playing a Troll SK back in the day with the hybrid exp penalty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">/agree Scurg<br />
<br />
If a big chunk of joo exp comes from solo grinding then the extra regen compensates dramiticaly for da exp penalty.<br />
<br />
Mez think da lvl at about the same rate if soloing.<br />
<br />
Troll just kills more mobs in da same amount of time to overcome da exp penalty with the added compensation of more loot.<br />
<br />
Ous Ogres realy bight the exp penalty...  we get 15% without the regen and even thow the no stun is nice it does not have near the impact on kill rate that the extra regen does.  Mez would think da Troll  lvl faster then Ogre even thow they have a 5% greater exp penalty.<br />
<br />
Even as an ogre it not that hard to lvl.<br />
