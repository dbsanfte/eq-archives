<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Level 62...in a raid heavy guild...NTOV etc....<br />
<br />
Is there an upgrade that is worth more than the mana saved (ie FT1) from the ODS<br />
<br />
Not in VT yet so nothing from there is obtainable.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it really depends on your spell situation. As you level up to 65 and fill out your spell book you will use 60- spells less and less. Slow will always be 60- and torpor is only upgraded at 65.<br />
<br />
One upgrade that you might look into is 8th shawl. This is about the same as the ods when using only 60 spells, but gets better and better as you get higher level spells. The ft is nice to have, and the focus effect is super :)<br />
<br />
Once you are using mainly 61+ spells you would look into spirit wracked cords, strength of the elements as 2 quest options. Mantle of fortitude from shei should be within your reach soon and is about the best pre-vt shoulder you could hope for(good luck getting it:)<br />
<br />
There really aren't a ton of nice shoulders out there unfortunately.</div></div><hr />

Mana preservation is WAY WAY overrated. I'd never wear an ODS.<br />
<br />
<br />
Get what I have... chokidai hide pauldrons. Exactly 100hp!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would have to disagree with Mana Preservation being overrated.<br />
<br />
It's very good.  I still use a great many pre-60 spells, including malo, torpor, pox, bane, turgurs, torrent of poison, more.  I often still buff with Khuras and Brute/Regrowth of Dar Khura - rather than using single target soul, grunt and replenishment.<br />
<br />
I think Mana Pres 3 is still valuable for shaman until they get 65 and get Malos and Quiescience.  Because you are still using torpor to regain mana and you are still using malo to debuff and you are STILL using your level 51 turgurs insects on virtually every mob.<br />
<br />
If you do want to upgrade shoulders anyways, there are a few I would suggest.<br />
<br />
Matchless/Peerless Mantles from West Wastes are always good, Death Watchers Shroud from Umbral is good, Barbed Rubicite Coif from CT is good, Spirit Wracked Cords and Strength of the Elements are good quested...  <br />
<br />
In terms of raid drops, I'm not so sure but I heard theres a nice one that drops off the Manaetic Prototypes in inner Plane of Innovation, then several off Luclin mobs like Shei, Emp, High Priest.</div></div><hr />
