<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not much specifically to interest shamans in todays patch, except perhaps this:<br />
<br />
Removed the reduction in damage to Damage over Time spells when used on NPCs that are moving.<br />
<br />
Woah! Ok so probably more beneficial for snaring classes, but still woah-worthy I feel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">- Altered pet summoning spells so that they always summon the most powerful pet possible, instead of pets within a 5 level range. <br />

That seems pretty cool too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Before they nerfed DOTs on moving targets Grippa, Druids were certainly not as powerful with DOTs as shaman were.  <br />
<br />
The change helps shaman immensely—at all levels.  <br />
<br />
Sort of makes me want to come out of retirement !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I never new they had changed the Movement reducing DOT effect. I've always thought it was there, unless the MOB was feared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I always thought (and I'm not 'old school' enough to know for certain) that the reason shamans used to be super DoT-tastic was that disease DoTs used to be a whole lot better. Nothing to do with the moving target changes ...<br />
<br />
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I still can't see kiting single mobs as a viable option for the soloing shaman. Especially now we're all converted to the HP/AC route. For one thing, kiting only works well in open outdoor zones, quite a lot of soloing shammies prefer to get up close and personal in a dungeon, using their high AC and slows to survive.<br />
<br />
Kiting negates our greatest assest - slow. Or rather makes it not required. And we don't have snare, or any AOE spells, so we can't quad kite.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to be confrontational, or even anti-druid, I just honestly can't see why shamans would want to kite.<br />
<br />
Please feel free to correct me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I believe the DoT nerf - as programmmed - affected you whether you genuinely kited or not.  Rather than just reducing damage on any tick in which the mob moved, it also reduced the duration of the DoT.<br />
<br />
So, if a dotted mob switched aggro after being dotted and moved even a small amount you got a significant reduction in the effect of the DoT.<br />
<br />
I didn't like the way the original nerf was programmed, but would prefer to see kiting discouraged by a more sensibly programmed nerf.  But then I don't like kiting, and I don't like kiters, and that I recognise is just my personal taste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Give all mobs with DoTs on them an additional effect of Spirit of Cheetah :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">This is actually pretty decent.  Gives wis shaman a means to solo without getting pummeled.  As for the health/AC shaman, think about it, on a long kite figure about 3 minutes, you're regening health and converting it to mana, so you're essentially medding on the run.  Its a decent bone for none JBB shaman as well.<br />
<br />
I might try it for a change sometime soon, but will likely switch back to the &quot;in your face&quot; approach as it just seems more balls out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Great change for killing all those low hp mobs for faction<br />

I m actually switching from cov thurg to Kael faction (I need to stop taking faction hit from AOW tho..)<br />
<br />
Dorf in GD roughly have the same hp than bane of nife do damage when they rooted (the green con hehe not the blue summoner in little house in front of thurg or blue con in mine).<br />
<br />
now, just run, bane, run to other etc. And let pet finish them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Khall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">They nerfed the dots because shaman, druids and necro's used to be able to kill yellows and reds with no fear of dying period. When my druid was 14 pre-nerf, i was killing red dw crocs with no downtime.<br />
<br />
Basically you load up yor dots and run, the mob never hits you and because dots are so mana effieffiecent you can kill just about anything you can land a dot on. Combine that with canablize for med on the run and you have a powerful combination.<br />
<br />
And i think, ebolt used to do 5k in damage, or plauge. But that was nerfed long before the dot nerf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Will Shamans ever kite?  bleh.  I spend all this money on Hps/AC gear and now everyone's gonna start talking about Wisdom being KING again so you can get a really nice Kite.  (semi-sarcastic there).  I can see it being done at low levels, or in rare occasions like Uthgar pointed out.<br />
<br />
Im more excited about the maximum level pets than anything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Boraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">In the old days disease dot used to last upwards of 7minutes and do close to 5k damage.  I remember level 30's and 40's killing ice giants by disease kiting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Ever have a mob move on the last tick of Epic? UGH!  It's just nigh impossible for us to root and rot things w/o losing something.  Maybe I'll start using those disease dots on mobs who don't summon that con even to me (Goranga scouts come to mind).. NAH!<br />
<br />
Again this is a small, but viable assist to our offense and I won't bitch.  If I was a druid I'd bitch because they need there concerns addressed in other manners. This would NOT be the bone I wanted thrown to me personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Geoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I used to kite all the time as my best RL friend played a Druid.  About all we could do to kill mobs when we duo'd was kite.  Luckily he wised up and now plays a monk.  Haven't kited since and wonder daily why we ever did.  To me kiting has always felt like an exploit (especially using blind) and I rarely felt proud of a kill.  On the other hand, going toe-to-toe with fists and venom is the bomb =)<br />
<br />
Personally I don't like this change.  IMO the ability to do more damage just means VI is gonna have to make mobs tougher.  Seems like with all the 60 droods around kiting as it was was already good enough.<br />
<br />
But hey what do I know, I'm just a silly shaman ;)<br />

<br />
Hoho, the arrogance of all the shammies that think they're so tough they don't need to kite...<br />
<br />
It's another option, and a very viable one... I've been pet kiting HGs in RM recently with my shammy (lvl 38ish at the time), the xp is fine and the loot is great, with very little downtime. Pull with malisement, root once, stack venom and scourge, wait for root to break, sic dog then run in circles, canni'ing occasionally :)<br />
<br />
It's actually a lot more fun than just standing next to the mob and getting hit... especially with giant mobs that hit like brick outhouses.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I'm wearing all HP/AC gear, and nearly maxed defence. But I'm not ashamed to kite if it helps me kill stuff quicker... that would be foolish.<br />
<br />
I couldn't tank those giants in the million years, even with slow.<br />

I'm pretty sure you mean that the normal damage was reduced by 1/3, Snap...dont think this nerf applied to Fear Kiting though.<br />

WOOT !!!   No more going OOM casting for a non-green pet. A big issue to me as I'm disconnected by my ISP every 2 hours and multiple casts for a cyan / blue pet and then medding back to full before I could even get my first pull in really ate into my play time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I don't think many of you were around to remember how tough the anti-kite fix was to us.  I was 39 at the time, and doing HG's was pretty rough.  there was a maximum of two people in rathe mts at the time, myself and a friend druid. They had just fixed the scourge duration and then implemented this and it was rough. This was before every newbie shaman wa given a full set of jaundiced bone armor, when a blood stained tunic was the bomb. Totemic would have been a  god send.<br />
<br />
Now, every other tom dick and hary shaman has emga uber l33t gear and doesnt have to worry, but at the time of its implementation, it was a big deal.<br />
<br />

Fixing this was long overdue.<br />

I was around then.  A wizard at the time when Quadkiting was a brand new concept done with Pillar of.. oooh.. I wanna say Force cause I'm too lazy to go to Graffe's and check it.<br />
<br />
Anyways, been a shaman for a while now and although I agree with this for at least necros,  was this REALLY an issue in the first place?  Druids and shaman were very capable soloers to begin with.  I don't see how this addresses any sort of balancing as we were able to do what this enables us to do now.  The only effect I can see it h elping with is losing 33% of a tick when the tank gets stupid and aggro is transfered to someone else and the mob moves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I imagine that they will want to fear on some occasions, but certainly not all occasions . It adds to their possibilities.<br />
<br />
For us shaman, it really just means that we won't be losing damage from ticks where MOBs move around, but we are not really kiting.<br />
<br />
Shaman kiting is not a real good option in the vast majority of the scenarios.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  seriously thought, IMO these are good changes.  I personally thought DoT damage being reduced because the mob was moving was, well, stupid.  Balancing a class or whatever aside, it just doesn't make sense.  What, the mob moving into the wind blows some of the DoT off or something?<br />
<br />
  and the pet thing, man that is awesome.  5 levels difference on a pet can make a huge deal, especially at lower levels when you actually USE that pet.  Sure won't impact my shammie game, but bleh it's nice to know I don't have some lamer Kobaker over there on my side.<br />
<br />
  So are these changes good?  IMO ya pretty good.  Will they affect shaman much?  nah, not terribly.  Let the druids kite their 5 zones they kite in (ya i DO know, I have a 60dru and made shaman cause it's a much better class) and we own the rest of the zones.<br />
<br />
  Now if you really want to make a shaman happy, change MY PET!!!! why the heck do I get a dog?  I eat dogs for lunch!  A dog-and-halfling-sandwich-on-rye is pretty durn good I'm here to tell you.  <br />

Not all Shamans are 51+. ;)<br />
<br />
Anyway, obviously it's a positive change whether you kite or don't. The option to kite more efficiently, whether to avoid death or just for a changup in tactics, is good. No damage reduction on our dots while stuff ping-pongs (or while a whole mob of melee push a mob around) is good. I really don't see anything to bitch about.</div></div><hr />

This effectively increased the dot dmg 33% for all soloin shaman (yes even the toe-to-toe shaman).  Ill take this over pet level increases any day.<br />

1) Soloing HG's at level 39. tried tanking them with your 50% slow? Not HP nor mana efficient<br />
<br />
2) Cobalt Drakes. Very nice exp, and drop tailoring hides. Wanna try tanking them too? 500 AE DD and debuff proc. Kiting is only way to kill. And now, i can drag them back and forth instead of rooting over and over as my dots chew at them. In fact, im gonna go to CS as soon as ive got patch and kill them, as it will be much more mana efficient now.<br />

It was this nerf that changed the way we fight. With all the new equipment, most shaman's never had to learn the fine art of kiting. It IS possible to quad kite with a shaman. Now that the damage reductions have been lifted, this is great news indeed.<br />

Anyone who thinks that slow and tanking a mob if more effective then kiting is just silly. Your wasting 250mana on Turgurs and HP's that could be canni'd back into even more mana. Why get hit if you don't have to?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Kardaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Correct me if I am wrong (And I damn well could be I have not done it in so long) but didn't the DOT nerf also include rooted mobs? It was my uderstanding that a rooted and non-feared mob was considered to be trying to get at you and therefore would be considered moving.<br />
<br />
If this is the case then this un-nerf will seriously help any Shaman that uses Root-rot/DOT to take out mobs.<br />
<br />
If this is not the case then just ignore my ramblings.<br />

I'm interested to hear exactly how you're gonna quad kite.   Target mob #1.   Pox.   run.   Target mob #2.  Pox.  Run.  Target mob #3.  Pox.<br />
<br />
Sounds like lots and lots of fun to me.  (end sarcasm)<br />
<br />
Now if you just mean kiting, well yeah, that's fully possible but that means running laps around outdoor zones like a druid.  If I wanted to do that I'd play a druid.  I've worked hard to get my gear up to where I can stand toe-to-toe with a mob and take it down, it's a least a bit more interesting to me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Hmm ... mixed feelings on this one obviously. I'm still not convinced that this change is a big deal for shamans. However, I concede that lower level shammies would beneift more. I remember experimenting with kiting when I was a young troll, but I gave it up as it never seemed that great.<br />
<br />
As a desperation measure - of course, we've all done that.<br />
<br />
And I can't see how, as Hrothgar said, this raises DoT damage &quot;by 33% even for toe to toe shammies&quot;. That's clearly not the case. If I'm toe to toe with a mob, it isn't running. Therefore, full DoT damage.<br />
<br />
When the servers come back up, I'll test it. One zap fom the epic plus my dog was enough to kill the average rockhopper just as the DoT wore off - if all DoT damage has increased, they should drop before it wears off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">It just means that my method of soloing ice giants for their toesies just got more efficient.<br />
<br />
I honestly get SO bored doing that camp for toes and essence of winter (which folks let rot or destroy) that I go out of my way to cause a little mayhem:  root, slow, dots, flash of light.  and as it runs back, flash it again.  I love the reactions of the people out front as the IG goes barrelling past them.  And they tend to scatter as it comes running back... they think it's coming after them, usually.<br />
<br />
And no, I never let them get hurt.  If they're mid-combat, I'll either wait for them to near-kill theirs, or just rein mine in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i don't agree with that, you can't JBB (8 sec cast) while kiting an unsnared mob, you can't cast epic at 200 range, and the cast time on pox and bane is so long that you're prone to get hit while casting/kiting.<br />
<br />
sure, you won't get hit until about after 4ish seconds after you started casting, but you will get hit once or twice per cast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I remember correctly.  If the mob moves at all then your hit with the 33% penalty.  It would tax server too much to include any sort of radius checking so I imagine the original implementation was along the lines of a simple movement check... so if mob pushes you back or does that wierd straffing thing... that is movement.  <br />
<br />
Let me know i what you find out though. I always wanted to check this out myself but never got around to it.  I just have always been cynical with the way VI implements &quot;changes&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Running around Kiting seems like time wasted, better spent regaining Mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Aye but for those of us with Affliction Haste/Extended III items things just got better.<br />
<br />
Think of it this way:<br />
<br />
Running i can regen for 47hp per tick. Factor in the possible suicide button or Canna4 plus Affliction Haste (3.4 sec Pox) and Extended Affliction and you have some very viable possibilities with kiting multiple mobs. Pox now becomes very attractive as fast cast 2500dmg dot.<br />
<br />
Now to get my hands on an Affliction Haste III item :)</div></div><hr />

I don't think many of you were around to remember how tough the anti-kite fix was to us. <br />
<br />
Yeah that happened right before I started to hunt in SKarana.  When I did get there all I saw were people sitting on hillsides, chin in palm, and sobbing while the Avocets and Harriers trotted merrily by.  Apparently I didn't know what I'd missed.</div></div><hr />

I was there when they did this kite nerf and at the time, yes it did hurt us, and I never kited again.<br />
<br />
It's just a new option for us so stop bitching about getting an upgrade!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">I don't see why this is an issue.<br />

It's another convienence for us. If you do it, great. If you don't, then fine.<br />

It doesn't make soloing a mob that summons any easier, that's for sure.</div></div><hr />

If the mob doesn't attempt to hit you in melee for 18 seconds (rooted or not) then dots do less damage. Then again knowing the high quality of monkeys VI hires as programmers you never know.</div></div><hr />

As for uses, they exist, I just choose not to use em :)  The one thing I'd kite just to say I've soloed is 55 and just pisses me off cause I lose to him everytime but he's in a zone non-conductive to kiting (well an area there of) so I'll stick to losing my fights with him daily ;)<br />
