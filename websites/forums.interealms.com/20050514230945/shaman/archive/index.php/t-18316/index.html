<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>graul_maul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Need a bit of advice here. I have started duo'ing my 65 shaman and my 61 necromancer. Sorry, I just can't pick which one I like the most, so figured I would have the best of both worlds. Anyway, since I just started this, I quickly found it it is no where near worth the hassle of trying this in Everquests version of windows mode, so I downloaded EQWin and have been using that. Things have been going pretty well, except for this...<br />
<br />
I will be playing the game, things look fine, then out of no where, everything freezes up. It usually doesn't stay locked up, but it will be locked up long enough to cause me problems when fighting. Talking about a 30 second freeze or so, and if I fail a slow when this happens, it can be quite nasty. Have any of you ever seen this occur? I know alot of you bot at least two characters, probably even more. Did you ever see this, and figure out what is causing it?<br />
<br />
My system:<br />
P4 2.4<br />
1GB pc1066 RDRAM<br />
Nvidia Ti 4600 128 mb Vid Card<br />
Cable Modem for internet connection<br />
<br />
Don't think my system is the cause of this. Did you turn off anything specific in the options of everquest? I have all models running as well as sound, dynamic lighting, and character animations. Nothing really runs slowly for me with both characters up, just that annoying freeze that happens maybe once every 30-60 minutes. I am going to try turning stuff off myself, but trial and error on this could take me a long time. Was just hoping someone here had the same problem, and already found which setting was causing this.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mrwallace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Create an empty file with WordPad or NotePad and just save it with the name of &quot;NOSOUND.TXT&quot; in one of the eq install directories.  You are running from seperate directories...right?  Did you read the knowledge base on eqwindows.com?  I followed their advice exactly and have never had an issue with my AMD 1600, 512 PC2100, ATI 8500...so you should be more than fine with your computer.  At the very least, turn off the sound and give it another try.  Doesn't it sound wierd anyway with 2 instances of game sounds?<br />
<br />
On another note...how is that duo?  I just created a necro for that very purpose.  I'm thinking it could be the most powerfull duo in the game.</div></div><hr />

I run a pretty crappy system and have lots of models turned off. I have gotten some freezes like you describe but it is very infrequent.<br />
<br />
UMP!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I 2-box my shammy main with multiple melee alts on one machine.  I use two directories (just seems to make sense to have one copy of each file for each instance, just in case) and run with sound off on both accounts.  The freezing you describe I think is typical, has happened to me many times.  I have a P4 2.66 and 1Gb RAM with a 128 Mb video card, so I believe it is software and transmission related and not a PC config problem.<br />
<br />
One thing that has helped a lot besides turning sound off, as already described, is to shut down the spell effects for one or both.  With me, it is only the shaman who requires the spell effects be shut off when casting.  I always get some hesitation, and sometimes freezing when casting quickly and changing windows at the same time.  Not good when you are casting an initial slow and then trying to switch quickly to the melee.<br />
<br />
Also, I've read that having each account on a seperate hard drive would help, and common sense dictates that it would.  However, I haven't been able to validate the performance gain and if it outweighs the cost and issues of going to a multiple drive config.<br />
<br />
Hang in there, with a little tweeking I'm sure you'll be able to 2-box reliably.  Try shutting off the spell effects, I'm pretty sure it will help.</div></div><hr />

Has anyone tried this before and if so did it make a decent difference? If I get bored tonight I just may try it out.</div></div><hr />

I read through all different classes message boards and I can't believe the number of people that talk about &quot;I 2box this&quot; and &quot;I duo&quot; that.<br />
<br />
Now, don't get me wrong, I don't mean anything bad, but what ever happened to the time of meeting someone new when you wanted to &quot;duo&quot; for experience?<br />
<br />
I play a single account on a single computer and could never imagine myself paying another monthly fee to play the same game, two characters at a time.  I am not faulting anyone for doing this, as heck it's their time and money and they can spend it playing EQ however is fun for them.  It is just starting to seem like the times of logging on and adventuring with someone you've never met before are fading quickly.  To me, getting to know new people from all over the world is most of the fun in EQ.<br />
<br />
Not trying to derail the thread or anything, just trying to figure things out by writing them out I guess  :p .<br />

Not trying to be a smart arse or anything, but I think it's kind of a common sense thing.  I personally feel that most folks two box for the simple fact that when they do need that rogue with the 200+ LP skill, or those DMF resists, or just a dedicated mage to AE some type_01_animal-hides, they will have that class specific toon available.  All this without having to find that 10% of the population willing to group with you out of the blue, then 10% of them willing to do exactly as you say, then 10% of them willing to let you have ALL the needed loot's that may drop.  I don't two box because my brain isn't able to handle it, heck, I can barely keep up with 1 Shaman!  Then again, some folks two box for the purpose of having a level 65 toon will AA's out the yin-yang for each class.  Like what was said before, I agree, I think it's silly, but I can see the pro's and con's for each.  However, I will be keeping my small mind inside my nice comfortable little box! :p <br />

<br />
<br />
I two box and there are a lot of reasons.  First of all, when I have to do farming for some item for whatever reason (trade skill bits and that type of thing more than any specific loot piece), I can kill a LOT faster with a melee person than with just my shaman, (lets face it, even in a greenie dungeon, shaman DPS is pretty sad) but in a lot of places, I can't solo with the melee, I need heals.  Subjecting someone else to a no xp farming expedition for say Haze Panther Eyes or Waterlogged Riggings is silly.   In other cases, I just don't want to have to deal with sharing what things might drop, like high end tradeskill bits that a partner might want to sell instead of letting me loot for my own skilling.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I don't have the time for an xp group.  LDON has fixed that a bit as adventures have a finite duration, but in the past if I only had a couple hours it wasn't always worth trying to find a random group, especially in the days before the current LFG tool.  Other times I can't devote my entire attention to EQ.  I am at home playing during the day quite often, and maybe I am working on laundry or something as well as playing, and need to leave the keyboards at sporadic intervals.  Those times it is simpler to just plop my duo in a fairly safe, slow xp spot.  I also tend to play at odd hours, and finding someone else to group with isn't always that easy.<br />
<br />
And finally, for me personally meeting new people is NOT what I find most interesting.  In fact, I find that a large percentage of pick up groups or random duo partners are horribly unskilled.  People that really don't play their classes with the intricacy that I have come to expect after playing the game since beta, and having been very lucky to join a guild of highly talented players.  Maybe that is arrogance; if so, I'm sorry, but I just don't have a good time in those situations, and I play to have a good time!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">To the orginal poster i would guess turning sound off in one or both would help that alot. <br />
<br />
To the person asking about people running two or more. I'm capable of meeting people in game running one just as much as running two or more. However i enjoy running my multiple accounts and like being self sufficent when i want to be. I also like my solitude when i want it too. I'm the person in guild who never needs to get a cleric to come rez me , or before pop needed a port or a certain buff or much of anything in terms of what a char can give (had all of that myself) so if you hung out with me is because of person behind the keyboard not the class that was being controlled. Hope that makes sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ooops forgot to add to Graul. Along with sound i found i got less screen freeze when i turned my densities to spell casting effects down. When i had alot of spells cast close together would slow me down once in a while. Once i found lvl for my system i stopped having any troubles. <br />
   In options/display was the spell particles , opacity and other particle density is the ones that helped me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">hmm, what video driver are you running? I had exactly that problem with the same video card after going from the 45 to the 51 series of nvidea drivers.  Might try to go back if you upgraded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I 2box because I'm not an exceptionally sociable person.  Guess I'd be a hermit if my computer didn't chain me to society :p<br />
<br />
Anyway I experience the same problem the OP and a few others have mentioned on a p4 2.66, ti4600, 512mb 3300 ddr ram system.  I followed the advice on the EQW boards to a tee - have 2 copies of EQW running 2 copies of EQ, one with the sound off.  Only horse/elemental models and 1 race model on for each window (helps with zone times, especially since I generally listen to mp3s while playing).  Using Nvidia 43.something drivers, as the 45 ones don't seem to be compatible with EQ (many others have had the same problem).  Wasn't aware that newer ones were out, I'll have to take a look.. though I don't think that's the cause of the problem.  Rather think it's EQ or EQW, just that it's doing something it really wasn't designed to do. *shrug*.<br />
<br />
One quetion I am curious about: those who have this problem, what OS do you use?  I'm using win98 still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Can't offer anything on the freeze-ups. The experts here seem to think it's sound and that's as viable explanation as any.<br />
<br />
Insofar as the 2-boxing. In a New York minute. Shoot, when I finally get settled (be it Bosnia, Iraq, Kuwait, Afghanistan or a stateside locale) I'm setting up THREE computers. When I do and am looking for tips and tricks I'm coming to this board.<br />
<br />
Flexibility, 100% of the loot, no waiting, you obviously like the other person ( :) ), just easier. Plus you can tailor your adventures, forage if need be, go for that rare item that isn't worth anything except to a TS'er, et al. <br />
<br />

I used Win98 and still do. It may not be flashy, but a buddy with WINXP has had problem after problem. Same with his wife who uses ME (iirc).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I used to lag out for 10-30 seconds at a time 2boxing.  Was a real PITA, especially before my cleric got 90% rez.  The 3 things that I can recall that made the biggest difference were 1) new vid card (128M), 2) turning ALL spell effects and new models off (no biggie since most of them looks like ass anyway), and 3) running Spybot.<br />
<br />
For reference, I can now 3box on 1 weak machine (Athlon 1gig chip, 512M ram) with very little lag, and none of the big lag that used to get me killed when 2boxing.<br />
<br />
I'd try Spybot first, it's free, and it made the most noticable difference for me as far as the long-duration lag spells are concerned.  HTH</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>graul_maul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">OK, wanted to give you guys an update.<br />
<br />
I copied my entire Everquest directory to my desktop.  Then I renamed the folder, and copied it back to where i keep my games.  Then, I went into EQWindows, and copied another shortcut to my desktop.  I installed EQWindows into my Everquest directory.  Very important here, you have to edit that EQWindows file to point to the new everquest directory.  It will still point to the old one.<br />
<br />
Next, I went into this new EverquestB directory, and at the root of it, I created a new BLANK text file called NOSOUND.TXT, and saved it here.<br />
<br />
Started up the game, I turned off all spell effects, and put the clipping plane at 0.  I also, just to do it, turned of sound for this folder through the options screen as well.  Figured that would not hurt.<br />
<br />
OK, I loaded up the two different Everquest games through EQWindows.  Ran them both last night for a few hours.  I did not see one lock up.  I did have one strange problem.  Last night, my son asked if he could play my shaman.  So I logged graul off, and let him play graul for a few hours.  Graul was on this new EverquestB game.  When he was done, I tried to log graul back in, but it kept crashing at the Server Select screen.  No error popped up.  Took a reboot to fix this problem, so I didn't think much of it.<br />
<br />
EverquestA runs with everything turned on.  All player characters, full spell effects, sound, lighting, animations, the works.  EverquestB runs with all character models, but I turned off sound (using that nosound.txt file) turned off animations, spell effects, and turned down the clipping plane.  Only zone that ran a little bit slow for me was Plane of Tranq.  Guess there just too many people there when both my characters are sitting in the zone.  Both accounts run at 1280 x 1024 with the Drakhal Original UI.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if the original screen lock problem comes back, I will let you know, but maybe this has fixed it.<br />
<br />
I will cross my fingers.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help and advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>csivils</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I 2box (2 window actually) a froglok paladin/troll shaman.  When I'm online, I almost always have them both online.  My friends refer to them as the &quot;green team&quot;.<br />
<br />
I don't do pickup groups, but I do like grouping with my guildmates.  When I picked a partner for my shaman, I not only wanted to be able to duo efficiently... I also wanted to have the core group to start an exp party/raid group any time I wanted.  I've been very pleased with the results.  I actually enjoy being the main slower AND the MT on raids/exp groups.<br />
<br />
I run EQ on a laptop with 512 meg of ram.  I also run it out of a single directory.  The big performance boosts for me was turning off the sound, dumbing down the everquest options as much as I could stand, and running the game in 640x480 mode.<br />
<br />
The 640x480 mode was a very harsh adaptation, but I've tweaked my UI over time untill it is quite usable in my opinion.  Running at such a small resolution lets me see most of both windows at once.  This is actually very useful on raids when I put the characters in separate groups so I can see 12 life bars at once.<br />
<br />
What I found was that my machine was not CPU limited, it was memory limited.  The freezes was when the machine was thrashing using virtual memory.  Watch your hard drive light to see if this is the case for you.  If this is the case, drive your tuning options for memory rather than CPU.<br />

<br />
my suggestion.. HOTKEY everything.<br />
<br />
now.. about PC optimization... assuming u run EQw to do it.. there is few things u can optimize..<br />
<br />
1. right click My Computer -&gt; Property -&gt; System tab with Virtual Memory etc.. -&gt; System Performance thingie.. where u can disable many Windows Visual Enhancement.<br />
those Visual enhancement take HUGE mem when u switch between windows...   I'll EDIT this with more detail when i get home.<br />
<br />
2. Start -&gt; RUN -&gt; Regedit.exe &lt;enter&gt;  <br />
   use this to delete un-needed registry in Windows/Run registry folder...  I'll EDIT this too.. with more detail.<br />
<br />
3. only 1GB of memory??   eqmain.exe takes up like 300~500MB of RAM... btw..  so umm.. Add 1GB more or just buy computer from eBay for ~$300.<br />
<br />
4. Put bunch of stickers on your Computer..  It makes it go much faster..  Just like Import Cars..   put some NOS, Greddy, etc.. stickers..</div></div><hr />

Why?  My troll was an outcast who was KOS to grobb long before LOY.  You have zero idea if I'm a roleplayer or not.  I'm having fun, not disrupting your fun .<br />
<br />
So you can take your elitist RULEplaying someplace else.  Especially since this is a thread about 2boxing which is pretty contrary to the roleplaying concept of immersion.<br />

EQWin does not break rules since EQ now supports windowed mode... it just doesn't run as well as eqwin does.<br />

<br />
Since you have 2 computers, I think you would be better off staying with 2 computers than using 1 computer.<br />
<br />
I use 1 monitor and keyboard to control my two computers, mainly to keep my desktop clear of clutter.   Head to CompUSA and get a keyboard/mouse hub and the correct cables.  Not very expensive, cables are pricey but I think you could get everything for &lt; $70.  I hit SCROLL_LOCK, SCROLL_LOCK, UP_ARROW and it switches computers.  There is a slight delay while the monitor switches over.<br />
<br />
Regarding why 2-box...<br />
<br />
Most of the time, 2-boxing is more trouble than it is worth, IMHO.  The point for me is not to make the game *more* complicated, but actually to smooth out the complications that arise from only having 1-box.   Since I mostly 1-box my SHM, and also solo him a lot, and sometimes in zones where I am the only person there, it is sweet to be able to bring a rez or a KEI or port *to him*.  Heck, that is even handy when you are grouping without a chanter and someone insists on leaving to get a KEI refresh -- what a pain in the butt.  I tell them to stay put and run my pocket-chanter over and KEI us in place.  A major advantage to the group and really not all that complicated.   When solo, if someone else shows up, I will gladly invite them into a group, and if I am playing 2 boxes I let them know so they can ditch if they want... or I camp out my 2nd box.<br />
<br />
So setting up for 2-boxing is helpful even if you are very social and group a lot.<br />

Use the viewport command. My screen res is 1280 x 1024 but I set the render viewport to 900 700 or somewhere similar. This allows me to push the interface all around the border and eases the strain on the graphics card. Kinda also reminds me of the old original interface. The preferences are remembered per character, so you could set up your bot account to a really tiny size and the main one to a fuller size if you so wish. For those that are wondering, the viewport command is /viewport x y w h where x is the distance from left, y is distance from top, w is width and h is height.<br />
<br />
The first thing I do when logging on the bot account is press F9 once for the top down camera. This causes a noticable speedup as the camera has very little detail to sort and zbuffer.<br />
<br />
I hope that helps :)</div></div><hr />
