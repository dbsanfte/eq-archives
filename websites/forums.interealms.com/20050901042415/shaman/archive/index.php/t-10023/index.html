<br />
So far the best place ive seen is BoT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">elemental planes &gt; tactics &gt; bot<br />
<br />
they don't drop anywhere else</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">how about runes .. i meant to ask that too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Pit in POT was the place to get Runes up until last patch. Considering you could Duo/Trio (Solo once you got BOU/BOS) Same with Spectrals.<br />
<br />
Named giants in POS drop spectrals, almost all flagging encounters do as well once past 2nd tier.  Without a guild, I'd do Groups in the pit in POT for spectrals, or BOT as you're already trying.<br />
<br />
Since the nerf to pit, it's not that great anymore but you'll see spectrals, no runes.  Probably not going to see many runes unless killing bosses, or mobs on the way to bosses. (Word &quot;bosses&quot; used loosely)<br />

Putting spells on anything other than a vendor is a timesink. Timesinks directly translate into money in a monthly subscription model. This is all about money.<br />
<br />
A well-designed timesink (from Sony's perspective) is one that is neither too difficult nor too easy. If it's too difficult they risk frustrating subscribers to the point that they'll drop their accounts. If the timesinks are too easy (farming greens for shards!) they risk losing accounts when people get bored with the game.<br />
<br />
Timesink design has changed considerably in EQ. One off the major timesinks used to be corpse recovery and travel. With PoP they've really dropped the travel timesink and the CR timesink and have replaced those with a plethora of other timesinks.<br />
<br />
Other timesinks: <br />
<br />
- Etherials, Spectrals, Runes. There's no reason not to place spells on vendors from a roleplay design perspective. But that wouldn't be much of a timesink. <br />
<br />
- Useless spells in the - spell list. I firmly believe that the shaman dex and str buffs are in there for pure timesink reasons. The sooner shaman get full spell books the sooner they start kvetching and agitating for new content. <br />
<br />
- Multiple toons per account. The designers encourage folks to create multiple toons and play around with them. The more people do this the slower they develop mains and the longer it takes them to gobble up end-game content. It'll be interesting to see how EQ2 replaces this timesink.<br />
<br />
- Faction. Pure timesink, but pretty well designed. Think about the hundreds of thousands of hours spent factioning giants versus dragons versus dwarves in velious. This faction timesink alone has probably brought in millions in revenue for Sony. How much money have they made off of the Half Elf illusion factioners? It's a great timesink quest, but it does undermine the integrity of the game when almost everybody can look like everyone else. <br />
<br />
- No-drop. The no-drop flag is about timesinks. If everything were droppable in EQ then there would be fewer fallow resources sitting on retired or dead accounts. <br />
<br />
and so on and so on.</div></div><hr />
