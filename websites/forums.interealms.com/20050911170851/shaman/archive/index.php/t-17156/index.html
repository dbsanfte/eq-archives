<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Neyl Dew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am not a writer, I just had a few monthes with nothing to do and no access to the game, so I wrote. So, this will be crude writting, sorry.<br />
Please tell me what you think.<br />
<br />
Crael Ravenscale is my Iksar Shadowknight.<br />
<br />
     There where twelve in my brood when I was hatched. While this is not a large number for an Iksar brood, it was uncomfortable for us. Then again, as Iksar, comfort was never a consideration, only survival. Of the original thirteen of us, only five survived to leave the nest. Even so looking back perhaps those first eight to fall where the lucky ones. They never rose to true consciousness and so they never came to know the horrors of life.<br />
<br />
     I personally killed two of my siblings in those first few weeks of life, and I am sure that still affects me today. I still clearly remember the feel of their still developing bones giving under the pressure of my hands. I did not hate them, or fear them, or even truly acknowledge them at that time. It was simply a matter of survival. For the Iksar existence is always about survival.<br />
<br />
     I wasn't the largest of the five to rise up from the nest, but I feel I was the most cunning. Only one other of my brood still lives today. The other three fell to the various denizens in and around New Sebilis, Or Cabilis as it is often called. I will not relate the fates of all five of us, that would be pointless. My sister Kintaria still lives, if you want to hear about her I would suggest asking her. I am not a keeper of the tales of the living. I will however discuss with you one of my sisters that did fall. <br />
<br />
     As all Iksar not yet claimed by one the guilds, neither my sister nor I had a name. Her scales where abnormally light and cream in color, and her frame was demure. But even with her unimpressive physical stature she had a power in her bearing, like she knew beyond a doubt that there was nothing she could not accomplish. But it was not simply her own confidence, just looking at her you could see it. It was behind her golden eyes. The pure malice for lesser creatures, the weight of the wisdom of the ancients, and power of the Iksar blood surging through her veins. It was the cold glow of Mana infusing her very being, but given life within those beautiful eyes.<br />
<br />
     I felt it then, and I know it now, she was bound for greatness.  She was the greatest pride of my life, and it wrenches at my heart to know that she was deprived of the chance she needed to rise to the power that was her birthright. She was to be a shaman, and I have no doubt that she would become great among the Hierophants.  It is ill advised for an Iksar, but I loved my sister. She was my reason for life and she has now become my reason for death.<br />
<br />
<br />
     My sister and I where exploring the city&#8217;s ruins, near the entrance of a field littered with the bones from a great war long past. We where beneath the oppressive shadow cast from the towers of the &quot;Temple of Terror&quot; when we heard it. I can still hear that sound. It, like that sound of crushing bones still fills me with a sense of nostalgia even today. My sister was the first to place it as the sound of leathery feet slapping the ancient granite slabs that line the pathways of the city. <br />
<br />
     To those who are not native to the great city of Cabilis you may not know this. There is a Trio of slave Frogloks that wonder around by night and serve &quot;The Toilmaster&quot; by day. And if you spend time there you will know that most people kill those disgusting critters. And why not? They are just slaves, and just Frogloks at that. I suppose I am lucky that one of that Trio had already been felled. If we had encountered the entire pack, I would not be here today.<br />
<br />
     I had never know fear in my youth, that lesson was to come soon enough though. But my sister did know that we should leave those vile frogs alone. I will admit that I have never known prudence, and I truly wish to this day that I had listened to my sisters reasoning. I gathered a few large pieces of granite broken free from the stone path, and suggested my sister do the same. My sister, while not as bloodthirsty as myself, was nonetheless loyal. Fully knowing my folly, she followed me anyway. I knew that between my physical prowess and my utter belief in my sister&#8217;s powers that no frog could stand before us. This proved to be true.<br />
<br />
     With the supreme confidence that comes with the utter ignorance of youth, I rounded the corner of the basalt foundation of the towers. Seeing my mark I threw a rock at the frog I saw, events happened quickly then. Today I can still recall almost all of that epic battle where I earned so much, but lost so much. With my first missile still in the air shouted out to my sister to join the fun.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Come sister, it's easy, just aim for the third wart down!&quot; Ok I know it sounds funny, but I was honestly trying to be helpful. The first missile struck the frogs head with a satisfying &quot;Thump!&quot; But about the only thing that accomplished was to enrage the beast, and to draw its attention to me. I heard a stone whistle past me and knew that my sister had joined. Her stone flew wide and ineffectually struck the beasts shoulder. As I launched my second missile I said &quot;Way to go sister. But aim next time.&quot;<br />
<br />
     I began laughing; this was simply the most fun I had ever had. But the laughter died quickly, I saw the second frog come around the corner attracted by the commotion. About then I decided we might have a little difficulty, I know my sister was thinking the same because of her comment. &quot;Damn! Stupid frogs!&quot; There was a clatter behind me as she let the rocks she had gathered fall to the ground. The remainder of the battle is a bit difficult to explain, but I will try to describe it.<br />
<br />
     From behind me I heard a sound, I can only describe it as the sound canvas makes when it is ripped by the gales that strike our city. By this time the first frog had reached me and had taken a swing at me. Dropping all but the largest stone in my hand I began bludgeoning the beast. That was when the first blast hit it. I didn't then know what I felt pass beside me, but I know the frog did not like it. A bolt of energy connected with the creature&#8217;s chest and it let out a terrible cry. It was a cry of pain, a cry of confusion, but most satisfying, it was a cry of pure terror!<br />
<br />
     I managed to land two more blows to the beast witch sent it fleeing, however I could not pursue it for the second beast was on me. My sister seeing it turn to run let fly with a second bolt of energy. I felt nothing but pride for my sister as the bolt squarely struck the beasts fleeing back sending it sprawling to the ground. <br />
<br />
     Now you need to understand something, my sister paid dearly for those two bolts of energy, and I paid equally for those few crushing blows I had managed to land. I was in pain, my left arm hung limp and battered, blood flowed freely from several places on my ravaged body, and I felt near collapse. My sister already exhausted from the battle saw me falter. Desperate by this point I began swinging at the second frog. It was a loosing battle, but I had resolved to inflict as much damage as I possibly could to the beast before I fell. Perhaps my sister would be able to finish it. A well aimed blow crushed one of the bulbous eyes on its domed head in a feeble attempt to blind the creature. From behind me I heard the tearing canvas sound again, but this time it was different. It was much softer, much simpler. I had no idea what my sister was doing, but I hoped it would happen soon. <br />
<br />
     What happened next cannot be forgotten. The frog had an evil glint in its eyes; it knew its victory was assured as it slashed at my neck. Its dirty claws connected with my exposed throat and tore a savage wound. However I had a no chance to collapse from the shock of the grievous wound, my throat had mended itself. The sensation was neither warm nor cold, but it felt like both at once. My neck wound closed, feeling returned to my limp arm, and the bleeding wounds across my torso sealed themselves. As the pain receded I felt my cramping muscles relax and my mind clear. I felt more alive at that moment then I had a right to feel. My sister had used the last of her energy and refreshed my body.<br />
<br />
     The frog knew what happened before I did, and it leapt past me and assaulted my sister. Now my sister was truly feeble physically to begin with, but add the exhaustion she was feeling she stood no chance. It only took two swipes with the beast&#8217;s claws to bring my sister to her knees, and a third to knock her to the ground. I took the opportunity provided to crush the back of the beast&#8217;s skull with my stone, but the beast would not be deterred from my sister&#8217;s destruction. The beast swung a fourth and final time at my sister who lay unconscious on the ground. I lost all hope when I saw that blow land, the beast easily disemboweled her, then turned back to face me.<br />
<br />
     What remains of the battle is so simple, yet so difficult to explain. If you hope to understand what happened next you have to understand my state of mind at that time. My sister lay dead in a spreading pool of her own blood and entrails, the beast had turned to face me with that maddening Cycloptic gaze, and no matter how hard I swung at the beast my blows would not land. But the ultimate offence, the thing that changed my life for all time. My sisters golden eyes had faded. They had lost their power, their majesty; there was no life behind those eyes I was so enthralled with. At that time I lost control of myself. I was consumed with a need to kill this vile beast that had so casually erased the life from my sisters eyes. As my hate grew, my control faltered. With rage shining singularly from my eyes I looked up from my sisters battered corpse and into the eye's of the frog.<br />
<br />
     I saw it in the beast's eyes; my sweetest yet most bitter reward. The frog was afraid, truly terrified of me, and well it should have been. I was consumed with hatred, drunken with the beasts fear. Resolute in my decision to kill, no, to destroy the froglok before me. Before the frog had a chance to react, to turn and run, I reached out my hand and laid it on the breast of the beast.<br />
<br />
     It was completely silent, there was no clap of thunder, and there was no flash of light. There was only my hand on the beast&#8217;s chest, and then it let out a terrible scream. It was the sound of anguish as the beasts soul was ripped from its body. While there was neither flash nor bang, it was not a peaceful death. No, as I released my hatred and pain into the beast, I felt the thunder I failed to hear. I tasted the agony of the beast, and verily, I smelt the terror of the frog as its life was consumed.<br />
<br />
     I know that was the last moment of my life as a mere hatchling. Looking down at the scales covering my hand and up my arm I noticed they had discolored. Once they where ash gray with light hints of blue, now they where a dull unreflective black not unlike the plumage of a raven. That was my second birth, when the realization that power was absolute, and I had power.<br />
<br />
<br />
     Still heady with the victory, and lightheaded from my wounds, I did not hear it immediately. Chuckling, almost true laughter. I turned around to locate the sound and looked up at its source. On the parapet of the tower I saw a form. Laughing.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Well boy, that was one way to end a fight. Tell me was the victory sweet to you? Have you sated your appetite? Or would you like to learn more about death? About... Power?&quot; The voice drifted down, eerie in its sound; so quiet I was not sure I heard it. Rather I thought I heard it in my head, echoing with my own thoughts.<br />
<br />
     I tore my eyes from the figure above and looked across at the dead Froglok, twitching obscenely, its body still not convinced it was dead. I looked past it at my sisters still form, obviously dead. Once more, and for the last time I looked into her eyes. My sister was dead yet I had survived. Oh, how I hated myself!<br />
<br />
     &quot;It is no great loss, she could not survive, she did not deserve to live&quot; The voice was no longer above me, but almost directly behind me.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Who are you to say my sister was so little?&quot; I felt my anger rising again, I knew I could not survive another battle, but I had ceased to care. My veins began to throb harder as I turned to face the voice. What I saw immediately froze my veins.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Not what you expected to see? Boy.&quot; More chuckling.<br />
<br />
     Words fail me as I try to explain what I saw. It began as a shadow, but it was more than that. It felt like it had a depth to it, like it was there, but not there, more like it was everywhere but where I was looking. Near the top, two glowing points, obviously eyes burning down at me. But I could tell they where not just seeing me, they where looking through me, into me, examining my very being. My rage had been replaced with something new and terrible. For the first time in my life, I knew fear. I cannot say if I was afraid of what was before me, or if its mere presence instilled the fear.<br />
<br />
     &quot;I have something for you, boy. A present maybe? No, not a present, this you earned.&quot;<br />
<br />
     The shape, shadow, the form glided past me. It came to rest beside my sister. No, not &quot;It&quot;, &quot;He&quot;. He reached down and gently touched my sister&#8217;s face, then her torn and broken torso. He turned back to me holding out an ethereal fist. With faint wisps of steam rising off his hand he opened his clenched fingers. In his hand was I could see a weapon.<br />
<br />
     It was a blade, but it was not a simple blade, its point was curved cruelly forward. Rather than a blade guard it had two additional blades jutting out at angles. The hilt itself was wrapped in soft yet tough leather and studded with light crème colored scales. Tentatively I reached out and touched the hilt and pulled back sharply, it moved! It felt like it was writhing under my touch, almost like it was... Alive.<br />
<br />
     &quot;This is no time to be meek boy. I tire of your childishness, and I have more for you.&quot; I thrust out my hand, grasped the blade and pulled it to me to examine it. The hilt was still writhing in my hand, yet it didn't make it harder to grip. In fact, I would come to find out, it is impossible to remove from my hand without my consciously releasing it. I have come to believe that the weapon bears an intelligence of its own. An intelligence that wants my grasp as much as I long to grasp the blade.<br />
<br />
     I looked up from my blade in time to see the shade thrust his hand into the chest of the froglok I had killed. With a wet smacking sucking sound he removed the beasts heart and handed it to me. I reached out my hand and took the heart, I glanced down at the corpse of the frog; the hole in its chest was steaming in the cool night. From behind me I heard a cracking then tearing sound. I turned with a start to see the shade remove the head of the frog my sister had killed.<br />
<br />
     As he hands me the head he says to me:<br />
<br />
     &quot;The Kukuri carries your sisters soul, remember the rage at her death and you will be lethal. As you grow in power, your sister too will grow. She can still be as great as you once believed she would be. But that requires you achieve that greatness for her. Will you fail her?<br />
<br />
     &quot;The heart is your admission into the house of Rile. The Crusaders of Greenmist. Take it as summons to Arch Duke Xog, he will instruct you further. <br />
<br />
     &quot;The head is your protection, your sister died because she was protecting you. Your sister will continue to protect you, if you use this totem properly. I will leave it to you to discover how to use it. The lore of the Armorers of Sebilis will show you how. The power of the Iksar race will allow you to do it, and only your will, will see it happen.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Your father is Cazic-Thule, your Spirit is one with Innoruuk, and you are an unholy child of the greatest of Gods. Seek the training from the children of your father and your brethren of Spirit. <br />
<br />
     &quot;When you come of age, I will see that we meet again.&quot; Even as he was speaking he was fading, by the time he finished speaking he was less than a mere wisp of smoke, then was gone completely.<br />
<br />
     Ignoring the corpses that where already being attacked by the young scaled wolves that plague Cabilis like rats of Freeport. I walked around the base of the tower to the entrance of the shaman guild. I mounted the ramp, ignoring the questioning glances of the resident scribes I immediately walked into the glowing wall that provides access to the upper rooms of the hall. Searching for the Arch Duke I climbed a ladder that lie before me, then making a small leap I climbed a second ladder. Now in the highest tower of the hall I saw before me the Archduke. I know it was he; he radiated an aura of malice and hate.<br />
<br />
     Slowly, without my announcing myself, the Archduke turned to face me and spoke.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Greetings Crael, I was told to expect you.&quot; He simply held out his hand, and I placed the slowly cooling heart onto his scaled palm. Without even looking at it he said. &quot;Speak with Lord Gikzic, do not disturb me again until you are ready for what I have to teach you. The great Lord Cazic-Thule has plans for you, thus we dare not disappoint him.&#8221; He gave a shudder at the word disappoint, and turned his back to me in dismissal.<br />
<br />
 <br />
     That is how I came to be. I tell of my entrance into the guild of the Crusaders of Greenmist. I have also told you why I am welcome into the city of Neriak. But it does not tell you everything. For that you will need to wait. The story is not complete yet, for I have not yet met that phantom again. I have yet to learn what to do with a Desiccated froglok head I have resting in the vaults of Cabilis' banker. But one day I will be &quot;ready&quot;. Until then I live, I learn, I kill, and I search. Always I search for the forgotten lore of generations past, and of hidden knowledge. And with my sister&#8217;s presence always in battle, I search for greater victories, for her.<br />
