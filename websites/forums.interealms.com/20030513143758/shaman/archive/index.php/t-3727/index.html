<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mjod Eaglehart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi everyone,<br />
<br />
I'm currently working through the Gatorsmash Maul quest, and am up to the orc runner part of the quest. I know that it's possible to do the quest without this step, but I'd like to do it anyway.<br />
<br />
From the text of the quest so far, I'd guess that the orc runner is to be found in Nek Forest. I've read conflicting reports about this though. I seem to remember, say 3 years ago, seeing an orc named &quot;* runner&quot; in GF heading towards the BBM zone (but as I said, a long time ago that was). Seems this guy may well spawn in the BBM zone, along the path near GF...<br />
<br />
Any help as to where he might actually be found and/or spawning secrets would be appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did this quest about 9 months ago, including the Orc Runner part. Though I once saw him around the entrance to Neriak (while playing another character, a couple years ago) I would recommend you look for him in Butcherblock. As you zone in from Greater Faydark, go left and sit on the wall before you get to the large tree. The Runner comes out from around the zoneline, goes to the big tree, and then turns back towards the main path.<br />
<br />
I don't know of any way to make him spawn, but he appeared about every 30 minutes or so. I had to kill him three times before he dropped the quest piece (I can't even remember now, but I think it was a letter).<br />
<br />
He is a very easy kill, and as I recall gives Indigo Brotherhood and Crushbone Orc faction hits (if that's important to you).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
