<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jahvah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm writing this as a plea for information as to what I may be doing wrong.  The last four LDoN adventures I've participated in have ended in failure, and I'm beginning to think my overall performance may be an issue.<br />
<br />
Just some history, up until level 53 I breezed through several LDoN's with little trouble, generally completing them in around 30-45 minutes. Once I hit 54 things changed dramatically.<br />
<br />
first loss: MM collect 21. Group consisted of 58 rogue,54 shaman, 52 Ranger, 51 monk. I was boxing the ranger.  I'm pretty sure this one was my fault, I tried to form the group up and got in a hurry, couldn't find KEI in PoK and all my enchanter friends had called it a night.  Pulls went slow, but steady until we got an add with a named...Ranjah down.  I ran out of mana trying to slow and heal the group. Slow's kept bouncing, which sucked alot of mana for heals.  After running the ranger back and getting rebuffed, we lost alot of time.  We progressed slowly, I kept running out of mana even constantly canni-dancing. I figured using the pet trick would help reduce the number of doubles our monk was pulling, so we switched.  Three mobs later I sicked dog dog on one mean ass SK. Once Dog dog returned intact I happend to glance down at my own health bar...suddenly I had 10% health left and blood agro...Shaman down. Thats all she wrote. (I havent' boxed an LDoN since then)<br />
<br />
Second loss: Stillborn group. Tried to form up at BB, had a 58 Palidan, 56 bard, myself (54 shaman), a second palidan, and a necro on the way.  Bard went link dead and never returned, necro arrived 30 minutes after invite and reported he got sacked in Cabilis by a guard (he was a gnome) and lost his level...you guessed it, he had been 51. So he shows up asking if there's anything blue to kill around. Net group = Palidan, Palidan, Shaman. After 2 hours of waiting and hoping the group would materialize, I gave up. I pretty much get 2.5 hours of playtime a night and my schedule's pretty inflexible...(read: wife imposed)<br />
<br />
Third loss: Full group, collect 29, hard. Berzerker, palidan, ranger, ranger, enchanter, and myself healing.  Group leader takes a hard mission...which didn't bother me so much, but she didn't tell anyone until we were halfway through the dungeon.  My slows were bouncing left and right, but with KEI and canni I was able to keep up reasonably well on mana even though I was still buffing and healing the group.  We're moving along at a reasonable rate until we get to a room full of mobs. We rest a moment and start patting each other on the back saying what a great job we were all doing...well guess what.  Palidan lull wouldn't land on one of the mobs, and suddenly a routing single/double pull turned into a train of bout 7 mobs.  Puller/tank went down before my first slow finished casting. Healed ranger, ranger , palidan, as agro seemed to spread around quickly, slowed another mob, healed the enchanter...by now I had three unclaimed mobs beating on me so I was getting interrupted horribly, tried to heal the enchanter again, but I couldn't get a spell off...he dies, I get his mobs...Retreat is called...the two rangers were the only survivors. The wipe and recovery killed us on time. We ended up missing the deadline, but completing the &quot;loser&quot; mission for 5 points.<br />
<br />
4th loss: Assasination. Full group: Warrior, ranger, ranger, ranger, bard, shaman.  Warrior gets bugged when we try to enter the dungeon and can't zone in. Levels are fine, he has the expansion, EQ is just borked. So five of us zone in and try to figure out how to get the warrior un-@@#$%ed. After about 10 minutes we decide to get re-organized and move on. Bard pulls, highest ranger tanks, I heal, I slow, I haste, I run out of mana.  We get moving. Second room Bard pulls a named plus an add...slows won't land on either. MT can't hold agro, Non MT ranger get nuked *HARD* I land chloroblast, but with all the built up agro from the attempted slows I get the add on me, stoicism gets interrupted, superior healing comes in too late...second room, Ranjah Down.  We decide to press on and let him catch up. On every pull the Bard was getting whacked down to half health, MT ranger was getting beat up pretty good too. Maybe 30% of my slows were landing, and my mana pool was being hit pretty hard.  As a result I had to keep stopping the group to dance my mana back up to 40%.  We finally got the target to spawn with about 20 minutes left. I think we were three or so rooms away from him when we got the pull from hell. At first it didn't look too bad. The only evidence of trouble was the pullers health bar dropping rapidly. Once he finally got to our room he was at 40 health and dropping fast, I chloroblasted him, then began casting stoicism, that's when his pull entered the room. I don't remember how many there were. I think there were three with one named.  I cast stoicism on the tank, healed the non MT super agro ranger, cast slow on the named, and got agro from every mob in the room. Root wouldn't land so I couldn't get away from them. Three rangers in the group, and they couldn't pull agro...now that's some real HATE.  So I got an all expenses paid trip to PoK. Followed closely by Agro ranger, then MT. I think the bard got out Ok. Anyway, we ran out of time.<br />
<br />
I'm normally not this long winded, but I'm trying to figure out what I could have done differently, or what I can do in the future to stop my losing streak.<br />
<br />
Perhapse if my gear is at fault some advice on upgrades?<br />
<br />
Here's my magelo - http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1141347<br />
I've upgraded a few pieces, neck and ear, but can't remember the names of the new items.<br />
<br />
Any helpful advice would be appreciated. Failed LDoN's are really, really frustrating, seems like so much time wasted, and I have 290 points left for Anathema :(.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At 55, you're at the breaking point in difficulty settings.  You're big enough to get the 58+ difficulty settings, but still small enough to qualify for the 50+ settings.  The differences in mob DPS vs hitpoints is significant at those levels.  That could be why your healing is starting to show strains when trying to keep the group alive.  That will also greatly affect the lull level of the mobs, which is probalby why your Paladin couldnt lull in one of the adventures you mentioned.<br />
<br />
At 58 you get a much bigger (though MUCH slower) heal which will help take some of the strain off.  Level also GREATLY increases the resist rate of your spells.  55-59ish is just one of those tough areas for shaman.  You have the potential, but just havent quite grown into it yet.  Hang in there.  Besides the late 30's to late 40's I think this (53-60) is one of the toughest in a shamans life.  <br />
<br />
Your gear is pretty nice.  You have much nicer gear than I did at your level (I didnt see my first FT untill I was 54 and Luclin came out), and a pretty nice mix of HP and mana stuff, so I dont think you could do much better unless you have 100K that you arent doing anything with.  Some of the stuff coming out of OOW would be a nice upgrade, and I can see that you've already been at the Bazaar (wallwalkers, for instance)  At 55 you can solo in Dranik's Scar for not terrible exp if you swap between you and the dog tanking.  Must make sure and land slow before engage though, as they tend to hit pretty fast.<br />
<br />
But losing LDoN's isnt all bad.  Yeah, you dont get the points, but you do get the exp and that is really the name of the game anyway.  The point spread in LDoN is terribly and HORRIBLY unfair to lower level adventurers.  By the time you can afford some arnor pieces you're already well past them in terms of bazaar purchasable gear.  Spells are another matter, and many times you wont get a spell untill you are well past the level when you get the spell.  As I said before just try to grin and bear it.  It sounds like you are doing the best with what you've got to work with and are just working against a deck thats stacked in the other guys favor.  Nothing to do but plow through it and hope for a better hand next time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">On your third loss, I think you should have had the chanter be the primary slower so you could focus entirely on healing, at least to start with.  Perhaps you could fire off a malosi on incoming mobs so the chanter gets fewer slow resists and doesn't need to open with the high agro Tash, which would just strain your healing mana even more.  <br />
<br />
Seems like if the chanter wasn't slowing, wasn't pulling, and clearly wasn't able to handle crowd control on the overpull, then he was kinda useless, probably just using crappy chanter nukes, or worse, crappy chanter dots.  So I'd have given him something to do that would save you mana and let you focus 100% of your attention on keeping your group alive.<br />
<br />
Another suggestion I have for you is that you might want to consider memorizing both turgurs and togors insects.  That way if something resists your first slow attempt, you can retry in 2.25 instead of 6 seconds. <br />
<br />
The difference between turgurs and togors at your level is minimal.  Turgurs is a 70% slow.  Togors is 65%. I'd think getting the mob slowed ASAP would be more important than that extra 5% of slowing.  So lead with turgurs and if it's resisted, retry with togors.  Or you could keep malosi memmed and alternate with that also, but I've found the &quot;2 slows&quot; strategy to work out ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There is a stage as you level up where doing &quot;Hard&quot; difficulty setting becomes progressively harder. Lets face it, at lower levels, hard LDoNs are a joke. But at, say, level 63, doing a hard LDoN is a very serious undertaking.<br />
<br />
I regularly do LDoNs in a group of 3 and get through them in about 35 - 45 minutes, but I don't do hard adventures as a rule...<br />
<br />
I'm guessing you are getting to that level where you are going to have to do normals unless you have ver on the ball peeps (and not 2-boxers).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grimmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">MT can't hold agro ...<br />
~JahvahThis is an indication of serious problems with the group.  The MT was a ranger that couldn't hold aggro--a mid-50's ranger shouldn't lose aggro more than, say, 1 time in a 90 minute LDoN.<br />
<br />
I use the same spells for aggro control now that I used in the mid-50s and I can keep aggro off anyone.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jahvah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for all the input. It's nice to know that the dungeons are actually getting harder, and it's not my imagination.<br />
<br />
I generally keep both slows memmed for LDoN's. But the resist rate for both was unusually high. <br />
<br />
On the last dungeon I did swap in Malosi when I noticed too many slows were bouncing, but it really seemed to take a long time to cast and got resisted alot.  By the time I was done casting, I was on to healing because the puller and tank were being beat to a pulp.<br />
<br />
Next time I definitely will request the enchanter slows. I didn't even think of it at the time. We had agreed he'd take care of haste and I'd do slows and heals.  I can't really fault him for CC abilities. Judging from the resists I was getting, he was probably having similar difficulty. And by the fact that he drew agro early on the bad pull, I have to imagine he was trying to mez mobs, but was failing, and it was just pissing them off.<br />
<br />
When we regrouped we had the enchanter lull and it went pretty smooth. We just ran out of time.<br />
<br />
Hopefully my levels will even out with the resitance of the mobs soon. That's my biggest problem. That and the fact that I can't seem to sit down to med until the mob is half dead, by then I need to cast a heal, which means If I sit down I get agro. So it makes for a tough time getting mana.<br />
<br />
The ranger that couldn't hold agro kind of surprised me at first.  But then I noticed that he wasn't always using snare/tw right away, and he was competing for agro with two other rangers.  The third ranger obviously knew what she was doing. She didn't take agro once. The second, well...lets just say I don't see many level 52 rangers running around full planestrider's gear.  I can't remember the names of the weapons he was using, but I'm pretty sure they were freaking fantastic.  It was only after our eventual CR and rezzes that I took a look at his gear.  I think it was just a simple case of a ranger wanting to do more damage than anybody else...and succeeding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think my Shaman was in his mid or high 50s when LDON came out. I played the MH role a few times, but it was tough. My heals were too wimpy for the DPS that I was trying to offset and if I had to slow AND heal, one or the other didn't get done right at least some of the time. I certainly couldn't have done it with a non-plate tank on multi-pulls.<br />
<br />
Things got better at 58 when I got my mini-CH, but still I don't think I would have been able to keep a non-plate tank alive consistently, at least on multi-pulls and without off-tanking. Things got once again better at 62 with Tnarg, VASTLY better at 65 with Q and even better with Canni5.<br />
<br />
At 65, I could do pretty much anything I wanted in normal LDON. I could pull with VP/Root. I could obviously slow. I could buff during the adventure because Canni5 gave me much more mana to play with. I could tank level 60-61 mobs with ease. Heck, I did almost all of the above (except pulling) a few times when I was partying with my friends' Bard, Mage and Necro.<br />
<br />
So yes, hang on there, life gets much better later on, but for now a plate tank and/or a dedicated healer are your best friends in LDON :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>leibeast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i see one major flaw in the grouping...you were the only healer.<br />
<br />
shammies are great healers/ slowers/buffers/ damage dealers and to some degree melee (with pet) but main healers and trying to do all the other stuff as well...no wonder you ran outta mana. at 66 i try to do the same thing many a time there is no cleric, but i try to at least have a druid in grp with me so that i can be effective, and BACK up heal rather than main heal.<br />
<br />
you did nothing wrong. they expected too much from one individual. (or you did of yourself) with almost 6k mana pool i find on tought fights its all i can do to slow/ dot/ quessence/DD and canni V to be ready for the next mob...and rebuffing as we go=)<br />
<br />
shammies do rock, but we cant be everything...all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Agree with the above poster about healing.  You need a druid or cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i see one major flaw in the grouping...you were the only healer.<br />
As a matter of fact, people don't realise that shamans are better healers than druids between 44 and 57. Before druid's get their CHeal at 58 (Tunare's Renewal), they get the same direct heals as shamans but shamans get stoicism and the mana to heal more through Canni versus a druid's group regeneration and group chloroplast. However, buffing (particularly haste due to it's short duration) takes up huge amounts of mana. If you are going to be the MH and slower in a group that is not camping in an outdoor location (so you can use a mount to enhance mana regen), you have to be prepared to say &quot;No&quot; to requests for buffs or make the group take med breaks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ahh yeah, I forgot about that new fangdangled stoicism thing.  Didn't have that back in the day:)<br />
<br />
But regardless, one more mana pool devoted to healing is what the guy needs.  I can now main slow, main heal, buff/debuff, etc.. on hard ldon's, but even at 70 in time gear, its taxing enough that its just not fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tenien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you having a lot of trouble with resists on slow, you can also try keeping Plague of Insects memmed with turgur's.  Only 25% slow, but some slow better than none, and even it will eliminate benefit of haste buffs on the mobs if doing LDoN's with chanter/shaman mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">up until level 53 I breezed through several LDoN's with little trouble, generally completing them in around 30-45 minutes. Once I hit 54 things changed dramatically.Yes, as several have noted, things do get harder.<br />
<br />
first loss: MM collect 21. Group consisted of 58 rogue, 54 shaman, 52 Ranger, 51 monk. This group has decent dps, a puller, no real tank, no rezz capability, and the shaman must be healer, slower, buffer, and crowd control (and dps on 2boxed ranger!).   This is marginally doable, but only if nothing goes wrong and the shaman never misguesses what to do next.  Something will go wrong; you will misguess; you will almost always lose with this setup.<br />
<br />
Second loss: Stillborn group. This is not a loss.  Frustrating evening, yup.  Not a loss though.<br />
<br />
Third loss: Full group, collect 29, hard. Berzerker, palidan, ranger, ranger, enchanter, and myself healing.  Group leader takes a hard mission...which didn't bother me so much, but she didn't tell anyone until we were halfway through the dungeon. ... We ended up missing the deadline, but completing the &quot;loser&quot; mission for 5 points. This group has good dps, no puller, a tank, crowd control, a main healer, and 3 supplementary healers.  This should be a win, on normal setting (and would have been; you almost won on hard).<br />
<br />
But.  Hard missions are significantly harder than normal.  I think it is very hard to justify the group leader's decision to take a hard mission without consulting the rest of you.  (In most circumstances I would not accept a hard mission with a group of people I did not already know well.)<br />
<br />
Given that you were doing a hard:  I would put the enchanter on slows on single pulls, and the shaman on slows on multi pulls (the enchanter switches off to mezz the add(s).  That gives you the mana to keep everyone topped up nicely on buffs, except for haste, provided also by the enchanter.  With your strong melee dps single pulls would go down pretty fast, the occasional double would be handled smoothly, and you'd make steady progress.<br />
<br />
When you come to a room full of mobs.  With this group setup I would reason:  we don't have a FD puller.  This is a collect mission.  We don't have to do this room.  We will turn around and go the other way.  The pieces we need will drop in another hallway.<br />
<br />
If we absolutely must pull from this room with seven mobs (in an assassination for example), the best puller would be the enchanter.  We set up the kill spot two rooms away.  The enchanter pulls at the far doorway of the in-between room.  He must lull 6 mobs and pull the seventh.  If he fails, he dies away from us in the in-between room.  He can then be rezzed and we'll try again (we lose 5 minutes instead of 25 minutes).  If he succeeds in getting a single (or double) he brings it to us at the kill spot.  Keep doing this until the room is empty.<br />
<br />
4th loss: Assasination. Full group: Warrior, ranger, ranger, ranger, bard, shaman. Fine setup.  Strong tank, lots of dps, good puller, good healer, no rezz capability.  Should be a solid win.<br />
<br />
Warrior gets bugged when we try to enter the dungeon and can't zone in ... Truly I think your most reasonable move at this point would have been for everyone to quit, zone out, reform, and try again.  You have a strong setup; ignore the meaningless 'loss' you just took, and go get the experience, the LDoN points, and whatever loot you may get in the next dungeon.  As it is, you let a computer bug push you from a very solid setup into a very iffy one.<br />
<br />
ranger, ranger, ranger, bard, shaman. ... Bard pulls, highest ranger tanks, I heal, I slow, I haste, I run out of mana.  If the bard is good, this can still work, but a lot can go wrong, and it needs a bard who can twist reliably.  I'd put the bard on pulls, slows, and hastes, and dedicate the shaman to healing.  The bard needs to pull singles.  Once in a while a double may be unavoidable, but every time that happens you are adding to the likelihood of failure.  <br />
<br />
second room, Ranjah Down.  We decide to press on and let him catch up. This is a followup mistake.  You had a strong group of six, you settled for a marginal group of five, now you are down to an inadequate group of four.  <br />
<br />
I had to keep stopping the group to dance my mana back up to 40%. I would call this a desperation mistake.  You are anxiously pressing on as fast as you can, pausing only to regain bare minimum mana -- 40%.   But that's not going to be enough if you get a really bad pull.<br />
<br />
the pull from hell. ... I chloroblasted [the bard], then began casting stoicism, ... I cast stoicism on the tank, healed the non MT super agro ranger, cast slow on the named, and got agro from every mob in the room. Root wouldn't land so I couldn't get away from them. You did bloody well, all things considered.  It is a credit to your perseverance and skill that you lasted that long.<br />
<br />
To sum up these 4:  <br />
<br />
1.  Inadequate group makeup.  <br />
2.  Frustrating evening, but no loss.<br />
3.  Bad move by group leader to choose hard without consulting; still a very strong group, nearly winning on hard; certainly a win if you choose normal setting; probably a win on hard with different assignments and tactics.<br />
4.  Everyone should quit when warrior can't zone in.  You would lose 10 minutes, get the bug fixed, and win 2 or 3 LDoN normals in the time you spent getting beaten up with the remaining inadequate group of 5, then 4.  All the other problems in this scenario come from pressing on instead of starting over.<br />
<br />
Bottom line.  You're not a bad player; actually I'm impressed with how well you did in the situations as they unfolded.  But I think you can turn #3 into a win with better tactics; and I think you can turn #4 into 2 or 3 wins by choosing to start over quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It's a combination of factors that have mostly been pointed out already.<br />
<br />
1) Ldon runs are getting harder. The exact mobs you get in a dungeon and therefore the difficulty of the adventure is dependant on the average level of the group. Essentially there a level 20, level 25, level 30 etc dungeons all the way up to level 70. Selecting a hard mission bumps you up one step. So group with an average level of 25 doing a hard will get the exact same thing as a level 30 group doing a normal. Knowing which dungeon your going to get is important especially if your looking at a hard. The difference between a level 50 dungeon (low end for what you could get now) and a level 60 (a high end hard) are going to be huge.<br />
<br />
2) Shaman aren't particularly good healers at that point especially if your trying to do multiple things. Druids really aren't much better off at that point either. Thats one range where clerics still hold a really good lead. Later on shaman become very effective healers vs easy content because of slow and out highly efficient HoT spells and Cann ability for mana regen. Especially as gear and aa's improve. You'll probably want a druid or cleric around for heals and you'll probably need to help the druid heal.<br />
<br />
3) Your also at kinda a weak point for debuffs. Mobs are starting to get resistant but you still don't have malo for an unresistable debuff. This can make landing slows difficult especially if your in a hard dungeon for your level.<br />
<br />
In general just make sure you know what to expect for the ldon mission and don't try to do too much and you'll do much better I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zillanex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Seems you and my wizard have the same curse then :D, think i done 5 ldons on him(he is now 44 first ldon at 41) 4 of those where failures, one was a hard rest normals, the hard one was acepted without the group knowing, well we did see the popup thing.<br />
I always thought ldons would be easy with a wizard but turned out it was rather &quot;hard&quot;, mostly on mana though, nuking drains mana fast since the pace in ldons are usually rather high so little time to med, resists are rather nasty to and rather common, with my mage i try to debuff all mobs to help nukes land but others seem to forget about it.<br />
<br />
Done 1 ldon with my shaman before i remade him, was in the upper 20's and had the same problem you describe, running out of mana, was healing/slowing and buffing and my mana pool just wasn't that big to keep up with it, all i had was canni I to.<br />
<br />
With the bard in group did he try to mez adds? if he stops meleeing all together he could probably keep 3 mobs down somewhat reliable.<br />
<br />
As for resists i noticed on the few ldons i have done with my 41-42 chanter that it differs a lot, in some dungeons i had mez resisted even after tash, sure glad i have a rune spell to use, took some nasty beating in that ldon :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Finglas Halfelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hail Jahvah,<br />
<br />
I hope you don't mind the perspective of a Ranger, who has made his share of mistakes, but has also had a few unorthodox successes.<br />
<br />
I love your examples because it seems in each of them there is a chance for victory (and also three of them have at least one Ranger in the group  :) ).<br />
<br />
I don't think you did anything wrong, tactically, in these adventures.  On the contrary, you seem very competent.  I think it's more, &quot;How could the group members have better coordinated their efforts?&quot;  It's great to be a part of a group that works well with each other, and is willing to try different strategies.<br />
<br />
<br />
Concerning the first adventure:<br />
<br />
You are the lifeline in this particular group.  Once you go down, all is lost.  But 2-boxing the Ranger, gives you the opportunity to coordinate the Ranger's and Shaman's tactics.  Please try this -- have the Ranger cast Tangling Weeds (fast-casting Snare) and Flamelick upon each mob on incoming, and repeat for each time you have to cast Slow because of a resist.  Your Shaman will be able to cast Slow very early, and also be able to sit immediately after each cast.  Patience is important for this tactic.  Don't cast Slow on a mob until it has been first Snared and Flamelicked. <br />
<br />
I have 2-boxed my wife's Shaman quite a few times, and have been very successful with this tactic.  I know that without her, I would have a hard time taking on even a single mob.  But with her, tanking 3 mobs is possible, once the mobs are slowed, and if she doesn't get aggro'd in the process.  On 3 pulls, her mana does get depleted because of the need to heal me, but we end up surviving and being able to progress.  On single pulls I take little damage because of the early Slow, and am able to heal myself afterwards, conserving her more valuable mana.<br />
<br />
<br />
Second adventure:<br />
<br />
Stillborn group?  Hmm, maybe not.  :)   Not much DPS in the group, but the Paladins can heal themselves between battles, and have Lay On of Hands for emergencies.  They also can tank, lull, and grab aggro very quickly.  It would be interesting to try it.<br />
<br />
My wife (Shaman), stepson (Paladin), and I (Ranger) did quite a few adventures with very few failures, when we were in our 40's.  Always MM Normal Collects, and it was always slow but steady.  Haven't been able to try this since my stepson left Norrath.<br />
<br />
<br />
Third adventure:<br />
<br />
A valiant effort on your part, but there was probably nothing that you could do to save the group.  <br />
<br />
It may be more reliable to have the Enchanter Pac Assist the Paladin on pulls.  I think too, if the Paladin pulls with a low-level Stun, the Enchanter may be able to Tash on incoming without drawing aggro, giving you a greater probability of landing a Slow.  Not sure about the amount of hate generated by Pally Stun spells, though.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fourth adventure:<br />
<br />
/em hangs his head in shame.<br />
<br />
If the Bard was being hammered while waiting for the Main Tank to grab aggro, then the Main Tank (Ranger) was not casting Tangling Weeds and Flamelick on incoming.  If that was the case, you probably ended up having to cast more heals than necessary, and had to wait longer before being able to cast Slow and sitting.<br />
<br />
Also, the Main Tank could have maintained aggro by recasting Tangling Weeds every few seconds.  I don't think the other Ranger would have stolen aggro in this case (proccing weapons or not).<br />
<br />
The Aggro Ranger should also have put his proccing weapons away.  I assume he was using a couple.  If he ever did draw aggro, he would only need to stop attacking for a couple seconds.<br />
<br />
Concerning multi pulls -- at least one of the Rangers should have been able to Snare and kite the adds away from the main group until the first mob was defeated.  Also, I have seen some impressive Bards fight one mob, while keeping another mezzed for the entire fight.<br />
<br />
And finally, about the Rangers' mana and healing ability -- they can't keep anyone healed during a battle, but three Rangers can fairly quickly bring a group up to full, between battles.  Every minute that they have full mana pools, while you are Canni Dancing to get yours back, is wasted mana overall.  As a Shaman, I would heal only enough to keep the group members alive during the fight and ask the Rangers to heal everyone to full afterwards.  And if you are forced to Canni, ask them to keep replenishing your health.  Much better to have you at 100% mana and them at 20%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Again, tactically, I think you are doing everything very well.  It's ironic, I think a group would have a hard time surviving a 4-pull without you, or at least a Druid or a Cleric.  Yet, I have never seen Shaman single-handedly save a group without having at least one other member perform crowd control or at least draw most of the mobs' aggro onto themselves first.<br />
<br />
Planning, as a group, for bad pulls is the most beneficial thing I think you can do, especially in unorthodox groups.  And it feels great when everything works out.  But if the group doesn't work well as whole, I think the only thing you can do on bad pulls is wait for someone to engage the adds, mezz them, or at least kill a couple mobs before you can do your thing.  I ask my wife to hold off doing anything, if she thinks she will end up having 3 adds on her.  If the group can at the very least kill off one of the mobs first, she has a chance to heal others and slow, and end up saving the group.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jahvah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You guys ROCK!  There's some great information in this thread.  My guild is doing hard LDoN races tonight, I'll try to put all your advice to work.  Guild groups generally work better than pickup groups, so hopefully we can break my streak tonight.<br />
<br />
Finglas, I always try to include rangers in my groups.  My first character was a ranger that I leveled to 55, and deleted out of pure frustration. (I play on FV, one character per account). <br />
<br />
In the 50's soloing sucks for a ranger (you can only look so at so many griffon butts), and it's tough to get groups...of course six months after I deleted him, I bought a second account because I missed playing my ranger so much.<br />
<br />
I also find that a Ranger/Shaman two box is a very effective combination...just not on LDoN's.</div></div><hr />
