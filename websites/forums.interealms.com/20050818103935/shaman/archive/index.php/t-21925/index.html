<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ryam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Virulent Paralysis is Disease based root with knockback. The first level is nice for emergencies, it gives you some time to recover after getting aggro, and pushes the mob out of melee range (if its melee range is relatively short). At 1st level the duration is rather short, so it is a temporary relief, but still quite handy. At level 3 the root lasts about as long as the reuse on the AA (2 minutes), so it can be used to keep a mob rooted indefinitely (unless there are premature breaks). After debuffing Disease resist with Malicious Decay, VP3 is pretty reliable in most cases, and makes root-rotting easier and safer. VP3 also has bigger knockback, and it good for gettting mobs off clecics etc if the group is low on CC (or to bounce mobs on clerics if you are as evil as the average shaman :p).<br />
<br />
I only have Lvl 1 of Sprit Call, so I'm not an expert on that, but it already has its uses. The doggies it summons are a pretty good speed bump, as they seem to have about as much HP as dogdog, and they also Enrage. In addition the doggies generate decent push, so they can be used to position mobs. No idea on the DPS they do, haven't parsed it, but it's a fun AA. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">VP: aa disease root with knockback, hotkeyable.<br />
<br />
Nice skill to have, go for VP3 if you get it though, for the large knockback/long duration (2m5s). Great for soloing, good for Ldon CC and things, and many other 'uses' make this a great ability. Also I rarely mem root with VP3 and clicky root pants, unless I'm pulling and need a real fast root for CC etc.<br />
<br />
Spirit call 1-3 (havent got 4/5 yet, not sure about them): I generally count on 1-2k damage per dog, depending how tough mobs are. Has a lot of uses other than damage, mainly positioning/interrupting casters/breaking rooms with no CC'er etc<br />
<br />
I wouldnt buy either of these aa early on tho, SCRM/Qb2/LR5/rc1 etc are all arguably 'better' for day to day shaman power.<br />
<br />
If you have you basic aa sorted out tho, buy sc1 then work on VP while you decide if you like having a dogpack ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't fully agree here. I got VP1 early on and found it to be a life saver, SC1 as well is great for those bad pulls where you need a burst of DPS very quickly. To go beyond level 1 of each though is something that can wait till other AAs are out of the way. The one flaw I have seen with SC1 is if the mob dies before the added pets do they do not engage any other mob unless you are hit.</div></div><hr />

I disagree - if I was just starting with AAs I would go for canni5 first, then go for SCM3, then get VP, then RC, then SC - then back to arch AAs.<br />
<br />
For both soloing and grouping VP is very very nice, especially since you can nearly cast it between spell gem refreshes.</div></div><hr />

VP, while insanely useful, will not change how you play the game. Cann 5, on the other hand, will do exactly that.<br />
Spirit Call 1 is a toy, nothing more than a speed bump to buy some time, and RC at level 1 is relatively useless, basically a Tash remover, it isnt really all that cool until RC 2 and RC 3, giving you the ability to remove Malo, Root, etc but that can get pretty expensive AA wise.<br />
Cann 5 with its 3 min BAM! Here is ya some mana for your troubles. The mana that it gives me back now isnt near as big a shot to my mana pool as it was when I first got it, but 1k2 mana is 1k2 mana. Thats big. let me re-iterate...thats REAL big. Its our best AA hands down. Dont skip it for anything else.</div></div><hr />

Then cheap stuff that is worth to have:<br />
VP1/RC1/QB1<br />
<br />
Of course everything is nice to have but it depend how fast you are getting AAs. The only bad note about cann5 is that if you mainly solo self buffed and your equipment sucks you risk to die everytime you use it.<br />

The sequence of AA you &quot;purchase&quot; depends largely on your playstyle.  Eventually, you'll get them all... well, if you stick around that long.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Diabalein, I never even bothered using VP1 when soloing.  It didn't last long, so I had to have a spell gem root up as well.  It was basically a waste for me, and I root rotted a LOT in PoValor.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying it isn't useful for you, but it sure didn't match my playstyle.<br />
<br />
What I would do on Crystalline Golems in POV is hit them with Malos from extreme range, with my back to them, and run away.  When my spell gems refreshed I'd stop, turn, and cast root.  I had something like two resisted roots in hundreds of pulls.<br />
<br />
I tried pulling with MD and using VP instead of regular root, but then I had to apply Malos/Malosinia anyway to get my poison DOTs to land, and as soon as I cast a root-breaking DOT, I had to reroot with regular root anyway.<br />
<br />
OTOH, I usually debuffed with MD anyway after the thing was rooted, so I guess it's six of one/half-dozen of the other which you use.<br />
<br />
In PoFire, today, I use VP3 to solo red-con Doomfires and I don't even keep a root up.  If VP3 breaks early, which it has very rarely done, I have to kite until it recycles.  The extra spell slot and the longer duration make it worth it to use VP3.<br />
<br />
But I wouldn't trade either level of VP for Canni5.  VP is useful in one or two narrow circumstances, Canni5 is useful EVERYWHERE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">A note about VP.<br />
<br />
While it just might be the best AA to get after canni5 if you plan on soloing, in a group situation it is far far less useful without proper communication.<br />
<br />
Any time you use it make sure to explain to your group about VP either a) when you first join the group or b) have a hotkey that mentions the mob is knocked back away from the group and parked.  The utility of VP goes right out the door when you have a couple mobs inc and as soon as one get's VP'd a melee or two, or pet, go after it.  Instruct the MA that on a multiple mob pull to not go after the knocked back mob if he had switched targets during the pull.<br />
<br />
Go straight for VP3 and do not stop at VP1 or 2, the knockback is just that much greater with VP3.  VP3's duration is just about 3 seconds longer than it's refresh so you can keep a mob perma-VP'd, which is wonderful for soloing.  If you plan on using VP at all make sure to keep malicious decay up at all times.  Even though it is disease based, many mobs (especially in LDoN) will resist VP frequently without a disease debuff first.  Once the debuff is in, they hardly ever resist (strange pattern no? :))<br />
<br />
Otherwise, for a handful of AA (it's what, 9 total for VP3?) it's a GREAT aa to have.<br />
<br />
As for spirit call, I was seriously disappointed with it at first and still am.  The cast time is entirely too long and once the mob is dead you can't command the pets to attack another target so they just stand there.  Sometimes I can get them to attack another target if I take some hits, but still that's not even reliable.  In the 6 or 7 seconds it takes to use the AA I could have nuked and canni'd once for the same damage they will do since the mob will be at 50 by the time the dogs go to town anyway.  Now, as a pulling tool it is useful because it's like a guaranteed root land if you know for sure you are looking at 2+ mobs.<br />
<br />
Basically, two thumbs up for VP3 and one thumb down for Spirit Call.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">...the cleric in the group i was in was using rc3 a lot, too (guk ldons...mobs casting tigir's, etc), and that is pretty attractive.<br />
<br />
Just do the Blood of Nadox quest.  Group cure similar to RC.  Not nearly as good, but doesn't cost AA's and will cure Poison, Disease, Tash, Slow.<br />
<br />
That said, RC is the shizzle.  Just wanted you to know there was another option for group Slow cure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Everything that people say about how good Canni5 is the truth.<br />
<br />
I have to confess that I got Virulent Paralysis1, Radiant Cure1 and Spirit Call1 before I got Canni5, and with the benefit of hindsight, this was a mistake.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong: VP, RC &amp; SC are great AA abilities. I now have at least level 2 in each, but Canni5 is better.<br />
<br />
Personally, I am not very good at focusing on grinding out AA for a big AA requirement ability (i.e. Canni 5). I get impatient, and I need new toys along the way (I earn AA slowly). So I picked up the low point AAs as i ground out AA for canni 5....it kept me interested, and I still got there in the end.<br />
<br />
In terms of optimal performance I should have gone straight for canni 5, but I didn't....sue me ;)<br />
<br />
I am now on the long, long grind towards LR5. I know it is probably the best AA for me to aim at...but rest assured I will be picking up a couple of other, lower cost AA along the way, just to break up the tedium and give myself a little treat / reward for being a good bear!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Basically, VP works well and is very useful when coupled with Malicious Decay.  At level 3 of that skill, the knockback is incredible and the duration is 2 min 4 sec which makes it last plenty of time so you can refresh it with itself.  If you do MD and VP3 on a lot of mobs (red cons in PoFire come to mind), and don't use any root-breaking-initial-DD DoTs, you can keep total control of said mob until its death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Damman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Spirit Call 3 has an added benefit most ignore, caster PVP. 5 dogs pushing on a int caster interrupt almost anything over 2.8sec casting. Just don't ever get SC4 or 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">VP1 can help save a group on an overpull. VP1 can allow you to escape an otherwise unescapable situation.  I think it is possible that VP1 might be useful before CanniV.<br />
<br />
RC1 is also nice--frees up a spell gem. I cannot recall anything that I have encountered that was not healed by RC1. Thus, RC2 &amp; RC3 seem a waste. Anyone out there who can tell what requires levels 2 and 3?  RC cures negative effects which are not touched by Blood of Nadox.<br />
<br />
In LDoNs, I pop SC1 2-4 times as a kind of dot. I usually try to pop on a multi-pull towards the beginning of one mob. If they are still around at end of that mob, I try to grab aggro on next mob. Paladins/SKs make it tough, but if needed I root/hug the mob and usually get a hit that way. <br />
<br />
With Root and VP1, Turgurs, hasted/DW dog, Bane, Bane of Nife, SC, Qs, Tnargs, Ferine Avatar, I can add fair dps while adding slows/heals. Of course, this requires enchanter buffs for group ahead of time. If I have to haste then my dps goes way down.  With a beastlord in the group, stacking FA and ferocity leads to insane attack ratings.</div></div><hr />

Like everyone else says, VP is also a great tool to have at your disposal. I'd also recommend grinding out ND3 at some point. SC is good when handling multiple incoming mobs, especially when solo.<br />

Had I been using the &quot;old&quot; Spirit Call 3, the 5 True Spirit clones would have parsed at 65 DPS all being equal, compared to 98 DPS from the ASC's melee - the procs added over 50 DPS.</div></div><hr />
