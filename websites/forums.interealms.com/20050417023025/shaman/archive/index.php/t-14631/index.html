<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>xorekill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hail and well met, all.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, with the 6/11 patch, it's come to my attention that KEI and other high level buffs (e.g. Aegolism, HR) can no longer be cast on anyone under level 46.  I didn't see this addressed in the patch message, but I'm not willing to spend 50 plat to confirm or deny a rumor (bleeding potion failures at too expensive).<br />
<br />
Most of the guides to leveling that I've seen tend more towards getting KEI, going in with high HP/AC and disregarding mana save for when Canni is needed.  Where should a lvl 40 shaman head to xp now?  How does the lack of KEI affect the pre-46 crowd on other servers?<br />
<br />
-Note : My gear, like many other misguided people before me...is WIS intensive.  I'm in the process of converting it, but prices are outragious on this server.<br />
<br />
Thanks to all who aid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grenoble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For me, I never got kei until I was 44 or 45 anyway, and by then I was easily soloing in OT and DL and EW.<br />
<br />
Course, you may want to look into LoY zones now; this was before the expansion, and I hear exp and loot are decent.  <br />
<br />
Kei was fixed...not nerfed, fixed...with the last major patch.  It was never intended to land on those under 46, but grouping worked around it.  I think the patch message just referred to buffs in general, not kei specifically.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My last experience in LoY wasn't overly pleasant ( received an intimate introduction with the business end of a drogmor ).  But I'll give it a shot, I've been working on my Paineel faction and Stonebrunt's just a short jont through the Warrens.<br />
<br />
As for KEI, I agree, it was a fix.  I didn't start using it until 34, and only for soloing or grouping where some misguided fools ( three warriors and a rogue ) wanted me to be their only healer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kvak_Ribbit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I still think thatyou can go anywhere those guides mention.<br />
<br />
the only thing Kei is (or was), is a tool to prevent downtime and hence speed up your levelling.<br />
Kei wont help you kill mobs, it will help you kill more mobs. So the mob that you can kill with Kei you can also kill without Kei.<br />
<br />
So following the guides are still a very viable road to go.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When it was available I used it, but now that it's not, it really isn't that big of a difference for me.  Soloing is a bit of a pain because it takes awhile to regain the mana from all of my startup spells, but once i get going it's ok (although i don't solo much with my shammy.)  I normally group with a SK that's a few levels higher than me, and the only differences are;  (1) I don't get to contibute in hth much because I'm constantly canni'ing, and (2) I can't add as many spells as I normally would.  Still, our kill speed isn't noticeably different than it was before kei...I just have to be more careful with my mana.<br />
<br />
Note:  I'm not a total twink, but I do have a fungi.   ;) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Loreddar Of Karana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/agree Abynormal. I was a bit addicted to KEI, but I can still hunt in most of the places I was hunting before the fix. Not having the same amount of mana available means I have to be much more careful about adds and multiple pulls. The downtime between fights has also increased quite a bit. <br />
<br />
The fix occurred at lvl 43 for me. When I made lvl 44 I decided to counter the fix by getting Canni II and Stoicism. There are plenty of guides on the Crucible for getting both of these spells, and together they make the downtime much quicker and more bearable. They also give you a glimmer of what the high levels talk about when they discuss &quot;unlimited&quot; mana with Torpor and Canni IV and V.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Find some freinds that can help you get the water flask for the stoicism spell...  Cani hard assuming  no adds to frenzy aggro on you and  at one red of health  cast stoicism and sit down  usualy your  75% health and have meditated most of the mana used for the casting of the stoicsm spell. <br />

<br />
Mana gear Hp gear and  resist gear I been focusing on  to help make  utilization of  cani and stoicism.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>xorekill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">While I can't wait to do the stoicism quest with the help of my friends...the spell is of little worth to me casting wise until I reach lvl 44...a painful 4 levels away still.  I've altered my old root-rot techinque to slow-send dogdog-posion dot-melee-canni-canni.  Should the mob not be losing life quickly, I tack on the disease dot as well.  Between Iksar regen and Chloro, I'm managing to only use about a bubble and a half of mana at 190 wis now, and coming out of a fight with about 60pct health.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, pvp has kept me from performing the Canni II quest yet...the joys of being on the 4team server.<br />
<br />
Thank you all for your suggestions and help!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">there are plenty of places to solo as a shaman with no kei.<br />
<br />
we still have no downtime without it, maybe less than a minute.<br />
<br />
anyway, as xorekill says, slow; dog; poison; melee; canni.<br />
<br />
I never used my disease dot however, I did use my dd a bit, just to even out my mana and my health a bit.<br />
<br />
I usually would end fights with 75% mana and health.</div></div><hr />

Besides it now causes you to actually learn how to play our class. Munch away at yourselves, and learn the canni dance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hear ya brother.. i play on VZ and all my attempts at doing the canni2/stoic quests.. simply sucked. <br />
<br />
As for exp'in xorekill, i seem to be pretty similar to u in lvl etc.. just find urself a good melee partner.. find a place togo and just slab on regen and slow the mobs u should be aite.. mana shouldn't be a problem.</div></div><hr />
