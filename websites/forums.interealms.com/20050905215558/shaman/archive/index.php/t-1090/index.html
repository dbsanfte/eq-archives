<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After seeing the demographic poll was just curious as to what people would choose if they had to start over again.  Personally I would stay as a troll, non of the other races appeal to me and I love playing my troll (even if I prefered the old scratchy bum, flailing arms look).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Whaddya think?<br />
<br />
Yup yup, Troll, but that's with the old Troll models in mind, if I had just started the game and only saw the new models I'd probably play a cat.<br />
<br />
ADDED: The only classes I would play are Shaman and Warrior, I only made the SK because I had some junk armor and 2 handed swords to pass on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Troll no doubt about it. Could put a Fun-guy tunic on him, Totemic out the wazzoo, 2 ac 6 65 HP rings, and go to town.<br />
<br />
Around level 10-15 group with some buddies and go start the Epic :)=<br />
<br />
I  STILL  wonder what's the lowest level you can succesfully complete Epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As low as you convince a sizable guild to do it for you.  You could do it at level 1 if you could find an epic shaman to MQ the tear for you.  Without that, you'd have to wait until 46.<br />
<br />
In response to the thread, I clicked ogre, but after thinking about it for a few minutes I think troll would be better because of the regen.  It's a close call, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well I love being Iksar so it would be difficult but if I were to do it all over again I'd be very tempted to try Ogre.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Old models, I'd either stick with iksar or go troll so I could use JBB as well as have regen.  With Luclin models though, I'd go barbarian because trolls and iksar look like ass now, plus barbs get to wear anything and lowest xp penalty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>DarkPhase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ogre again for me :) Unless they add a Unstunnability in AAXP. Then I would go Troll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I love my Barbie, but I would have to go Troll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would still play a Troll!:cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Currently I play a Troll, but I would definitely go with Ogre for the unstunnability from the front and the extra Stamina. I guess it seems that other races' abilities/extras diminish in significance at higher levels, while the Ogre's racial bonuses become more useful. It also wouldn't hurt that I like the Luclin Ogre models, while I have the Troll models turned off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">A better question might be:<br />
<br />
If you were starting over, would you play the same race as you originally chose?<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd play an ogre again, no doubt about it.  regen is great, but I just like being BIG.  and I can't count the number of times being unstunnable has saved my butt, and I've channelled off a gate through 3 or 4 mobs beating on my ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I' be unique and go a Barbarian again. Why be a &quot;cookie cutter&quot; troll? When you could be a handsome good looking Barabarian with a crazy eye :D<br />
<br />
As for the Epic at level 1 it couldn't be done, because you need to be ally? to MQ the tear so you'd level up quite a bit just getting the faction from the woe/envy turn in etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hmm I hardly ever get Stun, if I do the odds are 1-500 or so.<br />
<br />
My interupts are probaly 1 out of 10 when casting.<br />
<br />
What I do not get is when I play my Ogre SK I still get the same amount of interupts then with my troll shaman so I really dont see the big thing on know unstunnability from the front as a Shaman.<br />
<br />
As a Melee then I see it as a nice ability but not as a Shaman for the reasons I mention above.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">would still be a troll shaman.<br />

<br />
Ogre unstunnablity is nice for warriors tanking ubermobs, but only marginally useful for a shaman.  The only times my barb has gotten stunned when it caused a problem was when getting hit from behind anyway.  The Ogre's real advantage is higher starting stamina - but trollies are not far behind there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Vanbarm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Picked an Ogre and would pick and Ogre again without even having to think about it =)</div></div><hr />

Same for Kitties, Iksar.  Trolls are a bit more common, usually 10 or so lvl 60s.<br />

Faction issues mean nothing to me. Extra AC means ALOT to me. I would probably spend most of my points in stamina to make up for the low sta.. and it wouldnt even hurt his wisdom much, being naturally high in the first place. Regen *shrug* Im nearly 57th and havnt ever felt lacking for not having a fungi, and only 3 levels after that it becomes obsolete anyway =p<br />
<br />
Jbb.. well its useful, but my playstyle doesnt make it godly. I would much rather trade it for the chance to do the cudgel quest without having to turn in 20000 bone chips. Cudgel in range and epic in main. Planar armor that practically falls from the heavens like rain thats better then Rune Etched. Iksars really rock and I pretty much regret my choice of barb alot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I originally started my barb shaman because I was starting the game with some friends and we all wanted to be the same race. We were such newbies that we were afraid we wouldn't be able to make it to each other's hometowns otherwise. Anyway, we decided on barbarians. Our decision wasn't based on faction at the time. We didn't really think along those lines. We just thought the barbarians looked really cool and we were avid Diablo 2 players then and had all played barbarians there also. To make a long story short, if I was to start over, I'd probably go troll. Regen is just too sweet and the jbb is awesome. I can also think of times when snare would be nice, so all in all, trolls seem to have it all. There's an exp penalty sure, but with mad regen and a jbb, you could probably kill at a pace to compensate for that. Maybe one day I'll get around to starting that troll. I'm not even level 50 yet with my barb, so who knows? ;)</div></div><hr />

I've seen too many others get stunned after a resisted turgur and die before they can get off another slow, or back off to lose agro, and at the same time I've gated from far too many 5-12 mob trains to consider unstunability anything but a great advantage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You may know this but just to restate, that necklace casts a low level Darkness spell and is only good to stop runners very low on health, it has a long cast time and only lasts about 6 or 7 ticks. You cannot use it to &quot;kite&quot; or outrun mobs you can't already outrun with SoW.<br />
<br />
So anyone thinking dRooD Troll forget it, although the quest to get the Regent Symbol of Innoruuk is a lot of fun and one of the better written ones in the Old World.</div></div><hr />

-High base stats. (Ogres get something like 20 more total base statpoints than Trolls)<br />
<br />
-No Stun From Front - This is huge in my opinion.  You can't slow anything if you're spinning in circles.  I also play on a pvp server where this provides additional advantages (nothing like channelling epic dot through 3 rounds of Rogue melee).<br />
<br />
-Innate Slam<br />
<br />
Troll regen is pretty nice, but in the end, I don't feel it's that tremendous an advantage.<br />
<br />
Iksars can't wear plate.  No JBB = teh suck.  Not a big thing in the end, but it sure makes getting there more pleasant.<br />
<br />
Barbs can't see.  Seems like a small thing, but it's a drag to have to keep IV/UV up or sacrifice a gear slot for an item that aids vision.</div></div><hr />

I don't believe this is that much of an issue anymore, I think VI did something with the gamma to improve seeing. I played an Erudite several months ago and although it wasn't &quot;Troll Vision&quot;  it  was never as dark as it used to be. It maybe my monitor but I have black blacks using test patterns and other games are dark when they're supposed to be.</div></div><hr />

New models, prolly troll for the same reasons everyone else said (JBB+snare+regen).  New iksar models are terrible, especially females.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Hey Gala, it's ogres not trolls that get frontal stun immunity.<br />
<br />
If I had to start over, I would be severely torn between iksar and troll.  <br />
<br />
The JBB would not be a consideration for me, the big consideration would be AC/wis bonus vs. snare necklace.  I know that is used mainly to stop runners....that's what I want it for!<br />
<br />
I would choose troll or iksar due to the amazing regen bonus, especially the double regen granted those races with AA points.<br />
<br />
I would probably go troll just because of the female troll models.  I like the one with the bride of frakenstein hair.</div></div><hr />

Buuut......if considering the bigger picture, Troll would definatly be the best pick in the high end game. With the gear i have now i could easily get a troll to 255 wisdom and still have damn near 200 sta unbuffed while not sacrifing regen.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">I love my barb for RP reason (just don't fit with the evils), but<br />
after 45 level of never blind (splitpaw mask, then CGS) I recently got my SoBW and lost my last equiped light source (anyone know of a ammo light source). So I have to sacrifice a gear slot for a GLS - very annoying.  I might give the troll a shot if I had to start over again.  At least I could help at Lucan raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Heh. I had a GLS in my inventory until I got my epic. IR and UV let you see better, but they still don't provide light. In places where there's no contrast to begin with (caves), actual light helps a lot.</div></div><hr />

the light is amazingly helpfull.  bearform and UV give good vision ive found, but a lightsource can do wonders</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">I love pretty much everything about being a troll.  I love Grobb, I love the look, I love the way other players react to me, I love the comraderie with other trolls, and the relative rarity.  We could use some more quests and backstory, but otherwise we are pretty much perfect :)<br />
<br />
If I started over I would be a troll again.  I would probably not pick a name that made people think I was an Ogre (I had no idea what the names of the towns were when I picked my name, it just sounded &quot;Trollish&quot; to me at the time!).<br />
<br />
If I couldn't be a troll I would be a kitty.  No xp penalty, sneak, look almost as good as a troll, and a decent backstory are plusses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Tohlagos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Like many others I love my barb, but knowing about the races better now than when I started my shaman, I'd say I'd give a troll a try.<br />
<br />
After troll,  barb again, and then Iksar.  Ogre just isn't me.  Not sure about the kitties yet.  Should try an alt and find out.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Ogre again, no doubt.  I'd put some points into agi and especially sta this time though.  :)</div></div><hr />

Actually I like how there are so many quests available for them and the fact that many of them involve trade skills which are more and more essential to the game.</div></div><hr />

There's something to be said about being evil, and trolls/ogres don't come close to matching how evil an iksar can be. That and you have to understand the two rules to life on norrath:<br />

Used to be that everyone wanted to be a barby because their faction was sooo sexy and they had long hair to go with their long wisdom.<br />
<br />
Used to be everyone wanted to be an ogre because they had arms like tree trunks, were not stunnable from the front, and had damn fine resists!<br />
<br />
Used to be everyone wanted to be a leezard because they had tails full of wisdom that made a mockery of the barbs hair, resists that were positively ogre, natural armor the likes of which gawd had never seen, and could regenerate missing parts to boot!<br />
<br />
NOW everyone wants to be green and stoopid with a belly full of fungusbeer, dreaming of tripping up the fast feet of their foe with special necklaces and blasting them in the azz with bursts of frosty deth!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Zulan Spiritshifter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">I just wanted to add, that out of the 35 lvls that I have played with my Troll, the regeneration has definitely been nice.  When I hit lvl 34 i set out to the char creation screen and made an Ogre.  Wanting to test this Stun deal, I've been planning on taking the Ogre to maybe lvl 24, just to see how much of a difference there truly is.  <br />
<br />
Now taking everything into consideration, I basically gave my lvl 1 Ogre everything my Troll Shaman had.  Far from any sort of Uber equipment the Troll had, but it is definitely uber to start off a lvl 1 with.  He's strong, he's strong as hell as a matter of fact.  2 even cons and a yellow con at lvl 4, all while loosing only 100 or so hp's (out of the 360 buffed) he's basically just plowing his way through everything.  I wasn't able to start getting the troll any Totemic til about lvl 19ish or so, so this will surely be a bit unbalanced, but I gather that by lvl 24 (once canni and regen are set in place), the test will surely begin- for me at least.  <br />
<br />
The Stun immunity factor of the Ogre has seriously peaked my interest and considering how much I love to tank, I think this will serve me much more than the Trolls few xtra pts of regen did.  This guy's stamina is incredible also and I'm definitely interested in seeing how he will fair when the time presents itself.  For now, however, he's just a big arse mofo running around the jungle killing anything he sees.  It's truly an amazing sight to behold.  He can fight for longer periods than the troll was able to, but the lack of any real regen definitely merits consideration.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, it's just a test seeing as how fascinated I am by the sheer size and brute force of the Ogre.  Otherwise it is back to my troll.<br />

<br />
i don't think i'd want to play a shaman again.  i really enjoy playing my monk, plus he's very self sufficient.  <br />
<br />
if i had to choose a shaman race, i'd be torn between troll and ogre.  the question is which is more benefit, regeneration or not being stunned?<br />
<br />
i think not being stunned will be a life saver.  regeneration is more of a mere convenience.</div></div><hr />

I duo a lot with my RL friend and often times I am melee'ing right with him also and channeling through bashes and hits and landing root to park the adds...I really hate when i get stunned with my monk twink..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Sliths</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">If I'd have to start over I'd still go with iksar. Personally I like the iksar's quests (since in a few of them you learn alot about the some of their history and its an interesting challenge for a few of them). Not to mention I can wear some gear not as good as some other shamans races and still have better ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Ssarahh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">Wait, i did....I did it kinda differentally though :P i started playing as a Cleric. I loved being a Healer but i hated Healing if that makes any sence to you at all. If it doesnt lemme splane I love having the ability to heal when it is NEEDED i hate HAVING to heal all the time and everyone wondering what the hell you were thinking when you tryed to cast ANYTHING eltz. Then I met someone who would turn me on to the class of shaman. Spiritual (though some dont like him much) showed me the real powers of a shaman mind you i was only 30ish and a 30ish cleric cant solo his own shadow i watched this shaman and his pet going toe to toe with a sand giant. i stood there in awe and that night i created Ssarahh MK1 Iksar Shaman. I had great fun with her took her up to LVL 53 got her epic and a full set of Hate gear. but things in RL took a major downturn and things Ingame got repeditive, the Guild i was with though i loved em wanted too much with nothing in return and logging on just started to suck. so i annouced my retirement. Ran around and gave away all of my Droppable items then i Deleted. I scrubed EQ from my harddrive and vowed never to return......that lasted all of 6 months LOL. I created a LVL 1 toon and petitioned to see if i could get Ssar MK1 restored but was told by the server GM that it had just been too long &quot;were sorry, next time dont delete&quot; LOL so Ssarahh Mk2 was born and i can honestally say that i am loving every minuit it gave me a chance to fix some of the mistakes i had made with her in the beginning and to play around with different factions also as the old ssar had destroyed her Noob cudgle cause it seemed that there was no real reward for doing the quests sept a useless weapon i dont have to do the Bone quest LOL (any Iksar who has done it knows how Horrable it is) All in all Iksar is the only Shaman i would play ever</div></div><hr />
