I can't wait to see that day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ridik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Anyone else notice that most ppl's &quot;I got Torpor&quot; posts all seem to be coming from Emp.  I know its where I got mine and have read alot of ppl getting it off him.  Maybe he has a slightly higher drop rate, being in a dungeon (the Main dungeon of kunark) gave them reason enough to make him drop it 2 of every 600 times rather than 1.  Never know what those crazy Devs were thinking back in teh day.  Just an observation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Which emp?</div></div><hr />

Just to add to the thread...<br />
<br />
About 3 days camping Emp in Seb (not straight), but he finally dropped Torp and Malo for me. (not off the same spawn)   <br />
<br />
I do have to add, that I felt the cruelty of SOE, every time I saw a scroll on the Emperor's Corpse.. and saw MAL...... my heart jumped... in time to see the ...A.  I think I got 6 copies of Mala total.  So when Mal&gt;&gt;&gt;O&lt;&lt;&lt; finally dropped, I almost had a heart attack!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ultrazach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've been trying to get Torp for several months now. Even tried the GWs in Skyfire and had a friend camping the Emp for a copy. No Luck.<br />
<br />
Luckily two copies dropped in Veehsan's Peak over the weekend from one of Cazic Thule's reputable guilds. I gladly forked over 40k and a pair of boots for a copy.<br />
<br />
Needless to say I'm happy. 40k+ or not. The spell simply rawks. :-)<br />
<br />
Now I guess that means with my luck next week they will be researched and sold by Enchanters for 8k.  :-\<br />
