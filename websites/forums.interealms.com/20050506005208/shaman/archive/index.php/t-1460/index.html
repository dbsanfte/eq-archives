  Was just wondering how many lvl 60's in uber gear to kill the final 3 encounters of the epic weapon? The 3 books guy, The guy in the hole, ( I have the tear from fear already) and hmm I think there is one more mob to kill in COM after the 3 books guy and the guy in the hole. Can this be done with one group of 60's?:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hole could definitely be done with one group but it would take you a while to get down there. Recommend 2 for speed.<br />
<br />
As far as CoM goes one group could easily kill lord ghiosk for the 3 books. After that when you go back to do lord rak and nek after killing Kirn in the hole you'd need a bit more than 1 group. <br />
<br />
For nek and rak you need<br />
<br />
1 cleric to keep people alive<br />
<br />
1 mage for a fire pet to kill rak<br />
<br />
1 rogue to pick locks<br />
<br />
1 tank to tank the reavers and bosses<br />
<br />
1 feign puller to split the 5 reavers in raks room.<br />
<br />
1 mana regen crowd control source (bard or enchanter)<br />
<br />
1 shaman to do the epic =)<br />
<br />
You could theoretically get it down to 1 group of 6 if you used the feign puller as the tank but that would complicate things a bit as far as pulling goes. Also you probably want to add a druid/wizzy so that the tanks can get out after your done. A second mage for a second fire pet wouldn't hurt either.<br />
<br />
I'd say 2 groups to make it simple and safe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lord Ghiosk requires 2 level 60's one monk and a healer.<br />
<br />
Hole would need max of one group of 60's but most likely 4 or 5.<br />
<br />
Lord Rak needs a mage fire pet, cleric, rogue, monk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>NukuUnu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok great , thanks for the tips</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rigu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Lord Ghiosk I did with a lvl 51 shm and 60 monk. Neh'ashiir with a 51 shm and 60 monk using a bio orb to pull him down. Rak'ashiir takes a mage, acleric or 2 weaker healers, and a FD puller.</div></div><hr />
