<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey everyone, let's vote about where you would like to meet up for the in game raffle. Write in votes are welcome.<br />
<br />
Note: you won't have to be present to win.<br />
<br />
Added a link because Litgruv has a good point:<br />

So, here's the deal with the raffle. I plan on using Fuudce's awesome idea to raffle off 5 items I received at the Guild Summit. I will be creating an official &quot;post here if you want to participate&quot; thread today or tomorrow (still have two things I'm working out).<br />
<br />
I really want people to come observe the random to ensure I am being fair and impartial. If we want to do a naked newbie race or something for fun, that's great too.<br />
<br />
Basically, here are the rules:<br />
<br />
1. Must have been registered on the Crucible before yesterday when I first mentioned the raffle (don't want anyone creating a ton of bogus accounts for more chances to win).<br />
2. Must be comfortable sharing their real life address with me (via PM or email)<br />
3. Will have ONE entry only to win<br />
4. Can't cherrypick the prizes, if you're in, you are eligible to win any of the 5 prizes<br />
5. Although it's a longshot, can only win ONE item, if you happen to turn up a winner for a second item, I'll just re-random.<br />
<br />
EDIT Additional note, don't PM me your address info yet! You only need to do so if you win :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What raffle..<br />
<br />
<br />
And i picked halas cause there is no cooler place for anything to happen ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">North Karana is spacy and easily accessible.<br />
<br />
Besides we can train Grimfeather on eachother for kicks and kill HG's for PP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For once I agree with Litgruv, Halas would be great for whatever this raffle thing is you are talking about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I vote EC - so that those who have faction issues can join in.... plus it will be cool to repopulate the EC tunnel.  :)<br />
<br />
BTW - how will this work for people not on the server?  We create an alt?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I vote Halas! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tox, because it's one book away from PoK, and no one is KOS there.  Paineel book would be fine.  <br />
<br />
-Fin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Bahh, why no Cabilis?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>wakonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I am taking it this will be on Erollisi Marr server then?<br />
BTW, very cool of you Glori.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Maybe you should do it in misty thicket so you can spend all the time you do /random's looking at the bixies :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">EC<br />
<br />
I miss the &quot;old&quot; Bazaar.<br />
<br />
oops, edited heh, dindt read Glor's &quot;edited&quot; post, LOL<br />
<br />
Oh, BTW, thats a great idea, that was my planned proposal, some way to assign everyone a number, then Glor /ran. <br />
<br />
Maybe also put the prize list in order for people who do not attend. However, make it possible for someone who wins to pick a &quot;lower&quot; prizeif he wishes? Dunno, might be hard to do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hmmm, I should have added Rivervale!<br />
<br />
Blazz, in the interest of fairness and simplicity, there will be no picking of prizes. I'll number the prizes 1-5 and random each one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Draconis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">dont know what the raffle is really about, but I voted innothule.<br />
<br />
Why? because Trolls &gt; all <br />
(and frogs suck)<br />
Edit: read the other thread sounds like a good idea<br />
<br />
heh imagines 200+ zerg raid of level 1-6 shamans retaking grobb, oh the joy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I picked Halas, even though I suggested Qeynos Hills in my original suggestion. The reason being it's a lag-free zone that's easy to get to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>mspeedie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Since POK is unlocked there.  Also get shaman noticed ;-)<br />
<br />
Not stand down, lotto up!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Anyone have a clue what this is about yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Perhaps you should read the first post where I added a description and a link after your first post?<br />
<br />
PS POK too laggy, not an option</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ahh ok, didnt read it again cause ... well i already read it :)<br />
