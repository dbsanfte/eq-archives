<br />
Criminy, I was told by the island inhabitants that Raptors are camped 24/7.  One 59 Wiz claimed to be in possession of the camp 8am-2am every day of the week.  Was barked at by the druid holding the other island, and the antisocial behavior towards visitors reminded me of Leo DiCaprio's &quot;The Beach&quot;.  They really don't like interlopers on their little island paradise out there!<br />
<br />
They also told me a Pathfinder had no business hunting Raptors.  I can't believe that's right, because I am one lean mean fear-kiting machine.  Any comments?</div></div><hr />

I really don't think you would be able to fear kite.<br />
<br />
But, there is no way I would let someone tell me they are camping ALL the mobs in some large area like that - especially for AE kiting.  If you want one and they havn't engaged it yet - take it.<br />
<br />
Of course if they are really petty they might train you 'by mistake'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leyden</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best way to do the raptors is to Lev up and pull one to chessboard isle and kite it right there.  No adds that way.  Once you get the rythm down, you can pull two at once and root&amp;snare one on chessboard isle, while you kill the first.<br />
<br />
You can't fear kite over the ocean while leved either.<br />
<br />
That place has been the personal playground of druids and wizzys for a long while and they seem to have their own set of &quot;rules&quot; they like to follow there.  Most are afraid of you kiting along those isles and getting adds and training them while they are doing their kiting.  A real concern.  Seems to be alleviated some if they know you are pulling to chessboard isle to fight.<br />
<br />
There is no real difference between this place and the wyrverns in CS.  And everyone knows CS is FFA (no camps) and druid/wizzy quadding paradise with static outdoor spawns.</div></div><hr />

Those Raptors in TD are more trouble than they are worth for a 53 ranger.. Ive attempted them twice (at 54) and had my Arse handed to me.. the Aggro radius is quite HUGE!!!.  Thank Tunare for the Firepots. <br />
Ive seen the Strategy Section over at Graffes for Wizards and those two Islands are well suited for 2 Quadders sharing the 8 spawn. Let them have it and all its trouble.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I have been yelled at by a wizard, but I ignore him.  Funk that.  If I see a static spawn on the beach, not argo'd, not moving, I'm going to take it.  If the wizard / druid doesn't like it, so sorry, port somewhere else and quad aviaks for all i care.</div></div><hr />

As long as you stick to the normal raptors they dont hit all that bad and have low hit points.  I did have swiftwind and a dark cloak of sky at the time though but I could do 2-3 spawn spots before respawn.  I always sat on large where there is a single raptor on a beach facing chessboard.  You could sit on the side of him next to the mountain and it wouldnt agro if you fought others there.  Was good exp back then so I imagine it would be great if you could fear kite them.  Normally the quad kiters leave that spawn up also because it is a ways away from the other spawns for kiting, so I was always guaranteed that 1 spawn and then I would just grab another from any of the other spots.</div></div><hr />

FAH ---- Q !!!!  Make the wyverns animals and I'll fear them all day long.  Until then, I'm not leaving an exp spot that took me 30 minutes of travel time to get to-- so I told him, &quot;I can't port anywhere I want in Norrath/Luclin, so I am forced to stay here.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Heh, that's pretty funny. Can't imagine whoever designed TD doing so for the benefit of wizards and druids who want to quad kite. For that matter, I seem to remember there being talk a while back about nerfing the range of AE spells because of quad kiters. That nerf never happened but should illustrate VI's opinion on quad kiting. Not something I really see them tailoring zones for. Might want to point that out the next time you run into that sort of rubbish.</div></div><hr />

Have a hard time picturing Verant being inches away from nerfing the radius of AE spells because they didn't like people quad kiting and at the same time designing levels specifically for that sort of thing. Then again, maybe it's unreasonable for me to expect consistency out of Verant. Seems like an easy enough goof-up to make also. Quad kiting is usually easy even in zones not typically thought of as being quadding zones (I also have a druid).</div></div><hr />

<br />
On one hand, you can kill them just as well as they can and have the same right to do it as they do. Though some people (myself included, to an extent) see TD as mainly a quadders zone, not by design, but by how it is used. I rarely see any class at the raptors except druids, wizards, or bards. Despite that, I plan on bringing my ranger to hunt them too. :)</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't actually do that of course but they have some nerve trying to claim such a broad &quot;camp.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jarlax</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Claiming the camp like that is B.S. plain and simple.  I had a wizard watching me kill on the small while he was waiting for an island to open up once (I didn't know he was there) and he shot me a tell saying that he never knew that a ranger could handle the islands like that.  He said that he figured that I was getting exp as fast possibly faster then he did quad kiting with all the down time (granted I was 55 and had the extra damage bonus).  So don't listen to them finger waglers!<br />
<br />
As far as the islands go, they are great for fear kiting, you just have to esablish a cycle.  On the small island at 53, I could take a 3 cycle with no problem.  When I hit 55 and got the damage bonus increase I can handle 4 no problem and every few cycles I will also pull a 5th.<br />
<br />
The larger island is a little more difficult and you need to be on your toes, but if you can handle getting 2 at a time now and then, then once you learn where they spawn and the roamer cycles, you can create a 3 or 4 cycle there also.<br />
<br />
It is very doable for a ranger, and is actually good exp.  So just beat them to the islands and start playing around until you find your pattern and tell them druids or wizzys to stick it up there arse! =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Calithan</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm normally a lurker, but as i've had plenty of experience here, i'll share my thoughts. I play both a ranger (53) wizard (59). I&quot;ve been on raptor isle doing my thing for a LONG time. Once raptors were made fearable i've even brought my ranger there.<br />
<br />
This is on Zeb, so i've no clue on how raptors are on other servers. You have generally 2 camps. <br />
<br />
Large - 8 static spawns 2 roamers. 1 static is on far side of island and generally left alone. <br />
<br />
Small - 1 roamer, 5 static<br />
<br />
1 person CAN hold all of Large (8 spawn) leaving the single. Done this many times. If you can hold them, it is considered a camp.<br />
<br />
2. Same goes for small, if you want all 6 they are yours.<br />
<br />
So two people can monpolize this area, if its taken, you do something else.<br />
<br />
Exceptions.<br />
<br />
Ask to split the large - sometimes someone is nice and says sure, i don't need to do them all. I'll share. But its always been at their discretion. Spliting large is usually only done with other quaders as the spawn cycle gives just enough time for one to finish before the other goes back out for the second. If split with a ranger or any single class that doesnt quad you'd probably not finish it in time before 2nd set repop and be in a good bit of trouble. (seen it happen)<br />
<br />
Ask small if he's taking the 2 leftover static, if not, they could be yours. Ask Large if he's taken the farside static. Normally even if somone is on large taking 8 and someone on small. Those three are usually left alone.  These are the ones that my ranger usually pounces on, as they are out of the pull path of the others. And if you do happen to mess up, they won't path over the safe spot on their way back home.<br />
<br />
Being as they are camp so fiercely, its hard to get a spot unless you're there at the right time. Buy my ranger has never had a problem geting those last three. However IF a ranger is there, it is possible to hold small island and keep it clean. Doesnt' matter if you're not a druid or wizzy, bard or whatever. YOu're there, they are yours, end of story.<br />
<br />
Honestly i've never had any bad dealings with anyone there. If you know the area, how to keep mobs away from that ever so sacred safe spot, you'll never step on any toes.<br />
<br />
As to &quot;how can somone can claim such a large area&quot;. Well, groups claim large number camp spots in many zones, for xp , loot etc. It's recognized as acceptable camp because well, that's what it is. Raptors are the same way as any other zone, there are rules to the camp. If you follow them, regardless of class or group (yess i've even seen a cleric/monk/rogue do large) your camp will be respected as will you be.</div></div><hr />

Except large was almost always 2 people camping it and small had 1 person.  Then I would get the 3 leftovers that Calithan mentioned.  Its a nice spot once you get to know the other people that do them, as its normally the same people every day. And once they see you not bothering them and actually help them out when they run out of mana and still have some raptors alive they dont mind. The respawn is nice and fast too so there are not long waits if you do get those 3 spawns.</div></div><hr />

You CAN levitate and just pull your first raptor over the water and fear kite out there with no adds...very easy, you will have to swim underwater to hit them, no biggie there, then just start pulling away at the others and fight on land. I could do 3 easy before repops, and now at 55, I can get 4 most of the time. The one roamer on the small island is just a small pain, fear it if it interfers with your current fight, then engage after your done.<br />
As for those finger waglers....I usually watch them for a bit, and they usually cant get all the mobs before they start back on repops, even on the small island.<br />

Took the whole small island but the viscious (shudder, he takes waaayyyy too long to kill)<br />
I kited them on the south beach (side facing fire pots). Had a LSoEE and swifty. If your carful and really good as a ranger, u never have to kite in the water.  The roamer was actually my favorite one there. He would always come in the middle of another raptor, so i'd have to juggle 2. If it took too long i'd do half a cycle with 2. LOL it was sooo fun, no boring kiting. Just make sure to keep both snared and spread apart, and run them along the beach on the oposite side of the viscious. And always have lev memed incase you need to run if you mess up or have a wizard trying to kill you for the spot.<br />
i admit I did have a friends fungi, but damn was it fun. <br />

<br />
A few things youll want:<br />
<br />
- A lot of Bat wings<br />
- A lot of Fish Scales (unless you have an EB item or do like me and just surface once in a while)<br />
<br />
Just keep SoW and Levi up. Chloro if youre high enough. Keep harmony handy.<br />
<br />
They are easily harmony pulled if youre not sure if you can single.<br />
<br />
Pull with snare or some sort (Ensnare comes to mind) from over the water. Pull it some way back. Watch it close in, and dive in and start fear kiting. You will have NO add agro there and all the space you want for your fearing.<br />
<br />
Only one thing will will make this a little annoying at times: night. Load up chill sight or the like and youll see them better in the water.<br />
<br />
Happy hunting :)<br />

(Oh, and i can recommend them solo up to lvl 58 max, after that theyre really not worth the trouble if you consider the time spent versus the xp gained at your level)</div></div><hr />

Do the small wait at the south end near the large safe spot. Wait till wander leaves then fear kite the first, repeat on second. when those 2 are dead wander should be arriving, now fear kite him. (always pulling to south end shore before fearing)<br />
<br />
Then move up grab Sid (Sid vicious) what i call the vicious rap. also bring him to south edge and fear kite. Then move up to ruins. Fear kite first rap closest to ruin. run him back to his spawn point then fear, repeat till dead. Then fear kite last rap on island pulling him to the closest edge of shore from where he spawns. When done and if you still have mana grab a bonus rap from large island that woukd be right behind you from your last kill alone by itself.<br />
<br />
Then you can sit against the mtn face on small safely while medding to repeat it all. Exp is awesome so go and enjoy, the small was made for Rangers !</div></div><hr />

I pulled a raptor out into the water and started the normal snare/fear routine but there was a Wiz there that cast dispells on the raptor breaking both snare and fear as soon as I landed them.

I used to go there because of raiding a lot so I didn't want to jump from a group, and the firepots gave me quick access to the world at large.  I used to usually take the large island as any quadkiters would ask me if they could have the small island.  Fear kiting in the water was the easiest way, but it is slightly quicker doing it on the land.  I once shared the island with a mage.<br />
<br />
The XP was always very good so I would advise anyone to try.  Just make sure you know where the firepots are for a quick escape.  The worst I had was 4 mobs on me once (a quadder messed up).  I tried to lose them but you can't, and I ended up on the ranger island.  A bit of root parking, snaring them all, and fearing left them all dead :)<br />
<br />
I once had a wizard and druid moaning in ooc that it was made for quadders and unfair for me to be there, but the rest of the zone soon had a good laugh at them and told them where to get off</div></div><hr />

So i read this thread and thought i'd go down and try these raptors.<br />
  I really didn't believe people had that much trouble with wizzies here.  Well, I got down there and started hunting. Took me a bit to get  my strategy down.  Then wow a wizzie comes onto ooc and told me to get out said i was not utilizing the camp right since i was not quading and wanted me to leave.  *** another wizzie on the big island supported them.  After i told them where to go i continued hunting.<br />
After a bit i got into a pretty good cycle, basicly on a 3;7 cycle.<br />
Kill three med up completely then i'd kill those 3 again pull anther around the corner by that time the 3 would pop again so i'd kill those three making it 7 in a row without medding.  Then med a bit, usually wouldn't make it back to full so after the three were dead i would med to full and start another  7 cycle.<br />
Now I know I wasn't quad kiting, but i believe i was killing more raptors then that wizzie.  Anyhow I hunted the south shore of small.   2 spawn there and one loan one straight east of there.  To get the fourth round the corner to the north and grab a viscious.  <br />
