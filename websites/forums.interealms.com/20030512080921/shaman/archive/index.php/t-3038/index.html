<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Here's the quick and simple version I used.  Allakhazam's had a pretty good write up as well:<br />
<br />
There are 4 things:<br />
<br />
1. TRAKANON'S TOOTH --- Dropped by Trakanon who usually averages about 3 drops per death <br />
<br />
2. MEDALLION OF KYLONG --- Give all 3 portions to Professor Akabao in the Lake of Ill Omen<br />
(Top portion)In Chardok there is a mob called Niblek, give him a black sapphire and a ruby and he gives you the top portion<br />
(Middle portion) Dropped from Verix Kylox in Karnor's Castle (He's located in the basement area-follow the moat to the right hand side and go into the underwater tunnel, he spawns around that area)<br />
(Bottom portion) Found in the Library of Kaesora (its just lying in the corner of the 2nd floor inside)<br />
<br />
3. MEDALLION OF JARSATH --- Give all 3 portions to Xiblin Fizzlefutt in the Timorous Deep (His loc is -5800,2950)<br />
(Top portion) Its just lying around in the Swamp of No Hope at loc 52, 2935, -6 <br />
(Middle portion) Dropped by an Iksar monk in Firiona Vie named &quot;an ancient Jarsath&quot; (wanders near the Drolvarg camp-check tracking around the loc 270,-1900)<br />
(Bottom portion) Dropped by the Bloodgill Marauder who guards the entrance to Veskar at the bottom of the Lake of Ill Omen (His loc is -380,-50,-190) <br />
<br />
4. MEDALLION OF OBULUS --- Give all 3 portions to Slixin Klex in the Burning Woods located at -681, -1120, -560<br />
(Top portion) Quest mob Sselot Dnaas who spawns in an island in Warsilks Woods at loc 3900, 300(Give him a burnished wooden staff from chardok, have an enchie charm and do the trade)<br />
(Middle portion) Dropped by a rotting skeleton at loc 2100, -5100 in the Dreadlands <br />
(Bottom portion) Dropped by the Pained Soul in Trakanon just outside the Old Sebilis <br />
Portal<br />
The Pained Soul (and its placeholders) spawn at Loc: -1857, -4373. <br />
<br />
To get there: <br />
<br />
Facing out of the Seb tunnel, take a right and go through door. <br />
Take a left and move up a bit. Then turn to your right and the pained soul/spec keeper/spec champion should be in front of you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Take all 3 &quot;completed&quot; medallions and the tooth and return them to Emperor Ganak in Trakanon's Teeth to get the Key to Veeshan's Peak</div></div><hr />
