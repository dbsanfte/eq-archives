<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ronfar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Notice that this is flagged beneficial, and contains aggro reduction. This will likely be a group only (or possibly even self only) spell for SKs to use to decrease aggro at the cost of 1500 hps and a 40% slow.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ScRuBbA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">if that spell goes live, would it really be a surprise? i think we've been screwed enough already in every category.. starting to just be repetitive upgrades for others and still nothing for shaman, but hey, its VI, what else is new?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tauran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It has a 9 minute recast as well.  Not exactly something to rely on for slow in a group.  And 40% is hardly earth shattering considering you can do it to one mob every 10 mins or so.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  I thought about it a little more and it seems to me to be a aggro reduction buff like the enchanters glamerous visions but a much higher reduction with the penatly of a 1.5k nuke and killing melee DPS.   If so it would be pretty useful to shamans slowing or overdoting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's going to be a snare, not a slow.  Until it hits live servers, don't get in an uproar.  When it hits live servers, thank every SK you group with by keeping aggro on him and not us when our first one gets resisted, which by the way still happens to me occasionally on T2+ mobs even after Malo.<br />
<br />
Also, SK's have had 10 times the nerfs done to them than to us.  Be thankful for what we have.</div></div><hr />

V nice looking spells.  I do think it would be nice to get a spell slow line of spells.  Apart from anything it may well give us something to do against the slow immune mobs.<br />
<br />
P.S. These are flagged as No Class atm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Heh SKs are awesome now. If I hadn't had so much time invested in my Shaman I would make one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Notice that the two spells Asta linked to are AE spells!!<br />
<br />
Definitely shaman material.   Would be nice if these show up on the shaman spell book for LoY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sounds like Necro/sk for one and druid/ranger or wiz for the other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Um, that original spell, as others noted says &quot;Beneficial&quot; and reduces aggro.<br />
<br />
Really looks like a self-only spell used by SK's to lose aggro.  Nasty side effects for that benefit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I wouldnt put any stock in these spells until LoY gets closer to release.  In every expansion VI puts a few odd spells in to throw people off.  And even if these spells go live they will probably be changed quite a bit.<br />
<br />
I'd give it a few weeks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">These are flagged as No Class atm<br />
So - they are probably pbae spells for mobs.  Nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yeah, those are for a very nasty mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Glaaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Could be a self heal with the slow affecting the caster not the mob.<br />
<br />
Suck 1500 HPs from mob.<br />
Decrease caster argo.<br />
Slow caster 40%.<br />
<br />
The beneficial/detrimental flag is different from other lifetap spells, but whether or not its beneficial is kind of depends on your point of view.<br />
<br />
Just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kharzhoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">For whatever its worth, the current thought on the SK board is that this is primarily an agro reducer spell. It has a recast of 9 minutes and lasts for 3 minutes. Our thought is that it reduces the agro and has the sideaffects of 1500 hps and slow attack. This would be used primarily on the first clerics for a CH chain, or on someone slowing the mobs. As the SK cant keep this buff up, it will probably only be used for the initial pull/debuff/CH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Those 2 would own for pvp :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">As far as I can tell, from the description, this is Snare spell with DoT, pretty typical for SK/Necro. Definately not a SLOW spell, it's the movement speed reduction, not the attack speed reduction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I seriously wonder if LoY will contain any spells that will be either useful or level appropriate to a lvl 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Karlis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">It -is- attack speed reduction, it is not self only, but it is a beneficial spell.  It's prolly going to be a group or possible click through on any target agro reducer.  <br />
<br />
Obviously no one outside of the developers can say for sure but come on, they won't upgrade HT cause apparently it'll become overpowered, so they're hardly likely to give us a 6 ratio nuke =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3753&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
Just changed to detrimental effect, which I assume will be slowing the mob as well as a 1500 nuke.  What bull**** if this goes live.  So now SK's blow away our best nukes, and can now slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Wow.  1500dd, aggro reducer, and a slow.<br />
<br />
Caster balancing is making me a bit nervous again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kialan Lecariuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Ok, hold on.<br />
<br />
2/1/03 the SK 'slow' spell was changed from Beneficial to Detrimental.<br />
<br />
/gasp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Yatta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">If it wasn't for the 9 minute recast, I'd assume this spell was a joke. Curious though, how would an &quot;aggro reducer&quot; work on a mob?</div></div><hr />
