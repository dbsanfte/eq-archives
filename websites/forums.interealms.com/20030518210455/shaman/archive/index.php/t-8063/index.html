<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>drdrink</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, a bunch of my guildies have been telling me to do this level 35 quest that gives plat and exp but, I'm evil :D. So, it's basically impossible to repair all that faction. Anyone have more info on the evil places to get these items?  <br />

<br />
Saren Kaja in Shadeweavers - Thicket Ball of Twine <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SkegBlackwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Keg of Beer- Neriak Foreign Quarter: Darien Felton loc 140, -80 right across from Soulbinder <br />
<br />
Bundle of Weapons- Grobb: Ootok Loc -240, 40, right to the left as you come in the zone. <br />
<br />
Ball of twine- Feerot: Fugla loc 965, 1255 Stone huts to the north east of the bridge near Oggok. <br />
<br />
Purification Tablet-West Freeport: Toxdil Loc 620, 200 Right outside the gate on the north wall is a secret passage, run through the wall to find him <br />
<br />
The armor assortment still comes from Thurgadin like in the good version, as does the case of meat from Bazaar.<br />
<br />
All of the items are lore and no drop.<br />
<br />
Iksars as far as I am aware can not do this quest unless they have worked on faction.<br />
