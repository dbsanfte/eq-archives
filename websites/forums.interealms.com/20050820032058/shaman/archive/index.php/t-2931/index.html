GO AWAY IT SUCKS. Shaman are SOOOO useless in CT. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What he means by 4c is known by a few names. On Mith Marr where I grew up it was called Lower Zig and Upper Zig, on some servers they call it 4 corners, on some it is the archon temple. Anyhow, it is the big temple back past the maze. Mobs in all the corners surrounding it. The big temple that you have to climb a  couple stairs to get to. Thats the one :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">DAMN YOU!  I'm never gonna get one of those baubles!  Been going for weeks, Taethan keeps telling me we will get me one eventually...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>fandain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">so do these drop inside the temple, or also from the mobs standing in the corners? are they from nameds or also random from regular mobs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mooshfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">How long were you there for? Was there for 5 hours and all we got was a necro shoulderpiece from Terrorcclaw 8(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Did you have just a single group there? Or two groups?  And where did you pull to?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mooshfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">WHen I do 4c my group starts off at safe hall. Your group should look something like Enchanter, Cleric, Monk, Taunter, Dmg dealer, Shaman. I guess it would be possible without a chanter but more work for you =\.<br />
<br />
Anyways, you generally pull the 2 static close to safe hall, after those killed you pull the 2 at the top of the stairs. It would be BEST if you GET 2, there are wanderers running by, try to time ti so you DONT get any of the wanderers, if you do its fine, you have an enchanter and shaman hehe. Then after kidnapping a few wanderers up top  I move up and begin making laps around the maze gangbanging each corner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Guildie picked up a barbed rubi bracer for me this weekend, nice item. Does a barbed rubi hat drop drop in 4c? Mine needs replacin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">whats the spawn time of those fast roamers and the corner mobs? same as the rest of the zone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Spawn time in 4c is an INSANE 10 minutes. Most of the rest of the zone is on a 20 minute timer. If you can one-group 4c, you're in a hot-s'hit group with VERY nice DPS, that fo sho. The big thing here is levels. Don't take people below level 58 and you'll have far fewer adds. I took an expeditionary group of about 20 people, half of them below level 58 (but none under 53) and the adds were constant, non-stop and aggroed from a mile away. Did win a Hammer of Spiritcalling before leaving 4c the hard way. ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh .... as for the guy that was there for 5 hours and only got the Necro Shoulderpiece.... You simply have to spend LOTS of time in this zone to get a good variety of drops. In some 5-hour sessions in the maze we've had 10 named, and in other 5-hour session only one. <br />
<br />
Here's what I'm finding so far: <br />
<br />
Sewers: 1 named per 7 hours.<br />
Maze: 1 named per hour<br />
4c: haven't spent enough time here<br />
TR: 1 named per 4 hours<br />
<br />
I never did this zone as a lowbie, but I'm LOVING the currrent zone design and content. It's got two bugs, however. The ring of ooze event's final boss casts a ZONE-WIDE MR-based poison DD and whirl-till-you-hurl stun. The AOF event also has a zone-wide AE.<br />
<br />
You can probably count on wiping, wherever you are, if either of them is kicked off without warning. 140MR at level 60 is sufficient to resist 95% of the zone-wide AE from the ring of ooze. Levels 59 and under have considerably more difficulty resisting it.<br />
<br />
Hmmm... unbelievable zone. One comment over at the Rogue boards sums it up nicely: <br />
<br />
<br />
This place is easily my favorite zone in the game. <br />
<br />
#1 It's tough...No playing games when you come here. You have to have decent DPS, quick minded healer, and and enchanter who knows his stuff. Respawn time is 10 min, mobs hit in the 200's have 350 ae's, ae slows. Some named flurry, enrage, blah blah....This is my idea of a PERFECT 6-person group zone. You won't find Joe Sebilis here two-boxing, or monks soloing. <br />
<br />
#2 Exp is the best in the game for a group hands down. It's nearly as good as soloing. <br />
<br />
#3 Loot. Basically only place in the game where you can get upgrades at lv 60 thats non-tov, luclin boss mobs. And it can be done with 6 people. <br />
<br />
If you want a beefy challenge and want to work for your loot, come here. If you want to solo, be bored, and play with your anus, I hear Velks is great this time of year.. <br />
<br />
<br />
I simply LOVE how soon the mediocre players get run out of this zone. One of the best things about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">You won't find Joe Sebilis here two-boxing, or monks soloing.<br />
<br />
Umm I solo here all the time. It''s not that bad once you know the layout.<br />
<br />
As for masks, check out the Dreadfang mask. 50hps 50mana so a lil better then the Tae Ew Ritualist Mask.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Heh, soloing in CT makes very little sense from an experience perspective. If you can somehow wander the zone until you find a named, and then SOMEHOW get him single, then yeah, maybe soloing here could work.<br />
<br />
But really, I don't see you doing any of the nicer named camps solo. FT3 boots solo -- no way. Duo with a monk, yes way. Mosquoto leg ear solo, no way in HELL. Duo with a monk, VERY difficult. Sorrowsong boots solo, no way. Duo? Very tough. etc etc.<br />
<br />
Sure, just for bragging rights, go solo it. Wooptie doo. You're not getting xp at a good clip and you're not taking down the nicer named drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Junder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Is a 55 shaman too low for this zone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I simply LOVE how soon the mediocre players get run out of this zone. One of the best things about it.<br />
<br />
Thats the best thing about the zone. Forget the Items. Forget the XP. The fact that a group of people ToV and ST equipped will get wiped out at the zone in for being mediocre players, while my regular group goes in.. hunts nameds and snickers in /gu at the so called ubers who cant hold their **** together in a zone thats actually challenging.<br />
<br />
Im sure that sod+primal warrior and his group went back to highkeep2.0(fungus grove). And pulled endless rounds of ****ty xp, but 0 challenge/danger mushrooms.<br />
<br />
That makes me happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">At level 58 here I had real trouble slowing anything without Malosini AND tash on it. At level 55, you'd get a ton of resists and likely get pummeled. With a bard doing OOS and a chanter doing tash... You could prolly hang. But it'll be tough on you. Try it out -- worst thing that can happen is death, and CR is incredibly easy here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Actually I can keep 5 spawns cleared on my own solo. That IS better exp then with a group killing. The only thing that's better is a duo with monk or rogue so I can kill 12 things per spawn cycle.<br />
(I do admit that I &quot;cheat&quot; and gate to the zone with C3 and aego on after raids)<br />
<br />
As for your &quot;named camps&quot;.<br />
Um all those you listed are soloable. The sewers is a very easy solo spot, and the ft3 booties drop right there at the start of them just begging to be solo farmed. <br />
The only remotely tough part about the whole sewers area is the see invis skeeters making the move to spots somewhat more difficult. If you camp down there, its no problem.<br />
As you said, add a monk for easy splits and your golden.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">4c is INSANE without an incredible group, the only reason I do it is because the monk, 1 rogue, war, ench, and sometimes ranger \ wiz in my group are all from FoH hehe...and even then we have had trouble before (i've died a few times...tank died once from adept with grinder, dont think we have wiped though).  Unless you have some crazy DPS, dont expect to keep all 4 corners cleared.  Also, Fleshgrinders are very common drops here, and on Veeshan sell for around 70k atm (when I got and sold mine they were 100k but dropping fast).  I have saw about 5 or 6 of em in about 7 or so trips.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Actually I can keep 5 spawns cleared on my own solo. That IS better exp then with a group killing.<br />
<br />
5 mobs in 20 minutes? I'm averaging at least 30 an hour in TR, Gatorpoool, Sewers and Maze with a nice full group. Really depends on the puller. <br />
<br />
Also, how are you single-puller the first room of 3 slimes in the FT3 boots area? They're really not single pullable... so are you rooting, gating, rooting, gating, and then finally getting one? And what spells are you using? A &quot;Pool of Slime&quot; would probably take two poxes and six banes plus spear dots. Of course, you probably have a JBB... which is &quot;worthless&quot; for soloing at level 60. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">My favorite thing about CT is that it is actually HARD, and the risk = reward very well. Even at 60 with over 150-200 AA points total among my group, we still wipe out sometimes. It's hella more fun doing something challenging to your skills as opposed to XP grinding in Velks Lab / Sebilis etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">When breaking the first slime pool you can get 2 and 1's.<br />
<br />
When doing hardcore experience I just do zonein and kill the 2 guards at first dble doors, then 2 at the &quot;cooking pot&quot; in the courtyard, then the single raptor on the left side. That's 5.<br />
After the intial 2 breaks, you can pop a pet out to kill faster.<br />
If other people are around and getting in the way, there is 5 more mobs that are easy single pulls in the CY area. (yes a named spawns in CY)<br />
The maze is easy to solo too at the wizard port in spot. <br />
<br />
The hardest thing to kill are the warders they take a little extra work. <br />
On average I use pox, bane, plague,Ebolt and  2 epics, melee/jbb/canni to suit your style. Canni5 during fight, and pull next lizard while the first one is near death. With hard hitters like this, its all about kill speed/DPS, not long fights saving mana.</div></div><hr />
