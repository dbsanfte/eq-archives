<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">pfft what about a 65 only forum lol.../snicker</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I notice I can get 4% aa while only get 1% exp at lvl60; that like 1 blue per hour(or less when you ding); and this rate will lower when you ding 61,62.... . man, I really hate to level up at this exp rate<br />
<br />
since lvl50 and 50+ will con blue at 65; those summon mob will kick most of other class out of solo club unless they still like quad kite light blue con<br />
<br />
for lvl50+ mob, here is possible solo spot for shaman:<br />
CT : maybe you can single pull all spawn at lvl65 :) just dream<br />
Grey : Sun Reavent are level 55, 6 spawn,<br />
Seb Jugg : still danger now, lvl65 maybe make a difference<br />
FG royal bug : hard to single pull atm, maybe can reliable single at lvl65<br />
FG bandit : don't know what level, maybe can single at lvl65<br />
UP : random mob<br />
ME : 4 arm<br />
SSra : hopefullly this will be new solo ground for us</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">levels 61-65 may require a lot more exp than level 60. A while back I heard a rumor that was something like level 61 will take twice as long as 60, level 62 will take twice as long as 61, etc. etc. Now thats just a rumor, but I'm willing to bet the levels will get progressively longer. We'll just have to see.<br />
<br />
I think your right though, we will definately have an advantage solo'n post 60. All the places you suggested sound like viable places we could solo at. The bugs in FG would be really nice if you could single pull them all, I was able to single pull one of the warriors (level 60) and solo him, with ease actually, they don't summon.<br />
<br />
Anyways, some other ideas would be:<br />
Akheva - some of the higher level mobs past the traps.. rocks and stuff.<br />
Velks maze - could probibly single pull at some point, but a lot are cleric mobs.<br />
WW - various mobs/dragons<br />
Kael - Arena maybe?<br />
OS - Emp - would be awesome if you could single pull his guards, that would be 4 level 51 mobs, 2 reg mobs, 2 named mobs level 55 and 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Korlace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Of course, all of these places sound great, and would probably be quite possible for well equiped shamen.  However, I remember reading a while back (a long while back) that PoP abilities could only be used in PoP zones, and that regular level xp could only be gained past 60 in PoP zones, meaning that perhaps all of this is academic.  If I'm right, at best you could grind AA at all of these spots (which would still be cool), but if I'm wrong, I'll be very ticked off (as will many others) that some lvl 64.75 shaman is grinding out their last few blues to 65 at kael arena when I'm hoping to get a chain BP to drop (but don't, cause I can't get a good camp/plenty fo spawns).  There's already a problem with solo/duo combos competing for spawns from newbs in many zones (hey, look at me, i'm a lvl 60 newb!).  So, the question of the day is:<br />
<br />
Can you even get level xp (or even AAXP) in old world/kunark/velious/luclin zones once you ding 61?<br />
<br />
If you CAN'T, I can see tons of people staying 60 for a LONG time to grind out tons of AA on easy, low hop mobs before moving on to PoP content.  Maybe not, but I know that this is what I plan to do (no PoP for me until I have 30-40 AA).<br />
<br />
So am I right or am I wrong?  Does anyone have experience with the PoP beta test?  Can anyone confirm either way (provide links to other posts etc) which of the two situations we'll have on the 21st?</div></div><hr />
