<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Druids.... 99% of them are jag offs.  ANY moron can level up a Druid to 65 with little to no skill.  Add to it the fact that they all bitch about &quot;Sure we are: #2 with heals #2 with dots #3 with nukes #(ranked high) with buffs {I'd take PotN over any other if I could only have one buff but I'm guessing melee would want Virtue so we'll just say they are higher than us.} *waa waaa* But SOE hates us!&quot;<br />
<br />
And the sick thing is they REALLY feel like this...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Manson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Clerics 100%<br />
<br />
They are too darn powerful and high-end EQ is way to centered arund them.  Clerics can afk for 5-15 minutes if they like and the darn group has little choice but to stay hanging around waiting for them.  If any other class decided to go afk for that amount of time they get dumped from group.<br />
<br />
Clerics are pretty moody on my server too.  It the group/adventure/expedition gets off to a bad start they usually run and forget about rezzing you.<br />
<br />
If EQ were not centered around the cleric as much as they are these characters would never get away with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Used to be Druids but now id say Clerics.<br />
<br />
Cleric goes AFK group waits.<br />
Not enough Clerics turn up raid cancelled.<br />
Cleric gets aggro &quot;Help your cleric is being hit&quot; etc.<br />
Out and out best healers in game yet they still want more.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Fun survey, but hopefully you all realize that, it's not the class, it's the people.  And no class has a monopoly on &quot;jag offs&quot;.  I love all the classes, but there are a lot of people I'd off if I could. :)<br />

<br />
I'd say that all classes have some good, and some bad players.  The class itself doesn't make the person a jackass..the person was probably dealing with their cranial rectal insertion problem long before they began playing EQ.<br />
<br />
I'm not really sure what this thread will go to show, besides whining about class envy, but in my opinion, each class has an equal opportunity of providing etiquette impaired players to the game.<br />
<br />
Be Well,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>gin_juice68</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Rangers <br />
<br />
I hate rangers with tons of procs and ZERO AC and ZERO HPs...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Cleric. When one cleric REFUSES to group with our fully EP-equipped group because we didn't have a fricking CC class for a hard LDoN. (all of us are about 50-2) And begins to taunt us and saying that we better get a CC class or we're on her **** list...it goes to show how fricking cocky some of them have become.<br />
<br />
If Clerics weren't so needed, some of these jerkoffs would get exposed and have their stupid LFG tag up for hours.<br />
<br />
Druids are either amazing at their class or terrible. It's easy to sort them out and to replace them, so I have less hatred for them than the cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just like any true old-school shaman, I hate druids more than any other class - especially halfling druids.  I have absolutely no rationalization for this, I just hate them.  I think it all started with their petition (which SOE listened to).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Seichan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm going to have to go with Bard on this one.  I base my opinion solely on who I hate to duel to most.  Well.. and I guess I am jealous of Selo's.. but oh well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The only class that makes me go &quot;uh....&quot; in my head when they join the group is bards.  There are few things as annoying in game as going to slow an add, only to find that you've wasted the effort because the bard decided (this time at least) to CC with charm.<br />
<br />
I also have much hate for them because I cannot recall grouping with a single one that understood that Selos (or whatever it was) blocking Torpor was a Bad Thing, even after being told.  I understand this has been fixed though.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, a well-played bard is a thing of envy to behold, but the well-played are few, and the many seem to be able to get in my way like no other class can.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Amen.  Anybody who does not harbor a deep seeded, completely irrational hatred for halflings in general and halfling druids in particular may not be human.</div></div><hr />

Sorry Sskeli but i think this whole quesion is bull**** to begin with, for the first reason, you only give 6 classes to Duo/group/whatever with.  All of them have there placements.  Now I noticed you said Disliked the most. why would ayone have a problem with any of these classes if they knew what they were doing, and pending atmosphere/surroundings?<br />
It just seems like a needless post to me /shrug?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sskeli Kin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It's not a test...lol. Share your feelings or just ignore it, but posting a message saying my post is useless is pretty useless in and of itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Asthore McTavish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I don't hate any special class. I just despise someone who pesters me for FA on a raid. I usually pick 5 people randomly to cast FA on. These people don't pester me when it wears off and we have 4 mobs inc. They don't send me a tell as the named is inc for FA. My guildmate Feradach is right FA is da DEBIL!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I still dont have FA, and you know what, I aint gonna buy it, if the melee want me to have it they can font me the plat for it. Hell half the time it them rolling for the parchment/runes for alts or for spells for their bazaar mule that stop me from getting the spells in the first place.<br />
As far as hate its a strong word, what i dont like is SOE farming out all our abilities and spells so much so either our hybrid beastlords are more powerfull wanted then us, or submit to the whining of the druids till they are soloing all content with ease and still want more.<br />
There are only a couple things that i really wish would happen:<br />
1. SOE i want it no reason we should get a &quot;spirit&quot; spell combo of stuff we already have.<br />
2. CH same as druids, not sure how they ever decided at one point that druids and shamans deserved unequall healing spells.<br />
3. Pets, inate dual weild, little more powerful comparatively speaking, and BUILT IN SOW dammit, it a spirit wolf without spirit of the wolf, cmon.<br />
 and number 4 is just in general add some quest content to the rest of the game old world older expansions, hell make them flagged so you cant do them more than once, and get REAL exp for them. After all i thought the name of the game was everquest not evercampandgrindandfarmandcampandgrind.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The class that I dislike the most didnt make your list.<br />
<br />
Enchanters<br />
<br />
Dont get me wrong.  I liked having enchanters in my group for Guk and Sebilis crawls.  They made my life easy.  They made the game easier.  But then came KEI.  Which wasnt bad in itself, because I loved 14/tic mana regen that lasted an hour and a half...that was less cannibalizing that I had to do.  <br />
<br />
And then they extended it...and extended it till a single cast of KEI can get you through 3 and a half hours of playtime.  <br />
<br />
And fully extended my FA doest last more than 12 minutes, AND its single target.  <br />
<br />
Oh, and did I forget to mention that even though the devs have SEEN how completely devastating an enchanter with a charmed pet (not even DIRE charmed, just charmed with the right precautions) could be in PoP they &quot;looked into&quot; charm and found nothing wrong with it.  And now to have any hope of being successfull in GoD in a timely manner an enchanter is a must.  And since they put out insane DPS and have a slow thats as good as ours after its mitigated, they get our spot in groups.<br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />
