<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In a further attempt to understand the design principles used to implement shaman healing, I used calculations on the healing power of shaman spells (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=20223)  to compare the effect of slow mitigation on shaman healing.<br />
<br />
Since we don't know exactly what the design principles used by developers are, my intent is to test the following hypothesis:<br />
<br />
The lower healing power of shamans is balanced by their ability to reduce mob DPS using slow spells.<br />
<br />
Ideally, a test of this hypothesis could be made by examining a large number of in game encounters under actual playing conditions.  Since this is not available at the moment, I used the following dynamic model:<br />
<br />
1.  Assume the mob has a DPS that needs to be healed that exceeds the ability of a priest to heal it.  I used a DPS of 650.<br />
<br />
2.  Calculate the hypothetical time that a priest could keep the tank alive by chain casting a single healing spell (druid, cleric) or by casting debuff spells (Malos+Turgur's, or Balance of the Nihil) followed by chain casting a single healing spell (shaman).  These times will be a bit higher than they should because in real situations, there will be fizzles, resists, etc.<br />
<br />
The model can be written as:<br />
<br />
Health at time t = Full health - NetDPS * t<br />
<br />
The time that the tank lives is obtained by solving the right hand side of the equation when health at time t = zero, which gives:<br />
<br />
t = Full health/NetDPS<br />
<br />
NetDPS for an unslowed mob is equal to DPS minus HPS (heal per second)<br />
<br />
NetDPS for a shaman that first casts debuff spells is a bit more complicated:<br />
<br />
NetDPS(slowed) = DPS when t &lt; time to cast debuffs<br />
NetDPS(slowed) = {(100 - Slow %)/100}*DPS minus HPS when t &gt; time to cast debuffs<br />
<br />
The time to cast Malos and Turgur's Insects I calculated as 5 second cast time for Malos + 2.25 second recast time + 3 seconds to cast Turgur's + 2.25 second recast time = 12.5 seconds.<br />
<br />
Here are the results for a selected set of spells.  I omitted 10 second heals due to the lag between when the spell hits and when it is cast.  I assume that druid and clerics are healing damage done by unslowed mobs.  I also assume no resists on any debuff spells.  These numbers also assume no focus effects or archtype AA's.  Numbers are times until the tank dies.<br />
<br />
Instant heal spells:<br />
<br />
Cleric, Holy Light - 86.4 seconds<br />
Cleric, Supernal Light - 47.0 seconds<br />
Druid, Sylvan Infusion - 29.7 seconds<br />
Shaman, Tnarg's Mending (unslowed) - 20.8 seconds<br />
Shaman, Tnarg's Mending (slowed, M+T, no mitigation) - 28.7 seconds<br />
Shaman, Tnarg's Mending (slowed, M+T, 50% mitigation) - 15.7 seconds<br />
Shaman, Tnarg's Mending (slowed, BoN, no mitigation) - 130.7 seconds*<br />
Shaman, Tnarg's Mending (slowed, BoN, 50% mitigation) - 33.0 seconds<br />
<br />
*Assumes the mob was reslowed at 90 seconds.<br />
<br />
Heal over time spells:<br />
<br />
Cleric, Holy Elixir - 15.9 seconds<br />
Cleric, Supernal Elixir - 15.6 seconds<br />
Paladin, Supernal Cleansing - 14.6 seconds<br />
Shaman, Breath of Thrushar (unslowed) - 15.0 seconds<br />
Shaman, Breath of Thrushar (slowed, M+T, no mitigation) - 20.1 seconds<br />
Shaman, Breath of Thrushar (slowed, M+T, 50% mitigation) - 14.5 seconds<br />
Shaman, Breath of Thrushar (slowed, BoN, no mitigation) - 36.8 seconds<br />
Shaman, Breath of Thrushar (slowed, BoN, 50% mitigation) - 20.5 seconds<br />
<br />
Conclusions:<br />
<br />
1.  Shaman instant heals lag far behind other classes on unslowed mobs.<br />
<br />
2.  Using Malos + Turgurs, shaman instant healing achieves parity with druids only on unmitigated mobs.  In all other comparisons, shamans are far behind other priests.<br />
<br />
3.  Pre-slowing with Balance of Nihil seems to be a viable healing strategy due to its fast casting time (1.5 seconds), despite the fact that it slows far less (60%) than Turgur's (75%).<br />
<br />
4.  Any healing strategy that relies solely on HoT is unvialbe, although slowing seems to have a measurable impact on HoT power.<br />
<br />
Comments:<br />
<br />
Aggro from preslowing was not accounted for by these calculations, and may be a significant factor limiting shaman healing.<br />
<br />
Resists on slow spells will greatly degrade shaman healing power.<br />
<br />
Druid and cleric coupled with shaman slowing would greatly enhance their healing more so than for a shaman, since neither class would lose healing time to debuffing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nice exercise. Here are a few points to consider though...<br />
<br />
1) Assuming no resist is disingenuous. Heals are unresistable. Malos is unresistable. But neither Turgur nor even Balance of the Nihil are. Even assuming a low resist rate ( say 20% for M+T and 30% BoNihil ) radically change those power curves since additional time spent debuffing is not spent healing.<br />
<br />
2) I don't remember when last I saw someone encounter a 650DPS in an exp group without the benefits of either focuses, AAs or both. This applying to clerics, druids or shamans for that matter. The corollary of this is that you can expect the healers to have at least one of either a mana saving, spell haste or heal enhancing effect going on for them, if not all three. But given that the clerics and druids heals are proportionally larger, they also gain larger absolute bonuses from those focus effects.<br />
<br />
3) Also to consider is the amount of mana involved. Shamans heals are not only smaller... They're less mana efficient. Sometime MUCH less. Yes, we're better at gathering mana than either clerics or druids but canni is an ACTIVE mana regen... we can't use it if we're chain heal, we can't chain heal if we canni. If we can't canni, both classes have us beat, hand down, on the passive mana regen.<br />
<br />
4) An additional set of cases to consider would have been along those line: How long can a cleric, druid or even paladin heal a tank during a 650DPS encounter if a shaman M+T slow the MOB? How long if a Shaman use BoNihil? Or BoNihil followed by M+T? How about a 'chanter using the 70% slow? Or a bard using their 50%? Or a BST using their 65% slow? What if the MOB mitigate THOSE? What if the MOBs mitigate to 'slightly' (25%)</div></div><hr />

Murtak, I think they should sticky your post.  You have done the most comprehensive analysis of the problem to date.  Your numbers are consistent with this exercise and point out the need for a reevaluation of shaman design.<br />
<br />
Gloriana, is it possible to sticky Murtak's post?</div></div><hr />

I agree 100% Crag.  BoN in particular would be profoundly affected by resists.  My numbers represent a &quot;best case scenario&quot; that makes shaman healing look as good as possible, and it is still lacking.<br />
<br />
2) I don't remember when last I saw someone encounter a 650DPS in an exp group without the benefits of either focuses, AAs or both. This applying to clerics, druids or shamans for that matter.

But given that the clerics and druids heals are proportionally larger, they also gain larger absolute bonuses from those focus effects..<br />
<br />
Another good point.  Again, the net effect of factoring in AA and focus effects is to make shaman healing even more unbalanced.<br />
<br />
3) Also to consider is the amount of mana involved. Shamans heals are not only smaller... They're less mana efficient. Sometime MUCH less. Yes, we're better at gathering mana than either clerics or druids but canni is an ACTIVE mana regen... we can't use it if we're chain heal, we can't chain heal if we canni. If we can't canni, both classes have us beat, hand down, on the passive mana regen..<br />
<br />
Murtak has some nice numbers that deal with mana regeneration.  Again, advantage here to clerics and druids.<br />
<br />
4) An additional set of cases to consider would have been along those line: How long can a cleric, druid or even paladin heal a tank during a 650DPS encounter if a shaman M+T slow the MOB? How long if a Shaman use BoNihil? Or BoNihil followed by M+T? How about a 'chanter using the 70% slow? Or a bard using their 50%? Or a BST using their 65% slow? What if the MOB mitigate THOSE? What if the MOBs mitigate to 'slightly' (25%)<br />
<br />
I did a few analyses I didn't report, including slight mitigation.  The most important point, I think, is that slowing has a disproportionate affect on cleric and druid healing power because they incur no time cost when their healing benefits from a slow cast by another player.  Of course, a shaman would gain some healing benefit if another player slowed while the shaman healed, but since all shaman heals are underpowered to begin with, the effect is still least for a shaman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A couple of quick numbers (these apply for 30 second fights only)<br />
- If the MOB mitigates Turgur's to &quot;mostly&quot; and the shaman is the only healing, slowing is not worth it if you need Malos to stick it reliably.<br />
- If the MOB mitigates Turgur's to &quot;mostly&quot; and you have a cleric healing for you, using Malos+Turgur's on every MOB and assist healing the rest of the time increases cleric healing by 50% overall (thus adding a shaman has the same effect as adding half a cleric).<br />
- If the MOB mitigates Turgur's to &quot;partially&quot; it is only worth it to slow said MOB if the cleric cannot keep up with it unslowed.<br />
<br />
And thanks for the praise Gardeltron. :D</div></div><hr />
