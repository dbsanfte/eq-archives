I may be riding on the short bus here, but I was always under the impression that Malo was unresistable.<br />
<br />
Got resisted in PoV on a golem yesterday, thought that was strange.  First resist in probably a thousand casts.<br />
<br />
Is Malo resistable?  If so, does it get resisted often in higher end encounters?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kialan Lecariuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If it is true that made Malo resistable by some mobs, I'm crying nerf. /sigh<br />
<br />
First slow, then malo? No way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Malo is completely unresistable, or was for EVERYTHING pre-PoP.    It very well should still be unresistable in PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am pretty sure I got a resist (or two or three) on Vindi. But, I was drinking heavily that night so I may have been dreaming :)</div></div><hr />

You probably had Malosini cast rather then Malo; it is indeed unresistable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Got log?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&quot;What rolls down stairs alone or in pairs <br />
rolls over your neighbor's dog? <br />
What's great for a snack and fits on your back? <br />
It's Log, Log, Log! <br />
<br />
It's Log, Log, it's big, it's heavy, it's wood. <br />
It's Log, Log, it's better than bad, it's good! <br />
Everyone wants a log! You're gonna love it, Log! <br />
Come on and get your log! Everyone needs a Log!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">lol! I'll check to see if I have a log tonight. Like I said, I was heavy into the Guinness that night (not a good move on our our first Vindi raid), so I am pretty sure Snacko is on the right path :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grromp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don't have a log myself, but am POSITIVE that it was Malo, and that it was resisted by a plain old golem in the wastelands in PoV.  You know, the ones that look just like Geonids?  Wasn't named, just a regular level 62.<br />
<br />
Guess I should look into it more, since a lot of others think it was a mistake as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Trylan_Error</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I read on the mage board that a mage got mala resisted, in PoV. Perhaps they broke the spell with the last patch?</div></div><hr />
