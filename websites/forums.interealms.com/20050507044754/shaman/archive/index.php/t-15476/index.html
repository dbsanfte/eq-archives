<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone else noticing this on there servers? The price of, well, everything seems to be at an all time low on xev at least. <br />
<br />
People buying ebay'd plat? Farming like mad? Increased droprates?<br />
<br />
<br />
Fungi on xev - 35k ( 6 months ago I sold one for 75k )<br />
Most level 65 spells can be purchased for 10-15k if you wait long enough.<br />
<br />
Gotta be the increased droprates/named spawn. Loot from BoT is flooding the market. GSoT can be purchased for 3.5k. I am selling vengance II daggers from droga for 8.5k, and i'll have to lower my prices soon. Copper hammer/Bloodsworn sword ~20k each and dropping ( THESE WEAPONS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DROPPING 2 EXPANSIONS AGO lol ) Zones like chardokB and the quality of droppable armor coming out of there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ornate armor is flooding the market. <br />
<br />
Did sony finally snap under the weight of the whiners for more loot to become easily accessable?<br />
<br />
<br />
Similar on your server?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes and no. There is only one guild on our server that is into PoTime and thats Triton.<br />
<br />
I haven't really noticed anything out of the ordinary, just that most of the higher levels of my guild are in HoH and BoT getting the items you speak of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If people were farming ebayed plat, prices would be going UP, not down.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing it's the other way -- most PoP zones, where all the XP is, is pretty poor for actual sell-to-vendor cash loot.  Heck, I was out at the golems in PoValor for a couple AAs this weekend and pulled in around 200 pp in actual cash loot.<br />
<br />
I pulled in almost double that in an hour in Fungus grove duoing in the Shik'Nar royals area.  If the two of us hadn't needed a shard, though, we wouldn't have been there.  PoP is good for player-to-player loot but not so much for putting coin into the economy.  Less coin = lower prices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ahh good point on the farmed plat. <br />
<br />
Must be the increased droprates. Gear is flooding our market.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Prices have come down big time on my server (emarr). for a second i thought this was really bad, then i realised the stuff that always sell for high price is stuff from 3 and 4 expansions ago and that the people selling them so high are the scumbags of the earth and dont deserve a break.<br />
Seriously why should you have to pay 60k for a 3 year old fungi or 75k for a 4 year old cof, or over 100k for some crappy boots from tormax. <br />
<br />
Its time the prices come down to earth where they should have been 2 years ago.  I think ornate played a large part in this but dont overlook the fact veksar nurga droga and chardok b were just as large an impact on the economy adjusting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ive noticed a drop in the price of some items, but many items are starting to go up in price again.<br />
<br />
Tae ew mail was down to 8K about a month ago and is now creaping back up to the 10 to 12K range.  Heiro cloaks were at an all time low (that I have seen) of 9K 2 months ago, but are now back up to 15 to 20K.<br />
<br />
Spell prices have dropped a bit...I saw Torpor on sale for 30K a few weeks ago.  Lowest price Ive ever seen.  Quin still sells for 100K</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vahnisia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As soon as school starts up again and kids are not on all day, items will get rarer again and prices will go back up. It's just a matter of the season. A month from now and all will be back to normal until Christmas break.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">the massive influx of ornate armor is destroying the economy at the moment.  Any armor will be rock bottom priced right now - even if it's good stuff.<br />
<br />
For example: Veteran's chain leggings - nearly on par with Ornate Chain - price used to be 30K solid... now I can't tell the damn things for 25K... people don't look at the stats or the benefits - they just want Ornate *bright flash of light followed by a golden glow around the word ORNATE*... it's a status symbol I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Market on tons of items appears to be crashing on Terris.  I notice that weapons in particular are much lower than I have ever seen (I am a troll GM blacksmith, so I keep a close eye on the midrange weapons market in particular-I cannot move my main products at a profit right now).  <br />
<br />
Personally, while I think Droga/Veskar have something to do with it, I think that the biggest culprit is Star Wars Galaxies leading to lower demand because of people taking time off EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">SWG has certainly drawn away a number of folks in our guild.<br />
<br />
I think prices have been due to crash for a long time.  I never understood why they were so high to begin with, except that we had a few people on the server who were flooding plat into the economy and jacking prices up.  <br />
<br />
The economy isn't &quot;broken&quot; - that's an impossibility.  It simply changes, as all economies, real or virtual, do.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, Chuk is right and it's probably high time from a player's point of view.  <br />
<br />
The bazaar jockeys aren't happy, but so what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>eleon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">om... have you seen the nice focus efects on the ornate :p... I am looking to buy (or loot) the boots, legs and arms ASAP. I have the bracer (FT2 is nice), and the helm (no more acumen except when underwater). I am not sure the BP is better than vindi's BP, but has an &quot;ok&quot; clicky.<br />
<br />
As to why are prices falling... they always fall. As people get levels and farm more and more &quot;good&quot; items, the prices always drop. Remeber the servers are not getting any younger, and I no longer know anyone that is not at least level 55 to 60 if not already 65. <br />
<br />
To be real, ornate is going to be bottom end cash loot soon, as more and more people break time, and/or the next expansion comes out with even better loot, and you will not be able to give the ornate away. I know on BB, the price for the orntate silk hat is down to 6 to 8k already.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Two big keys:<br />
<br />
Availability of ornate going up for the slightly less then high end players<br />
<br />
Very very nice drops from revamped zones for the mid level players. There was a huge weekness in availability of items at those levels that is being fixed. <br />
<br />
Haven't seen rune prices drop significantly, they've been pretty stable for the past few months. 8-60k depending on spell. <br />
<br />
And complaining about 100k for tmax helm/boots? Damn cheapest I've ever seen em is about 180k and I thought that was a fairly good deal on Torv.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Some things have really gone down - tae ew armor, for example - but other things are still expensive. Tae ew tunics were 20-25K when I first started looking at them. I think they were down to around 12K when I had mine made by a guildie. Now they are under 5K. But, I'm kinda thinking this may be due to increased drop rate on the blood. We did a short little raid into CT a couple weeks ago and came out with a full stack of blood, whereas before you'd be lucky to come out with 5 or 6.<br />
<br />
Shaman spells havent come down much though. Quiescence was 60-80K, Focus of the Seventh is 45-50K, Blood of Saryrn, Malos, and Ferine Avatar are all in the 10-20K range. And the Kunark versions of these spells are still equally as expensive (or much higher in the case of Avatar - the least useful of the bunch).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">my server is really screwy (FV), malo been on sale for 3 days for 34k (wish I had the plat for it!), avatar for 13k for a week, never see torpor, malos was 70k, didnt last that long at that price, have yet to see Q for sale, primal avatar lasted a day or 2 at 60k, never seen Fo7.<br />
<br />
but besides shaman spells, I have noticed items in general have come down a lot in price in recent weeks. I attribute it to places like chardok b, and droga and such, not so much an increase in drop rates, just more spots to get drops from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Did sony finally snap under the weight of the whiners for more loot to become easily accessable? <br />
<br />
Typical anti-casual one liner.  About as constructive as:<br />
&quot;all raid players are anti-social loot whores with the ambition of a sloth, physique of a hog and social skills of an HIV positive leper with bad breath&quot;.<br />
<br />
Go go, stereotyping! :)<br />
<br />
On the upside, economy on A Ro is getting the smackdown, which is good for buyers.  Picked up malo (20k) and Q (20k), both funded by selling spells I made via spell research.  I don't raid whatsoever so I'm overjoyed that the new 61+ spells + ornate finally provide a droppable alternative to raiding for those that play 1-2 hours tops at a time.  I may even have to change my sig, things have been looking up. :P<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jebeksis Stormcaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Why is this a new thing? Prices for almost all items (with exceptions for ones that don't drop in game any more, etc) tend to drop over time as more of them are in circulation on the server. Or, in the case of spells, as a larger percentage of the people who need that spell (for instance, all the 65 shamans on your server) have it, the potential market to which someone could sell a particular 65 shaman spell becomes smaller. Yet 65 spells keep coming into existence at the same, if not an even greater rate (most likely at a greater rate than the creation of new 65 shamans).<br />
<br />
It's been like this since the game started. Remember when it cost 1k (or more) to buy canni3?  61-62 spells went for 10k+ soon after PoP was released, but now people can't even be bothered to loot ethereals. <br />
<br />
The absolute &quot;best&quot; items have always seemed to go for a couple hundred k, regardless of era. It's just what those particular best items are depends on what the most recent expansion is (ie, the best items come from the most recent expansion, replace the previous best items at the top of the price list, and driving down the price of all old gear).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Economy on BB is screwy, from what ive seen almost all of our 50-60 spells are going for twice as on other servers.<br />
<br />
Not bad prices on 65 spells though, Quin/Malos/7th all around 10k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Sure, prices drop over time, but lately its just been extreme.<br />
<br />
The economy has been dropping rapidly on my server.  For example, we were looking for AOW hats for our 2 warriors for a while.  I'm sure we could do AOW but we dont seem to have much luck convincing other guilds that they should just wait for me to get all 20 of my guildmates online to kill him.<br />
<br />
Anyways, for months there was one on sale for 250k.   Then suddenly there was one for 120, we grabbed that... then 2 weeks later there are 5 of them on sale for around 100k.<br />
<br />
I guess as more guilds are entering elementals these are being replaced and people are just trying to get rid of them.<br />
<br />
My guild made a lot of money selling blood runed battlewands... selling them for 100k or so.  Now we cant move them for 50k because casters can buy spell haste 4 on their ornate boots for 5-10k.<br />
<br />
There is also market saturation issues.<br />
So like the Thunderous Drum of Karana - the bard drum from South Mid in Bastion of Thunder.<br />
<br />
Before the &quot;upping ornate drop rate&quot; patch that drum was rare as hell.  My guildleader had one of 3 on my server.  We were overjoyed when a guild grp had one drop for them in January and they gave it to our guildleader.  When the drop rate was upped there were a couple for 100k+ in the bazaar... last night there was 1 for 9k and 5 others for only slightly more.   There are only so many bards... so you have a huge price drop.<br />
<br />
Same goes for spell prices... more spells are being made than there are people to use them.  Particularly ethereals, I can't really think of what to do with them anymore.<br />
<br />
With Veksar, Droga, Chardokb and the opening of BOT/HOH and more people with tactics access there is a lot of high end, newer, droppable items for sale too.<br />
<br />
and plat is just easy as hell to make these days.  <br />
<br />
I think there are 3 main reasons that the EQ economy is in flux right now. The drop rate increase on ornate and items in BoT/Tactics, the introduction of new items in chardokb, droga, veksar and the progression of players upgrading droppable loot from past expansions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think its many thing but something not mentioned is 60+ faction in old world. JBB was 20-30k on my server for last 8 months or so but drastically dropped since xp changes. People are going back old world like seb and getting AA's while phat lewtz. (JBB now 12k Fungi 40k)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">my server is really screwy (FV), malo been on sale for 3 days for 34k (wish I had the plat for it!), avatar for 13k for a week, never see torpor, malos was 70k, didnt last that long at that price, have yet to see Q for sale, primal avatar lasted a day or 2 at 60k, never seen Fo7.<br />
<br />
Hehe, fo7 is for sale today, only 55k.  Malos for 60k, and torpor for 50k.<br />
If you'll remember, though, FV got an enormous influx of new players as soon as school let out.  Waaaay to many are people looking to take advantage of the no drop rules, which dont matter as much as you might think.  Saw Q once, of course it was our local plat retailer (you know who!).<br />
Just more players in the economy now across all servers than previous summers, it'll calm down some as soon as school starts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>cahyre kitty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">On Torv I saw this with a warrior friends weapon. Greatstaff of Thunder was a well respected weapon and sold for around 120k. We saw it at 85 and then and then 50 in one week but few were available if any. I helped fund the purchase at 35k. Two days later it was at 10k. Now 3.5-5k. The weapon is worth every plat at 35k. But 120 k - 3.5 k in 2 weeks??<br />
<br />
That I think is the greatest extreme. Overall everything I sell is dropping in resale value each week though.<br />
<br />
Spells seem to be holding though - Malo and Torp are holding at 30k (dropped from 40k with spell research), Q was 85k last I saw and I've seen it at 95 and 100k. Pox sold in 2 days at 25k. I cried as I want it badly. On the other hand my spare copy of Bane sold at 4k, which is half the price I paid about 2 months ago and it didn't sell for a week at that price. Needless to say I'm at no hurry to hit 65 as I can't buy the spells anyways.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Here's the scoop on the economy of EQ.  <br />
First, Ornate is such nice armor that everyone wants it.  There's a high demand for it among everyone who's not in a top end raiding guild.  Given the prices of ornate, it's making a lot of raiding guild members rich.  Riches buy these sort of people nothing.  You can't even ebay pp these days for any kind of money.  SO, they are wasting it on tradeskills.  This removes pp from the economy for good, thus making a MASSIVE pp-sink which is currently draining plat outta the economy faster than it's incoming.  Quite a bit faster in fact.  Therefore, less plat available to people for discretionary use means lower prices.  <br />
<br />
Supply and demand.  Supply of ornate isn't quite enuf yet to meet demand.  Supply of pp is dwindling.  It's a great market if you're selling ornate, tho.  <br />
<br />
Also, that VII dagger is incredibly easy to get.  If people knew how, it would be cheap as **** in about two weeks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Notgurck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The bottom sure fell out of Quellious' economy.. I just figured some kids had finally learned to dupe.  I doubt Sony would care, if it doesn't affect short-term profits it doesn't exist as far as they're concerned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Prices have been dropping like mad on The Seventh over the last 2-3 weeks mostly due to ornate.  The rare kunark spells have dropped because of Chardokb and even the 65 spells have gone from 100-120k down to 25-50k.  All this in the past 2-3 weeks is pretty amazing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I am not sure the BP is better than vindi's BP, but has an &quot;ok&quot; clicky.<br />
I had Vindy before I won an Ornate BP roll.  I wasn't sure if it would much of an upgrade, but I love right clickies.<br />
After the first 5 minutes of having it, I can't believe I wasn't sure if I wanted it.<br />
I love spending zero mana and about a minute of casting time to completely haste the 4 tanks in group as well as my pet.<br />
It's absolutely amazing how useful it is.<br />
For the loss of 5hps (My Stamina is maxed out without buffs even) and a few resists and a minor 2hp? regen, I gain free right clicky haste that saves me about 300 mana per target per half hour, and I also gain 85? more max mana pool.<br />
It's a no brainer.<br />
Get ornate asap and love it.<br />
I can't see myself rolling on anything to replace for a long long time (considering my guild is in the ele planes, that's saying a lot).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Krenk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Good, it's about time that things are becoming affordable to the average player. I too think it's due to the increased amount of content, and not really any changes in drop rates. Tradeskills can now actually make quality items for the mid range game, and dropped items compete with those which lowers prices overall.<br />
<br />
SOE also (supposedly) banned off a lot of the duplicators and ebay farmers out there. About a year ago, they had a very serious problem with massive amounts of duped plat on every server. It was covered by even the &quot;major&quot; news organizations, such as CNN (which is where I read about it).<br />
<br />
Look, there's no way to make 100k pp from mob drops in a *reasonable* amount of time, without exploiting or duping. It just never was possible, nothing in this game drops that much plat/gems. Ripping people off on trades is the only &quot;legit&quot; way this can happen in game.<br />
<br />
Removal of duped plat lowers the inflated prices we've had to live with. Spells should never have cost such insane prices, especially one's that people outlevel for better spells. And I think that they still need to come down a lot on certain spells, since they are only useful for a few levels in the life of a character.<br />
<br />
Four things have driven prices down. Lower subscriber population as many people have moved on with life or gone to other games. Better trade skill items. More content adding more items. And lastly, there's more people in the high end game, and guilds are no longer putting a choke hold on the rarer drops. You know the one's, those elitists who horded certain items and spells, even going so far as to destroy them, while only letting one or two out for auction every once in a blue moon.<br />
<br />
If you want prices to stay reasonable, then when you find an exploiter or ebay farmer, get them banned. They're the people who ruin the overall economy by flooding it with cash. Flood it with items, prices drop. Flood it with cash, prices skyrocket.<br />
<br />
Heck, the good stuff is all no drop people. You guys don't need massive amounts of cash to float your boat. And it's the casual players who end up getting shafted the worst by absurdly high prices.<br />
<br />
Maybe one day, EQ plat won't resemble pesos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">If you know where certain items come from, it totally makes sense why the prices are droping hardcore.<br />
-Every time I've gone down into Tactics, there's been some bard or necro farming piggy.  He drops one of 4 items that are very decent items (war crested ring, 31/28 2h slasher, 28/30 1h slasher knight weapon with stun proc, and tactician bulwark?) and possibly runes?  Piggy has a relatively short spawn time of 30 mins - 3 hours and drops something every kill now.  Hail farmage.<br />
-Ornate drops a lot.  On average, with a full group clearing mobs for xp, you'll get an ornate drop about once per hour.  That's a lot of new good armor entering the world.  There's usually about 1-3 groups doing xp in Sol Ro on any given day on Brell.<br />
-Veksar loots.  Campable names.  Necros own this dungeon.  The armor is just a bit less quality than ornate, but it's tradable for when you get a better upgrade on a raid at some point.  There's so much new stuff entering the world from this place.  Why pay 100k for tormax boots when you can camp some boots with ~40hp ~40mana for free instead?  *boggle*<br />
-Bot named.  There's lots of other gear entering the world from BoT.  Single group killable named mobs that spawn every 6 hours that drop loot every time now.  That's a lot more loot being around.<br />
-More easy raid targets.  You have mobs that are killable by 4 pickup groups that drop weapons better than Tunare drops.  You have other weapons and armor dropping that are on part with Vex Thall gear.  This gear is no drop, but since it's so easy to get, you don't need to buy the other tradable gear out there, so it's demand drops, so it's price drops.<br />
-Cultural armor.  Aid Stupid's earring quest is making everyone a smith capable of making cultural armor.  The armor is good.  The market is flooded with it.  You can get 25ac 30hp 30mana bracers for about 4-5k.  Other armor slots are also rather cheap.<br />
-Fennin Ro cycle has a lot to do with Rune Prices.  You get about 15 runes in 3 hours spawning Fennin.  You get a rune just about every named kill in PoFire, and there's about 9 named you can farm every 3 days.  That's nearly 25 runes being looted every 3 days by some guild or another.  It doesn't take very long for a guild to fill up spellbooks of guildies and recruits.  The rest enter the open market for MQing.<br />
-Aid Stupid's earring quest is gobbling up huge amounts of cash.  I think one of our guildies estimated it costs about 500k to get the tradeskills up to do his quest.  LOTS of people are doing this quest.  That plat that used to be out there is being destroyed, instead of being spent on items.  Less plat available = lower prices.<br />
<br />
Of course with stuff like this, the price of items is dropping fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Notgurck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Of course it makes sense that over time, prices on particular items will drop; nobody's arguing that.  I think what incited this post is how fast prices have dropped - the bottom literally fell out, and on most servers too, from what people are saying in this thread.  The only thing I can think of that would kill the economy this fast is item duping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Naw.  Wouldn't be item duping.  There's just a hell of a lot of good gear entering the world nowadays.  People are trh8skilling and working on AAs and not twinking as much as in the past from what I've seen.  Less need for twink gear.  Less PP to pay for twink gear.  More items around.  More things to raid for gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Heh, prices on some of those servers blow...<br />
<br />
Malos is usually in the 15-20kpp range on Prexus.<br />
<br />
I've seen focus of the seventh for 25k...quiescence for 20k...blood of saryrn for 25k...ferine avatar is 17.5kpp, always a ton of those for sale.<br />
<br />
Of course, I can't seem to sell a 15/24 +6% backstab mod rogue primary handable piercer these days.  But, I did get a mostly full suit of ornate (still waiting on the chest, one up for sale for 125kpp currently) by farming Droga over the past few weeks, so all's well. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Secs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">The thing that ornate is doing, is taking resale value out of armor.  As this game goes further and the average player gets &quot;better than ornate stuff&quot; he can't sell that piece of ornate that he upgraded from.  So the plat that the average person spends on ornate will never be recouped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">well if i farm cash items i focus on &quot;stable&quot; items like funghi. Its been 40k forever and there is no change comming up. Same for Hierocloak or Lodizal. JBB also kinda stable at 15k on ayonae ro.<br />
<br />
All the new stuf drops so damn fast, it doesnt make much sense beeing a reseller anymore. Well if i see a funghi for 25 to 30k from some1 who needs cash quick i sure buy it, but stuff like playermade jewelery / armor just aint worth it anymore.</div></div><hr />

A guildie spent 1,5 million plat on that earring  :p <br />

You make a KILLING selling plat, it is a very common thing on my server (FV) probably because of no no-drop, and SH transfers. Not me personally, but there are a few people who consistently have those high end items selling for 250k+, probably 10-15 mill total in items at any given time, turning around selling that plat for a nice chunk of change. <br />
<br />
I've also heard on other servers it's bigger than ever too.</div></div><hr />

Well it also helps when you have a GM friend. Dont tell me that wont work, i saw it live. We buffed up to kill Klandicar when some ppl un-invised and rushed in. Of course we tried to get him, and did get the kill. 1 minute later (!) a GM was in zone giving us all a warning for KSing. When i spoke to him and asked to be flagged for lead admin he refused to do that. WHen he took the nodrop stuff from us (the neckpiece) i again asked if i can spek to Lead Admin. After a few mins i got a tell: the warning has been removed from your guys accounts. it was like 1 PM CET and your chance havinga GM online at that time are like zero, but having a GM online and comming to you almost the second klandis corpse hit the ground is a laugh.</div></div><hr />

This is so not true.  There are always spots where you can do that in a single weekend.  Used to be the maze in CT were a single group could farm 250 k in a day, now you have BoT where you get about an ornate an hour, for a similar take.  It's just the question of knowing where and, sometimes necessary, giving up on some exp (especially in CT).  But you can make cash without the need for exploits.  And if you listen to people coming out or a weekend in SolRo with a half dozen ornates you know why the economy is taking a nose dive.<br />
Oh yes, and /rude Oreen, 12 kills, no pants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I think he is talking about generating 100k in actual cash (i.e. how actual plat pieces enter the game) rather than camping items that sell for plat.  As I understand it, a lot of the actual plat came into being through tradeskill macros.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS&gt; I hate ornate legs.  I Spent sizeable DKP on Yttrium legs from Seru just before they upped the ornate drop rate, thinking I would not see an upgrade until elemental legs (far, far away for me).  At least they look spiffy (chain graphics on luclin troll models looks like total ass).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Things arent too bad on Karana, where the majority of the population is level 65 characters. Fungi is still 60-70K, but many of the lower items have come down. REIF is 6-9K, Torpor and other spells are all over the place, from 30K plus. Although there are some half wits on that server no doubt. I cant argue with my REIF that cost me all of 400pp :). Thanks to whatever trader made that mistake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Good, it's about time that things are becoming affordable to the average player. I too think it's due to the increased amount of content, and not really any changes in drop rates. Tradeskills can now actually make quality items for the mid range game, and dropped items compete with those which lowers prices overall.<br />
<br />
SOE also (supposedly) banned off a lot of the duplicators and ebay farmers out there. About a year ago, they had a very serious problem with massive amounts of duped plat on every server. It was covered by even the &quot;major&quot; news organizations, such as CNN (which is where I read about it).<br />
<br />
Look, there's no way to make 100k pp from mob drops in a *reasonable* amount of time, without exploiting or duping. It just never was possible, nothing in this game drops that much plat/gems. Ripping people off on trades is the only &quot;legit&quot; way this can happen in game.<br />
<br />
Removal of duped plat lowers the inflated prices we've had to live with. Spells should never have cost such insane prices, especially one's that people outlevel for better spells. And I think that they still need to come down a lot on certain spells, since they are only useful for a few levels in the life of a character.<br />
<br />
Four things have driven prices down. Lower subscriber population as many people have moved on with life or gone to other games. Better trade skill items. More content adding more items. And lastly, there's more people in the high end game, and guilds are no longer putting a choke hold on the rarer drops. You know the one's, those elitists who horded certain items and spells, even going so far as to destroy them, while only letting one or two out for auction every once in a blue moon.<br />
<br />
If you want prices to stay reasonable, then when you find an exploiter or ebay farmer, get them banned. They're the people who ruin the overall economy by flooding it with cash. Flood it with items, prices drop. Flood it with cash, prices skyrocket.<br />
<br />
Heck, the good stuff is all no drop people. You guys don't need massive amounts of cash to float your boat. And it's the casual players who end up getting shafted the worst by absurdly high prices.<br />
<br />
Maybe one day, EQ plat won't resemble pesos.<br />
<br />
hahahhaah you my friend need to stop smoking crack... if my shaman was 65 i could guarantee you i could make 100k in a day.. which used to be equal to 600 bucks.. now worth 200 bucks.. but yes it was possible and no EQ didn't ban pp farmers... as for dupers.. show me the story.. i highly doubt that SoE caught dupers..because i believe the only duper ever caught had a GM helping him..</div></div><hr />

forget about lvl 65 spells such as Q and the like ... they are charging just ask much as torpor sometimes, about 25-37k  makes me wonder how they expect to get new shamans to replace thier leaving members ...<br />

The thought I always have when I see these outrageous prices on our spells is: you know if you or I were grouped with that person they would expect us to buff them with those spells. And if we didnt have them, we'd be looked down upon. You cant touch focus of the seventh on my server for less than 50K. I dont have that kind of money and never have - I have maybe 14K and that's a lot for me. Quiescence was 80K last time I saw it. Blood of Saryrn I think was in the 15-20K range. Ferine Avatar has been sitting at 17.5K, and I think Malos is the cheapest of the bunch somewhere around 10K. I dont have any of my 65 spells yet - dont expect to get them anytime soon either. I guess I'll just keep collecting spectrals cause I still need some of my 63-64 spells. I'll probably end up with half a dozen copies of Cripple...er..I mean, Tears of Saryrn.<br />
<br />
Kinda reminds me of those commercials;<br />
<br />
Focus of the seventh: 50K<br />
Quiescence: 80K<br />
Talisman of the boar: 25K<br />
Blessing of Replenishment: 30K<br />
Getting the non-shamans to realize it's better for them if we have our spells: Priceless</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, this is true.  <br />
<br />
He's not talking about selling stuff to other players.  At any moment some loon could pay 100k for any particular item.  He's talking about actually killing mobs for plat and sellables that result in hard cash which enter the economy.  That's how plat gets created.  <br />
<br />
It's not the best way to RAISE plat of course.  But that's why the price of ornate can drop from 50k to 5k, whereas a sapphire sells to a merchant for a specific price.  <br />
<br />
Pre-kunark there was a period when plat was &quot;worthless&quot; and everything decent was &quot;trade only&quot; - and 7kpp was considered a ton of platinum.  Only the dwarf kiters in Butcherblock had lots of plat back then.  <br />
<br />
And the guys who were the best at farming lower guk.</div></div><hr />

Costs can really vary. If your trying to do it as quickly as possible it can easilly cost that and more. Personally total cost for me couldn't have been over 200 k and i've made all that money and more back with the trade skill that I gained.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">The level of impatience of a player wanting the earring is what affects how much it costs.  (FYI I don't do trh8skilling so I don't know the specifics of these example, just generalities)  For example, in raising your smithing, there's a few ways to work up your skill.  One of them involves farming acrylia from the dungeon of the same name and making arrowheads.  You can then use those arrowheads to make arrows for increasing fletching.  The acrylia is free in that case, and you save money on fletching.  On the other hand, there's an enchanter on Brell who's paying 50p each for swirling shadows.  Making shadowscream? armor is another way to increase skill.  In this case he's got enough money to make other people farm the stuff he needs so he can save a lot of time.  Another example I can think of is making othmir fur caps vs making those robes for the solstace earring.  Making fur caps is cheap but requires farming othmirs.  Making robes is expensive but doesn't require farming I don't think.  Time vs money invested.  The cheaper you want to do it, the longer it will take you to acquire the stuff on your own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Notgurck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Making robes is expensive but doesn't require farming<br />
Actually making the robes is supposedly a nice way to skill up in the 100s and low 200s - you keep the hard part (the chain) on a failure, so you don't lose much and have a shot at a skillup.  It's when you start succeeding on them that you need to look for another, less expensive way ;)</div></div><hr />

I have noticed that lots of items or falling in price though, I dont mind, as it means i can actually afford some things :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Economy always revolves around demand and supply. So price is altered by one of these factors. <br />
ABout the ornate droprate, solro was changed so as to have 1 drop/half hour. But hate to say I believe it has now been nerfed. Not sure yet. Rune drops and spec drops were increased in bot, as well as the population at the highend guilds already have their spells obtained so there are more spells to sell. Which means cheaper prices. Annoying kinda but thats the economy for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Stuffu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">The economy on Ay ro has crashed...no other way to put it.<br />
Lodi Shield....as low as 10k<br />
JBB...... as low as 11k<br />
Tae ew shield.......2.7 k<br />
Bracelets of (might, beauty, etc).....can't give them away.<br />
Can't give most armor away, and few weapons are selling.<br />
Hadn't thought about the ornate armor aspect at all, but that can't be the primary reason. This was not a gradual drop in price....this drastic fall in prices was the result of absolutely no one buying anything. No ones buying newbie gear, no ones buying mid lvl gear, high lvl gear is selling only for give away prices.  Part of it....the shared bank slot....why buy 3 pairs of silver chitin handwraps for your 3 melee's when all you need to do is put it in the bank and log on your alt and get it from the bank (not bashing the slot, i love it, but it is partially to blame). Another part....SWG....the geeks have left in mass (i bought it too, i know i know).... Another aspect...ever check out the number of vendors at night....maxed at 500 by 1 am central time. Everybody's selling....no ones buying.....and mostly selling junk at that. Also....the kiddo's aren't in school....24 hours in a day...no responsibilities...24 hours of eq time :). Then you got the ornate armor. If you have plat now...go wild because these are some unheard of prices. Anyways, it's good to know that this isn't just happening on our server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">I blame ornate armour for the dramatic decline of the rest of the economy (I agree to the decline).  I know it is about all I am interested in anymore, and I have bought about 4 or 5 pieces now for my shaman and my dru....errr warrior.  I have not lowered my prices on my trader's stuff as I am guessing it is a temporary thing and can always take a bath latter if not.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">I have one piece of ornate armor which I got myself in a group in BoT. I did a search in the bazaar for 'ornate chain' out of curiousity. Came back with 1 guy selling an ornate sleeve pattern, and 2 other people were selling multiple pieces of ornate chain armor (the crappy player made stuff) for 15-20K. Lame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Actually when you think about it...Lodi shield was overprized anyway. i think that the prices drop to a level they belong to. Lodi shield never was worth 15 to 20 k. 10k is just about right imo. Same goes for JBB. it has no stats, 9 sec casttime and cant be used below 45, so 25k was WAY too expansive.<br />
Look at the really good items, the price is stable. Funghi tunic = 40k since i play EQ. One of the best items out there, and even if its just to PL ur alt. Hierocloak...one of the best droppable cloaks...stable at 12 to 14 k for over 1 year. CoF etc...stable at 35 to 40 k for years.<br />
<br />
Why buying ornate crap for you chars when elemental playermade stuff costs almost the same and has WAY WAY better stats ? i dont know who designed the items, but those guys must have been complete idiots. Ornate silk robe for necs is worse then my kael robe, go figure. and the ornate silk robe costs like 90k, while elemental robe costs 35k and has better stats</div></div><hr />
