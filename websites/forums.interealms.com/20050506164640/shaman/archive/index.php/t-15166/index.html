<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vivala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello Fellow Shammies,<br />
<br />
I'm currently in the shard market,  i'm trying to get the acrylia caverns shard.  I know about the spawn at the zone in from Grimling forest, but he is usually uber camped.  I have tried in the jail area by the white gate,  I have never seen anything but the standard grimling bloodguards, and the caster types spawn there.  Is there a place deeper in that the sanctum bloodguards, or any other shard dropping mob spawns?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help,<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It drops in inner acrylia, a lot. It is very easy to get now. Getting to inner acrylia is harder than getting the shard. The entrance is where the priest cycle spawn was/is. Click the statue. Bloodguards all over the place in there.</div></div><hr />

Getting there is harder than getting the shard.  Easily soloable for a 60+ shaman.<br />
<br />
Get to Acrylia caverns.  I've heard of spawns near the zone-in dropping shards, but I believe they are very rare drops there now.  The gate area mobs used to drop them frequently, but from what I was told that has been changed.  If you go through the gate area and into the castle area by clicking on the thing on the wall, just whack bloodguards in that area (you don't even need to wander really, just pull the the area you were ported too) until your shard drops.<br />
<br />
It took me an hour or so to get there (had never been to the zone before), dragging a low 50's cleric friend with me.  Once inside AC, another half hour or so to get to the right part of the zone, and then another hour or so to get both of us our shards (and there was another group in there at the same time).<br />
<br />
Very easy overall if you have someone to guide you there, but not too bad even if you don't.  I made it with second hand directions w/o too much aggravation.  Definitely download the IG map for the zones you need to travel through, and including AC itself.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />
