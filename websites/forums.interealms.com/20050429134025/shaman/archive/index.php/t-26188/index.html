<br />
Warriors though, are absolute awesome tanks in dungeons, good aggro holding, and just tough overall, glad we have two level 60's.<br />

Supposedly pallies got a small reduction in their dps when a skill was fixed.<br />

Paladins suck because they don't do anything particularly well other than stay alive.  I gave up the solo PVE game because even before the dps nerf it was too brutal to play.  Imagine soloing a cleric in EQ and you can imagine what it's like to solo a paladin in WoW, only worse.<br />
<br />
In addition, unlike your warrior, pallies are horrible at single target aggro. We've had to get creative to make our crew work with a paladin tanking. So you have a class that deals the lowest dps in game, is not a good tank due to aggro issues and is pretty much just boring to play.<br />

See my forthcoming thread on paladin healing for a silver lining to the generally cloudy paladin world.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Indalecio Galronte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This leaves me terribly vexed. While it hurts the solo game some, the real pain of this stems from PvP built Paladins like myself. Again, most Paladins who actually are trying to kill something in PvP are heavy Retribution, for them Seal of Command is there bread, butter and secret lover. Getting high agility and crit gear was key because your weapon crits went up and your secret weapon got more powerful as well. Burst damage is the only way we could beat most other healing classes (most Paladins can't play the mana war). It's sad but I'll suck it up and play test the changes when they go live myself before making a final decision. Luckly my Paladin is brushing up against 60. Gogo gadget twinked alt.<br />

Once again, with feeling:<br />

Paladins are NOT the lowest dps in the game.   That special slot is reserved for druids.<br />

I'm sorry that paladin DPS sucks, and was made worse by the fixes/nerfs.  But if this sorta of statement is repeated often enough, people might start believing it.</div></div><hr />

What a troll. My crew is still beating every instance we come across, we're just not doing it the traditional way.  We're going to head into BRD shortly with only one char above 55. We don't kill fast but we are pretty much unkillable with 4 healers (3 in plate) and 3 DI's ready to prevent a wipe. <br />
<br />
Anyways, my complaints about the ongoing paladin issues doesn't change the fact that I keep having fun or I'd quit already. So take your trolling elsewhere, thanks.<br />

Okay, give me druid dps numbers in the low 50's. I'll tell you mine:<br />
- 1h/shield + seal of righteousness or crusader = ~60-70 dps<br />
- 2h + seal of command (prenerf) = ~80-100 dps<br />
- 1h/shield + any other seal = ~30-40 dps<br />
<br />
The only time I can break 100 dps guaranteed is with a huge pull so that I can take advantage of my AE. Otherwise I need a big string of crits. I think starfire alone beats my dps and if you throw moonfire on top of it forget about it- and that's just off the top of my head.<br />
<br />
So yes, I stand by my statement that paladins are the lowest dps in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My problem with this type of change is it further dilutes the way paladins are played. The guy above said... good thing that paladins get something more out of int...<br />
<br />
He obviously doesn't understand retribution paladins....<br />
<br />
<br />
Think warrior light. You Go with AGI gear for 2 reasons... it increases your chance to crit with regular attacks AND command, and it increases your chance to dodge....<br />
<br />
Now it increases your chance to crit with regular attacks... and does nothing for command, and increases dodge.... see the nerf?<br />
<br />
It actually makes it HARDER to get good equipment because now there are instead of 3 stats to juggle... str sta agi.. you have to juggle str sta agi and int.<br />
<br />
Furthermore... The largest problem is that it pushes paladins into role where players that play them already did not want to go. People play paladins as holy warriors.... not holy period.<br />
<br />
Right now paladins are basically playing the priests of their groups...<br />
<br />
We are a tank class....<br />
<br />
They have lost their vision.</div></div><hr />

Actually those numbers are pretty close to my 52 shaman for sustained dps. I use a 30 dps dagger with shield and a 40 dps staff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Pretty similar to my shaman too.<br />
I was in ungoro the other day, in the ape tunnels.<br />
There was a 56 paladin there, and I was in there too.<br />
We each were killing every 2nd mob.<br />
We had the same kill speed.<br />
I think I could get 2 in a row at times, but then she'd get 2 in a row when I had to drink back mana.<br />
Can a shaman burst damage better?  Hell ya.<br />
A shaman isn't going to tank nearly as well though.<br />
It's called balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think people are misunderstanding my complaints about paladin dps.  I have no problem with paladins having lowest dps in the game- they can take a beating par excellence.  The problem I have is that for aggro, dps &gt; all.  So if you lower paladin dps significantly you're essentially lowering a paladin's ability to tank significantly as well, leaving them with... well, whatever you can eke by in terms of niche.<br />
<br />
Low dps also wouldn't be a huge problem in the solo PVE game if soloing were fun.  Okay, I don't kill fast but I'm not getting hurt either. The problem is that soloing as a paladin is mindnumbingly boring.  Unless you're fighting undead you essentially cast a seal every 30 secs and then just go afk, taking you roughly 45-60 secs per even con mob.  That is not entertainment- it is punishment.<br />
<br />
Those are my issues- I don't want to do huge dps. I just want to hold aggro and have a fun solo PVE experience. No more, no less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Still Iz, have somone in your gang power level up a warrior, then you can all play the classes you wish, and not worry about tank not having aggro. In the upper level instances, you need to have very, very strong offense, and if a tank cannot hold aggro, your rogue, and your shadow priest are going to get their  crap handed to them really quickly. The wandering abominations in strath for example, got a crit hit on my rogue for 1517. These are not bosses :)<br />
<br />
No paladins really forced the horde to have a much better warrior ratio. No warrior, means no guild raiding for us, period. I love our warriors, too bad they are useless in pvp, but heh they have other characters they are working for that.<br />
<br />
Get a warrior, your entire outlook on this game will change for the better.</div></div><hr />

Congrats on completely missing the point of my post.<br />
<br />
Get a warrior, your entire outlook on this game will change for the better. <br />
My outlook on the game is positive, it's just negative on the paladin class specifically. I love WoW to death.  My only long term concern remains the same issue I had with EQ, the herding of everyone into a single playstyle at level cap (raiding). The game remains loads of fun regardless.<br />
<br />
As far as warrior goes, nah, we can beat all the instances so long as our new paladin MT is willing to be awarded all the plate tank phats from here on out (and so far he loves it).  My rogue and our 3rd paladin's hunter will eventually replace our current paladins on days when we can convince our shadow priest to heal.  Really a warrior isn't needed- I feel bad that the Horde has part of the Holy Trinity rearing its ugly head already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">You still haven't been to the big instances though man, if a plate class cannot hold aggro on several targets at once, and hold aggro with two rogues dealing full out adrenaline rush/BF damage, you are going to struggle greatly. We had two full on combat 60 rogues in last raid, we rarely got aggro, and feinted it off when we did. We dropped critters amazingly fast. Usually the rogues kill the non-elites quickly, then turn on the elites.<br />
<br />
If Paladins are as bad at getting and keeping aggro as you say, you will get stopped cold. A rogue, or a hunter is useless if they cannot contribute massive dps. When you have 3-4 57 + elites and 4-6 56 + non-elites in a pull, and in the middle of it old Stiches comes up and wades into the fray, making people fly all over the dungeon, hitting your rogues for 600-1500, a plate aggro holding beast is what you need.<br />
<br />
I just do not know if Paladins are really as awful as you say, if they are, then you are in for some rough lessons in class diversity.<br />
<br />
On a side note, got some lightforge armor, seems like would be awesome for a pally, warriors grabbed it, okay for them too, not too hard to get to really once you learn the places. Killed the crimson hammersmith, gonna be pretty tough to 5 man that before they make strath changes.<br />

At 43 my average DPS is 40-45.  I don't have any numbers for lvl 50's but for a lvl 60 druid, 100-120 DPS is average.<br />
<br />
For a real world example:  2 weeks ago at lvl 43 I was fighting the lvl 43, 44 Naga in STV.  I would cast my 10min thorn buff and it would *always* wear off on the 5th mob.  So about 2-2.5 minutes to pull a mob, kill it, heal/med and find the next one.  I did this for about 2 hours.  <br />
<br />
The 4 or 5 people (friends/guildies) that I talked to all killed those mobs MUCH faster at that level.  Two of those friends were paladins who indicated that it took between 30-45 seconds to kill those mobs...and they were unhappy because it was so slow.<br />
<br />
Not trying to **** on your thread, so I'll bow out now with an agreement to disagree.</div></div><hr />

No, actually you didn't. From this very thread:<br />
<br />
Anyways, my complaints about the ongoing paladin issues doesn't change the fact that I keep having fun or I'd quit already.<br />
<br />
Any criticism of any aspect of WoW in fanboispeak = &quot;whining&quot;. I'm still having a blast- I adapt and move on. I'm simply pointing out flaws with the paladin class as someone who's played one 50+. Next.<br />
<br />
At 43 my average DPS is 40-45. I don't have any numbers for lvl 50's but for a lvl 60 druid, 100-120 DPS is average.<br />
Man that is pitiful- I know zero about druids other than a brief perusal of their spells on Thott. I assume when soloing you don't just chain starfire/moonfire, which would account for the really bad dps. I retract my statement that paladins are the lowest dps class in the game- let me rephrase as &quot;one of the lowest dps classes in the game&quot;. Once your kill times on even cons break 30 secs it's an exercise in frustration, no matter your class.<br />
<br />
On the upside, Blizzard has said druids are getting buffed in future patches.  Not so for pallies but oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I have a druid, level 25, I read on the druid forums, somone on the test server testing new druid dps and it is pretty good in cat form, they also get a new ability that is lke evis, 700 something damage for a 5 point combo, should help out druids a good amount. They will not outdamage rogues, but will do pretty damned well.<br />
<br />
The whole Paladin thing, you guys realize, if your dps was bumped up, you truly would, hands down, be super overpowered? I have seen what a good paladin can do, they can take a massive beating, hit back very hard in return, and simply not die. Great qualitied to have, especially in group pvp, which the pve server folks will be doing alot of when BG come out too.<br />
<br />
Of all the classes in the game, the one I really just hate running into in a pvp encounter, is a Paladin. The chance of me killing him is iffy anyway, and the chance of me killing him before swarmed is nil. At least the real good ones, alot of them really are silly people that shield too quick, don't use all of their tricks. The good ones are like running into a brick wall.</div></div><hr />

I gave up the solo PVE game on my paladin before the dps nerfs. It was already unbearable to take 45 secs to kill an even con.  I realize this doesn't address PVP, but I think it's horrendous that Blizzard is unable to separate their codebases between PVP and PVE.  Ruining the soloability of a class in PVE is very bad considering that it's virtually required no matter which ruleset you play on.<br />
<br />
Case in point: if paladin PVP dps is considered too high, fine. Make it so paladin dps is automatically chopped by 25% (or whatever) when used against another player.  Leave it as is against mobs.  Unfortunately Blizzard has taken the easy road of a unified codebase when one size fits all does not work for both PVE and PVP. I think a lot of the nerfs (c.f. mage invis, priest charm, shaman earthbind etc...) should have been PVP nerfs only and left PVE alone.</div></div><hr />

As a warrior, I fight mobs that are 5-6 levels lower than me when I grind.  I wait until quests are green to be able to accomplish them.  Why does everyone in this game think that even con and higher mobs should be par for the course grinding material.  Sure I can beat even cons, typically need a potion, but that sure would be inefficient.  My warlock friends won't even touch a mob that is even con, mostly fighting crap that is +2 to +4 of them... and they have the nerve to bitch that they need some love from Bliz... makes me sick.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Think people use even con mobs because its easier and applies to anyone as they face a mob of the same lvl. Just think its a basis. The point is isnt much surprise with pally dps even on blues. <br />
<br />
At lvl 60 I run around and kill all kinds of mobs alot of blue and its still take me a  good bit of time to kill things. <br />
<br />
BUt once you start comparing non even con mobs it changes to quick. If you fight a mob 4 lvls under, 3 lvls under , 2 is all different. Even is even for anyone. Not a birthright</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Btw I'm not adding to the dps complaint. I'm used to it and am not complaing. <br />
<br />
I only got mad when people would say we lived to much when that is our strenght. If i kill stuff this slow i better not die easy which is what i'm doing now. I just think being able to kill mobs my lvl was the tradeoff for taking so long on every every lower mob too. I can kill an even con. But i dont kill one one lvl lower much quicker either. Or two. IS pretty even steven with pallies. <br />
<br />
 My only complaint is the iffy aggro on instances and pvp isnt as fun on my pally. Guess part of the reason made my rogue alt. Destroyed this undead dagger rogue last night. He was effing with me when our pvp status wasnt up. But caught him later and he kept coming back for more. Was sad for him but satisfying from my end. I destroyed him. Never have felt like that pvp on my pally. I live or live awhile but everyone runs if i actually am winning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I suppose so, but just seems unrealistic to me.  Takes me a long time to kill an even con as well, but hunting mobs -5 or -6 and I run through them with no downtime.  DPS rises dramatically on lower level mobs and the time it takes to kill them is proportional to mob level.  So if the time to kill was the complaint ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Sorry mach i might of misspoke a little. You are right some people might feel an even con mob is a birthright. <br />
<br />
Just find some classes do it better than others and to me even is an easy basis but thats jusy perspective i shouldnt impy its everyone. <br />
<br />
MY rogue absolutley destroys mobs the more &quot;blue they get but i struggle more on even mobs. My pally is hard to tell the difference sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">My brother is a 60 warrior, his dps sucks compared to a rogue as well, not even in the same realm, however he was the first to 60 in the guild, hit auto-attack and just relax, he never even used his rage most of the time.<br />
<br />
I remember hunting for cores of earth, in badlands at low 40's maybe? A paladin 5 levels below me was killing the same mobs I was, took him a long time, but he could even take two of them, where two would kill me easy.<br />
<br />
It is all relative.<br />

I recently timed a solo PVE grind session on my rogue because I wanted to make sure I wasn't exagerrating.  My rogue is L40 using 2 blue instance daggers to ambush, then swapping to big high damage mace to tank.  I chose the trogs in the southern part of the Badlands as they are all melee mobs, L39-40 throughout with a named quest L42 mob. No mobs were elite. Melee mobs actually reduce my exp rate significantly because their AC/hps adds a good 6-7 secs each to my kill time and they also wind up damaging me (casters do not).<br />
<br />
53 min grind session:<br />
23K exp (over 1/4 of a level)<br />
2-3g in coin<br />
5 green drops<br />
3.5 stacks of silk<br />
0.5 stack of mageweave<br />
<br />
I once had a bad pull and took on 2 L39's + L42 named simultaneously. Used heal pot, evasion and thistle tea and destroyed them. I typically only bandaged if I got really low or ran out of mobs (usually the latter).  I'd say average kill time was 10-12 secs, which is pretty slow compared to killing casters.<br />
<br />
Biggest problem? Finding enough mobs to feed to my blades. If you've never watched an ambush+remorse grind session you should, it's a lot of fun.</div></div><hr />

So, it seems that I can stop buying new differently focused stat gear and thinking of a new spec, for now. I'm at the least very appreciative for the chance I now have to look at my alternative talent trees and gear dependencies for those trees instead of jumping ship with reckless abandon and praying for the best.<br />

Iz, full combat build will crush an ambush/remorse build in grinding hehe, try it! You actually want adds that way.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure you're right but I'm addicted to the big ambush crits to start every fight. The big yellow numbers just look soooooo purrrrrdy!  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Ya I was impressed with the openers when I tried it, and on casters I would end fights quick and with high dps, on anything else dps went to crap and adds made me need to eat food.<br />
<br />
I just love being able to sustain 400-500 dps in tough dungeons, makes me feel wicked badass. Warrior shout plus crusader procs can be pretty impressive too. I have fairly low attack compared to alot of rogues really, only high 400's at level 60. Strength only + 41 and agility only + 122 or so. Mainhand/off hand listed dps is like 70/50 or something. I whup butt though :)<br />
<br />
Rogues really are fun.<br />
