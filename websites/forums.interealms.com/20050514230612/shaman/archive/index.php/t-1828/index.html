And the idea behind the name is because Druid lo...A **** it.  Ask someone from the druid's grove if you wanna know the reason for the name.</div></div><hr />

edit:  but it is kinda neat why they named it cabbage.  Shows the developers are at least semi-aware of what's going on in the game.</div></div><hr />

Verant loves druids. They're the lowest common denominator of EQ.</div></div><hr />

Why?  Because he's pharming them of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's actually a nice spell. Mass Aego , then people who want mana regen click it off and get the single target version. Good spell to solo also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Seems woody has got rid of the bow ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Krone:  hhahahahaha.  That's awesome.  Wonder how many people sent an email saying 'That's a ranger, you idjit!'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It's a good spell and one of the few realistic requests that the druids made in their ludicrous petition. I'm glad to see that Verant replied in this manner, proving both that they're willing to listen AND that they're not gonna accept a bunch of absolute crap requests. No Flesh-eating Locust spell which is a 2000 pt DoT over 60 seconds or anything. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aidon_Rufflefuzz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Actually PotC was on Test before the State of the Druid was completed and posted.  Both the spell and the State of the Druid were in the works before the rest of the Everquest community were aware of them.  It isn't indicative at all of what Verant may or may not have found to be valid complaints and suggestions from the State of the Druid.</div></div><hr />

All of the 9 ingredients were already part of the new series of trade skill items put in on the same patch.  So this wasn't some massive quest added just for druids.  There wasn't anything really added to make the quest other than a small bit of dialogue and the final combine procedure.  Everything needed was already something made by tradeskills.  Golden Tunare Idol, Star Ruby Encrusted Stein, etc.   They just chose 9 of the harder trade skill items to make, and ones that fit a nice story, and put in a bit of text and a final combine to give out the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Jaradis: ahh...makes more sense.  I noticed a few of the items were part of the new tradeskill recipies but I didn't read through all of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Plus, now that the quest has been solved, the next patch will include an easier way to get the spell (i.e. not tradeskill intensive). Also, the first druid to complete the quest (whose name escapes me) will somehow be immortalized in the quest. Perhaps they will rename the spell Protection of That Druid.</div></div><hr />
