<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Santero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">/clap Verant for all the late changes to tune-up our class, better late than never, but for each step in the rigth direction Verant is walking two steps backwards.<br />
<br />
Please fix the group shrink spells. Return Donlo's Dementia to the game as a SHM 55/ BST 64 G1 spell and upgrade Tiny Terror as a G2 powerful version with buff icon and MGBable for raids.<br />
<br />
Upgrade Talisman of Alacrity as Talisman of Celerity a 60% haste G1 spell or change Talisman of Alacrity as G2 version but with shorter duration.<br />
<br />
And remove the NODROP tag in the Primal Avatar scrolls!!!<br />
<br />
Shamans assemble!<br />
 :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sorry but shrink with buff icon = useless. No one wants to waste a buff slot with shrink. A confirmation box would be another thing. I don't care much if I can't MGB shrink (but &quot;/shout AE shrink inc&quot; would be fun ;)) as long as TGB would work.<br />
<br />
I can't see any reason why our group haste isn't 60%. When I have more then 2 melees in my group I will use talisman to haste them. They have to live with 50%.<br />
<br />
No drop on PA... I don't really care about that. I have PA but cast it only on doggy when I solo in Seb or PoG for cash. Not enough spell gems to keep it up on raid (most melee have primal weapons anyway) or XP groups.</div></div><hr />

Hmm where is the first poster is asking for an icon for tiny terror ?<br />
<br />
I don't see why I can ninja shrink my group and not an other group.<br />
If they need to &quot;protect&quot; the innocent from beeing ninja shrunk, then they can make the damn spell only working on people in your raid !!! You know, the neat feature for the bugged #!$$# flags !!<br />
<br />
Come on !! I don't need a group shrink that is not working outside group !<br />
If I want a group shrink it's not to shrink my group.. it's to shrink my raid !!! and if I want to shrink my raid, it's not for RP purpose or fun or beeing mean with people but because of very poor level design of high end zone that require a shrink to be half playable !<br />
<br />
for the group haste, I don't care..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wildane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">upgrade Tiny Terror as a G2 powerful version with buff icon and MGBable for raidsRight there.<br />
<br />
Heh, they finally add some useful spells to replace those POS specs we had before and still people find something to complain about.  Sure, group haste is broken, but hopefully this patch today will fix it.  Be glad with what you have.  They weren't obligated to do as much as they did.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, now please enlighten me where a group shrink, that is only castable on the group in which you are in, is useful. Please do, I really want to know.<br />
Sorry, but exchanging one crap spell I never cast with another I will never cast doesn't do ****.<br />
<br />
So long<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just can't believe people still complain. The only time we're gonna be using group haste is in Xp groups, when theres not a chanter with us.<br />
<br />
'SOE' (notice I didn't say Verant) has addressed our concerns in this patch, and I for one, am very glad with the changes that they have made. They have listened to us, theres no way that they're gonna give us 60 percent group haste, so please stop asking for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Santero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No drop on PA... I don't really care about that.<br />
<br />
Primal Avatar is now researchable.<br />
<br />
Why a int caster want to research a NODROP priest scroll? <br />
<br />
In the last patch SOE have removed the LORE tag in some of the researchable spell. Verant please fix Primal Avatar.<br />
<br />
 :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Regarding Shrink:  Do you want to be passed from group to group to cast shrink 12 times (twice for each person) or do you want to be passed from group to group to cast shrink twice in total?  Given the choice, I will accept the non-targetable nature of the spell and use it and be happy with it.  Its ALOT better than what it was before.  Perhaps the limitations will keep the cost down.<br />
<br />
Primal Avatar:  I would love to have this spell.  I hope that SOE will make the scroll tradeable.  Perhaps they will not, though.  The point of primal avatar was that it was a version of the spell you could only get in sleepers tomb.  I guess that is fine.  If they do not make it tradeable, though, they should at least kill the recipe so people dont get false hope.<br />
<br />
Group Haste:  Sure hope this works after last nights patch.  I was so excited when I logged in and cast my first group haste.  About 20 minutes later, I was getting tells:  &quot;uh...  this might go faster if you haste me.&quot;</div></div><hr />
