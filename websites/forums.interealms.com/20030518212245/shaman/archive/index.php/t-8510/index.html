<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Laraedus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, I've created a little barb shaman to play with and I'm loving it so far.  So much, that I've decided to go ahead and spend some plat to get him twinked up a bit...he's only level 9 at the moment.  <br />
<br />
I flipped through equipment posts...looked at a few people's things and here's what I've gathered....<br />
<br />
At level 9...it's all about the AC and HP.  I should probably focus on that.  I've got about 25-35k plat to spend.  So far I've noticed that the following is mentioned the most:<br />
<br />
The Iksar Ceremonial regen chest piece<br />
A haste item (either FBSS or the chitin handwraps)<br />
<br />
People talk about a horse but not sure if it's worth it for me at this level.  At least for now.  <br />
<br />
I'd love to see some other suggestions or magelo profiles that fit in my price range.  Thanks for your time!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A lot of my stuff is buyable and it's mostly HP gear, and some of it ought to be in your price range. A few items like the Hiero cloak or BBB might break your bank though :)<br />
<br />
You don't really need a haste item; slow tanking really doesn't become much of truly viable tactic until you get Turgur's at 51. Root and rot is far more efficient at lower levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">actually, I disagree. With the plat that you have available, get yourself a nice weapon(rune etched icewurm fang is about 4k) and a cheap haste item. For the rest of your gear, go for ac, then for hp. At the lower levels, this type of a setup allows you to melee quite effectively. The only way that root rotting would be better is if you get a horse and can have constant kei. As you level up, hitpoints become more important, but before 30 or so, ac is the way to go, you can always switch gear around as you level up.<br />
<br />
The horse is definately the way to go once you stop meleeing(typically lvl 45 when you start using jbb) But you do loose a bit of plat when you sell it back so its nice to be kinda sure before you buy it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree with Slargg on that one.<br />
<br />
I'd get: Iksar BP (5k), REIF(5k), SCHW(3k) and ac gear. Jaundiced stuff (arms, boots, gloves, maybe helm) is good ac, cheap, and useful when you hit 45. That should leave a lot of plat to still get a few nice items that will last you into your 50s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree with Slargg on this one.  If you're going to focus on AC and HP, put it to use and melee.  You need Defense anyway, so best to melee.  I personally didn't have a haste item, but it would have been nice.  I did OK with quickness.<br />
<br />
With the introduction of PoP items to the market, a lot of the older gear that has good AC, HP, and WIS/mana are going much cheaper.  Look for low-plat values that give the best bang for the buck.  Remember, you'll have to upgrade some of it in your 50's anyway, so best not to break the bank on things you won't keep for a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just to let you know, this is exactly how I made my shammy. I picked up a girdle of rapidity(31% haste) and a reif. I meleed till about 43, now I just jbb away. I 2 box a war and my def is just about maxed, will be whenever I stop being lazy and get the last 10 points. I have made a few changes to my gear, mostly selling the old gear for what I payed for it. Here is my gear(definately more than 25k, but you can substitute similar pieces and save a ton. <br />

<br />
I plan on changing a few things to get more hps, and probably doing the coldain shawls, but this is the gear that will pretty much take me to 60+</div></div><hr />
