<br />
Is there a known justification/reason for not rolling it out to the entire player base at once?</div></div><hr />

I presume it's to do with localisation issues. It's going to take time ensuring that everything is translated into French and German.<br />
<br />
With Ubisoft (the European distibutor) being French there is no way they would release it without at least doing the French translation first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>crollub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So the English speaking world is waiting for it to be translated into french and german first before we can go ahead and play it in our native English in England. hmmm....<br />
<br />
I feel sure that this cannot be the reason for not simultaneously releasing WoW in the UK. Good attempt at a shot in the dark though :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it's a horrible flop in the U.S., they can cut their losses by not releasing it globally with all the extra units produced (even though the box, art, instruction manuals cost more than the software and media it's on) and shipping fees to abroad, as well as costs for setting up European servers, customer service centers, etc.  This is Blizzard's first MMORPG, so they might take some caution.  The EU may also have regulations on imported products that require them to be available in more than one language.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>crollub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just been through 28 pages of threads on WoW forums<br />
<br />
Its a regional game<br />
<br />
Aussies play on Aus servers<br />
<br />
East coast america play on EC servers<br />
<br />
Koreans play in Korea<br />
<br />
It aint worldwide gaming!!!???<br />
<br />
lots of unhappy segregated guildies out there....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zillanex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well i guess i keep playing eq1 then, more likely i go back playing anarchy online but as always that is not an option :(<br />
Perhaps i finally play eve that i have payed for way to long considering i never played it :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've read extensively about eq2 since day one, so I know that game inside and out since beta now.  <br />
<br />
But WoW, the graphics alone made me not even want to read about it.  Some like it, some don't.  Feels too cartoonish to me.  At any rate...<br />
<br />
The only thing I've heard about wow is that you can pretty much max a character in a few weeks.... maybe a couple months if you are more casual.  And the thread I was reading on this didn't stop there.  They said that a character could be maxed out both in terms of gear and char advancement in under a month..<br />
<br />
I have no clue why folks would want to subscribe to a monthly game that is &quot;over&quot; in a couple months.  Maybe the thread I was reading was full of crap, but WoW seems like a waste of time to me.  <br />
<br />
Even EQ2, which I know in detail, seems &quot;dumbed down&quot; for the masses.  EQ1, and perhaps Vanguard latter, are really the only two 'hardcore' mmorpgs out there anymore.  Well.. daoc, UO, etc.. also, but nothing with the immense size of EQ.<br />
<br />
If SOE were to start updating graphics and old content in EQ1 faster, while maintaining an expansion every 6 months or so.. I really don't see how any new game will be able to catch up.  EQ1 is just too far ahead and too rich.  <br />
<br />
Really, I guess the only reason for someone to switch is if the 'feeling' of the game was more to your fancy.  EQ2 is close for me... but thats just because its EQ1-like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">EQ is mostly done to a lot of people too.  With each new expansion they add levels or aas that you can max out in ... a few weeks, maybe a few months if you are more casual.  Same deal.  The difference is that people playing WoW will enjoy the process, whereas EQers consider it work.  Which game would you rather play?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">so 20% will be playing eq2, 25% are not interested in WoW or eq2, and 50% ish will be playing WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yea I agree with Karshak_rn.<br />
Or even the real life game. That's the fun one! :-D</div></div><hr />

This looks pretty cool. Boyfriend is installing it tonight on his computer to try it out ... He's finally hung up his War for good. I guess I'll keep chugging along until I find something better</div></div><hr />
