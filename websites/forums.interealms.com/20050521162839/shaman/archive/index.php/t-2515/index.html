It's missing 44 Summon Companion (at least).  It doesn't have Cabilis or Shar Vahl locations.<br />
<br />
What ever happened to the level 50 poison rain spell?  Did that ever exist, or did it disappear at some point.</div></div><hr />

Casting Time:  1 second <br />
Recast Time:  Instant <br />

Mana:  10 <br />
Class:  Alteration <br />
Type:  Single Target Buff  <br />
Max Duration:  27 minutes <br />
Casting Time:  2 seconds <br />
Recast Time:  Instant <br />

<br />

Level:  1 <br />
Mana:  5 <br />
Class:  Divination <br />
Type:  General Purpose <br />

Recast Time:  4 seconds <br />
Actual Effects: Self: Changes Direction to Face North <br />
Description: This spell orients the caster of the spell to due north. <br />
Excellent for those who don't use sense heading often. Used with the /loc system, the first number will increase when you run the direction this spell points you, and the second number will not change. <br />
Also, since the divination spells are used infrequently, but often are life or death (e.g. Invisibility), this 5 mana spell is extremely useful for increasing the divination skill.<br />
<br />

<br />
LEVEL 9 SPELLS <br />
<br />
Name:  Cure Blindness <br />
Level:  9 <br />
Mana:  20 <br />
Class:  Alteration <br />
Type:  Single Target Vision Alteration  <br />
Max Duration:  Instant <br />
Casting Time:  2 seconds <br />
Recast Time:  3 seconds <br />
Actual Effects: Target: Cures Blindness <br />
Description: This spell will remove any blindness effects from the target.<br />
<br />
Name:  Endure Disease <br />
Level:  9 <br />
Mana:  20 <br />
Class:  Abjuration <br />
Type:  Single Target Buff  <br />
Max Duration:  27 minutes <br />
Casting Time:  2.5 seconds <br />
Recast Time:  Instant <br />
Actual Effects: Target: Increase Disease Resistance (19 - 20) <br />
Description: This is the first of two spells that add to disease resistance.<br />
 <br />
Name:  Light healing <br />
Level:  9 <br />
Mana:  25 <br />
Class:  Alteration <br />
Type:  Single Target Instant Health Replenishment <br />
Max Duration:  Instant <br />
Casting Time:  2 seconds <br />
Recast Time:  Instant <br />
Actual Effects: Target: Heal 26 - 33 Hitpoints <br />
Description: Your first heal spell was actually less mana efficient than a buff, but that is no longer the case. Healing is a very important job for a shaman. When there is no cleric around, you can at low levels be a substitute primary healer. Shaman's are very good healers in downtime though, which is where their heals are generally used.<br />
Be careful using these spells in combat. A heal spell taunts a monster very much. If you heal 33 points to a teammate, the monster acts like you just did 33 points of damage to it.<br />
<br />
Name:  Sense Animals <br />
Level:  9 <br />
Mana:  5 <br />
Class:  Divination <br />

Recast Time:  4 seconds <br />
Actual Effects: Self: Face the closest Animal <br />
Description: Faces the caster in the direction of the nearest animal and selects it on target.<br />
This spell is moderately useful until Tracking. After then it is fairly useless most of the time. You may however find yourself using it on rare occasions when tracking doesn't seem to help.<br />

<br />
<br />
LEVEL 14 SPELLS <br />
<br />
Name:  Bind Affinity <br />
Level:  14 <br />
Mana:  100 <br />
Class:  Alteration <br />
Type:  General Purpose <br />
Max Duration:  Unlimited <br />
Casting Time:  6 seconds <br />
Recast Time:  12 seconds <br />
Actual Effects: Target: Set Home/Respawn Point <br />
Description: This spell changes the target's home point (i.e. where they reappear after dying/when they gate) to their current location.<br />
Note: You can bind yourself anywhere. Other targets can only be bound within a town zone. <br />
<br />
Name:  Burst of Strength <br />
Level:  14 <br />
Mana:  15 <br />
Class:  Abjuration <br />
Type:  Single Target Buff  <br />
Max Duration:  18 seconds <br />
Casting Time:  0.5 seconds <br />
Recast Time:  12 seconds <br />
Actual Effects: Target: Increase Strength +20  <br />
  Target: Increase Dexterity +20  <br />
  Target: Increase AC +8  <br />
Description: This update to Fleeting Fury is just as useful as the first. Its low mana cost makes it a great &quot;dying-effort&quot; spell to cast giving you a little more edge with you hammer to bash the monster.<br />
If you are in a group, it wouldn't hurt to give this to the tank every now and then for big fights also. <br />
<br />
Name:  Disempower <br />
Level:  14 <br />
Mana:  45 <br />
Class:  Alteration <br />
Type:  Duration Single Target Debuff <br />
Max Duration:  Instant <br />
Casting Time:  2.25 seconds <br />
Recast Time:  Instant <br />
Actual Effects: Target: Decrease Stamina (10 - 20) <br />
  Target: Decrease Strength (14 - 15) <br />
  Target: Decrease AC (7 - 9) <br />
Description: This research spell lowers your target's strength, stamina, and armor class.<br />
The most powerful thing about it is that it stacks with the Enfeeblement Series of Spells.<br />
This can reduce strength by over 60 with higher level spells.<br />
Careful stacking of these spells can reduce the max damage of the enemy enormously, and in pvp render a melee opponent overweight very quickly.<br />
It will also reduce their max hitpoints, and make them easier to hit.<br />
This spell will stack with Feckless Might or Insepid Weakness, but not Listless Power. <br />
<br />
Name:  Endure Poison <br />
Level:  14 <br />
Mana:  20 <br />
Class:  Abjuration <br />
Type:  Single Target Buff  <br />
Max Duration:  27 minutes <br />
Casting Time:  2.5 seconds <br />
Recast Time:  Instant <br />
Actual Effects: Target: Increase Poison Resistance +20 <br />
Description: This spell will increase your resistance to poison based spells. You will take less damage from and resist more poison based spells with a higher resistance to poison. <br />
<br />
Name:  Enduring Breath <br />
Level:  14 <br />
Mana:  35 <br />
Class:  Alteration <br />

Number of Components Needed:  1 <br />
Type:  Single Target Buff  <br />
Max Duration:  Instant <br />
Casting Time:  Instant <br />

 <br />
Name:  Invisibility versus Animals <br />
Level:  14 <br />
Mana:  30 <br />
Class:  Divination <br />
Type:  Single Target Vision Alteration  <br />
Max Duration:  36 minutes <br />
Casting Time:  3 seconds <br />
Recast Time:  6 seconds <br />
Actual Effects: Target: Invisible to Animals <br />
Description: While you do not have regular invisibility at low levels, this spell is very helpful because regular invisibility doesn’t work against some animals (or undead for that matter).<br />
You can walk freely among animals and not worry about dying with this spell on.<br />
Like all invisibility spells, if you attack, cast another spell, or if the spell just runs out, you are no longer safe.<br />
<br />
Name:  Levitate <br />
Level:  14 <br />
Mana:  30 <br />
Class:  Alteration <br />
Component Needed:  Bat wing <br />
Number of Components Needed:  1 <br />
Type:  Single Target Buff  <br />
Max Duration:  15 minutes <br />
Casting Time:  3 seconds <br />
Recast Time:  5 seconds <br />
Actual Effects: Target: Levitate Off Ground <br />

<br />
Name:  Root <br />
Level:  14 <br />
Mana:  30 <br />
Class:  Alteration <br />
Type:  Single Target Movement Speed Reduction <br />
Max Duration:  48 seconds <br />
Casting Time:  2 seconds <br />
Recast Time:  Instant <br />
Actual Effects: Target: Root <br />
Description: Much like SoW, this spell will help you escape easier. A rooted mob stays in one spot for up to 48 seconds (it usually breaks the root before that).<br />
Also, DoT spells are most efficient when the monster isn't moving. If you root a monster then DoT it, it will do more damage. <br />

 Name:  Walking Sleep <br />
Level:  14 <br />
Mana:  60 <br />
Class:  Alteration <br />
Type:  Duration Single Target Debuff <br />
Max Duration:  1 minute <br />
Casting Time:  3.25 seconds <br />
Recast Time:  5 seconds <br />
Actual Effects: Target: Lower Attack Speed by (23 - 35%) <br />
Description: An upgrade to Drowsy, this spell decreases the rate at which an enemy attacks.<br />
In a typical situation where many party members attack a smaller number of enemies, it is more mana efficient to cast slowing spells on the enemies than to cast haste spells on your party members. Of course, if mana conservation is not a concern, casting both will result in a dramatic increase in melee effectiveness.<br />
This spell begins at 23.35% slowdown and increases by 0.25% per level to a maximum of 32.5%. <br />

LEVEL 19 SPELLS <br />
<br />
Name:  Affliction <br />
Level:  19 <br />
Mana:  75 <br />
Class:  Conjuration <br />
Type:  Disease Based Single Target Damage Over Time <br />
Max Duration:  2 minutes 6 seconds <br />
Casting Time:  2.75 seconds <br />
Recast Time:  Instant <br />
Actual Effects: Target: Damage over Time (126) <br />
  Target: Disease Direct Damage (30) <br />
Description: This is the second in the line of disease spells.<br />
They are slow working, mana efficient, somewhat overlooked DoTs. Over the course of two minutes, this spell will do 120 damage. For only 75 mana at level 19, that is excellent.<br />
Some say the spell isn't even worth casting since it takes so long to work. Try timing how long a monster takes to die while solo and while grouped. I think you'll see that the spell can actually do its full damage. <br />
Not all our DOT's stack, disease will not stack with disease and poison will not stack with poison. BUT poison will stack with disease, so if you cast Tainted Breath THEN cast Affliction it will appear as if they stacked when in fact the last spell you cast overwrites the first (not sure but since it has a immediate damage factor may work the other way around too). This works for all DOT's.<br />
On the other hand, hey can be a taunt and recasting them may save your casters life.<br />

Max Duration:  Instant <br />
Casting Time:  3.5 seconds <br />
Recast Time:  5 seconds <br />
Actual Effects: Target: Attempt to Remove Two Magical Effects <br />
Description: This spell attempts to remove magical effects from the target.<br />
Effects are removed from the top of the effect list (in the top right corner of the screen).<br />
This often leads to complaints that the spell is broken, as you have to cancel all of your buffs in order to remove one harmful effect that was just cast upon you. <br />
You can work around this by casting a short lived buff on yourself before your normal buffs, which will leave a slot open at the top for any enemy effects.<br />
This spell will taunt a mob when cast on them.<br />
This spell will only remove Magic, Fire or Ice based spells and is the weakest in this series. <br />
