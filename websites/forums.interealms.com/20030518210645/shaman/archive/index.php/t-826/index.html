<br />
I swam out around the wall of the town in OT but I can not find him.  Is he a day/night spawn or up all the time?  Anyone have a more precise location on him?</div></div><hr />

You'll round a corner and see him standing against a wall near some pillars. You'll also see a golem in the distance guarding a house. You're out of his aggro range, but have SoW up and go to Galdon invis, then drop invis to do the hand in. You'll do find.</div></div><hr />

Had I gone 10 feet more the first time I would had noticed him around the pillar.  But mainly when I read the guide I got the impression he was up on top of the wall, not 200 feet on land.</div></div><hr />
