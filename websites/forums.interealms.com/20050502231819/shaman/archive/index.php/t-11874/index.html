<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I spent 6 hours today in Gunthak over by the troll fort killing tons of ogres, eruds, gnomes, DEs and humans  for  a quest im working on and didnt get a damn thing. am i looking in the right place or is it just bad luck?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Probably combination of bad luck and poor drop rate.  I've spent about 4 hours total in same spot (doing the pure blood quest three times before they made the combine no fail, for the gunthak gulf water), and saw the oil one time.  <br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />
Slow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I spent about 15 hours around the fort playing my Paladin trying to get a medallion for his spell quests. During that time, I saw 3 or 4 Metallic Oils.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">doh, i found one of those while looking for Gunthak Gulf Water for pureblood quest.  What's it for again?  The one i found I just left there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It is for a quest (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2320) that starts in Ak'Anon.<br />
<br />
It results in a Charm (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=19451) that gives STR and Mana. It gets better with DEX and if your DEX is 200+ it also has Extended Range II.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eatbugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">While I was looking for the injured wolf for the BST 52 spell, I saw metallic oil drop five times from Marauders/Plunderers in two hours.  Since I had no clue what it was for, I left it.<br />
<br />
Naturally, I haven't seen it drop since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I dont know why im fricking torturing myself with this camp. its a chittty charm  which may give me OMG 15 more mana, what the hell is wrong with me.<br />
<br />
Day 2, 5 hours again and no Oil.<br />
Im killing plunderers, pillagers, merauders of all races.<br />
somebody throw me a fricking bone please</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">why not just go for the ivory fang figurine in the mines ? I mean if its that rare you might as go for a dropped item that gives better stats/effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">you're sick Chuk.  Sick.<br />
That charm is one utter piece of ****.<br />
And it's not real.<br />
And you're not having fun.<br />
So why bother?</div></div><hr />
