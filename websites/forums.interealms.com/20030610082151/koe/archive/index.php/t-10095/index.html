  No charge just help to get the items needed. I will provide most of it but I need help in getting the following:<br />
<br />
Nightmare Arachnid Silk..off of Creeper spiders in PoN..2 per try<br />
Innovative bolts and Innovative gears in PoI...2 per try<br />
<br />
I will forage the grease and supply the staffs and make the parts to combine. But it takes a good 2 groups a few hours sometimes to get the silks and PoI is good exp for the other parts.<br />
