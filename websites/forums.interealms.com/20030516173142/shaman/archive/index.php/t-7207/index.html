well - do you already have all the useful AA?  In that case, whatever you feel like doing.<br />
<br />
<br />
See the FAQ at this place for a discussion of AA, among many other shaman things.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>shambo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have all those AA abilities already...just thinking that these mobs in PoP hit harder than the old mobs. So maybe this would help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cailte Canmore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Having an increased chance to completely avoid damage is far superior to a similar increase in your ability to mitigate damage taken.  Put it this way you see a punch coming and are able to either a) duck out of the way ie. avoid or b) tense your stomach muscles to absorb some of the blow ie. mitigate the damage which would you prefer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shambo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I understand the purpose of both. My question revolved more around which of the 2 skills people had experience with. I surely wouldnt be the first time SOE made one particular type of skill work &quot;better&quot; than another. I agree avoidence is much better. It also should enhance your ability to cast during a fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Batuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Combat Agility is a great skill.  You will notice many more misses with CA2 and 3.  You will be able to cast more often since mobs will miss you more often.</div></div><hr />
