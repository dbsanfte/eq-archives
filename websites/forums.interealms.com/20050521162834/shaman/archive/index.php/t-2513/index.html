<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone have a link to a diagram showing which portal takes you to which city?<br />
<br />
Last night was my first time in there so I wasn't sure what to expect.  Thought VI would have had them labled ;)<br />
<br />
Got down in the room, bound myself, then found the one to Grobb.<br />
<br />
Gated back after banking and was trying to figure out how to get back up top to the water so I could head back to my hunting ground.<br />
<br />
Guess what? You can't :eek:   But most of you probably knew that..hehe.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bind on the spires above the room. Gives you full access to Timi Deep then.<br />
As for the portal diagram, I don't have a link, but I could recite them from memory. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hehe..yeah I realize I should bind at the spires now :)<br />
<br />
Actually found someone in the room and asked how to get back up top.<br />
<br />
Guy told me to port into freeport with my feet in high gear and have my arse in tow :D<br />
<br />
Needless to say I ported to Grobb and made that long run back<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
Lesson learned I guess :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Eh, I bound there a bit ago and haven't regretted it.  Having access to 9 places is a lot better than access to only 1 place.  Only place that isn't convenient to get to is velious.<br />
However, that's what thurg potions are for.  I spent an hour this morning getting pottery skill from 7 to 148.  Spent about 100pp doing it, most of the cash spent was between 122 and 148 skill which is optional anyway.  <br />
Gives you a basically free potion to thurgadin when you have the skill and a few lousy drops from either CC or Velks.  I'm gonna hit CC and get a gross of the items I need.  Stackable velium blocks and stackable silks are the ticket.  Then each time you use the potion be sure to spend a minute and make a new one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Did a quick search on google and found this:<br />
<br />
Firepot room thingy site (http://www3.big.or.jp/~room369/eq/guide/firepot.html) <br />
<br />
The text is in Japanese, but you can figure it out with the pictures :).<br />
<br />
*EDIT*<br />
Foudn another Firepot guide, this one's in English :)<br />
English Firepot Room site (http://www.mindspring.com/~balir/eq/firepots.htm)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The EQ Atlas key to the pots is here:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Love the firepot room! It makes working on trade skills a BREEZE!  Forge busy?  Try Halas!  Need to buy grapes? Hop on over to Rivervale!  Mistletoe?  Hit Freeport!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Firepot room is great for me as my system slows to the speed of a turd rolling uphill in Luclin.<br />
<br />
What was funny was when they screwed up a patch and all the locs got messed up. *** am I doing in Warslike Woods?<br />
<br />
What is NOT funny is that Faydedar did rip my Enchanter a new one. Went from FH to less than one bub by the time I could get to a pot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Doh..I thought I had check eqatlas.  Sorry about that.<br />
<br />
But thanks for the link.  Last night as I was running to the room, I was getting nervous the closer I got as I know fayd hangs out there.<br />
<br />
Caught a glimpse of a fire croc out of the corner of my screen and felt my stomach in my throat.  Then I realized what it was.  whew!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>guice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Don't worry about Fay too much. Unless VI's fixed his pathing, he's killing instanious by a guild, or he eventually paths to Master Ranix ( IKS MNK ) and he solos his butt.<br />
<br />
Fay is rarer than Gore and Sev, it seems. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Dunno how rarely fay paths past the pots, but...<br />
<br />
Since binding at the firepots, I've run into Fay twice.  The first time, I barely made it to the safety of Cabilis with half a bubble of health.  The second time I was &quot;lucky&quot; that some poor magician slowed Faydedar down enough that I was able to zone into Grobb unscathed.  On a couple of occasions, I've also seen what I assume to be Fay's leftovers laying in and around the firepot room - usually one fully dressed corpse with half a dozen other naked corpses piled one on top of another.<br />
<br />
Overall, I'd say the spot is 99.5% safe, but be careful or that .5% will pop up and bite you on the ass ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Heh..I thought if you made it down into the room, you'd be safe.<br />
<br />
Now I know why I've seen so many corpses there :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the heads up!</div></div><hr />
