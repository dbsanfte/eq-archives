Melee Enhancements Part 1<br />
New Spell Effects Live<br />
Casino Now Open In Shadowhaven<br />
HEAR YE! HEAR YE!  Check with your Town Crier for new editions of your hometown paper!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
***  AA REFUND  ***<br />
<br />
- Extended Notes 3 and Sionachie's Cresendo have been refunded (More details below).  If you had these bard AAs and were close to 30 AA points stored, make certain that you spend enough points to have 30 or less unspent AA points before you zone.  All AA points over 30 are removed when you zone.<br />
<br />
- Improved Reclaim Energy has been refunded to magicians due to changes with the amount of energy received when cannibalizing their pets. If you have this Magician AA and were close to 30 AA points stored, make certain that you spend enough points to have 30 or less unspent AA points before you zone.  All AA points over 30 are removed when you zone.<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
** Melee enhancements **<br />
<br />
We have been building an enhancement to the melee system, and the first part of it is now Live.  <br />
<br />
The yellow bar now represents endurance rather than stamina.  <br />
<br />
All Disciplines now require an expenditure of endurance to use.  They still have a re-use timer, and they can't be used more often than the timer allows.  <br />
<br />
Disciplines have now been divided into a few different timers.<br />
<br />
We have also added a few of the new melee skills to the game.  These are the skills that do not use the new &quot;opening&quot; system, but can be used without an opening present.  The &quot;reactionary&quot; skills and the opening system will remain on Test for further tuning.<br />
<br />
Warriors have been given a mitigation boost.  This affects all warriors at all levels.<br />
<br />
Monks have been given the ability to dodge blows from attackers behind them.  This affects all monks with the Dodge ability.<br />
<br />
All existing disciplines can be purchased as tomes in either East Commons or the Plane of Knowledge.  To learn a discipline, the Tome must be turned into your guildmaster.<br />
<br />
Several new disciplines have been added for warriors, monks and rogues who are above level 60.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
** Play King's Court in Shadowhaven! **<br />
<br />
Shandeling's Roost in Shadowhaven now houses a game of chance.  To play you will need to buy a King's Court Token.  You then take this token and turn it in to any of the dealers.  Based on what your hand turns out to be, you will be awarded a prize.  The highest hands will return a gold ticket as the prize.  This Ticket can be turned in to win prizes such as a Guise of the Deceiver, Fungus Covered Great Staff, or Holgresh Elder Beads. Good luck to all that play!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
** Items **<br />
<br />
- Purchased augments, that have not been bound to an item yet, can be sold back to Dible Hedledrap in South Ro.<br />
<br />
- Caerlyna in the Bazaar will trade your containers for tokens and will trade tokens for containers.  This will allow player characters to sell those tokens in the Bazaar.  Folks that buy the tokens can then take them to the Caerlyna and trade them in for the appropriate container.  You can exchange most weight reducing tradeable containers for a token.<br />
<br />
- We've changed the +12 Wis on the Copper Medal of Rapture to +12 Int.  Really, we have!<br />
<br />
- We have lowered the minimum duration to 5 ticks on Affliction Efficiency I-IV and Affliction Haste I-IV foci.<br />
<br />
- Timeless Coral Greatsword will no longer claim to be out of charges when it procs.  If you own one of these swords, you will need to petition a GM and ask them to replace your current Coral Greatsword with a new one.<br />
<br />
- Phylactery is no longer useable by all classes, only MAG NEC ENC WIZ CLR SHA DRU.<br />
<br />
- The Delightful Orb of Forgotten Magic now only procs for characters level 35 and above.<br />
<br />
- The following items that had the Invigor effect now have Serpent Sight or Ultravision: Orb of the Crimson Bull, Abram's Axe of the Stoic, Tolan's Darkwood Boots, Mrylokar's Greaves, Singing Steel Vambraces, Crown of Rile, 5 Dose Potion of Wolves Blood, 5 Dose Potion of Fleeting Languor, 10 Dose Potion of Wolves Blood, 10 Dose Potion of Fleeting Languor, Potion of Wolves Blood, Potion of Fleeting Languor, Spiroc Wingblade, Spirit Caller's Boots, Spirit Weaver's Boots, Frozen Efreeti Boots, Ring of the Crimson Bull, Rune Crafter's Boots, Wolf Caller's Boots and Camii's Bracer of Vigor.<br />
<br />
- The effects on Abram's Axe of the Stoic and Spiroc Wingblade are now Worn to activate, not procs.<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
** Spells/Songs **<br />
<br />
- New spell effects!  Just about every spell in the game has been given a new spell effect.  If you have your spell effects turned off, you may want to turn them back on.<br />
<br />
- Fixed the bard AA Channeling Focus.  It was allowing 100% recovery from missed notes in most instances.  We have restored it to the 5%/10%/15% values as documented in the AA window.<br />
<br />
- Fixed a problem with short-duration pets (Rage of Zomm, cleric hammers, wizard flaming swords and such) so that they will no longer dissipate before engaging the target NPC.<br />
<br />
- Reclaim Energy will now return 75 percent of the mana used to summon the pet, 95 percent if the caster has Improved Reclaim Energy.<br />
<br />
- Lull spells with duration less than 5 should no longer be lasting as if they had duration 5.  This will reduce the duration of some lull-type spells to their proper duration.<br />
<br />
- Fixed a problem that caused Protection of the Nine to block Blessing of the Nine.<br />
<br />
- We corrected an issue where the same druid damage over-time spell cast on an NPC by two different druids would not stack. <br />
<br />
- Bulwark of Vie was reducing spell damage as well as melee damage.  It now only reduces melee damage.<br />
<br />
- Eye of Zomm will no longer cause players summoned pets to suicide if commanded to kill the eye.<br />
<br />
- Improved the melee damage on pets focused by Ritual Summoning.<br />
<br />
- The magician epic pet can now Enrage when focused by Minion of Darkness.<br />
<br />
- Increased the offensive capabilities of most pets when focused by Summoner's Boon.<br />
<br />
- We have removed the Stamina effects from many spells.<br />
<br />
- Fixed a bug that would cause issues with pet hit points, and could cause them to be unable to move if their hit points got too low.  This may also address other issues with pets using hit-point boosting items.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
** Alternate Advancement **<br />
<br />
- Extended Notes 3 and Sionachie's Cresendo have been refunded.  If you had these bard AAs and were close to 30 AA points stored, make certain that you spend enough points to have 30 or less unspent AA points before you zone.  All AA points over 30 are removed when you zone.  You may, of course, repurchase these AAs.<br />
<br />
- Extended Notes and Sionachie's Cresendo no longer affects harmful area-of-effect spells.<br />
<br />
- Jamfest has been fixed.  It will now affect the bard's group, not just the bard.<br />
<br />
- The Archetype AA ability Spell Casting Deftness was not reducing the casting time for the wizard spell Harvest.  It does now.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
** Tradeskills **<br />
<br />
- Merchants will not pay more for a tradeskill product than the cost of the components needed to make it.  However, they will still sell those products for the same amount.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
** Zones and Quests **<br />
<br />
- Maelin will now respond as though you have the Quintessence, as long as you are flagged for time.  It is also now possible to receive any of the earlier progression flags, even if you have already earned access to the Plane of Time.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
** User Interface **<br />
<br />
- Tell windows now log the name of the person sending tells in the chat log.<br />
<br />
- Tell windows now blink when a tell is received, even when the window is not minimized.<br />
<br />
- Fixed a problem that caused users some ATI cards to be unable to see the /find path or the targeting ring.<br />
<br />
- We have added a new combat ability windown which allows you to make up to eight hot keys for disciplines and other new melee abilities and displays any current melee effects.  The window can be opened by pressing Alt+C.  The keys are accessible using either the mouse or Ctrl+1-8.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
** Miscellaneous **<br />
<br />
- Added some explanation text to the targetindicator.ini file that help explain how to modify the targeting ring.<br />
<br />

Man, I swear to God, Shaman are becoming the biggest bunch of whiney cry babies I've ever seen.  Damn, &quot;Are we not Men&quot;, or are we Druids?<br />
<br />
If that is the worse thing you can come up with, be happy.  Live with it.  <br />
<br />
How about we look at the bright side, LDoN dots will now take advantage of Affliction Efficiency and Affliction Haste, will be nice to cast Bane for 368 mana instead of 490, in 3.6 sec instead of 5.5.  Now that is a change that will have an impact.<br />
<br />
And, being able to sell back augments you don't need is a plus, not a minus.  Just because the change was made too late for you doesn't mean it is any less valuable to the rest of us, or to you in the future.<br />
<br />
Please folks, take your heads out of your rears and stop complaining just for the sake of having something to post.<br />
<br />
Oh, and is it just me, or is it obvious to all that the sub-65 lvl Shaman seem to be enjoying the game, while the uber 65 with 50+ aa's seem to be the eternal whiners?  Just a casual observation.<br />

Well since the extinguish fatigue effect never did anything before, you have not really lost anything beyond being able to restore your ability to jump.  Redundant effects on different pieces of the same armor set is stupid, but no stupider than the existence of the stamina bar in the first place up until these changes.  <br />
<br />
Its kinda stupid that they make the stamina bar meaningful finally and then remove all the spells that affected it.  Basically they are taking away our old, fake carrot so they can dangle the same one in front of us again later, but not fake this time.  I.E. add endurance affecting spells and make us jump through hoops to get them.</div></div><hr />

Hi.  How in the world can you be congratulating SOE for being lazy enough to put uv straight across the board, without even caring to see whether a suit already has that effect?  Granted, I don't think anyone ever used the boot effect, so you didn't lose anything, but didn't gain anything either.  There &quot;are&quot; people out there who do still wear velious armor you know, and they could have at least put something other than uv on it.<br />
<br />
Seriously, get rid of this pathetic attitude towards people posting on stuff you don't care about.<br />
<br />

<br />
65 shaman complaining about removal of an effect that has exactly 0 percent impact at that level.<br />
<br />
And the statement about removing sta effects from spells I'm sure is removal of old sta bar regen effects. Not character stat stamina buffs.<br />
<br />
All in all looks to be one of the more interesting patches. Can't wait to see what my guild's melee types can do after this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Heh, I wonder if the casino was implemented to suck away some of the millions of duped plat.  Will be interesting to see what they set the payout % at.  <br />
<br />
Plus, I think there is a whinerbot.exe out there somewhere that scours message boards and posts flames about people whining on random threads.  Looks like we have been hit a couple times :P.</div></div><hr />

Granted it is trading a lame effect for a lame effect, but it's still an insult.  The affliction item changes are good, but overdue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it was for both getting rid of plat from the economy, and to add upper end items back into the economy.  A lot of those banned shark exploit and plat dupe accounts had tons of high end tradeable gear, puchased with their ill-gotten plat, which is now forever lost.<br />
<br />
I'll wait to see what the odds are like, but I'm certainly game to spend money for novelty items like a Guise of the Deceiver.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think so... I think it just means if the result's selling price is greater than the cost of ingredients, selling price will be lowered to be the same as the cost of the ingredients.  Sounds like it's designed to prevent tradeskill macro plat generation exploits.</div></div><hr />

HIHI!!  Uh, the guy said that he did 200 hours of faction work that is now down the drain.  The only effect he lost was zing.  He did 200 hours of faction work only for zing?  Oh, wait, no.  He was talking out his ass for no reason in classic Druid's Grove style.<br />
<br />
Also, please point out the part of my post where I congratulated SoE for putting uv on the boots? I remember praising them for fixing affliction focii.<br />
<br />
Yes, I know that people still wear velious armor.  Hell, I still have a piece of it.  But thanks for that information.  But now that you mention it, this change actually makes velious armor better.  Now, you have the one marginally useful effect on 2 pieces, which means you have access to it longer (as you upgrade) without resorting to swapping.  THEY LOST NOTHING, AND GOT NOTHING IN RETURN AND ARE PULLING THEIR HAIR OUT OVER IT.  They aren't saying (as you have) that it would be a nice gesture to put Feet Like Cat on it.  Had they said that, I doubt anyone would have laughed at them.  They are saying 200 hours of faction work is now useless and grinding their teeth in speechless rage over it.  Which is asinine.  Which is why numerous people have come along and said &quot;HI, that's asinine!&quot;<br />

And Gwaeron hit it on the nose, why an across the board change? why not give us a useful effect, would it really have been that hard? Hell right click Levitate or Summon Beer for crying out loud.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Yes, I know that people still wear velious armor.  Hell, I still have a piece of it.  But thanks for that information.  But now that you mention it, this change actually makes velious armor better.  Now, you have the one marginally useful effect on 2 pieces, which means you have access to it longer (as you upgrade) without resorting to swapping.  THEY LOST NOTHING, AND GOT NOTHING IN RETURN AND ARE PULLING THEIR HAIR OUT OVER IT.  They aren't saying (as you have) that it would be a nice gesture to put Feet Like Cat on it.  Had they said that, I doubt anyone would have laughed at them.  They are saying 200 hours of faction work is now useless and grinding their teeth in speechless rage over it.  Which is asinine.  Which is why numerous people have come along and said &quot;HI, that's asinine!&quot;<br />
<br />
Its actually 3 pieces  :p  <br />
<br />
<br />
Pot, meet my friend kettle.  You can probably find him at the Grove.<br />
<br />
First, theres nothing wrong with the Grove, I lurk there all the time since I also have a 65 druid.  Second, thats a rather tame flame :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">- The following items that had the Invigor effect now have Serpent Sight or Ultravision: Orb of the Crimson Bull, Abram's Axe of the Stoic, Tolan's Darkwood Boots, Mrylokar's Greaves, Singing Steel Vambraces, Crown of Rile, 5 Dose Potion of Wolves Blood, 5 Dose Potion of Fleeting Languor, 10 Dose Potion of Wolves Blood, 10 Dose Potion of Fleeting Languor, Potion of Wolves Blood, Potion of Fleeting Languor, Spiroc Wingblade, Spirit Caller's Boots, Spirit Weaver's Boots, Frozen Efreeti Boots, Ring of the Crimson Bull, Rune Crafter's Boots, Wolf Caller's Boots and Camii's Bracer of Vigor.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not gonna mention the boots. But I am upset about the potions.  We already have both uv and iv potions, now we get duplicates, not that anybody ever sold the invigor ones before, but what's the point of 2 different recipes for the same item?  I think I'm more offended by the fact that SOE seems to neither care nor know about their big money making game except for how to get more money from us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Why should you be compensated at all for losing nothing?  They should have just removed the effect alltogether.  Anyway, not worth it.<br />
<br />
The best change of all is that canni now appears to have no spell graphics whatsoever.  I can put graphics on without being constantly surrounded by canni particles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Before I turned graphics off, I used to face the floor and close my eyes so I could canni, after 2 hours of those lights it would be AWEFUL!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">They should of put clicky shrink on the boots!<br />
<br />
Why shamans don't have a clicky shrink item outside VT is beyond me.   BST Get it on there wildlord armor!<br />
<br />
But fixes look sweet.   Finally the 9 stacking problem is gone.   Refunding extended notes is awesome, all the bards I know hated that AA, and you can't get rid of it.<br />
<br />
If only I didn't trash my SH faction AEing in there!  I wanna gamble!</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Merchants will not pay more for a tradeskill product than the cost of the components needed to make it. However, they will still sell those products for the same amount.<br />
<br />
<br />
So does this mean minus faliures that you can sell whatever you make back for the same amount that it cost to make it?  OMG this will make alchemy awesome ...<br />
<br />
<br />
Nope. still only get like 2.9pp back for sow potions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same than canni pet nerf/fix for mages.<br />
They refunded the improved reclaim energy AA that wasn't used in the canni pet instead of refunding quick summoning ..........<br />
Giving ultravision on boots for us and on kunark leggings for rogues just show how hard they about what to give back for old sta buffs.<br />
It just make me wondering if they ever play all the classes and know what they do .......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I haven't played with graphics on for more then a few minutes at a time since my 30s (mostly because of canni). <br />
<br />
I am very impressed with the new changes (although I hate the shiny shield thing for Q). Pox had an awesome graphic effect as did spear of torment, velium stirke, burst of flame (lol just had to try it out). <br />
<br />
Love some of the other classes nuke changes too, but mostly I'm thankful for the canni change. Maybe for once I'll actually get to see what all the spell effects look like. <br />
<br />
Also, making foci work on Bane. Thank you thank you thank you.</div></div><hr />

They got rid of our glowy hula hoop??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">No, I think that glowy hula hoop was what I was referfing too. Annoys the heck outta me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Khelud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Tolan's Darkwood Boots now have ultravision? my blind human ranger is going to be loving that :-) he wasnt going to get that spell for a number of levels...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Kaninfrenzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Canni having no spell effects is good but now it also has no sound. I found the sound marginally useful as it was reassuring that the spell had cast and I could look away while madly hitting my canni hotkey.<br />
<br />
Q is a bit blinding but I find it useful for letting me know when it's down on others for times I need to chain Q someone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I thought that the effect on Q looked sweet, but I've also never had it cast on myself so I don't know how bright it is when it is surrounding you :)  I hate to say it, but I will sortof miss the sound/effect of cannibalize.  It wasn't a good effect, and the sound wasn't good either, but you sure couldn't mistake it for anything else :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Ahh another expansion with something for everyone even shaman get a proverbial bone thrown in as Usual.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">The hoola hoop for Q is not new in this patch, it has been that way for a number of months now.<br />
<br />
Is it too bright? Turn down particle density or opacity, that'll fix it.<br />
<br />
I find it is very useful, since the ring lasts as long as the spell does, if I'm main healing, I know the instant it wears off and is in need of recasting.<br />
<br />
A lot of the new spell effects are pretty dull or lame or out of place, but there are a few (RGC, Burst of Flames, Pox/Ultor, the Slow line, and a few others) which really got improved. I just feel sorry for MTs on raids who are going to be turned into purple&amp;powder blue pyres with all the blast healing they receive.</div></div><hr />
