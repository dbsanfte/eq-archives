<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gulbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all!<br />
<br />
I &quot;flew&quot; through 50-55 using Highkeep as my springboard.  Took like 2 weeks.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I am badly struggling to get out of 56.  I am currently 81% into the level, and no matter where I hunt, it seems like I'm levelling off greens.<br />
<br />
I HATE LDoN groups for grinding, as I never seem to get more than 5% per Adventure so that's not an option.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, LDoN seems to have killed the PoP grouping on EC'I and there are never more than 3-5 people in PoD, PoN, PoJ, PoV, PoS, etc. so getting a PoP group is very very tough.  Everyone is doing adventures.<br />
<br />
I have heard JPF is good at 56/57.  I have never been there though, and am completely ignorant of where to go.  I couldn't find any guides using the search feature?  Decent spot?<br />
<br />
I am ok equipped (2500 self buffed hps, 950 AC, JBB/Horse, no epic).  I use the &quot;tank em in da face&quot; method of hunting.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I have soloed successfully in level 56 at the following places:<br />
<br />
Katta (Bank guards) - 1% per 4-5 kills.<br />
Dulak (Dandolak boat) - 1% per 4-5 kills (but ALWAYS camped).<br />
Togorian Mines - 1% per 4-5 kills (tough fights though - especially against the Troll Guard things).<br />
PoJ zone in/out - 1% per 4-5 kills.<br />
Highkeep - 1% per 6-7 kills (but ALWAYS camped).<br />
Velks - 1% per 5-6 kills (but cant use JBB so very slow).<br />
Scounds in EC - 1% per 5-6 kills.<br />
<br />
Can anyone suggest a decent soloing spot for me?  I don't mind tedious, boring experience grinding if its AT ALL faster than the above zones I have already tried.<br />
<br />
I guess Katta is the &quot;best&quot; place based on the ease of killing the guards and the plentiful amount of them.  Pull with slow, BoN, sic pet, chain nuke with JBB until dead.  Rinse and repeat every 90 seconds.<br />
<br />
Im begging here!  Give me some tips/secrets! :)<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">do what i do...<br />
<br />
get a kei, port to katta, grind it out.<br />
<br />
then repeat:<br />
grind it out...<br />
grind it out...<br />
grind it out...<br />
<br />
katta is the best solo experience you will find, and even though it's dreadfully boring, you either have to suck it up and level, or sit on your bum and stay level 56.<br />
<br />
so the best tip, i hate to say, is grind it out...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Exp is going to move slower and slower and slower as you approach 60 (59 is evil).  I honestly think that gaining levels in the 60's is EASIER than getting through the 50's.<br />
<br />
Adventures don't seem to be that bad of exp for my 50's toon, but I think it's honestly because things go so fast, I'm not staring at my bar every kill to see if I got a %.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You could go into Nadox. Go to EQatlas and pull to the safe spot by the bridge. You can get some pretty good drops.<br />
<br />
Work at the Dreadlands zone line in Karnor's Castle. You can pull 8 mobs back to the zone line easy and can use sow and horse.<br />
<br />
I am currently lvl 57 and I usually try to go to a different spot every day or two just to not get burned out. At our lvls the exp is about the same everywhere soloing from what I can find.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gulbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hey Erny!  I saw you in Katta last night - as I jerked around &quot;looking for a spot to hunt&quot; and wasting the whole night...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Have ya tryed gettin a melee partner for droga or nurga? Not really needed for nurga but would be nice for droga. Mobs at the top of the waterfall werestill blue to me at 56 in nurga, and I think the xp might be better than what your getting. If not the loot most certainly is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I second the post by Eisgeist. Go to Nadox. Take the zone in that is half way down the tunnel between Gunthark and Dulak. Invis past the elementals and run down the lava river. Head up to the right wall when it opens up and you will be standing up alongside the bridge. Go past the bridge entrance until you reach the rocks. This is a safe spot to pull to. You should be getting 1 percent a kill here and they are not too hard. As you become more comfortable with the zone you should be able to venture down the tunnels and pick up the pieces for your blood of nadox spell which is pretty useful.<br />
<br />
Don't forget that you can whack the elementals before you run down the lava river, they are good for xp and you can sometimes get some boots to drop. There are 3 that spawn near the entrance and one below the river that you can use F8 to target when close and then slow it and swim back to the zoneline to fight it.<br />
<br />
EDIT: If you are a barbarian and choose to use this method to get into the open area save yourself some annoyance by casting bear form before you head down the river. It is an awful climb up the wall in barb form but a direct run up in bear form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would think that grouping anywhere would yield better xp and fun compared to soloing.  I find soloing dreadfully boring socially and strategically.  But, whatever floats your boat.<br />
<br />
Too bad you don't like LDoN - I find it to be the best thing that's ever happened to EQ.  Apparently if you can't find planes groups then many others feel the same way.  :P<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gulbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Zhahz - yea grouping is much better I think also.  Problem is I am only available to log in about 2 hours per night, and getting a group in LDoN will always take a long time :/<br />
<br />
PoP zones are great experience.  I can get like 10% in 90 minutes in PoI in an average group.  Just GETTING the group is extremely difficult since very few people are there these days due to LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Gulbane-<br />
I feel yer pain. I'm at the same spot as you (58 currently) on my first character over level 55 and have a whole new respect for the term grinding. Tier2 is the best exp you can find at your level (still .9 percent exp per kill in a full group). You might consider zoning into pos/pov and checking if there are any group and asking to get on the list to replace the slower.  Although if there isnt a group to be had then I just grind away in nadox and dulaks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">1 percent per kill in nadox near the bridge...huh, never heard of this yet.  Will try it out soon.  Can only stomach staying in katta for 2, maybe 3 hours before I get fed up with it.  Can make at least 20% in that time though, more if I'm actually trying.  Having troubles clearing more than 9 spawns (2-3% exp in 9 spawns), despite kei, horse, jbb, and BoN.<br />
<br />
Hopefully Nadox won't be so bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Jaggedpine Forest -  Gnoll Cave ( the BB gnolls, not the brell gnolls )<br />
<br />
Very easy, some cash, decent XP.<br />
<br />
There is a false floor if you take 2 lefts from entrance (if i remember correctly). There might be some see invis mobs on the way but those can be pulled out and killed. Fall through this false floor and land at the end of a corridor wich opens into a large cave.<br />
<br />
There are a few spawns in the corridor and a score in the cave. Pull into the corridors end and let dogdog tank.  Adds are easily parked.<br />
<br />
Horse and JBB recommended for faster kills/more mana but its easy enough without.<br />
<br />
The only way out is via the cave and tons of mobs so have gate up until you get to know the place.<br />
<br />
I found the place very good but it could be taken sometimes. You can also pull from outside but those mobs are lower.<br />
<br />
NOTE: They changed pathing so i dont know how things are there nowadays. This info might or might not be acurate.<br />
<br />
All in all id rather get a group in POP tier 1 for better exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gulbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Tried Nadox last night.  Similar experience as everyplace else.  Someplace different though, which is cool.<br />

Slow spawn rate hurts though - though I need to explore more.</div></div><hr />

I'm almost sure you actually keep making rights until you fall through the floor (not 100%, been a while since I hunted there).<br />
<br />
very easy indeed, yet xp is painfully slow there. at 54 or 55, it was something like 1% every 4-5 kills (I spent a LOT of time here, and think I got less than half a level total-good spot to go while lfg though I'd say, I usually go to Echo and do the archers when I am lfg).<br />
<br />
<br />
IMO, suck it up and do adventures, or solo/duo in PoN/PoD.</div></div><hr />

True, i confused left with right :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Went to nadox the other night to check out the exp rate near the bridge.  Mobs have twice, if not more, hp than bank guards in katta, hit harder, faster, and yield less exp.  In katta, every 4 (sometimes 3) guards yield 1% exp, in Nadox, it is every 5 (sometimes 6) trolls.<br />
<br />
Considering that, katta is the place for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Have you tried the steps leading to the Shrine by the Torg Mine zone?  I zolo'd there from 56-58 and it was fairly decent.  Much less annoying than katta IMO.  There are a good 6 or so mobs here that are all easy single pulls.  They don't hit as hard as the ones near the bridge.  I'd pull with slow, sick dogdog, cast bane of nife and ebolt.  By the time I killed the last (I didn't pull from within the shrine) the first was close to repawning again.  Better cash than Katta since you can get some gem drops.  And IIRC a named can spawn there, but I never saw him.</div></div><hr />

I found this place too late- nice quiet spot. the temple was all single pulls as well if you move up to there as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yeah at 56+ and solo I bet there are few places if any for getting 1% per kill &gt;&gt;EFFECTIVLY&lt;&lt; What I mean by that is useing all your mana .. or it taking 5 minutes per mob.  Even in nadox at the shrine .. sure you can solo the 6 .. add a melee partner and you can solo 10+  I used to do the shrine or the Boats with my 56 warrior and we tore it up .. but I was doing this at 52ish .. Even in Katta which I went to last night .. 4 per 1% sucks and if I did bring my warrior I would run out of stuff to pull at the bank =) <br />
<br />
I know some people cant group .. or don't like to share loot ... or are just anti-social =)  Grouping is still the best exp in the game .. not LDoN but other planes.  LDoN just takes to long .. I enjoy LDoN a lot but I don't do it for exp .. and on top of that I always get more than 5% per run .. you must have your AA's set to 50/50 or higher.<br />
<br />
Your post Struggling badly to get out of 56! Help!! .. get a group =)  It only gets worse.<br />
<br />
ps this is directed to normal shaman .. not shaman who have 6k HP and a 4K mana pool .. Im sure there are spot those people can pull with a better ratio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gulbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Unfortunately I just can't sit down at the computer for 3-7 hours of completely uninterrupted time - which is required for grouping.  With a wife, kids running around the house, etc.  my time if limited.<br />
<br />
I *do* group when I can, however.  I seem to be getting attacked a bit and told &quot;don't be anti-social, GROUP!&quot; but as said, time restraints make that somewhat impossible.<br />
<br />
Either way, I am now 50% into 58 mostly due to soloing.  The above posts (by the folks that have a clue) were very helpful.  Nadox elementals were .5% per kill and easier than Katta guards.  Dulak was great (slow but still steady).<br />
<br />
Now at 59 I have tried The Deep zone in, which is nice, but strangely, sometimes I get 1% per kill, sometimes I get .2% per kill.  No rhyme or reason to it.  I can now do Katta guards so easily that it has become not bad experience.  I can pull 2 or 3 guards at a time, slow each one, and just tank them &quot;in da face&quot; while my JBB mows them down.  1% per 4 kills SUCKS but the quantity makes up for it.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for all the help all!  Any spots for a 58 or 59 shaman now!?!?! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Dulak--deep down the luggald caves.  There is a waterfall and a staircase spirals around it, you can get 61 or 62 here, can actually get 65 in the two rooms after the staircase (but its very slow exp).  I've never seen another soul in this area whenever i've been in dulak either.<br />
<br />
There is basically no loot here anymore, sadly, but occassionally a blue diamond will drop.  Also, spell research components drop pretty frequently.<br />
<br />
Its one of my favorite spots in game :)  too bad its basically all green/lb at 65 :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't speak for you, but I couldn't bare to solo through 59. If I was soloing I had AA on full. Only time I turned on exp was in a solid tier2 group. Made it out of 59 on a good group in pov killing razorfiends. If I were to solo in 59 I'd imagine I would do luggalds in nadox and work on the blood of nadox quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">They've modified nadox in the last couple months so its not as safe in this area as it once was ...<br />
<br />
i would avoid luggalds in nadox solo; at 65 i got 5 at a time in the first area and if i wasnt with an enchanter.... (note: this was me rooting one to split a seemingly double pull and getting the non rooted + 3 friends and then a wanderer showed up out of no where).  They also have a ton of hp to consider good solo fodder.  Not to mention they hit in the 160range--bad news when you get 5. The shrine guards near the torgiran mines zone should still be dk blue to 60 IIRC, and would present an easier and probably faster route.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Sajem -<br />
not the guards, silly.  the nobles and bards and the wanderer chick.  Drop cash about like the guards, but are great solo exp.  If ya get ahead on the killing, kill da guards for plat and the FS shortswords.<br />
<br />
For me (Troll) this was the best solo experience I ever had in the same zone with a vendor (that gave good prices, too!).  I even banked there some, but I would have to zone to drop aggro - hehehe she din't hit ahrd enough to interrupt the banking.<br />

Totally agree....actually what I do is farm plat when LFG. I go to the archers in Echo...make about 250 an hour, not bad AA xp, it's no more than a minute travel time from POK, so not far from anywhere really. With the archers and scounds, I can go afk if necesary with the long respawn, so that's nice too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">56-59 were really dead levels for me as well.  I've been out of game for a few months so don't yank on me for shoddy advice.  I remember spending a bunch of time in either veksar with my standard buddies and also getting the chance to tag along with a 3-boxing expert.  He handled a 65 chanter, 65 sk, 65 cleric group nicely.  Anyways the cool thing about tagging along with the 3 boxer is he took me to Nadox and Droga and treated me as equal.  So exp went by quickly, and I had the frequent chance to roll on decent drops.  Anyways just mix it up unless you get stuck on a camp that really attracts you for some reason, the shop in veksar did that for my friend.  When you are in groups try to establish friends that play at the same time.  Having that day to day group that travels together speeds things up more than anything else.</div></div><hr />

GUYS This right here is the BEST advice anyone can give.  If you read one thing on this topic read what Keman said, over and over if you have to.  Positive exp gain is positive exp gain.  I can't tell you how many times I see people lfg for 2hrs or so when they could have been soloing some crappy boring mob for a total of 10percent xp or whatever.  I know soloing is boring, but is sitting on your butt for 2hrs lfg any better?  Atleast do something that moves your bar.<br />
<br />
Also don't bounce around for 30 minutes trying to find the mob that gives a bit more exp.  Your wasting time, and wasting exp.  Do your best and try not to focus on your exp bar.  It will move som much slower when you stare at it all day.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">The far back of the luggald caves in Dulak (past the waterfall) as someone mentioned is decent.  The mobs past that waterfall area are mostly dark blue to my shaman at 62, and the ones inside the &quot;buildings&quot; back here we all dark blue at 62.  Surely not the best xp, but if you time constraints prevent getting a group it's a good spot.   The gem drops, while not as good as they used to be, are decent.  Unlike the enraged soulstealer spawn, I've never seen these back luggalds camped anymore either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Rotun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">If you have to solo, as a ranger I once did 55 to 60 on the LDCs in Sol B.  Kind of old school, but its good exp.  Should be pretty quiet there now too.  There are something like 9 LDCs and a chance for a very MR stone spider.  As long as you can deal with their DoT, they hit for next to nothing.  Don't bother trying to resist the dot, just deal with it.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">you're pulling from the wrong spot.<br />
<br />
<br />
ACtually, this is the exact spot I pulled.  I probably screwed up the first pull.  However, the luggalds still have more hp and hit harder than the rest of the zone, and, if you were in nadox for exp at 59/60, you'd be better served elsewhere in the zone.<br />
<br />
Have you been in nadox since they put inny in instead of the brood mother?  It has changed a bit.  If you have, then it was just mostly my pulling tactic :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>teccumseh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I'm sure many will find fault in my post, because the zones I choose may not be the best exp or most popular zones.  I can only say that the exp bar is steadily creeping up and I'm not dying that much.  <br />
<br />
As was stated earlier, I wouldn't wait around looking for a group to form, whether it be LDON or planes.  Most of us are donating for KEI, and it's rediculous to pay for a KEI then let it simmer for an hour waiting for an LDON group to form.  Just set yourself to LFG and go solo somewhere.  <br />
<br />
Here are a couple of places I've been visiting lately.  Some folks would say that hunting light blues is a waste of time.  I say, sitting on your backside waiting for an offer to group is even more of a waste. <br />
<br />
Velks labyrinth - There are some tough mobs in this zone, and yeah its an exp grind, but you also get to collect velium (nice cash from bazaar sales) and crystalline silks for tailoring, (you are going to do the shawl quest right?).  Your surely not going to be soloing the upper level, but there are places to get some solo exp at.  <br />
<br />
Dulak's harbor - yeah it can get crowded here and it's a pain in the butt to get too as well, but in recent weeks I have been the only soul in this zone.  In any case, who cares if the ships are all camped, you can still find a spot to set up shop and pull DB and LB mobs damn near anywhere in this zone safely. The PP's were coming in fairly regular and you can gather the medalions and finally fill the charm slot.<br />
<br />
Dawnshroud peaks -  At 57 the rockhopper cave still had DB and LB mobs to pull, and you can stay very busy soloing there.  As I recall DSP is still an exp bonus zone, and flawless hides drop fairly regular for those of you intent on doing some higher level tailoring.  HQ rockhopper hides were also falling frequently and you can knock out some of your lower level tailoring with these and get exp instead of hunting green conning lions in E Karana.  <br />
<br />
City of Mist - I had never been here until I started doing part 6 of the epic, and I entered the zone with more than a little trepidation.  Sure this zone has greens, but there are also LB and DB and if your still working on your epic then you can get the 6 reports collected.  Some decent drops come of the DB mobs in the stable area as well as a fair amount of PP too. I'm embarrased to admit it, but at 57 I've had to high tail it out of that zone on more than 1 occasion.<br />
<br />
Fungus grove - the first mob I conned in this zone was a DB lotus and it killed me.  Yep, call me a wuss, that sucker can summon/nuke and it did so until I died.  Want some excitement while soloing, go try that place out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">My advice is try to get a group in POV or POS maybe even make your own group!!! Making your group seems to be the best way to go. I got my first group off for pov at 57, it seems to be the best you can get. I do not like ldon misions, too much waiting for everyone to show up then for buffs, oops cleric doesn't have kei ... bla bla bla, then the group always breaks up after. The exp isn't bad for ldon, maybe tier 1 pop.  <br />
ok after all that jibberish, my conclusion. I would try for tier 2 a few minutes, no more then go to tier 1 and you should be able to grab a group there, and grind grind grind.<br />
My time is very valuable as I can normally play maybe 2-3 hours a week. I will find a nice solo spot(been duoing wiht my monk lately though). Put up lfg tag, and grind if I get a group great, if I don't oh well keep grinding. Hope that helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Glimugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I would reccomend checking out Grieg's end. Its a bit different from the norms, especially with the random illusions that get dumped on you and dogdog. The loot table so far is pretty nice from what I found and at 54, I was finding yellow to dark blue mobs. Nothing too hard, some casters, some resistant mobs (took a few casts to land a slow). The xp was quite good, IIRC there is an xp bonus for the zone, I got 4 yellow of AA in about 90 minutes, coming in at half a blue a kill. I got about 3 blue of regular XP in 30 minutes or so, wasn't tracking that close, but wasn't too shabby. Best of all though, it was fun and I was gaining.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Hate to say it, but BIG difference between lvl54 and lvl56.  The amount of exp to go from no exp to lvl55 isn't bad at all.  Now do the same in lvl55+ and you'll just start thinking about any alternative to playing EQ period.<br />
<br />
While I was grinding out lvl55, I group with all higher lvl characters (ranged from lvl58-62) in Droga.  The lvl59 mage was making faster exp then I was in lvl55.  Now I had to deal with the Barbarian racial penalty, but I was getting 2% exp when she was getting 3%.  So over an hour or so the difference was sick.<br />
<br />
I'm convinced that from lvl59+ the exp is much EASIER to gain the from lvl55-58.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Actually, I found level 59 to be the slowest xp going. It was definitely the hell level of all hell levels. 60-61 went in the blink of an eye, and 61-65 were just an arduous grind. Don't sweat the amount of xp you get, just make sure you are making progress and don't give up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>paladiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Struggling right now too, in my last yellow of 55 right now.<br />
<br />
I have a now 59 monk, and honestly, 59 is a breeze compared to 55 (and now 56 with my ogre warrior - talk about rough).  My monk's 75% through 59, and I really hardly noticed.  Probably because I had access and requests for groups in new and exciting zones.  <br />
<br />
I'm trying to grind my warrior and shammy to 58 (for LDoN groups with 65 guildies) and I'm hating...no, really hating it.  I'm doing Velks, which is quite simple for me (I can pretty much pull, slow, send pet, auto-attack and go afk until dead).  I pull in around 6%-7% an hour.  I've also come to the conclusion of just &quot;Grind it out&quot; - I skip the LFG game now, just get in, hit spiders for a few hours, and log before I go insane.  <br />
<br />
For extra incentive, I have started the shawl quest. I'm on #5 now, and I've gotten 3 biles just running through GD to Velks (cheer for glowing wurms) and yesterday I hit 75 threads.  Grinding may be boring, but grinding with incentives other than xp makes it a bit more tolerable.  <br />
<br />
Not sure what your guild is like, but I've found offering to help people do stuff like epic camps and such also help xp go by faster.  Offer your services to a monk camping the Iksar Betrayer in Chardok, or a chanter needing their vampire drop in Hate, and not only will the xp be supurb, but your guildmates will love you!  Of course, since camps like this are nightmares, they'll keep asking you back again and again and again.  Sad, huh? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I couldn't agree more with Paladiin. I also did Velks off and on from 56 to 58 and hit the wurms on the way there from PoK. Try to find something that helps you or others such as quests while getting exp. Also if you can find something to farm that gives you some exp. Having two reasons to grind forever makes your head wobble a bit less late at night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Stareff2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">You can decide what you hate worst, being 55 or LDON. I flew through 56 in a week doing crawls and dont think Ill quit until 60. You can hate it all you want but if you want to level, it is the best xp going for now and I tend to make 200ppish per Adven so the pp isnt bad and the chance to pick up augments is good also! Suck it up and get 60!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Personally, I find doing the harder level mobs in Nurga great exp... there is no shortage of pulling and if you set up at the right spots you can be at a bridge point between pretty tough and toughmobs. This way you can alternate when you are LoM go for the pretty tough... when you are ok hit the tough. At 55 you get 3% AA a kill solo and about 1 percent reg exp a kill per tough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Frooaki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Totally agree....actually what I do is farm plat when LFG. I go to the archers in Echo...make about 250 an hour, not bad AA xp, it's no more than a minute travel time from POK, so not far from anywhere really. With the archers and scounds, I can go afk if necesary with the long respawn, so that's nice too xxx <br />
<br />
Curious as to where this spot is located in Echo...where would it be on eqatlases map for instance?</div></div><hr />
