<br />
now that the trolls are gone from Innothule Swamp we have to go elsewhere for those spells, after a few posts this was found<br />
<br />
buy the poison/disease related spells from the upstairs vendor in the alchemy shop next to the bank in Shar Vahl <br />

my thanks to IndyEq<br />

PS I know there is a sticky for spells, but that seems to be about higher level spells &amp; we start going to IS at level 5<br />
