<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi peeps, <br />
<br />
Have a question, which is the best order to cast debuffs to get Slow to stick?  Especially in ToV :)<br />
<br />
From what I understand I think the order goes something like the following.<br />
<br />
Malo/Mala <br />
Tash<br />
Bard playing OOS<br />
Malosi<br />
<br />
Is this correct? also doest it matter what order this goes in? Of course malosi last but the rest unresistable so I am wondering if their is specific order to do debuffs.  also am I missing anything? dont know to much about bards either.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance of any info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Malosini.<br />
<br />
However, Malosini has the same check as Turgurs, so it doesn't matter. I only use Malosini if I am the only shaman there, because it has considerably less aggro and when it lands it makes it that much more certain that Turgurs will land. Nothing spells dead shaman like two resisted slows in a row.<br />
<br />
If you really are the only shaman there, too, you might consider giving JSticks and tash orbs to bards.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Generally i malo as soon as the mob is in range, then the enchanter tashes, then i try to stick malosini ... keeps you from getting too much agro on high resist mobs.  Slow once that's in, though you can do w/o if you get a lot of resists.<br />
<br />
Bard oos is just handy to make things go in easier, but it's not necessary (unless you're in ntov killing dragons i'd imagine)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jbishu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Don't forget you can also tag-team the malXXX duty with a magician. Mages like to feel useful beyond dumping mod rods on the ground :)<br />
<br />
Order is generally:<br />
<br />
*) Annul magic, as situationally needed. Can be done as soon as the MA engages as it is generally very low taunt. Helps to have 2-3 casters simultaneously cast annul in hopes of fully debuffing the mob.  This is a great job to have necromancers, magicians, wizards, et al. do as they are generally not too occupied with the front-end job. Excellent for removing SOW, HP buffs, AC buffs, and damage shields.<br />
<br />
*) Malo/a (malo preferred) and Tash. Can be cast simultaneously or one right after the other, but Malo/a must be cast *after* the dispelling is done. It is very helpful if the slowing shaman casts Malo (see below). Tash may have to wait until the MA builds sufficient aggro. Malo/a has low enough taunt value that it can be done as soon as dispelling is finished.<br />
<br />
*) Bard occlusion. Should be in place when resistable debuffs are applied.<br />
<br />
*) Malosini. If you are splitting the debuff load, have the mage be in charge of Malosini. It's the exact same as the shaman version, but it lets you share the load a bit. You'll know when it lands because you'll get a message that your Malo spell has worn off.<br />
<br />
*) Slow and other debuffs. Hopefully your MA has had sufficient time to build up taunt so that you don't take too much of a beating, but lots of resists will still get you hammered.<br />
<br />
If you are in a zone with mezzable mobs, you can also apply the full set of debuffs MINUS the dispelling on mezzed mobs before the MA gets around to them. It is very useful to have an enchanter who religiously memblurs the mobs if you are going to do this, though, as the mobs will generally run straight for you when mez breaks otherwise. Granted, that's often better than the mob running straight for the enchanter, so taking sacrafice hits might be a good tradeoff in some situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">for HoT we using<br />
Malo<br />
Tash<br />
Malosini<br />
Tugur<br />
<br />
and sometimes bard use OOS / Jstick but usually we don't need.<br />
<br />
When I m only 57+ shaman and that there is no 58+ mage, then I need to Malo + Malosini + tugur then tank the mob a bit even with  an epic'd warlord as MT (well.. maybe it's because bane + pox + epic I throw after slow...=)<br />
<br />
But when other shaman / mage are here, we splitting the debuff.<br />
Beeing the only oracle with malo of my guild, I malo, chanter tash, mage, shaman and me chain malosini till it stick, then free for all shaman with a cleric in group to slow (even a lvl 54 shaman can slow in HoT after all the debuff).<br />
Like that aggro is reduced and I don't have to tank, saving the mana of my cleric. <br />
