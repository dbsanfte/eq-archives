<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seefar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">These are really nice but I am having a little trouble getting them to work.  I followed the posted instructions exactly but when I entered &quot;/loadskins custom 1&quot; it said that it was not a valid command.  I tried it a number of ways (different spacing) but nothing worked, then I went back and tried again without the s at the end of skins.  When I do this is pauses a bit and then says Error loading custom skin, attempting to load default.  <br />
<br />
I went back and unzipped the files again thinking that maybe a file was missing, but it still would not work.  Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
I really hope so because these are wonderful!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont think you can have a space in the foldername.<br />
<br />
1. Create a new folder in the uifiles directory and call it bert (or ernie)<br />
2. Download one of the spellbook zip files (Arcane definately works)<br />
3. Download the spell icons zip file<br />
4. Unzip both of these files in your Bert folder<br />
5. Run EQ and type '/loadskin bert'<br />
<br />
They should then be there.  Apparently some people have had to then reload EQ for it to show the new spell icons and stuff but I didnt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">actually the command is /loadskin<br />
<br />
putting a 1 after the folder name will load the UI and not change your window placement.  ANd you cannot have a space in the folder name</div></div><hr />
