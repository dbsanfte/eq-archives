PLEASE stop crying.  It is really really sad.  Some people are making good points with the Affliction debate.  But in general it's a bunch of cry baby kids that had a good thing for a while and now it's been taken away so they are laying on the floor kicking and screaming.  <br />
<br />
It doesn't even make sense why it Affliction would work with Malo/Turg.  *Shrug* Flame away, I won't even both replying since the same replies have been posted for 50 pages and it's the same 12 people saying the same thing over and over and over.<br />
<br />
Shaman USED to be a good community of folks that rolled with the punches and took these fixes like men.  Now so many here sound like Druids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">/agree <br />
I personally haven't really noticed any difference since the patch, with slow or the malise line.<br />
<br />
What I kill usually doesn't last long enough for malise to wear off anyway, slow always wears off when its running, so I guess I'll need to stick another slow on it when its at 30%...ooo..I think I'll save that mana for a nuke maybe.<br />
<br />
I have never 'seen' this weakness as a class,points of improvements yes, but weaknesses and unbalances, go look at SKs, but then thats a entirely different story.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have played a shaman and posted on these boards for a pretty long time.  We have suffered various minor nerfs and have been overlooked for improvements many times, but I have always taken these things as they come.  I agree with you that this community is definately not what it used to be.  There are far too many whiners now, which is the price we paid for having shamans become a popular twink class a few months ago.  However, I believe this community does have a right to be pissed off about the affliction focus changes.  They came out of nowhere and without warning.  I can accept that the focus effects should never have worked with debuffs in the first place.  What I cannot accept, though, is that they were allowed to work for 8 months, and then were changed back out of the blue.  When a mistake is made and allowed to stand for so long, it becomes a part of the game, and more harm and agitation is caused by removing it than just leaving it in, a la the monk nerf.<br />
<br />
Many shamans, including myself, spent a great deal of time, money, and DKP (raid points) obtaining affliction focus items, because they made us better at debuffing.  I didn't get them because it made me dot better.  A fast casting dot that costs me less and lasts longer is not much of a boon to a raid, but a focused malo or turgur's definately is.  Now, though, all the affliction focus items I have collected go in my bag and only come out when I solo, which isn't very often =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you haven't noticed a difference, you obviously never had an affliction haste item. I notice a big difference with no affliction haste. I won't comment on the rest of the post seeing as that's been well covered elsewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree that doing nothing but bitching about a change has little positive effect, other than allowing the player in question to let off some steam.  If players feel the change is unfair then the thing to do is to make posts or send e-mails to the people who can change it.  If enough players feel the same way, Sony might take notice.  <br />
<br />
Just as a side note, I find it interesting that Gorgos seems to believe that everyone playing a specific class sounds exactly the same, as he infers by his statement about druids.  He also says that some shaman are cry baby kids. So logically, following his example, all shaman are cry baby kids.  Don’t you just love derogatory generalizations and stereotypes?  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Talsondar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">IMHO opinion, the major contributor to the whining about nerfs (the minor ones anyhow) is due to boards like this.  While the crucible is a major contributor to all that is good about the Shaman class, it is also a vehicle for mass hysteria.<br />
<br />
Honestly, its a game, with the the game comes changes and with these changes play styles must also be changed.  I am willing to bet MOST of the complaints come from reading about them and have nothing to do with first hand experience.   How many who are complaining about the focus effect changes have focus effect items?  All of em...I bet not, most of em...maybe...some..probably.  I currently don't have an Affliction focus item so whining about a change that doesn't currently affect me would be of little use to anyone.  Now if I had spent a ton of PP to purchase a focus III or IV item or had spent countless hours questing for one I would probably be a little red arsed, but hey, the changes still affect DoTs right?<br />
<br />
Just an opinion, but I always dread seeing the 8 page threads crying outrage over a change/nerf that everyone chimes in on, even when it has no direct effect on their own playstyle.<br />
<br />
Probably generate some flamage from this, but oh well, if the game changes, change your playstyle.</div></div><hr />

I don't disagree there, but I think the board lends itself to people getting all worked up and crying foul, when the things they are crying foul about have no direct or noticable effect on their current playstyle.  That is the only point I was trying to make, just must not have done a good job.<br />

We are all supposed to agree on everything and take any shaft we get in stride.  We can't upset the man ya know...=P.  And as far as the whiner designation, that may have been a bit harsh, but didn't have a thesaurus handy to come up with anything else.  Perhaps I should have used dissenter, angry mob, something along those lines, eh?<br />

itll be fun  with my malo being 2 seconds longer and my malosini being 3 seconds long and my turgur being longer too. Ill comfort the MA when the cleric misses the cheal cause they are used to it being slowed by then or the cleric when they are oom from having to heal more.<br />

You've missed a point that a lot of people have tried to make though. Most of the people that have aquired these items through hard work find them useless for dots. Extension and haste for dots is useless anyways. Only one still half way decent is effeciency and to a raider even thats worthless since the dots are near useless for raids. <br />

You say the problem with the Shaman class is people complaining about nerfs.  I say it's people posting hypocritical BS like this.   If it's wrong to point out that you disagree with the change then it's wrong to point out you agree with it.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rhaab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Perhaps the focus item change was unjustified, but lets stop acting like its a shaman nerf. It's really a nerf to any caster who uses a non damaging debuff, druids, enchanters, beastlords, necros, rangers, wizzies, shaman etc.... We can drop the &quot;poor me&quot; attitude because we are NOT being singled out here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If they REALLY wanted to nerf us this way, they'd make slow not have disease counters, so we can't cure the melees when they get slowed...<br />
<br />
You think you're upset about this?  How about clerics with manastones that found out that their endless mana was now turned off unless they wanted to fight Orc pawns in WC?  How about the tons of Shammy's who lusted after Rabid Bear to find out our pet would STILL have more DPS?  How about almost every young Shaman's dream of making his fortune in Alchemy, 'cause damn it, no other class can do it?  How about the Wizard GODS who lined up to MB the biggest mobs, turned into chanter wannabes overnight?  And finally, how about every big guild's favorite raid char, the Mage turned into, &quot;sit there and CoH us, kk thks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Affliction focus has changed now and forever.  It's unfortunate that we got hit this bad by the bat, but it's happened to us AND OTHER classes before and will happen again.  We need to adjust and continue....  We killed the same mobs before affliction haste and will kill them afterwards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Rhaab, this change fundamentally affects two classes: enchanters and shaman.  Enchanters have a MUCH longer recharm cast time or mez cast time.  Shaman cannot malo/malos under attack.  How often do druids, BLs, necros, rangers, or wizzies debuff?  Not real often when shaman and enchanters are around.  Maybe the druids a bit on raid level mobs.  Hell, do BLs and wizzies even have a debuff worth mentioning?  I think the BL may have incapacitate.  Snare is so fast casting that it isn't really nerfed.  Neither is slow.  What really hurts us is malo/malosini.<br />
<br />
Do you even play a shaman?  Is it above level 50?  Have you ever had an affliction haste item?  If the answer to any of those questions is no, perhaps you'd best not comment further on this thread.<br />
<br />
PoP mobs beat ass.  Compared to old world mobs, they are raid level mobs without massive hp.  This stealth nerf has reduced our ability to handle multiple mobs by a substantial margin.  Let me offer an example.  I'll pick a low tier mob--the crystal golem in PoV.  I think they max hit about 600ish.  They double attack.  They bash for like 200.  I would estimate they attack about once every 1.5 seconds or so, unslowed.  They can also proc a 375 crystal glass DD.  Let's ignore the proc for now and just focus on melee.  Max melee is about 1400 every 1.5 seconds.<br />
<br />
With CA3, CS3, ID5, and LR5, you can about half that damage.  That's only 54 AA pts.  Let's ignore those for now.<br />
<br />
Assuming about 70% damage--though they usually hit for max without defensive skills and an AC of about 1300--that's about 980 damage every 1.5 seconds--though we need to reduce that as bash takes longer to refresh.  Let's call it 800 every 1.5 seconds.  I dunno what average shaman hp is anymore, but I raid buff to about 5600.  That's about 10 seconds before it kills me unslowed.<br />
<br />
Malo is now a 5 second cast time.  Slow often won't land on PoP mobs without malo (less so in this case, as the crystal golems are easy to slow--however, higher tier mobs are much harder).  Splitting can be extremely difficult if not impossible in places.  With just 2 mobs (and affliction haste not working), that's an additional 5.6 seconds of casting to slow the second mob, assume no resists, and instant recast as soon as spell gems pop.  That's an additional 2400 damage.  I'll leave you to do the math on a 3 pull.  Want to see some more effects?  Try working the numbers on say, a two pull of Kriger giants.  Max hit 782 with a 500hp proc.<br />
<br />
This change has slammed our ability to handle bad pulls quickly.  Apparently, though, we're all just 'whiners' for being pissed about it.  When is enough really enough?  We can't melee past 40, we can't heal worth a crap compared to any other priest class, our slows were mitigated, and now it takes even longer to cast them.  Let's just ignore any effort spent to get these now-nerfed items.<br />
<br />
Pretty much my only response to those of you calling everyone else whiners is . . . (a) call me when you have a high level shaman and know what you're talking about, (b) why don't have a sip of ****.  I think you will find that most of those really upset by the changes are long-term members of the community.  We've rolled with the punches enough.  I suspect most of the older shaman are tired of being the punching bags.<br />

<br />
As for me making assumptions about druids (this will sound cliche) one of the best EQ players I know is a druid and he giggles every time he says:<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember, not all cry babies are druids but all druids are cry babies&quot; <br />
<br />
As he goes on to complain about his 14 manaless DoTs as he's clicking his epic/neck/head/boots/bracer/gaunts, fire works coming out his ass from the free Dots, then throws in his 1500DD with crit3 and performing a 5k critical heal.  For a grand total of 300 mana :)    *psssssst people I use sarcasm quite a bit if you hadn't noticed*<br />
<br />
At least in this thread I have seen a few people that stop and look at it from a rational point of view.  The rest of the people if they are fed up with this and it's the straw that broke the camel's back... Don't let the door hit you on the way out.  <br />
<br />
It's real simple, at log in there is a button called &quot;Delete&quot; target your shaman and click the button, then just agree to what ever it asks and you will be done with this problem forever.  Roll up a Ranger or a Druid or even a BL they are pretty good.  Just remember this is a game and to have fun.<br />

My main is a bard and I have a twink 28 shammy I haven't played in a LONG time.<br />
And I STILL knew that it was a bug that was supposedly in the works to be fixed.<br />
<br />
I used to farm and sell the Coldain Military Wristguard.<br />
I used to /auct their stats and neat-o focus item ability.<br />
When the change hit that had them affect more than just dots I NEVER advertised that the focus effect affected those things because I KNEW it was a bug, and that they had announced they would be removing it.<br />
<br />
Just like if they removed being able to med while on a horse.<br />
<br />
Does it suck because these were very nice things?<br />
YES<br />
<br />
Is it a shock that they actually got around to fixing a bug they had already identified and explained was unintended?<br />
YES<br />
<br />
But they did.<br />
<br />
Was the effect overpowered in it's bugged form?<br />
I HAVE NO IDEA. (I'm a bard, my shammy is too low to notice much)<br />
<br />
I hope they DO give it back to you for a gameplay reason and because it's just more fun for you.<br />
But I don't understand why there is so much fuss, as if it's a high level betrayal, about them getting around to changing back a bugged effect.</div></div><hr />

Yes yes and yes. You don't get to assume that just because someone disagrees with you they are automatically a &quot;n00b&quot;.<br />
My point wasn't that the change didn't suck, or that it wasn't a nerf. Just that it isn't a shaman nerf. Mages have pretty much the same line as our malo, so they are affected also. Just about every other caster has an affliction spell that no longer works with the focus. The change may be unfair or unwarranted but its a nerf to everyone not just us.</div></div><hr />

Tell you the truth, I have never fought PoP mobs without affliction haste before. Singles are no problem of course. But now it is much harder to pull off a successful 2 or 3 mob pull. It results in more deaths or possible wipes. I most likely won't risk a slow with no malo because I won't be able to malo and slow with direct aggro like I used to. So more people will die, there will be more wipeouts, and advancement will be slower. Maybe that's what they wanted.</div></div><hr />
