<br />
EX: If you clear Aary and all of the remaining dragons that are up save Lord V (some still not up yet /rude randomizer) and leave NToV to head back in the next day or so to finish them off once they pop - are they fair game to a guild that has not yet killed Aary?  <br />
<br />
Does your server have an &quot;unwritten&quot; code of conduct with regard to this?<br />
<br />
Curious what others think of this.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

That's no longer the case and it's a FFA.</div></div><hr />

Whoever is there and kills the dragon, gets the loot. Although some guilds will have deals so as to not both be in the zone at the same time, it isn't uncommon for there to be multiple guilds in NTOV.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ToV is now one of the most crowded zones.  Zoned in once recently and there was 150+ in there.  East and West wing were being farmed and we were in North to do the ring of untuned Vulak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ojuillean</div><div class="date">05-07-2002, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks guys - I was curious to see what other servers do.  I guess Emarr is unique in that (until last night at least) it's commonly been an accepted practice to stay out of NToV if you are not capable of killing Aary (or have not yet done it).  <br />
<br />
It's also been kind of a courtesy to not go into NToV once Aary is dead unless you verify the guild that killed him has no plans to go back and finish off the remaining dragons.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for the responses.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nildian Forestblade</div><div class="date">05-07-2002, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On RN the two major guilds that do ntov on U.S. time alternate. Ascent one of the RN ubers used to do ntov but now has moved on and does SoL almost exclusively. Though these guilds two guilds respect the others turn in ntov, the guilds that can do it on asian time do not, and will go in to get whatever they can. The aary rule that used to be in effect on RN isnt anymore because any of these 4 guilds can do Aary and the Asain time ones never respected that rule anyways.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sounds like Emarr has very nice rules, however I imagine that you dont have the 4-6 gilds capable of doing ntov that RN does or else it doesnt sound feasible.</div></div><hr />

I have heard that NTOV dealings on E'ci were pretty friendly up until recently. I believe something occured between the two top guilds (you know who you are) and one basically got punked. I would love for someone that had more info to elaborate, as I've been curious to the details. What can I say, I'm a gossip junky.<br />
<br />
Actually, it's not really gossip, as there was a little info on one of the guild's website referencing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Correct - previously there had been 3 Ntov guilds on Emarr and they had a pretty nice &quot;gentlemens agreement&quot; as far as I can tell - 2 of them merged into one - leaving it at 2 major ntov guilds - well they have essentially abandoned ntov for ssra and gearing up for vex thal - so that leaves Affliction now that we have become Ntov capable.  We've pretty much been alone in Ntov for the past month/month and a half.  But we have about 2 up and coming guilds getting very close to offing Aary - kinda why I asked for other servers input.<br />
<br />
I'm hopeful the tradition established on Emarr can continue.</div></div><hr />

Not uncomon to see 2 guilds in north tov, ive seen 200+ in tov on a weeknight.(west, east, and north occupied).<br />
<br />
Guess its bound to happen, when you have 3-4 euro guilds that are ntov capable, and 3-4 north american guilds, makes it crowded. Basically, almost everything is dead within 24 hours of server up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vanidar</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 04:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">E marr actually has quite a few guilds that are getting ready to go into NToV.<br />
<br />
I don't look forward to the competition but it's going to happen regardless I think.<br />
<br />
E Marr has always been very civil in regards to contested zones or spawns or areas. We have managed to avoid the really nasty battles that I have seen on other servers. I hope it continues this way. <br />
<br />
I do however see some strained relations in the near future. As much as I would like to say it wont happen I don't think we will have much of a choice with it. <br />
<br />
Affliction is in NToV now. Divine Grace is starting to go in as well. Kaizan X made their very first trip in recently. May even be the instance that Oj is referring to. That's 3 right there. <br />
<br />
Phoenix Crusaders will be in NToV within a month. And yes we will be going after Aary as well. There are a couple other guilds that are probably &quot;close&quot; as well but I still hold reservations about their ability to get past Aary.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dangrim</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 05:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tunare is FCFS atm. There was during automn last year the idea that if you took down Aary so had you earned the right to NToV so you could move in a CoTH mage to safespot due to that. Of course a guild that could not take down Aary decided to piggy back (read run in right as Aary died to try to get to the dragons first) their way in. Easy way then was to set up the CoTH link and they started to use LD CoTH instead to get past Aary *shrug*.<br />
<br />
These days so is it training Aary to Zlex to get it to a pet (they actually got around to kill him a little while back after upgraded), training each other (What the =&quot;!#¤)/&quot;#¤)/ is Aary doing here?! Personal experience as a sidenote) and other &quot;nice&quot; actions going on (;. I am happy I am out of the circus as there are five or so guilds that can clear NToV, another two or three guilds that can do most of NToV atm.<br />

I didnt realize though that some servers allow multiple guilds in ntov at once, sounds horrible to be constantly butting heads and running into people, at least when we get in we got it to ourselves :)</div></div><hr />

It's just that we don't exactly have a choice about it. What can we do? Train them? Tell them no? GM will not do a thing about it.</div></div><hr />

To get on the rotation, you have to kill Aaryonar. The rotation allows one day for the zone to pop, and two days to clear it.<br />
<br />
We have most uber mobs on rotation.<br />
<br />
While it can take a while for your turn to come up again on certain mobs, it is a good system in my opinion which allows the guilds to not get in each others way very often.<br />

Yet Magister, don't do it anymore, I believe they are working on Vex thal, Midnight Fury i have not seen in NToV for a long while. Affliction which i see in there often. yet as i see guilds growing, There are definatly 3 or 4 guilds getting ready to do NToV, EG, Divine Grace, Phoenix Crusaders. Ring of Destiny. So i'm sure there will be some bitchiness going to happen in the next 6 months. But at the minute i'm happy with the high end raiding on Erollisi marr, Everyone respects each other :-).</div></div><hr />

 Talking about E'ci. I assume yer referring to Recon's update about the fighting with Arete=) Way off if you think that's what changed North.<br />

 Anyhoo it's FFA right now basically. I only wish people were forced to kill Aary. People that can not kill Aary should be GM kicked out of the zone=P</div></div><hr />

To get in you need to be capable of soem other major targets &amp; then succesfully kill aary. Eashan/Ikatear and the west/HoT mobs are FFA, as are sont/kland.</div></div><hr />

Since Forlorn is one of the top guilds on E'ci, your knowledge of such matters would be vastly larger than mine. Very rarely do any stories come out of TOV, I based my previous statement on what I've read, which may be a no-no, but it's all I got :p<br />
I do tons of research about others on our server, because I like to know who I'm fighting along side, what guilds that generally have good reps, and those that don't. I will say that my dealings with Forlorn have been exceptional, there have been those that have tried to help me on numerous occasions, and that says alot, even though it may not mean that much to you, as you don't know me from Adam :p</div></div><hr />
