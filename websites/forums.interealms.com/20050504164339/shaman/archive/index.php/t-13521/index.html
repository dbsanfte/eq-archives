Unfortunately this pics seem to be low quality or they would make for a good sig  :( .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Who was taking the pictures?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ah, I get it - the periscope in the front of the sub was looking back towards its own tail, and the bear was chewing on the tail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This was my cousin Fred.  He's ALWAYS hungry!  That's why my Mom doesn't invite him over for Penguin Patee night anymore!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've never noticed &quot;holes&quot; on any of the 3 subs I've been assigned to over the last 12 years, nor do I recall ever seeing or hearing about holes created by sharks on any US submarine.<br />
<br />
A few teeth left in the SHT I could believe, but holes?  No.<br />
Certain other areas and it is another story entirely.  Sharks have used certain submarine towed bodies in the past for snack attacks in certain waters, but those are rare occurrences.<br />
<br />
Oh, and the peri-vis picture clarity usually does stink after it has been in use for awhile.  I think the first pic of the 3 wouldn't make for too bad a sig pic, all things considered.  I have to send this to some of the guys on my last boat who play EQ. :D<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
