<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fokkilie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Made lvl 39 and am looking to buy new spells.<br />
<br />
Looked at sticky &quot;List of spell Locations&quot;  looks like I will be taking my first trip to Kelethin  <br />
<br />
I have read that it is easy to fall off the trees (or was that just N00b's)  Any tricks I need to know??<br />
<br />
Also if I have to prioritize the spells to get (yes, I am poor), this is what I have and approx cost:<br />
<br />
    - Healing ~8pp<br />
    - Levitate ~9pp (been fighting alot in crystal caverns)<br />
    - Bramblecoat ~18pp<br />
    - Skin Like Steel ~14pp<br />
    - Call of Sky                             Cost??<br />
    - Natures Precision               Cost ??<br />
    - Burning Arrow ~22pp<br />
    - Careless Lightning ~11pp<br />
<br />
The following seem nice but not necessary at ther present time<br />
   - Calm Animal<br />
   -  Dismiss Summoned<br />
   -  See Invis<br />
<br />
Any suggestions??<br />
<br />
Also I have been trying to find Opal encrusted steins in the bazaar but havent been able to find for about a week, how do you go about hiring someone to make them for you??<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Lol get Levitation from a safer area if its your first time in Kelethin, and bring some bat wings with you.  There are no walls or anything to keep you from falling off, except the walls of houses and the treetrunks in the center of the platforms.<br />
<br />
And, dismiss summoned can be useful to you if you ever get a group hunting the bees in Burning Woods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>entilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">at level 39 you probably won't die from the fall unless you are already low on health.<br />
<br />
also, with every spell set the first place the first place i usually look is in the PoK library (both the ranger and druid vendors, maybe cleric too)... that is if you have PoP. only exceptions are those listed as found in FV, haven't found those spells anywhere else.  for NPC dropped ones (none at 39) i head to the bazaar first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kishin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">up until this past level i used a potent 2hander, some kei and dismiss summoned to solo The Hole's front six.  not easy.  just about worth it for the xp.<br />
<br />
oh, and kelethin is the best city ever.  it's like an open-air maze where you get to see the falling bodies of noobs who took one step too far.  thank god i grew up there or i'd never be able to stand it.  (although, when i made my WE ranger, the very first thing i did was walk off the edge.  never did find the corpse with the guild note to maesyn.)</div></div><hr />
