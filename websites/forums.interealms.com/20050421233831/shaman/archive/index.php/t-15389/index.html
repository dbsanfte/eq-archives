<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drylar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok. for those that day it's too far to walk... Here you go. From POK...<br />
Take nexus stone.<br />
Walk across to Shadowhaven portal.<br />
Go through hidden entrance to Echo Caverns (the side with the great saprophyte and needlites)<br />
Walk through to Fungus Grove<br />
Walk to the end of the town, invis up (nothing has yet seen me through invis), and head northwest to the lake, turn north through a big tunnel, and you should see a big hill covered in bugs. Go up the hill, and across the bridge to the portal to Twilight Sea. Warning... this only happened to me once, but was a learning experience... if invis drops near anything, get ready for a CR.<br />
Get off the tower in twilight, and head wsw to the zoneline to Scarlet Desert.<br />
<br />
With sow + invis + time it takes me to zone = 5 minutes from POK! Cheaper than a port (and faster, depend how long it takes to find one), faster than walking from Shar Vahl, and not comepletely insane like trying to cross the Grey or Grieg's End.<br />
<br />
Sun revanents are easiest I have found, but cast a plague on you. The sun reavers are shaman. You have been warned :). They are the only things I have found that can see through invis. I've found camping the GE zoneline in the north wall to be a good camp spot, as well as the zoneline to the gray. If you have a good group, feel free to head up the plateau to the revenant camp. It's definately a bring-your-own-group (BYOG) area. Everything seems to be KOS to me, and if you don't have a very good camp you WILL get adds. There are several tribes of the alien things, which a few I am only dubious too now. Kill one tribe, and you are liked by the other tribes. Good loot, and I've picked up a few sapphires and diamonds off the cheetahs. The bloodtribes drop some acrylica, but are some of the toughest guys out here. I seem to be on the low side at 47, and have been a strong solo'r so far, but out here it can get nasty. I come prepared with virtue and kei, and bind just outside zone in twilight, and keep gate on the ready. I managed to talk a full group into coming out here twice so far, and it really rocked. I am VERY surprised how underused this zone is. Everything is dark blue to yellow so far at 47, and still light blue to white for a few 54 guildies that came out with me. Kinda reminds me of DL, but with MUCH better loot (less often on the loot, worth far more when you get it). I've also heard 2 of the shards for the key to Vex Thal drop out here. haven't gotten them yet, but thought I'd pass that on. <br />
<br />
After all the help I've gotten from these forums, hope this helps someone out. If you play on Xev, unless I level past here by the time this is read, look for me... I am gonna be here for awhile.</div></div><hr />
