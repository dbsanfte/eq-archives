<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zrakkonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My advice, although limited in scope as I am only 63 1/2, is to quit trying to solo if you want fast reliable safe XP.  Get yourself in a PoV, HoH, or BoT group (now that you can access those zones since you are 62) and watch the XP fly.  I did half of 63 last night in 4 hours in a HoH camp.  In my opinion, grouping in these zones is FAR FASTER XP than soloing anyplace at 62 or 63.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">After 55 I'd say, it isn't worth it to try to solo things now. Sure, I soloed to 62 np, but I did it really right when pop came out and good camps weren't discovered yet.  Get yourself a group, and solo if you have to while LFG.<br />
<br />
Oh, and it doesn't really matter where you solo at.. the exp you get from all mobs aren't going to be much.  I think that at 61 or 62, it seemed like I had to kill the same mobs 2x as much to get the same exp as I did at the previous level.</div></div><hr />

Sturm,<br />

Are you looking to solo, or is grouping an option for you?  If so, a group in any of the planes, PoV, PoS (although not tons of groups in there from what I've seen), BoT (you can head here now) and many of the other planes you have access to will net you the XP you've heard about.  Solo, the XP isn't so great in most zones until you start soloing in the upper planes (quads in PoN give my 61 wizzy about 1% xp if I'm doing the weaker yardtrash, a bit more if I stick with just trees).<br />
<br />
My suggestion, if soloing - just grind it out.  If grouping, go with either LDoN or BoT, PoV, etc.  I'm not sure about GoD as I haven't headed that way yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>sturmbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thx,<br />
<br />
nice to get infoz sooo fast. <br />
Okay i forgott something ... <br />
<br />
My Last login with my SHM was in 2002 ;)  So i cant group <br />
with anyone at the moment - i dont want to kill the hole group ;) <br />
<br />
So i tought by myself &quot;make 1 lvl solo and than you know how to play<br />
 you good old SHM&quot; - i missing a little bit training  ;) <br />
<br />
Was hard to get all the &quot;new&quot; spells, the reserve of 80 k PP was good to get better gear - but thats not all ...  i have to debuff - slow - debuff - dot - getting pet on mob - Heal ( like earlyer times - no CLR near - so im the main-debuffingdottingslowinghealerandtankingshm ;) ....<br />
<br />
Call me a psycho  but i have to relearn it bevor i hear &quot; the damn shm kills us all &quot; .... so give me a hint  - a idear - a hopefully sing , that i can make 1 lvl - at the moment i die more than i play  ;)  i think i need more routine ( and i swear i never play DaoC or Horizons  ;) ... ) .... <br />
<br />
<br />
thy  ..<br />
<br />
PS - i have all extensions ... inkluding GoD<br />
    lol including even  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Grouping is easy(most of the time), if your unsure of yourself group in a tier1 to get a feel, sure exp may not be that good but you can get a feel for it again. If you got malo, it should be alot easier. I find grouping to be pretty boring at times, mob inc malo as soon as you can cast, then slow... erm now what? throw a weak nuke or 2, maybe help with heals.<br />
*edit*<br />
Oh, I hear &lt;inner&gt; acrylia caverns is good. I been hunting in velks for awhile lots of light blue mobs but they all down pretty fast and hit like wimps I stopped slowing them I just throw a few dots, then torpor my self.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Capaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am 62 now...and think that soloing is not worth the time or effort, compared with grouping in PoV, BoT or HoH.  I tried to do the Nadox zone in...easy but slow exp..1 hour of work solo versus a few pulls in PoV....no contest for time spent.<br />
<br />
If you want to relearn your class, I liked the suggestion to group in Tier I zone, PoD likely the best.  It will be forgiving at your level.<br />
<br />
Soloing won't get you used to the &quot;Need haste&quot;....&quot;Focus faded&quot;...&quot;can you shrink me&quot; cries from group members.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you are intent on soloing its going to be slow going at the post 60 pre 65 level.  My recomendation is Droga.  There is an exp mod in the zone that will help to eliminate a good portion of your racial exp penalty.  The cash there is also good, as are most of the drops.  You might not yet be able to solo some of the nameds that drop the 10-30K items, but you will definatly be able to take some of them.<br />
<br />
Soloing there at 63 I didnt get any named but still did 63 in about 3 days soloing about 3 or 4 hours a night (only 5% exp penalty for Barbs) and made about 5K in coin drops alone.<br />
<br />
Other than that, portions of Seb are still blue to you, but not very good exp, as it is 5 expansions old in terms of exp per kill.  Good cash, and the occasional good drop, but IMHO not worth the effort.<br />
<br />
LDoN exp is also good if you bought the expansion.  That is also a good way to earn points to spend on gear upgrades.<br />
<br />
Soloing in Tier 1 planes really isnt very good exp anymore.  Much faster even if you get a group in Tier 1 than trying to solo.  Groups in PoI are proably  your best bet as long as they are willing to travel around a bit.  Camping at the ZO is so BORING...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you intend on soloing at 62 just to get the feel back of being a shaman I suggest parking in the safehallway just passed the sleeping ogre in Nurga.  From here you can solo pull just about anything.  The exp is not as good as Droga but will not take as long to kill a mob as Droga either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Here is what I would recommend doing.<br />
<br />
Find a 65 LFG  Tank and then round up a Cleric of any level as long as they got complete helal and acces to BoT. Then zone into BoT and take your pick of any three other DPS classes. There are so many places to camp in BoT it's silly. There are plenty of mobs and place holders to keep dead that you can probably get a camp without any trouble as long as you got a group ready to take it.<br />
<br />
I haven't camped the Bees or anywhere in east yet but have been all over the other wings and liked most of em. Just make sure you malo each pull as soon as possible . If your tank has trouble keeping agro after multiple slow attempts you might wanna torpor yourself when you get a resist before attempting another.<br />
Oh and if you odn't have it yet get Canni V as soon as possible. I lost count awhile ago of the number of times a over zealous puller pulled too many and I ended up as healer and had to massive canni mid fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you just want to rebuild your skills solo, old world dungeons are quite fun!<br />
<br />
Seb zone in is quite forgiving at 62, I'd think. Unless you forget to root them at the end, in which case it'll be an exciting run to the zone out... Not much XP here, though your CC skills will be tested.<br />
<br />
Nurga is also fun and you can get some XP while at it.<br />
<br />
Droga is the big brother of Droga, quite fun but I find it gets old quickly and you can get in big trouble if something gates on you. <br />
<br />
Maybe hit the giants in Permafrost? Haven't been there since level 60 to farm a bit, but I remember they come in a wide variety. <br />
<br />
Other than that, I'd say get some HoH / BoT / PoV groups and explain that you are just getting back in the groove. I'd recommend opening with whatever is your currently best verson of the MalXX line of spells until it sticks, then land slow. (This will also give the tank a bit of time to establish aggro). <br />
The first 10 or so kills are usually about getting used to how the other 5 members are playing and establishing a steady rythm. When you feel you have the &quot;basics&quot; of slowing in the group down, the resist rate of the mobs, what you can land and not, and so on, you can start adding in the odd nuke and even do some crowd control on multi-pulls. <br />
EQ is a pretty easy game, and it doesn't take much practice to get used to it again. <br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />
