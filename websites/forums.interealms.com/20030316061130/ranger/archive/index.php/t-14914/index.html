<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kjhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I've finally reached my 28th Season and was hoping to raise my Archery skill.  My big question with this is, can I raise my skill on things that con green?  Or do they have to be at least Blue con?<br />
<br />
My other simple question is, what exactly does AC do?  Does it keep me from getting hit or lower the damage when I do?  Or both?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.  As always the Glade has been very helpful.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tullaian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1) yes must be blue or higher. <br />
<br />
2) AC is a combination of your mitigation defence and avoidance defence. Higher AC increases your chances to be missed entirely and if hit to take less dmg in general. It's more complicated than that but at your level all you need to worry about is more AC is always a good thing. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ranguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yup, must be blue or higher for skill increases. Good way to raise Archery I think is to load up on arrows, or carry stacks of parts and a fletching kit to make 'em as you go. (1 stack of components makes 100 arrows but only takes up 4 slots in a bag) If you're out soloing and you need a med/heal break, ask someone close by if you can shoot their mobs. That's basically how I kept Archery maxxed until dinging 51.<br />
<br />
AC is important until it's over 1000 IMO, then focus on HP...you get hit less and take less hits = less gating to bind at the expense of exp :)<br />

Oh yeah, welcome to the Glade /bonk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drienne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Skill increases are on any mob light blue or higher.  The higher the level of the mob, the better chance you have of gaining skills.  In other words, light blues have a very tiny chance of skill increase, blues are much better (with higher level blues increasing your chance), white is better than that, etc.  There are a few good places to gain skills.  In SRO, there's a female DE mob that wanders around.  Something beginning with A.  She's blue all the way to 60, and non-aggro.  So you could follow her plinking arrows all day if you like (you can also practice your other offensive weapon skills).  Secondly, the Nexus Scions.  They're level 63 (I think), and you can use ranged attacks without fear of being hit back.  Unless they nerfed it, you could sit at a nexus spire and toss arrows at them for skill increases there as well.  Just be sure to stay out of melee range.  They hit for 2000+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>entilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I shot half a bag full of arrows into the GD nexus scion about a month ago after reading about the technique for target practice.  all misses, no skillups.  sigh.  this was at skill 150 or so.  does the arrow need to hit in order to skillup?  might have been nerfed but would be nice if someone could confirm this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gavving</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">No the shot does not need to hit for you to get skill ups.   And shooting half a bag of arrows is frankly a drop in the bucket of how many arrows you will need to shoot to max the skill eventually.   <br />
<br />
Also, I would be &gt;very&lt; careful about using the scion as a shooting target.  As its a rooted mob that doesnt summon, a GM might not look kindly on you shooting at it.  Also if a bard happens to show up and sing an AOE song that hits you, the bard will be on the scions aggro list.  Meaning the scion will attack the bard if the bard gets into melee range.  <br />
<br />
Just shoot at other peoples mobs, or find a nice area and bow kite some blues for a day or 2.</div></div><hr />
