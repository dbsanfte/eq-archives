<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Andraxson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wanted to extend a huge thanks to everyone involved today on our little adventure into Chardok.  It was a blast.  I hope to do it again REAL soon.<br />
<br />
Especially since Baracus convinced me to bind in the NEXUS and I dont know my way around what so ever.  :)  So hopefully we can go again, so you can save me from sitting at the portal site for the rest of my days :)<br />
<br />
Gnomes are to small to adventure out on our own... we get EATEN!!!!<br />
<br />
SAVE A GNOME!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Andraxson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">And yet another great group today in Burning Woods.  Thanks much to Tuktuk for helping me find my way out there.  We were whooping up on all kinds of stuff.<br />
<br />
In typical eq fashion though... I was wiped out mere moments before the wife got home from work.  ;)  But thankfully Tuklipuf saved the day with super Rez's for all us dead type people ;)<br />
<br />
Yay for another great adventure.<br />
<br />
Ohh yeah... and I hit 50 while we were out.  :)</div></div><hr />
