<br />
Why are shaman the only priest caster without secondary forte to boost a second specialization?<br />
<br />
HELLO!<br />

Yeah dev team, you might want to actually spend a little time on shaman AA..you know, so you don't leave us behind even more.</div></div><hr />

As of right now its all rumors, nothing is final till GoD actually comes out.  Even then things could be added and removed, and only thing I ever used Caster's Realm for was to see what class got SoW first ( hence why i made a shaman after my pally got to lvl 19 ).  Somehow they guessed right but I wouldnt count on them for reliable information regarding a not-yet-released expansion which is undergoing an average of 200 spell changes a day.<br />

<br />
might be better than the CHA recommended by Verant at the start.<br />
<br />
just move my melee from the &quot;pure caster&quot; (wizard) table, to the ranger table, let me think a carry a hammer for a reason.<br />
<br />
let me melee like a cleric<br />
<br />
(now seriously, is that not the saddest plea from a shaman?)</div></div><hr />
