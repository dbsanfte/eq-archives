Picked up the Mirror 1 proc for 30 points in Everfrost last night and slapped it on my sharkspine club.  Since I couldn't find any info on it anywhere I figured I'd share my experience.<br />
<br />
First of all, Mirror 1-4 is a 5-20% chance to reflect all incoming spells.  It is a proc, and it only lasts 3 ticks.  I didn't get a screenshot of it, but it also reflected AE slow cast by a mob (of course the mob resisted it :x).<br />
<br />
The good news is it procs all the time.  Just using my mace between nukes and dots I was able to keep the effect up over 75% of the time, the only time it really dropped was moving from corpse to mob if the run was far.<br />
<br />
PVP note:  this is going to mess things up.  I was manaburned last night with Mirror up and if it had fired I sure as heck wouldn't be posting a cleric nuke screenshot...<br />
<br />
Anyways just thought I'd post this info.</div></div><hr />

As for the pvp aspect. Hahahaha.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think you can....All the weapons i seen that proc have slot 1 augs on them, and all the weapons that don't have procs have slot 4 augs (usually procing augs). But maybe there is some weapons that have a proc and you can augment another proc onto them, but i doubt it :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can.  Sharkspine club has Proc: Lotus Spines, and now Proc: Mirror 1 as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Wow thats pretty cool, 2 procs on one weapon...Hmm but do they proc the same rate as they use to? If so that can be some massive procing on a single weapon...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure, I augmented one of those Mirror I stones to my Soulstripper in beta and they both went off like crazy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ssiky the Ikky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What'd ya get yer sharkspine club to drop off of?   Aren't there a few mobs in pow that do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Yodelroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">ACK! I think I'd crap my pants if someone reflected my ancient mez song.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just think... it's only a matter of time before mobs start using mirror too...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Yodelroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I heard this doesn't apply to AEs and of course it won't apply to some/all combat procs (like deathtouch or banish). So it isn't what it first seems. Anyone know what all the limits are of this effect?</div></div><hr />
