<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jvrebi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We've just started raiding the Halls of Testing on a regular basis now.  I'm usually on slow duty.  61 Shaman with all resists above 100.  I Malo then Slow.  I can usually count on dying 2 or 3 times in a night.  Takes about 3 resists on slow &amp; I'm toast.  Is this par for the course?  My HP's are usually just above 3k with buffs on.  I'm wondering if level 63 &amp; up Shaman get resisted there too?  Do I need to demand an Enchanter Tash before I attempt to land slow?  I normally don't wait on the tank to build aggro as those mobs hit hard.  If I wait too long my Warrior's done for too.  I've been jumping right in from the get go.  Any words of wisdom are appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Malo, then Malosini(a), then slow. Tash and/or OOS should land in there somewhere, also.<br />
<br />
Don't even cast Slow once until Malosini(a) lands and overwites Malo. You will then find that you rarely die in HoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Guntar Ghostdancer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What we did in HoT was...<br />
<br />
In this order or close<br />
<br />
Shaman Malo's<br />
Enchanter Tash's<br />
Bard OOC's<br />
Shaman Malosini's (overwrites Malo but reduces resists more)<br />
Shaman Slows<br />
<br />
I usually got 80-90% first time slow at 60.  If you have 2-3 shaman all coordinating things this can go faster.<br />
<br />
Also try Disease based slow (grummus etc) on any of the dragonfly mobs because they are near impossible to to slow with turgurs. Hit them with Insidious decay or the new maliscious decay to get a better chance of disease slow landing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Guntar Ghostdancer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">BTW we still use this debuff cascade on newer mobs just insert the appropriate 60 + spells/songs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shizbiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">you need more hps, I buff over 4k easy at level 60.<br />
<br />
Malo and wait for tash, oos and malosini from another shaman or mage before even tryin.  You are frail and if your tank/clerics cant deal with unslowed mobs then your chanters/bards/mages will need to get their **** together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The first thing you need is a tank who is worth his salt.  If you die that much your tank is clearly doing a very bad job of holding aggro.  Im 58, so i get resisted alot in HOT, but the mob rarely swings over from our MT.  If i chain cast slow i usually get hit for a round, two at most after a third resist, but they really dont deal out too much punishment.  You deffinately need more HP's though.  Im at 3.7k with the normal raid buffs, and only really die if i make a mistake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've done ALOT of HoT. . *hint magelo* .. heh <br />
<br />
i can usually get slow in after malo &gt; Malosini lands<br />
<br />
Tash helps .. OOS too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">At 60-61, with Malo, you should be able to slow most mobs. You will need to hit it with Malo first, then Malosini, and then slow it. For the dragonflies, as Guntar said, use Insidious Decay and disease slow because they are very magic immune. <br />
<br />
Dont worry about the tank dying if you cant get your spells in instantly, because the tank is there to take a beating. That's his job, and he has the hps/AC for that. You dont. Dont slow as they come in and pull the mobs on yourself..that could be why you're dying so much. Let the tank engage it and position it while you are casting Malo/Malosini. Then after those are in, and the tank has called for assist get right behind him and try to slow (hint, use shrink so the tank doesnt have to fight to move around you). The mob will most times turn on you once slow lands (or gets resisted), but if you are standing right behind the main tank he will be able to pull aggro back very quickly. Just torpor yourself and wait for the mob to stop hitting you and back off (dont sit down, of course).</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's your problem right there.  <br />
<br />
But yes, I have went back to HoT recently to help equip some applicants and I get almost as many resists at 65 as I did at 60, tbh.   Make sure to coordinate with your bard or enchanter for their additional debuffing.   Bards rock in HOT, get them to help you with occlusion of sound and their slow while you are trying your slow.  When you do get agro a bard slowed mob isn't going to hurt like an unslowed mob would.<br />
<br />
Get your HP up and you will die less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">recant magic<br />
malo/malos<br />
tash<br />
occlusion of sound<br />
slow attempt 1<br />
malosini/malosinia<br />
slow attempt 2<br />
etc, just don't spam slow<br />
<br />
make sure every announces all debuffs. don't try to slow without tash/malo-malos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would start malo on inc so it landed just after MT had engaged, then malosini, then slow (this is regardless of whether tash and oos was in yet or not).  If slow is resisted, just chain malosini then slow, keep that up until one of them lands.  Once malosini'd then the next slow should land.<br />
<br />
When I started that process I would very very rarely draw aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">3k self buffed or with raid buffs?  You should really be over 4k with raid buffs, especially if you're doing ToV.<br />
<br />
As for slowing, malo, tash, malosini, slow you'll rarely get yourself killed.  I did this for a long time at 60 pre-pop in 1 group, and can't remember dying more than half a dozen times total from slow agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">tell the slackers to tash.<br />
If you're the only shaman just rotate togors and tugurs instead of malosini, if it landed slow would have.<br />
Yes level of spell does affect it's landing ability.<br />
I've found togors to land 2-3x easier than tugurs.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
True, but malosini generates about 0 agro, while slows generate huge agro.  3 resists and you're pretty well dead.  10 resists with malosini and the mob won't even notice you.  I'm sure your tanks can live with an unslowed mob for a minute (though those quadding wyverns hurt), it's not worth you dying every other pull, when there is no extreme urgency for the mob to get slowed (like quad 800 or something).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Togor's has a higher resist check though and has a lot of agro. <br />
 I just spam malosini 'til it hits since I don't have malo yet.  Then I assume the chanter has tashed by then and I slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It's not unusual for a shaman to die 2 or 3 times a night in HoT.<br />
<br />
I tend to be aggressive in slowing, others aren't.  Up to you and whether you like looting your corpse or not.  And it does depend on the folks around you of course.<br />
<br />
Nowadays I don't die at all because we typically have another shaman there and that makes a big difference.  Plus we typically overpower the crawl through HoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>jvrebi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Great answers, thanks all.  Is getting your hp above 4k done through hp gear mainly?  Pretty sure my Sta is around 230 after buffs.  Or is it through some Uber Cleric buffs like Virtue?  I know this is probably a hard question to answer without looking at my gear.  <br />
<br />
jvrebi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Aegolism - 1100 hp<br />
Brell's Mountainous Barrier - 225 hp<br />
Khura's focusing - 430 hp<br />
Sta buff - assume 200 hp<br />
Total: 1955 hp additional<br />
<br />
Those are all L 60 or below buffs, and all stack. All but 225 worth are just from you and a cleric, with Brell's coming from a paladin. Rangers and beastlords also have something that won't stack with brell's, and at least one of those give hp, if you don't have a paladin around. With PoP buffs, you could have more, solidly over 2000 hp from buffs alone. <br />
<br />
If you're ending up with only a little over 3k hp buffed, then either you're not getting buffed properly, or your gear and HP REALLY stink. If you're getting up to 230 buffed sta, that means you have 170ish or more unbuffed? In that case your gear is probably not complete junk, and I'd guess you aren't buffing properly. Even naked, how many hp does a L 61 shaman have? Something around 1100 or 1200, at a guess? I think my wife's L 65 cleric with no hp aa's has around 1200 unbuffed, and she has a typical human 75ish sta, so I'd expect most 61 shamans to have that much and maybe more, depending on race. <br />
<br />
So if you're 1200 hp unbuffed naked, and you're barely over 3k buffed, you either need to get fully buffed, or get any otherwise-junky gear you can to raise your hp, because they're REALLY low.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have 1225 naked and unbuffed at 62, I believe. It's 1200-something, cause I went streaking just yesterday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Talisman of the Brute is 50sta, 150hp for Shamans at level 60. No need for ambiguity. 1905 hps from level 60 buffs. If you and your cleric both ding once from 61 to 62, and have spells, then you gain 10sta (30hp) and 300hp from Virtue-instead-of-Aegolism.  Anyhow, there's still no excuse to be anywhere close to 3khp -buffed-.  Make a magelo, man, get the feedback that will matter to you.<br />
<br />
btw, how my group does it? Buff stripping on incoming, each chanter casts their highest Dispell once (JUST once, no dispelling debuffs, thx), with necro/druid/whatever backup if only one chanter around.  Malo first, tash cast to land when Malo does (it casts 4.0 faster, but nobody's casting anything till both are in so no need to cast on inc). Malosini is the job of Magicians, mine have gotten very good at landing right after tash/malo.  I'm sure the bard is doing something, he's pretty quiet :).  ANYway, Slow right after Malo is finish casting, and very very few resists.  Cripple is an enchanter, job, also, since slow+cripple from one guy is a little much agro.<br />
<br />
If there are no chanters or shamans or magicians or bards to back you up, then tell people to go fook themselves, you have to wait until landing Malosini yourself.  Agro from slows that land is fine. Agro from slows that bounce isn't fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Joredor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If you are still having problems with all of the above advise I just have this to say.<br />
<br />
Insidious Decay or better and palgue of insects or cloud of grummus are your friends :)<br />
<br />
I dont know if this helps or not, but I like to stand underneath the big ones to try and slow.<br />
<br />
As with the other advise when I have done it I usually malo, malosini until it sticks or I get frustrated, then slow.<br />
<br />
The Random Number Generator seems to hate shamans (or maybe just me) and other classes seem to be able to slow without malosini sticking.<br />
<br />
If you dont have malo, get the mage to mala and you cast malosini.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">All you people and your &quot;really should be over 4k&quot;<br />
<br />
HoT starts way before that...When I started HoT I had maybe 3500hp raid buffed.<br />
At 62 I still only buff to 4200 or so with the new focus of spirit,  1boar, and virtue.<br />
<br />
When you start doin HoT its not easy. None of your shaman will have malo..you have a mage mala, ench tash, bard occlude...then chain cast malosini till it sticks before attempting to slow too many times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Glek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I would be lookin more at the tank on this one.... i was only slower in a hot raid at level 55 and never once died(from slowing) or got agro for that matter and there was a mob i tryed to slow all the way thru(never did get it to stick on that one mob all tho i did before a wipe from a bad pull)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">When I started HoT I also had low HP and it was one of the things that caused me to start pushing so hard for HP gear.<br />
<br />
My guild started HOT the day I scribed torpor and malo (we farmed the **** out of tola and prot to get those), we did it with one group and only 3 of us were level 60, our tank was level 55.   I only died when we wiped.  I never died to slow agro.<br />
<br />
So if you are dying a lot, work on your HP via buffs and gear and your strategy as people have said here.  <br />
<br />
If you have no one to tash, have your melees help you with tash sticks.  That's what I did.  Then you just spam malosini until it lands and go from there.  Get bard to help you, play occlusion with best drums, etc.   Get mage to help you with malosini.  <br />
<br />
If this guy wants some better advice, he needs to tell us the levels and number of people he is raiding with.  Who he has to help him debuff - mage, bard, chanter, other shaman?   And if he wants gear advice, a magelo is good.<br />
<br />
I think the advice given here about making sure you have the right buffs, improved HP, and debuffing strats is a good advice .  Though expecting someone who is gearing up in HOT to have the kind of HP that some of us have isnt reasonable, with improved levels, buffs and droppable gear HoT is much easier than it used to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Guess that I've always had the fortune to have three other barb shaman there with me attempting slow....there is nothing like watching four polar bears with their back to the wall attempting to slow the mob.  Anyways, what we always did...and this went on when I was lvl 60, with the other shaman being lvl 65, 61, and 61.  I lead with malo, seeing as only me and the 65 had malo, and the other three immediately attempted to slow.  After malo was cast, I then attempted to slow, but that was a few secs after my malo hit.  Therefore, the other three shaman had a chance to get it to land and therefore I wasn't getting smacked around if I got a slow resist.  If I was resisted the first time, usually one of us got it in the second round.  Either way, the mob got slowed pretty quickly, and it helped alot especially with us having no bards or chanters there with us.  I usually did not attempt to slow a second or third time because that seemed like too much agro and I don't care who your main tank is...there is only so hard he can hit the taunt button</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>garguren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">get your healers keep an eye on you..  <br />
<br />
i slow at ToV as i am only sham in guild...  <br />
<br />
chanter tashs bard uses oos and i hit slow..   varies from landing first time to up tio 7 resists before it sticks..  occastional aggro is nothing serious.<br />
<br />

<br />
and i know for a fact with a healer or two you should never die.. i have tanked mobs in HoT unslowed cause tank blew balls couldent pull aggro for ****.. just chained slwo kept aggro entire fight.<br />
<br />
