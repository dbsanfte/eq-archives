<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Metadone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi there,<br />
I'm about to start a new Shaman on FV server.<br />
<br />
First, I considered the different races, and I had a hard time choosing between Ogre and Troll, but I really like the ogre models (especially the old ones) and I like to look upon everyone in the game (same for Trolls, exept when they meet an Ogre). So I set up my mind on Ogres.<br />
<br />
Now, my question is : what's the best way to spend my creation points ? 25 WIS / 5 STA or 25 STA / 5 WIS ?<br />
<br />
Please, take into consideration that I won't be in an uber guild to get uber items for a moment (the only uber guilds are on US time, I'm French) and the availability of he items is not the same as on other servers (however, I don't want to twink him, just give him enougth money for spells and a velium 2H staff someone gave to my previous char, ok that is twinking, but not too much). My best friend will also give me 2 +2 WIS rings and maybe a few money to purchase leather armour, but this one is not sure though.<br />
However, this is even better to my mind as I'll have to rend with tooth and claws (sp. ?) to gather some stuff for me and my friend (he plays a Wizard of the 18th blast, almost 19).<br />
<br />
Would you have some advice on gears that I can get to help me from scratch (remember we have TLC on FV server) ? Oh, I don't plain (sp. ?) to reach high end levels now, so, please don't start a gear war concerning items to get at level 392937 :):):)<br />
<br />
Wow, sorry for such a long thread for such simple questions.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your advices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As far as stats go, I'd say make sure your AGI is above 75 (otherwise big AC penalty), and then split the rest evenly between STA and WIS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would suggest 5 in AGI - you need to get your AGI up to 75...that's the CRITICAL level for agility.  The drop in AC is huge when you go below 75.<br />
<br />
I don't think you can put 25 in STA - I believe the maximum is 150, and you already start at 127.  <br />
<br />
I would push Wis up to 100.  Yes, Wis isn't very signifigant in the *long* run, but it is free mana, higher chances of skillups, etc.<br />
<br />
Since you are on FV, then gear is going to be a lot less available than normal, so I would carefully consider your base stats.<br />
<br />
Final Suggestion from me:<br />
5 in AGI  = 75    (critical!!!)<br />
23 or 25 in WIS = 100 or 102<br />
0 or 2 in STA = 127 or 129</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Metadone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I know about AGI, but why is it so much important ? I can buff it...<br />
What is the reason ?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your advices :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Deian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">AGI determines your armor class. Changes in this attribute won't show significant effects on ac, however, unless you cross a threshold - like 75 and 100(? not sure about the 100). <br />
<br />
If your naked ac  with 70 AGI is 100, it will be 130 with 75 AGI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Standard advice for ogres is to do 5 agi and the rest wisdom.<br />
<br />
Lot of people are thinking along the lines of uberness now and saying wisdom doesn't matter, so put every point in almost any character into STA so you can get more hitpoints.  That's pretty silly for a class that relies on wisdom, and we don't get wisdom overnight...just eventually.  Like, maybe in your high 50's you'll start to feel like you just don't care about more wisdom at all, because almost everything you pick up that is an upgrade will have wisdom on it anyway.<br />
<br />
I did the 5 agi 25 wisdom thing and found it did really well for me.  I can take off some regular gear to put on resist gear for special situations, but not feel like I'm going to lose too much effective wisdom(I worry more about losing the AC and HP).</div></div><hr />
