<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok guys, iv'e ding 47 and am now 1 yellow into it (got stoicism too). I'm just wondering is 1% exp good for a dark blue kill? atm i'm in Echo killing first 4(5?) underbulk spawns or deep room if i have C3. Duoing i get pretty poor xp too, bout 4 kills and 1% in TM with a 40 bst. Is there any other places i shouls check out? Iv'e read CoM is good but where abouts in there and can i do it now or when i ding 49?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it is ok exp gets a lot worse soon.  After 51 you will be begging for 1% exp per kill.  Most people will probably say try com.  At 49 you get a big bost in spells.  I would see if you can get nobles in HHK.  That will take you to 51+ pretty quickly ... after that the real exp is in the planes.  Small groups with a druid or enchanter using charm.  Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree..CoM is one of my favorite zones.  I soloed there from about 50 to 53.  I wish I had tried it earlier, because you can start it about 48 (kinda tough) or 49(lots easier).  Nasties never run (mostly undead) and drop good cash.  Zone is usually empty except for an occasional epic piece group (at least on Rodcet).<br />
<br />
And 1% is a pretty good exp rate.  Thats only 100 mobs a level.  WAit till you get to kill 100 mobs for half a yellow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kaab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can do CoM now. I soloed the last two yellows of 46 at the entrance. I've gotten 5 of the 6 reports. The stables seem to be a popular froggy PL spot, so I'm still missing the spectral courrier.<br />
<br />
Now that I have Stoicism, I'll be heading back for the last report. I'm tempted to return to Dulak though. I'm pretty sure I was getting more than 1% exp per kill there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Way back in the day (tm) it was something of 2-3 hours per blue (4%) for most groups to get through the 50s.  anything better than that I say you're doing well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Drinnar - <br />
he said he is 47.  Exp was/is much easier at that level than 51 to 60 - I am sure you remember, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You want solo exp or grouping? Either way hit Lake of Ill Omen and kill all 8 bloodgill spawns, per kill you will get 4-6% normal exp.  I did this from 40-50 myself, they have low hp around 1400ish hp if I remember correctly.  The one spawn at Veksar is a bit harder though(VP Key Component), either way being an outdoor zone and the way dots work now, you should get exp very fast... specially with kei.... I could go on and on about how much easier it is now lol =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>drakaranxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">City of Mist is okay but I really enjoyed Eastern Wastes. Over by the Icaclad Ocean zone. I like to solo by what I like to call the biggest bridge in Norath. Most of the stuff there was pretty good exp for me. I don't remember how much though. At the south end of the zone there are some giants wandering around. They might still be blue and give you some good faction hits for the dorfs. Good luck and happy trails.<br />
