<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Verata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a quesiton about vox, and what spells / debuffs are worth casting, and which are a waste.<br />
<br />
After tash lands, is it possible to land any of the following?<br />
Slow<br />
Malosi<br />
Incapacitate<br />
<br />
Also, is it possible to land pillage enchantment before tashing (as tashing BEFORE pillage enchantment, would be a waste =D )<br />
<br />
Setting up for a final vox run before I ding 53, and was curious if a shamans role was simply to poison nuke and keep the wizards/enchanters alive</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chtiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pillage does not dispell tash....tash runs off poison counters....and dispells are unresistable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I never landed any magic based spells on Vox or Naggy when I did them. <br />
<br />
I always just buffed before, then was a healer during the fight.<br />
<br />
I guess most low 50s shaman don't buff for those dragons anymore though, I always see those old school dragon raids with level 60 buffers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Verata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">well, im hoping for a group focus person, but if that doesnt happen im the only shaman =D<br />
<br />
yeah, im not sure if any of the magic spells will land or not, but i know that for most nukage, resists are a big pain, and landing a malo or incapacitate would help others with damage output</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">During VOx raids I mostly just healed.  And it was usually healing myself  heh.  On Naggy raids I was known to bind-rush like a mofo and chain cast Ice Strike.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Landed Malosi before at 51 while doing Vox, never landed slow.  If you check the shaman sloawable list, you'll see that Vox is immune to changes in attack speed.  For the record, it took me like 5 tries to land Malosi before it stuck.  The biggest thing IMHO with Vox is a sound strat (keeping respawn down while killing the cow, can be done through great timing) and a decent DPS.  Mana sieving is great if you're short on bashers, but as long as you got a truck load of bashers your GTG.  Organizing your buffs can be important so that resists are always protected.  Getting a decent resist helps, but this is easily matched by going in with a lot of levels.  This is a much easier fight when you're 52 than when you're 45.  Lots more stuff, but that covers the basics.  As a shaman, you'll get resists no matter what you cast, unless you got your epic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Check again, the shaman slowable list at:<br />
http://www.dith.demon.co.uk/slows/<br />
<br />
doesn't say she is immune to changes in attack speed.  It says:<br />
&quot;** Possible to slow but very difficult, probably dead by the time it'll land&quot;<br />
<br />
There is a difference between immune and hard to slow.<br />
<br />
To be honest though, it is not vox melee that kills people.  It is a combination of people getting feared, people falling in pits and her complete healing.   Make sure the people you are with can follow instructions, not fall in the pits and wear some resist gear.  Make sure there are enough enchanters to seive her.  Then you win.  I spent my time keeping clerics alive, healing my group when my cleric was feared and then other times, keeping the wizards alive to burn her down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Durich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">you check the shaman sloawable list, you'll see that Vox is immune to changes in attack speed. <br />
<br />
Vox and Naggy are not immune it just takes a but load of Debuffs to get them down to the point where a Slow will land. Besides slowing vox and naggy is waste of mana. The fights if done correctly should only last 30-60 seconds.<br />
<br />
A shaman's role at vox IMHO is buffs and Healing. If your short on casters change into a dispelling role and cast it 3-4 times. Leave the druids to nuking and you to healing. If your raids for some reason are always getting adds then duo with a monk to be on the add team to deal with them.<br />
<br />
However if your raids on Vox take more then 1 minute do to CH's and you have plenty of healers then you should Debuff/Incap her. Blow your mana and cani down out of AoE and come back for spot heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sorry about the Vox slowable thing, I thought I read it on the thread but after rereading I find I need more sleep.  A shaman friend of mine claimed once that they got the attack speed message, but that seems to conflict with what has been posted here.  /shrug<br />
<br />
Best way to keep the fight short is bashing vox and interupting that CH.  Equip non-lrg sized warriors with shields, get lots of Pallies and SKs.<br />
<br />
I have found that the most flawless Vox encounters have been where she was pulled to the u-turn before the pits.  Only times ther have been issues is where she warps/gates back to here lair.  Changes in Perma no longer allow players to get feared into the pits, if people fall in its because they need sleep as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My role at vox/and naggy raids was always buffing and healing. I never managed to get a slow to land.<br />
<br />
If you do want to try you have to get under her belly to get it to stick. My general rule of thumb was never try more than three times, otherwise you may find yourself rapidly rising up the agro list. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hallace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I dont know if all yas know and I dont asume anything BUT<br />
like all other spells debuff or not are most effective when in Melle range. Maybe Malosini would have taken effect sooner. If ya did that then 5 trys ws just bad luck =/<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Dumb dumb dumb and unrelated to Vox/Naggy. I know that they will eject any 53+ characters that they get aggro on, but is it possible for high level people to do anything to them first? Could a lvl 60 shaman land malo or a lvl 60 wizard rush up to Vox and manaburn it before getting ported out of the zone?</div></div><hr />

<br />
No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Gorre is correct, but, if someone is on Vox's aggro list, a 53+ char CAN land a heal before getting a port to the zone. :) Personal experience with this one.  If Vox so much as sees a 53+ char, they get a free ride to the zone.  Aside from buffing, 53+ chars can be used to keep spawn outside the lair clear and recovering corpses in the pits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Verata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have heard that it is possible to cast a rain spell at higher level, and the second and concurrent waves hit, but shrug, rumor of rumor.<br />
<br />
A vox raid leader on xegony who has lead 23 or so raids, has said that its much easier to win vox if she is slowed, but also agrees, its so random, that its not something to count on.  I think that the role I have adopted, int caster healer extraordanaire, is pretty much the one I will have to play.  In 3 of the failed raids i have been on, I was the second to last to die, with my wife enchanter being the final.<br />
<br />
Shrug, looks like I malo after tash, and if damage looks ok on groupmates, think about a slow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>rebul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I just went on a Vox raid the other day, tried to slow her, didn't work.  She wiped us out the first time, but after a quick cr we buffed up and took her down the 2nd time..2nd time i was able to land a malosi, but that was it..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Verata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ok, tonight on my last vox raid ever.<br />
chain cast slow/malosi<br />
<br />
Not one stuck, nor did it make a difference, she died.<br />
<br />
So, heres my 2cp.  Dont waste your time, if you have the force to take her, its not going to DEPEND on getting those spells off.  It could depend on you keeping your group alive through heals.  As a result of my chain casting, i let my enchanter wife die, as well as the cleric in my group, the paladin in my group, and the ranger in my group  (no, its not my fault they ALL died, but it is my fault my wife died.  she knew i was trying to cast, but it doesnt change the fact that she wanted to see the dragon fall, and she was dead when it happened)<br />
<br />
So, in summary<br />
Maybe you can slow, maybe you can malo<br />
Doesnt matter, your heals mean more than a chance at doing something, they mean definately doing something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>grumpeehead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">i never had the joy of killing naggy/voxx on my shaman, but a friend of mine said that if you get the staff from phinny (which to my understanding casts a lure-based malXX) then naggy and voxx has a decent chance at being slowed... has anyone ever tried this?</div></div><hr />
