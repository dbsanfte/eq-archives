<br />
I've got all the new models turned off, and I tried it out running around the bazaar... everything works as described, SoW works, ducking works, medding while standing works.  Very nice!  I can't wait until tonight to chain JBB the mobs while medding!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hiho,<br />
<br />
I asked this before and I ask again:<br />
<br />
Isn't this &quot;standing while medding&quot; a bug ? Or is this &quot;working as intended&quot; ?<br />
Peronally I feel it is trivialising XP hunting. But this is boring anyway, wish they had not made AA XP .. shrug .. maybe it's just me.<br />
<br />
So long<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sorry, once you start a casting action, you drop medding.  They fixed that several months ago.  Verant really wasn't happy with people attacking and casting while medding.  However, you won't have to worry about the whole standing/sitting thing.<br />
<br />
Until they fixed the medding while casting bug, I loved my pony, even though his head got in the way all the time!  I had to sell him a few weeks ago, cause I couldn't handle how annoying having his head in the way was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sorry,  My med-while-casting horse still works just fine.  Its a great thing to have if you don't mind turning all the luclin models off.  (Which makes you zone much much faster, btw)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Standing while medding is working as intended because you can't sit on the ground to med while riding a horse obviously. What I think they are trying to stop however is turning off the models and still be able to get that specific advantage. However if you have all new models off it's still possible to do it. Not sure I would call it a bug though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If someone has a link to a statement from Verant that clearly identifies the med-while-casting/JBBing as a bug or an exploit, I will happily go sell Elmer back to the glue factory.<br />
<br />
The last patch fixed the ability to &quot;change into illegal forms while on horseback&quot; bug.  No metion of mana regen benefits being a bug that was slated for fixing.  Medding while moving and medding while attacking were identified as bugs and were corrected some time ago.  <br />
<br />
P.S. The Verant nerf monkeys do read these boards and ARE aware of the benefit.</div></div><hr />

With the old models I can even run around in the bazaar without turning the clipping plane down to 0. ;)<br />

Back to the topic. I have the feeling that VI nerfed the med-while-casting thingy last weekend. Was killing katta guards last weekend. On Friday I had no problems to keep 3 guards in my root &amp; rot queue (I'm an iksar so no JBB) without down time (just hate this despawns when the guards run at low health). On Saturday I had trouble to keep my mana up with only 2 in the queue.</div></div><hr />

If that's the case it should be easy enough to test. just use all your mana and see how long it takes to regain whilst using the horse, and then do it again without. You could also summon a pet and chain blast the poor thing with a JBB if you have one to see if that alters the med rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I can confirm that you med faster with horse summoned then without, even with luclin models off. I have been spending better part of last week in CT (made about 4 points day before yesterday hehe) and I have the luclin models off. I gained the benefits of medding. However, while you are casting or meleeing, you do NOT get mana back as if you were medding on horseback. <br />
<br />
Really, there is no bug and no problem here. With luclin models off you gain some of the advantages of a horse (you can med without having to sit down specifically) but you lose out on other benefits that you would have with luclin models (I dont get the speed of my chain horse when I have luclin models off). Its a tradeoff. If they want to change anything, they should make it so that SoW effects do not stack with horses. <br />
<br />
One last thing about the horsey. If you have the horse summoned and then you go to leave some area in a dungeon, make sure to kill the horse buff before you invis to move out hehe. With the horse up (and luclin models off at least) if you invis and con mobs, they will show as indifferent, but when you get in range, they will still attack you. Took me a while to figure out why they were still attacking me lol.</div></div><hr />
