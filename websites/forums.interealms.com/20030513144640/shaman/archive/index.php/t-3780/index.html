<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have gone here and there for exp, but this is a guide purely for loot.  I came here at 40 as soon as possible.  I fought here at 30, but 40+ it is definately worth it.  All the Wooly Mammoths you can feast your teeth on, they are all green and easy solo!  Their tusks Sell for about 10pp each, they arent rare drop either, sometimes 2 per pop, my pet can solo 1 on his own easily with only haste at 40, i can solo one also while he is busy killing 1 for me.  I brought a lvl 25 druid friend here with me splitting 1/4th of all my loot with her for her tracking ability, and i made over 250pp in 2 - 2 1/2 hours.  I am mediocre with my weapon skill (122) and im in need of some new gear, so i like this place, easy solo.  It is an essential part of my JBB fund, if i stayed here 24/7 with my druid friend id be about 1-2k a day but thats me. I have been here for about a week and made a nice sum of money.<br />

If you need cash just come here and fight mammoths<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Why bother coming here when you can go to rathe and make arolund 400pp in half the time.<br />
<br />
Its a good thought, but deffinately not worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Balthur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">while i agree it is a good loot spot, I have found that there are too many folks hunting mammoths for this reason, and mammoths are pretty easy to solo at 30 anyway (and still get xp).  Rathe is better for loot, but way too many people hunting there (not to mention rogues pp'ing there way to financial comfort).  I've found that if in EF, ice giants are the way tp go over 40, but i reccomend having a partner hunt with you just in case.  I've never seen many people hunting them, and usually can share camp with someone already there if you ask politly enough.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Knowsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Come on guys.<br />
BEST loot/xp for the lvl is most definatly East Wastes.<br />
Just solo the Ulthorks and get their tusks...turn them in to the Othimer Chief in CS to get a BLUE DIAMOND or a Jacinith (50/50 chance of BD...1/4 chance of a jacinith...and then another 1/4 chance of a booby prize, which inc.s Fire Emerald Ring, Diamond, etc which all sell for 100pp to a vendor)<br />
<br />
Bind in Bazaar.<br />
Get KEI<br />
Take Nexus portal to GD<br />
Walk to EW<br />
Go to Jail (northwestish...gian depression in the ground)<br />
Kill Ulthorks (Around lvl 35)<br />
This will also give you GREAT xp...Ulthorks are giant overcons w/almost no resists (Except Ulthork Warriors who occasionally have OK resists) Just root, DoT, DoT, nuke, and wait, it will die. If you trust your root, then you can kill 5 at a time with KEI (at least i can, but my gear is pretty good)...just re-root when it wheres off...this is the best way to solo (better then Kiting) because you can med while the mob is rooted, which means you don't lose mana killing them. Per day you can get about 10 tusks...which is about 1500pp+uber xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually, if you just want loot go to upper guk. Kill all the spiders and the scryer spawn in between. There are spiders up top and also on the pillars down below so killing the scryer spawn is on the way down.  Take the silk and make silk swatches - sell in bazaar 15p ea.<br />

~phat loot<br />
<br />
Of course if you can solo in seb do that instead ..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">CS is cobalt scar, in velious. you need a key to run there or a druid (maybe even wizard i dont know) can port you in. not sure if you need to work on your CoV faction to avoid being kos to the numerous dragon-types in the zone beforehand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">the drakes are on cov faction so yes you need to kill giants or something and get your faction up so they don't aggro on you. their aoe is long range and hurts bad=p</div></div><hr />
