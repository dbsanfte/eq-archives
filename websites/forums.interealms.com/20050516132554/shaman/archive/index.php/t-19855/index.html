<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yesterday in Tipt we got a little in group discussion.<br />
I turned out our chanter was afraid to charm a mob that was not slowed/snared (fresh recruit in sub par gear so I can follow that line of reasoning)<br />
Shaman then tells her &quot;Do not worry, I will perma slow/snare your pet&quot;.<br />
<br />
So I went eand memmed Torpor for the first time since ages.<br />
<br />
And the first cast of it on the pet made me laugh<br />
<br />
Torpor being partial succesfull<br />
<br />
 :p  :p  :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
HAHAHAHA!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">LOL I had never thought of that, but it's brilliant. I might have to try experimenting with that the next time I get grouped with an enchanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">rofl, that's funny stuff :)  Gotta dig it.<br />
<br />
Definitely good for a laugh, thanks for posting! :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Meddow Spiritwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ROFLMAO<br />
<br />
wow i really needed that laugh.. thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Haha that cracked me up. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Folks talk about it snaring but I've never noted it to snare the charmed mobs.  Is it only when you use charm?  I'm 99.9999% sure that I would Torp DC pets all the time and my pet and it would neither slow their movement or their attack speed.<br />
<br />
Though I admit I've cast it on a buddy when we were running places just to piss him off :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Btekippe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually I use this alot charming.  Like when the usual snare spell wears off I'll torpor it, then the chanter breaks it so it's slowed up just a bit to give the Ranger/Druid a chance to hit it with a real snare before it eats the chanter.  Very very handy.  And I imagine it depends on the mob some, but I've used this mainly in Tactics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Torpor being partial succesfull<br />
<br />
ROFL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Used to be killer in Pvp before it was nerfed to group only :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I heard Stoicism used to be killer on mobs and in pvp before they nerfed it to group only players only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tienen Crazywolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I remember it not being group only, not sure about it working on mobs though, unless it was some top secret bug never talked about =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Nice tactic! And also lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">That is too funny!  I just snarfed (sneeze-barf) coffee all over my keyboard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I knew a guy that said when the game was released his groups would often carry an in ordinate amount of copper on them so that in cae it started to look like a mob was gonna win you could dump all the coin on it and  run away. I think you used to be able to pass nodrop gear in a similiar fashion just give it to a mob and then kill it and let the twinkee loot it.</div></div><hr />
