<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Khavari Reborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all!  I have recently made myself a shaman alt (which I have been wanting to do for some time now) and am enjoying low-lvl life once again.  Been lurking here for a week or so trying to glean whatever info I can.  Raising Kadia (my shaman) up the right way with no twinking or PLing.  Its been different since I come from a cleric and ranger background.  Obviously I need wis/hp/sta items for equipment, but I was also told that piercing is the key wep skill to have?  I plan on doing all three equally, but am curious as to your views.  Any other little tidbits of info would be appreciated as well.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shaman epic is a spear, and there are lots of good peircers that are shaman only, thats why most people tend to use a spear at sometime in thier shaminic career. (personally, Ive swapped to a 1hb now, and raising skill from 108 at 57 kinda sucks...I say its a good idea to try and keep 1hb, 2hb AND piercing as high as possible)<br />
<br />
In my opinion STA, HP, and mana gear are all great to have, but dont go TOO far down that road.  Ive known a few shaman that started a big meaty race (ogre, troll) and went total sta/hp from level 1.  At about level 30 they quit thier shaman because they said they hated the class.  when I asked them why they said cause they ALWAYS had to canni to get ANY mana.  If you are level 30 and only dealing with about 90 to 110 mana you are going to find that your fingers will work more than a bards, and buffing groups will be a mightmarish prospect.<br />
<br />
I say get your wis to about 150-160 in as few slots as possible, then start to look for the high sta/hp items.  My wis sits at 178.  There are some slots that Id like to replace but cant afford upgrades yet.  But I never have a problem with having too little mana.  Even after buffing a group to the gills (ToBoar, ToCat, Infusion, Kraggs, group regrowth, Bih'li, Dex and Str) I still have about 30 to 40 mana left, which I can get back in about 3 minutes.<br />
<br />
Get a horse as soon as you can afford one.  Although you cant use them inside and your own SoW is much faster sitting mana regen and no sit agro is invaluable to me.  I get grumpy sometimes when I have to head inside...its those times that I really want a KEI to be able to keep up.<br />
<br />
When your slows get bigger, your AC will need to get bigger as well.  Untill about level 45 I was a wis shaman; I was dressed more like a druid than a shaman.  But as I got more agro from slows/dots I lost more HP, which meant I lost mana as well.  Then I swapped to looking for high AC gear that had wis content on it as well.  I lost about 40 wis, but gained about 300 AC.<br />
<br />
MAX OUT YOUR DEFENSE.  I cant stress this enough.  Some shaman I run into still havent maxed it out at level 60+.... Mine was maxed out as soon as I could hit 200 and I dont regret it for  a second.  A great place for this (ive heard, never tried it myself.  was beyond this level when SoL hit) is the needleites in Echo caverns at about 25 to 35.  They hit really fast but for small amounts if you land a cripple on them.  Buff up, pull with cripple and just channel heals though when you need it. <br />
<br />
Thats all Ican think about right now...Im sure others have good advice as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hildaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ah, I do not think raising skills is as hard as people say, Thursday of last week, I got a Witchdoctors Cudgle (Nice 18/22 1hb) so Friday I Dex buff self, and Haste and start meleeing my pulls in Nadox ( Skill in 1hb was 123) Saturady night I get the Soulstripper camp, and on Sunday Morning I had my Soulstripper. Now as of Wendsday Night, 1HB skill is 195.</div></div><hr />
