<br />
Has anyone ever heard of a shaman being able to mh a hard LDON and win. I mean even with a bard slowing, our best heal takes 7 sec to cast (with focus effects) and has a 2.25 recast time still leaving your 2500 heal (with focus effects) every 10 sec.<br />
<br />
Now I can see healing in an adventure cause I duo in poe, but actually healing a full adventure and winning is the question. You cant use your mount, so you would have to rely on voq adn canni to get you through, but if you have constant mobs in camp, you are constantly healing.<br />
<br />
To clerify:<br />
Main healer- means no other class with better healing then ours(possible a pally helper throwing out group heals.<br />
<br />
HARD ldon- not normal ldon, anyone can mh those<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you would need uber DPS &amp; would have to pull singles...SK &amp; pally with their Group heals might also be required...I have done it with 3 shammies...one on slow &amp; dps...one on heals &amp; CC &amp; the other on heals, dps &amp; CC...it was tough as hell but we did win &amp; had a lot of deaths doing it too. I know i could not heal a full LDoN Hard by myself...can do a couple of mobs then i have mana issues</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Balanthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have been the main healer for a LDoN hard mission and won.  But it wasn't easy.<br />
<br />
I was the slower and healer and we came quite close to losing people more than once.   I think if the tanks of my group weren't elemental gear they would have bit it.<br />
<br />
Multiple pulls in hards just put out too much damage for our heals to cover successfully in my opinion.   You can get lucky, but with no cleric to res in the group no need to try it unless you have a paladin with you.  90 percent res better than none.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1) A very well equipped tank mitigates the damage, you don't need to heal as much. If your tank takes a lot of damage, or if you get adds, yes you'll use up your mana on heals.<br />
<br />
2) Quiescense and AA.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Definitely doable but most dependant on<br />
1) a really good tank.<br />
2) really good puller/CC<br />
<br />
Has anyone ever heard of a shaman being able to mh a hard LDON and win. I mean even with a bard slowing, our best heal takes 7 sec to cast (with focus effects) and has a 2.25 recast time still leaving your 2500 heal (with focus effects) every 10 sec.<br />
<br />
So many things wrong with that statement, where to start.<br />
1) I assume your refering to krags and thats our WORST not our best heal.<br />
2) Krags is a ch type spell so no spell haste focus on it it. 10 seconds cast time period.<br />
3) Krags is a ch type spell so no healing focus effect on it it.<br />
4) Dudala's mending or even tnargs is significantly better espeically once you get crit aa's and focus effects, neither of which works on krags.<br />
<br />
Now I can see healing in an adventure cause I duo in poe, but actually healing a full adventure and winning is the question. You cant use your mount, so you would have to rely on voq adn canni to get you through, but if you have constant mobs in camp, you are constantly healing.<br />

Like I said the tank and pulling/cc is the bigger issue. Sure focus effects, mana pool, mana regen etc on the shaman help out and so would new god spells but tank is the biggest factor on how much healing is needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>darhews</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No the shaman that stated he had done this said he was using our 75%ch, thats why I listed that spell and spell durration. <br />
<br />
Personally I never even load it. <br />
<br />
I guess that would be my question, using krags could a shaman mh a hard ldon. Even in conjunction with quis, there are still to many factors involved to risk it.<br />
<br />
You say it is doable, but have you done it. <br />
<br />
So far only one shaman said they have actually done it being the main healer, and another shaman said he did it (barely) with the help of 2 other shaman.<br />
<br />
He even stated he could do 1-2 mobs, then have mana issues, I guess that is another question. Does a shaman have enough mana to mh for 90 min in a hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Balanthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I guess that would be my question, using krags could a shaman mh a hard ldon. Even in conjunction with quis, there are still to many factors involved to risk it.<br />

.<br />
<br />
I would add that yes I've done it, but it was barely done.  It is tough and quite mana intensive.  I was canning my ass off for sure.  I had a good puller and on adds, I would root (if they could be rooted) the add on incoming and get it slowed asap.<br />
<br />
We didn't have more than two at a time.<br />
<br />
I used quies and tnargs.  Never load kraggs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Is it possible yes, it's just a rather painfull experience. Your canna finger will be very sore when it's over.<br />
<br />
Depends mostly upon the group your with. Very well equiped players help as does a supurb puller.<br />
<br />
I havn't memed Kraggs in months and wouldn't use it in any situation. Unless I didn't like the person that is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>darhews</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">so while you had adds, you had to heal 2 tanks? you rooted and slowed, see to me that is where the line a realism gets crossed. <br />
<br />
If you are the mh and slower, you got lots of agro built up, if that root breaks you are done for. Even with our slow spear helping with the mana cost, it is the amount of time it takes to cast everything.<br />
<br />
I guess if you can heal 2 tanks in a hard ldon I need to move to your server and taken lessons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I do know that a couple of occasions, the cleric has mysteriously gone LD on a hard ldon collect with 20-30 minutes remaining on the clock and up to 10 drops to go.  Each time I was with an Elemental Bard and Elemental Pally, I was not elemental at that time, nor was I in VT or ssra gear.  The other classes were not healing types either.<br />
<br />
SOon as the cleric went LD, i would immediately unload my nuke for kraggs (yes I use it, but very very very rarely).  I got to slow the inc mobs, plus keep the bard and paladin both up.  Toss on a Quiescence, and then do a quick tnarg followed by a kragg a couple seconds later.  Granted to pally -was- stunning mobs silly too.  The first time this happened, we lost, second time I've done this, we won... Barely.  Shamans can healthrough a hard ldon, but it is NOT easy and you better hope to whatever god you pray to that you have a ton of healing AA, good healing foci, and crit heals.  Still hard, but, it's manageable if all you do is jump between slow, cani, heal.  usually when I was waiting on a ch/tnarg to refresh I could squeeze one or twocani's in before I was getting another ready.  *Shrug* It's do-able, but not something I terribly want to do again.  Gimme a druid or cleric so I can patch instead as needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Banuddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">When I used to do LDoN hards I did this regularly without any trouble.  It's really just about the group having nice gear/AAs and a good puller.  I wouldn't recommend doing it with less than VT gear, but it's probably doable.  As you and your tank get better gear though, it becomes more and more trivial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I guess if you can heal 2 tanks in a hard ldon I need to move to your server and taken lessons. <br />
Reread what he said, he rooted adds off on incoming. That's not uncommon at all. With VP it's pretty easy to keep 1 mob out of camp at all times and under control.<br />
<br />
If you have good tanks, you don't need to start the heal chain immediately, there is time for them to build aggro and with a good bard puller the mobs are all single and come into camp preslowed.<br />
<br />
Edit: And a very good VT equipped shaman will have in many cases more and better focus effects then an EP shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>whoadievz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The most unbelieveable hard ldon ive ever had was me (shaman), three warriors, a wizard, and a necro.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>darhews</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I did read, he stated (if they could be rooted) which means there where some that couldnt be rooted. Thus landing an add in camp that needed a tank on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Xysander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have been MH for a bit on a hard adventure.  Our cleric went AFK for 20-30 mins and I handled the healing for that time.  We had no crowd control and no puller (I think we had 65 pally, ranger, wizard, afk cleric, 61 pally, and me) but it was mostly single or double pulls.  With a tank with good gear it was pretty much no problem but I had to canny much more than normal to keep up with everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It sounds like the key in these situatiosn is not so much the shaman, but the tank.  One would have to have a tank (or two) that could stand up to a hard Ldon mob for a while, while still holding agro from a shaman who not only was slowing, but healing like mad, rooting, and often low on life from constant canni.<br />
<br />
A shaman would realy have to trust his tank to hold agro, and stand up to a beating to go into these situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I am always the Main Healer in our LDoN Hard Groups.<br />
<br />
Group all 65 with over 200AA (some at 300):<br />
SK<br />
Shaman<br />
Wiz<br />
Monk<br />
Rogue<br />
Druid<br />
<br />
Druid refuses to heal since he has ID4, maxed spell crit and ornate gaunts.... He fancies himself a Wiz that can cast PotN.  <br />
<br />
To give an idea one night when we were playing and the Wiz didnt show up I was boxing Gorg &amp; Garg.  We had a 3 pull and the druid was busy &quot;rooting&quot; while it took him the amnt of time to root 2 mobs, I slowed all 3 and keep the SK healed.  We ALMOST made it with no deaths but the SK thought the Druid would SURELY see how I was spamming the group with my heal message and he'd pick up some slack.  He didnt, so the SK didnt kite around at all waiting for my heal and instead had faith in the Druid.... and died.  So we lost the SK and Rogue over all, both my two, the druid, and monk lived though we were OOM and beat to crap.<br />
<br />
It is possible to be the Main Healer but it gets dicey... to take 99% of the risk out of it we either tell the druid that he has to cover the first heal when the SK hits 50% and then I'll take over.  Or the SK just kites backwards while the mob gets slowed and Q lands then engages.  The hasted mobs are the worst though they just dish out so much friggin damage so fast.<br />
<br />
<br />
**** Edit:  OH forgot to mention... yes I'm always bouncing between 50%-80% mana and firing off C5 as soon as it pops since I burn through so much mana being the only healer.<br />
<br />
OH also a side note is it's not always the druids fault he's not healing, he's AFK 50% of the raid time.  Has anyone EVER heard &quot;AFK guys kids going to bed&quot;  &quot;AFK guys wife heading to bed&quot;  Your wife needs you to tuck her in?... bang her after the adventure when we are running for another one!  Oh and his kids are like 17 and 18 so no it's not like they are 3 and actually need to be tucked in. ****</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>FletcheraDebuffinMuffin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Quick Buff 3 helps Quiesence land in 3 sec  vs 6. I dont use Krags mending, I just use Tnargs and Quiesence. <br />
<br />
 I can heal a high dps group in a hard ldon and slow too...  Just need single pulls, if possible, and need the tank to hold aggro. So your healing 1 vs all 6. Ideal group:  war, rog, monk, rang, bst, sham. * bst can help slow &amp; paradon, ranger can snare, monk can single pull * <br />
<br />
ALSO .. pets work as a great root ...  ie bst/ sham pet ( even spirit call, on adds)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Skyline_SZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Doing ldon hard is actually easy with a shaman healing as main if you have: 1 65pally (stun Power dominates) with at least 4500+ HP unbuff and 1300+ac (not hard to obtain).  I have done over 50+ Ldon hard mission/including some loot farming and its quite easy to heal.  Have a snarer cast on mob and ninja zone...leaving the mob solo.  Sometimes u get unsnarable mob.. 2 or 3 adds are not too tuff if u have competant people.  You dont even need people with Uber gear or massive dps for it.<br />
<br />
few things to consider:  I never use Kragg mending (10sec for 2kblows ass)<br />
I heal constantly for 1600 to 1800 (tnarg with max aa with crits maxed) for 3 seconds</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>mspeedie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've done it, but its not fun.  We had time equiped team, with an ace SK tank.<br />
<br />
It was not fun, but it is doable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">yeah, it's not that big of a deal.. depending on equipment of course.  I have done it before, but most of the people that I roll with back when I did LDoN were full of almost all time gear, so some of the times it was almost trivial to need a cleric.  Don't get me wrong, I would rather have a cleric heal than anything else, especially since our heals at the time weren't that effective, but between healing and slowing, i spent alot of time canniing my ass off getting back to respectable mana count.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Balanthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I did read, he stated (if they could be rooted) which means there where some that couldnt be rooted. Thus landing an add in camp that needed a tank on it.<br />
<br />
It got hairy sometimes with two in camp when one was immune (rarely the case in most LDoN hards) but after they were slowed I just spammed the main tank with quies and tnargs. /shrug<br />
<br />
Pets + spirt call saves you valuable time as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Foradce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Done 3 ldon hard over the past couple days with me slowing and healing. Did one with no deaths and the other two had 1-2 deaths. Each one took from 45-60 minutes to complete. Only had to take one break after a 5 pull.<br />
<br />
Group was: <br />
65 paladin with around 5k unbuffed hp's and 160aa's<br />
65 shaman (Me) with 220aa's<br />
65 chanter I think has about 120aa's<br />
65 mage 300+aa's<br />
65 SK under 100aa (I think)<br />
65 necro with about 100aa's<br />
<br />
Mostly only have bazaar/ldon gear. Can take a look at my magelo for an idea.<br />
<br />
Key for me being able to main heal was really the good CC, although the paladin stunning helped as well. Was fairly hard at first, but after a while you start to get used to it and it doesn't seem so hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Foradce you have BIG BIG Balls with a group like that...not trying to knock you seriously that is a very odd group combo.<br />
<br />
Negatives to that group:<br />
-The SK MA for my group has ~6k unbuffed hp and runs at 1900AC with his AC taps and his AC gear on etc. with about 300AA the fact that yours is 1khp less (granted one hit but some times it comes down to that :) ) is quite a bit to give up.<br />
-Fights dont last long for most of the Necro dots to run... though looking at the group make up I could see where he'd be an excellent choice since you seem limited in DPS elsewhere.<br />
-The SK seems to be extra baggage unless he's the puller.  I've heard Palys pull really well in Hards but I never group with Paly's so I can't speak too much from experience.<br />
<br />
Possitives to that group:<br />
-Mages bring sick dps with their own pet and equipping the Shaman, Necro and Chanter pets with the weapons and gear to make them actually contribute to the group dps.<br />
-Necro can snare and kite then FD one add should you get it, SK can do the same, Paly can snare, Chanter can Mez.... as far as CC goes I think juggling it right you could effectively take a 4-5 pull and even though you dont have a lot of healing pull it off with some smart group members.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kind of off topic here but where do folks prefer (if anywhere) to do their Hard runs?  We have been going at Ruj lately simply to get me a Regen Belt.  Damn thing dropped the ONE RUN I wasnt there... but it went to a necro so that is good at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Where? Over the past month, I'd wager that about 1/4 of my runs are hards - and all pickups. Mir, Mmc, Ruj and Tak. Haven't had a hard Guk yet.<br />
<br />
Where do I Prefer? I try to encourage peeps to do hards in Ruj so I can get an SBBM. Luckily, I got a Trueborn Elite Ring in a hard Mmc. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Its dependant mostly on the group make up and fairly dependant on gear but a shaman can certainly play the main healer on a hard ldon.  A good puller, CC and sk or paladin is what I look for if I have to heal.  Paladin's stuns and self heals help a lot with the first 5-6 seconds when the mob isn't slowed or the shadow knight's snare generally allows you to have the mob slowed before its in camp or close to it.<br />
<br />
As to where I prefer to do my hard runs?  Anywhere.  Usually I'll take the puller's suggestion as the most important part of a shaman being the main healer is consistent single pulls in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Key for me being able to main heal was really the good CC, although the paladin stunning helped as well.

<br />
      Stun &gt;&gt;&gt; our heal in ldon hard</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The other thing to keep in mind from the original post is that if the Shaman in question was using Kragg instead of Tnarg it's possible (probable) that we are talking about a pre-65 maybe even pre-60 Shaman.  <br />
<br />
LDoN Hards are different at lower levels.  He may have done one where he was the highest level member of the group.  For instance, a 59 Shaman healing for a group of 52-55 level characters would probably work.<br />
<br />
I'd say that we probably don't have enough information to adequately assess the situation.  As many have pointed out, it is not impossible for a Shaman to heal LDoN hard missions.  Not that it is easy, simply that it is possible.</div></div><hr />
