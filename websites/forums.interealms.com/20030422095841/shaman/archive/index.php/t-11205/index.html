<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Oka,y im' about to do the ToP phase of epic, level 45 atm and i have a few Q's (looked at FAQ bit bout it but didn't find any answers). I have read from eqshaman walkthrough that other spirits spawn but they are pointless and not part of epic. My wuestion is do you have to talk to the other spirits to make Abe and greater spirit spawn?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baldrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its been a long time but from what I can remember its not required that you talk to any of the spirits except for the first one.  After like 15-20 mins Abe will spawn.  You can talk to the spirits before Abe spawns and it doesnt effect the sequence any.  Its a good way to pass the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Confirm, you can just sit there but I chatted with them cause there was nothing else to do.  BTW - There was a mention of one of the spirits down there changing in one of the patch messages recently, log the conversation &amp; see if anything has changed please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>grootz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I just did TOP last night.  I did not have to talk to teh middle spirits at all.  I just had to wait.  I had invis to animals up.  Only saw 3 sharks and none of the Killer ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">heh, guess I was lucky (not that it mattered with invis animals) but I never saw a shark the whole time I was doing ToP.</div></div><hr />
