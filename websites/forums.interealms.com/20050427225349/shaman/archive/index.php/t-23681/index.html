I am  a 65 shm, 5.2k buffed,only 75aa's, most my spells.<br />
Would love to know how a shaman can solo in BoT or doomfire for ornate, decent drops, etc.<br />
Or any other good solo spots people have found.<br />
Getting bored with grouping and getting aa's all the time and could use some upgrades on items, Pls post if you have any comments<br />

<br />
If you want gear advice, post a thread in the equipment forum with your Magelo.  <br />
<br />
Are you 5200hp raid buffed or 5200hp self-buffed?  Big difference in your safety margin for soloing depending on the answer, but realistically if you are over 3500 unbuffed you can in my opinion solo anywhere in Tier3 PoP or below.<br />
Would love to know how a shaman can solo in BoT or doomfire for ornate, decent drops, etc.  Or any other good solo spots people have found.<br />
No offense, but use the Search feature or just read the threads in THIS forum, they are full of how-to's for soloing shaman.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

I suggest you solo in the SolRo tower for ornate. On my server it's usually empty, might be different on yours.<br />
When you zone in, you'll notice that there are 2 roaming mobs. You can single pull them easily. Just wait till one walks away and get the other(the assist and aggro range is fairly big). You need an ER(Extended Range) item to cast/pull and be outside of the aggro range(that's if you are level 65). They are fast, have fairly high MR(slow should stick 95% of the time after Malos) and are immune to movement altering spells like root and snare.<br />
Pull with Malos(don't forget your ER item or they will aggro before you start casting), run back to the zone in wall while spell gems pop back up and slow it. Use HoTs for healing and Tnarg's/Daluda's for emergencies(you might get low sometimes). The mobs have around 40 k HPs, so use DoTs and pet.<br />
<br />
The respawn is fairly long, so you will have to split the pairs to the sides sooner or later and here's how to do it:<br />
<br />
Bind outside at the stones in PoT. Zone in and pull one of the 2 with Malos, both will come. Run in circles and through the middle intersection to make them split(pathing will allow you to split them depending on how skilled you are in positioning yourself). <br />
Once they are somehow split, move them as far as possible from their spawn point(without aggroing the other pair on the opposite side) and gate(you want them to take as long as possible to reset). Zone in immediatelöy and grab one. If by a mistake both of them reaggro, just try to split them again and gate. <br />
<br />
Rinse and repeat till you get one solo.<br />
<br />
Exp is decent. The best before elementals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I really enjoy soloing Vxed, there's a great thread on it a couple links down from this one on the 60-65 main board. Instanced zone soloing is an absolute godsend.<br />
<br />
I would not recommend trying Sol Ro solo until you have some AA's put into Lightning Reflexes (or at least trying it and being REALLY careful with healing) ... standing there and taking a beating, even from a slowed mob, can make it problematic to cast you DOTs, etc. It is sickening how much mobs in Sol Ro will miss you with LR5 -- and it makes it MUCH easier to cast without interruption, IMO.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grathis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">thanks alot for the advice you 2, I'll try that asap when i can get in game, and do you know the name of the mob that drops the onate so i can look it up. Thanks again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">all sol ro trash can drop oranate molds.  nonlegs/nonbp that is...<br />
<br />
btw, doomfire has no ornate mold dropping mobs and you can't solo the EP mold dropping mobs.<br />
<br />
BoT, best to get a chanter buddie and partner for molds here.  there is a list of named mobs that drop molds on alla...you go \to sol ro or tactics for BP/leg ornate stuff.  will prolly need at least a druid+chanter for killing tactics named bp/leg droppers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grathis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not sure why i said Doomfire, wasnt thinking meant Drunder, Fortress of Zek, there is a level 62 mob, it doesnt summon, quite abit of HP's,snarable, i think i may try.<br />
<br />
Heard many shamans try to solo in Drunder and it doesnt work out, anyone have any help there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As galelor already mentioned everything in SolRo tower can drop ornate. Back when I used to farm it, the only piece that the trash mobs weren't able to drop was the BP(they did drop leggings though).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grathis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">And a shaman can solo there?.. Would imagine it would be packed <br />
<br />
I just started playing again, dont remember solro at all,<br />
Any other information on Solro, do you have to have flags,certain spells?<br />
<br />
and thanks for all the help, sorry for all the question:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There are several reasons SolRo isn't packed:<br />
<br />
0)  You have to be flagged to get in<br />
1)  Mobs cannot be snared or rooted<br />
2)  Ornate drops are uncommon<br />
3)  No ZO, you have to gate<br />
4)  XP is poor for the effort you put into it<br />
<br />
The ZI and courtyard areas have the protectors that are all level 65, have huge agro ranges and too many HP.  Once you get away from the ZI you will have to split pairs on almost every pull.  For the time invested to solo here you would probably walk away with more plat and bazaar loot from Droga.<br />
<br />
Your best bet for farming here is to get into the Xuzl caves.  I'm not sure how easy it is to solo, but it is very common to find people boxing here.  Spend enough time here and you very likely can follow a guild who is going to take out Xuzl.  Respawn is an hour so you can follow them up quite a bit after they have moved through.  Your camping spot is right where you are when you use the cup to click up.<br />
<br />
From my time here I expect a full group to get an ornate drop every hour.  That is chain pulling and killing fast.  So, expect that a soloer will see on average 1 piece every 6+ hours.  I have not done the Xuzl camp myself, so the drop rates may be slightly different up there.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps,<br />
