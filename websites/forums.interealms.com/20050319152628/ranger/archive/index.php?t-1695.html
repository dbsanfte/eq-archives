For those who haven't been watching the headlines or listening to the radio this weekend....Layne Staley, lead singer of Alice in Chains (one of the best grunge bands imho) was found dead Saturday in his home. From the reports so far it is unclear as to wether this was from natural causes or possibly a fatal overdose. It had taken till last night after the autopsy to positively ID the body as Staley's, but now it has been confirmed. <br />
<br />
/em mourns the loss of another great influence to musicians of the world.</div></div><hr />

A heroin kit was found next to the body.  You make the call.<br />
<br />
Kind of sad, yes.  Hopefully it will wake up more people who emulate, but I won't hold my breath.</div></div><hr />

And as for the drugs...so what?  I haven't seen too many great/influential artists that haven't hit the drug scene at one point or another this guy just happened to be worse than some.  Scott Weiland-STP, Keith Richards-Rolling Stone, Ozzy, Motley Crue, Poison, Nirvana, Led Zeppelin, The Doors.  The drugs don't really matter in my discussion simply the loss of a good musician.   I hadn't read MTV's information... I hate MTV I go to reliable sources like CNN they just didn't have that info at the time.  Again my error.</div></div><hr />

You know... Stuff like this really makes me proud of Eddie Vedder and Pearl Jam. PJ has fallen in ruts, the lead guitar player most of all, but have come together to help one of other out. *sigh*, only if.  Its a disease.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilucia</div><div class="date">04-22-2002, 08:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was in my early teens when the Seattle music explosion happened. Truth be told I had heard of bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, and Soundgarden before they became popular, and I loved them. Then the &quot;Seattle scene&quot; started to grow because of MTV beginning to play the &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; video. It just snowballed from there and all the other bands from the area got popular as a result of it. I loved it all, and to this day I still frequently listen to AiC and Soundgarden, and several other bands from that era/area. Alice in Chains' music really personifies my teenage years, and I still consider 'Dirt' to be one of my all time favorite albums.<br />
<br />
This kind of hits me hard, because he was one of my favorite singers. Another of my favorite singers died of a heroin overdose several years ago as well (Bradley Nowell of Sublime), and it's always sad to see the same cycle of drug use repeated in anyone. <br />
<br />
I wonder if Jerry Cantrell will keep the band going, or reform the band with the other guys like he did on his solo album...<br />
<br />
/me puts Dirt in the CD player<br />
/mourn</div></div><hr />

Well, Alice In Chains hasn't really been &quot;together&quot; for a while. Jerry Cantrell has been touring around though. He was here in Tucson last year (the night of my really bad bicycle accident which I wouldn't have had if my roommate told me he had an extra ticket, the bastard) and I think he had Mike Inez (bass player) with him. Not sure about the drummer though. From what I remember though, the band minus Layne started another group once it became apparent Layne's health would prevent him from going on. That and the whole thing about Layne and Jerry not liking each other, but I haven't heard any rumors as to why that is.</div></div><hr />

I know he has the credits for most of the drums on the first album.</div></div><hr />
