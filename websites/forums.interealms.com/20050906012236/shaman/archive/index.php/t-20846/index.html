<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya all.  I'm running an ATI 9600XT and I can't seem to see certain particle effects anymore.  I can't see the ring around the Shaman epic, the pink sparklies around my Forgotten Magic orb, the waterfall at the PoJ ent and many others.  Spell effects seem to work fine.  I have checked around the net and can't seem to find any help.  Is anyone else having the same problem?  Anyone know of a cure.  I'm runnning the lastest drivers and all that.  Thanks for any help you can offer.</div></div><hr />

I'm assuming you're running the new drivers Catalyst 4.6 if I remember correctly. <br />
<br />
Is it only your main character that this is happening to? Try creating another char and see if you can see the spell effects target ring etc.<br />
<br />
I logged in one day and found that my spell effects had been tunred off even though on the options menu (Alt-o) they were all turned on. This only happened to my main character Haleice, my trader could still see all the spell effects and target rings. I then checked my eqclient.ini and Haleice_antonius.ini, and one of them had a load of garbage in it. I think it was Haleice_antonius.ini that was corrupted.<br />
<br />
So check those files and see if they are corrupted.</div></div><hr />
