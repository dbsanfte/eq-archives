<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Strik Niine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First of all would like to say &quot;hi&quot;,  have been a reader of these boards for a while now and find them to be very usefull and up to now haven't really had anything to say or ask.<br />
<br />
on that note,<br />
<br />
i am stuck trying to find a Goblin Hextracer in warsliks woods...  noone i have asked seems to know where in WW he spawns.<br />
<br />
anyone have a loc or notable landmark as to where i can find him at?<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He roams is there is no way to pin point him to one spot. what you can do is zone into WW form Cab. Then go to the right till you get to the grass and kill every Lv1-3 mob it sight for hours on end till he pops there for you. But the best way is to get a buddy with tracking to come help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tossen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Also, depending on your level (I didn't even start this quest until I hit 55), they roam all over near the Giant Fort. I was there maybe 3 minutes and two ran right by me. Having talked to others that frequent that zone more than I do they said that they see an abundance of them all around the Giant fort as well. IF you aren't at least in your 20's, I would mayb e not venture up there as the Giants are not really fans of intruders.<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Strik Niine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thanks, will have to lug my friend who's a dr00d to WW to track for me :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually it's to the left if you're zoning to WW from Cab. But yeah, just murder absolutely everything from the pavement to the first set of hills, he'll show up after a little while. Took me maybe 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
This quest isn't worth doing atm though, you'll just get it all done up to the part involving Dlubbish and the rockchanters (who aren't spawning) and get stuck.<br />
<br />
Freaking annoying to struggle through this quest and find out the spawns you need don't exist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oops Yep go left not right :P <br />
<br />
And I belive it is still worth doing just that have it out of the way for when they do fix it. If you read throug all of the quests you can make a cheak list and get a lot of the items ahead of time. While your waitting for them to fix it. I was able to do every thing solo up to the last kill for #7 with in 7 real days. I also used my girlfriends druid to do the forageing that in its self saves a lot of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Strik Niine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">thanks guys,   also if anyone knows what pottery skill needs to be at to do the combines?   took me forever to forage up 1 mendglow clay,  still need one more for the later ones and dont really wanna fail on the combine by bieng too low</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>gummox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Pottery is BY FAR the easiest tradeskill to skill up in.  You can get 122 skill in pottery with 10 plat or less making medium bowls.<br />
<br />
Buy 8 stacks each of:<br />
meduim bowl sketch<br />
block of clay<br />
flask of water<br />
<br />
Combine one each in the pottery wheel, you'll fail more often than you will suceed at first, but that's ok because you only spent 10p so far anyway.  Once you do start succeding regularly, feed your destroy button.  You can't sell them without firing them, and even then they barely worth more than the firing sheet.<br />
<br />
If you're skilling up in Cabilis, there's only one water vendor in West Cabilis.  I don't remember his name, but he's in the cluster of Kloks east of the Necro guild.<br />
<br />
If you want more info on pottery, or tradeskills in general, www.eqtraders.com is the tradeskiller's bible.<br />
<br />
P.S. I'm waiting impatiently for Dlubish to reappear also, I did the mendglow combines with 122 pottery and got the trivial message both times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The Hextracer is pretty common around the giant fort and much easier than getting the skulls from Kurn's :p<br />
<br />
Definitely get your pottery up to about 100 because it is easy to do and a failure will make you cry.</div></div><hr />
