Besides sucking they are Class NONE, Race NONE, and instead of using Archery Skill it uses Thowing.  They aren't even arrows and no class or race can use.</div></div><hr />

It looks like they are just a bridge for fletching anyway (depending on trivial rates). I'll just keep my Luclin arows, thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, I'm a Wood Elf and everything, but Tunare only Arrows?  LAME!!!  I'll feel for the Karana worshiping rangers if this doesn't change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dhiemn</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, why would anyone bother making the two lesser versions of the arrows?  The only difference is the nock, and since when ahs the notch of the arrow adjusted damage??</div></div><hr />

Heh maybe this is their 'fix' for archery... we get to throw the arrows instead of using a bow. lawn darts anyone...???</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think I remember reading something about EQ2 where Verant stated they didn't want players to feel sorry that they chose a particular stat/race/deity.  Hopefully planes of power will reflect this attitude for EQ1 + all of the Karana folks.</div></div><hr />

There's a ranger trying to make a Blessed Arrowheads with Small nock and is failing miserably with 210 skill so....can only hope =) Has anyone succeeded in it yet?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tailoring and smithing have had cultural recepies for a couple of months now.  VI finally got around to adding the same kind of variations to the fletching stuff.  Unfortunately only Elves have new cultural specific fletching recipies from this specific patch. But these recepies have only been in for one day.  How do you know that VI doesn't already have Human or Halfling in the works, just like there are Human and Halfling smithing recepies?  They probably wanted to give us the first load of new trade skill stuff, and we will get more for the other races when there are more available.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Half Elves were left out of the cultural specific  tailoring and smithing because VI said they were half breeds and did not specifically belong to either of the races, so could not do the trade skills.  I don't like it, but i'm expecting the fletching to be the same way.<br />
<br />
As for the Elf recepies themselves, it's because they use mithril, that's why these new arrows are Elf only, just like most of the Elf only tailoring and smithing stuff uses mithril.  And it looks like there are going to be items based on the imbued Emeralds and Plains Pebbles, which will also have the appropriate race restrictions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Roflmaoomfg...hahaha, skill :Throwing, thats the BEST part LOL.<br />
<br />
Now, can we please chase away crack dealers from VI headquarters, and take away their pipes for good?<br />
<br />
<br />
This is YOUR brain on crack- Points at Verrant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jooneau</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone tried combining with imbued plains pebble shards (Karana version of an imbued gem) instead of the imbued emerald shards, if it is even possible to do so?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ueauvan</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">did the imbued mithril and the normal 150 range ones<br />
