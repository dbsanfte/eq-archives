	<p>Ive debated a while about if I would post here or not about what is going on in my life. What I am going to talk about, I have yet to talk to anyone about before, not family or friends other than thoes that are involved.<br />
Let me start with a little back history, If your not interested, you can go to my second post where the meat is.<br />
<br />
I am 26 years old. I first met the girl that would become my wife when I was a senior in highschool. At the time she was the girl friend of my best friend. It was kinda odd. Because my best friend at the time was 18 and she was 14. I was only 16 at the time. We would tease him about it because no one had seen her before and they had been dateing for about a year, so we all figured he made her up. Anyway one day the opportunity came along and I was able to see her in the flesh. I took one look, said "Hi" and turned around and walked away in a bit of horror I guess you could say. She wasnt even 5ft tall and looked about 10 years old had thick glasses and was holding a ferrit. My dad is a lawer and always says 17 will get you 20. I wanted nothing to do with her or my friend in this regard. Bad, Bad, Bad ran through my head. That was the only time I saw her for quite some time.<br />
<br />
Years passed and we graduated from High School went off to collage like the typical american kid. I went to a local community collage to get my first 2 years out of the way. Basics are basics I would say. Why pay $2000 a semester at a state collage when I can get the same for $600 here. My best friend didnt go to collage but started working various jobs and we did spend much time together. Then a cyber cafe called "Hackers" came to town in 1997. It wasnt much. 10 computers networked together to play Quake and Diablo. It didnt even have internet access, just a LAN. I became quick friends with the owner and soon I didnt have to pay a dime to be there. I helped out as he worked 12 hour days 7 days a week. Anyway, I told my best friend about it and we started hanging out there. Things were good. Met a lot of people, and made a lot of friends. Soon the Magic the Gathering craze took hold and more time was spent on that then on the computers. That then lead to a home brew pen and paper game we called "Blades" We started to play that about twice a week for about 2 years.<br />
<br />
I was now finishing my second year of collage. It wasnt going to well. I started off in the wrong math as that was what the counclor recomended and it put me 2 semesters behind in getting my computer science degree. 3 years for a 2 year degree didnt make me to happy. Anyway we were gearing up for a big campaign in Blades. 6 months worth of gaming was comming to a head. We needed a few extra bodies. So I asked my friend if he wanted to play. He was never too big into it, but watched us play a lot and said sure. I also said bring your girlfriend in, the more the better. Besides Hackers was like 20 gyes for every girl that walked in. <br />
<br />
It wasnt like I hadnt seen her at all since that day 4 years ago. She came to a few Halloween parties my parents threw, ect. But I never had much of a conversation with her other than polite greetings ect. I never though much of it and when she started to come in to Hackers, she was treated like a queen from the rest of the gyes that hung out there. Anyway. Pam, my best friends girlfriend now was hanging out at Hackers all the time. I never realy did much with her and soon to me she just became "one of the gyes".<br />
Life rolled on. I met my first girlfriend in collage. A nice foreign exg student from Finland. Long blond hair, Adorable accent, and very intelegent. It was an ill fated relationship though, things were against us from the get go, but it was nice for about 4-6 months. Soon, shcool ended and she went back. I was 19 at the time, I even considered asking her to stay, but we both knew it prolly would not have worked out that way. I havent seen or heard from her since, and I did try but was never successful. On with life.<br />
<br />
School wasnt going so well. Math was kicking my arse. I was always good at it, but I felt it was rushed. Spend a week per chapter, and then near the end its the classic history class cram. 4 weeks of class left and 8 chapters to cover. Cram cram cram, Oh the final is just going to be over the last 3 chapters. fail the final, fail the class. I failed calc 1 5 times before I finaly passed with an A. <br />
<br />
My best friend and Pam had now been engaged to be married now for prolly a good 2+ years if not more. I dont think they ever realy set a date, but they had been dateing for a good 4+ years now. He was 21, She was 18 and I was 19 now. Things were winding down at the Hackers frount. We got internet via a wireless T1 line and everyone was addicted to Ultima Online and Starcraft battlenet. Bout 6-8 months later Hackers closed down due to management neglect. The owner simply was too engrossed in UO he never bothered to collect any money from people who came in to play. <br />
<br />
We kept the group together best we could but it wasnt long before most went their own way. The hardcore of us still played Blades on a regular basis. It was one night with just 3 of us and we were playing Blades. We were not playing the main campaign, but about 1000 years before it. One of the cool things in the game was time travel. I was playing a character that was to be my mains ancestor. Noting was realy going on so we compressed time about 20 years. We were asked if we wanted to get married or anything or what you would like to happen during that time were going to skip. Seeing how I was trying to establish a lineage with my characters I said Yea, Ill get married. The dice were rolled, hell froze over, and it rained blood hehe. Blades is a percentile game. I rolled 2d10 and got double aught 0. or a 100 when I rolled for a wife. 100s are what make blades fun. Its a chaos roll. Anythign can happen. The game can take a complete 90-180 degree turn at the roll of the dice. Once the dust settled, The lady that was to be my wife was Pam's character from about a year ago. But she was 1000 years in the future, how can that be? Well Blades is cool. We made it fit.<br />
<br />
Now both my wife and I agree, this was the seed of our relationship right here. I guess you could say I had blinders on when it came to her. I had known her for quite some time, but never realy knew her beyond that she was my friends fiance. I had never though of her in any other way. She aparently thought differently. That whole gameing session was very cool. Not too long after I was on ICQ and playing UO at home and she sent me a tell. I explained what happend in blades the other day and made light of the situation. She asked if our 2 characters had any kids. I said yea. When I was rolling through that chaos roll I hit double 00 again and we ended up with Twins. Unknowning to me, Pam is a green witch in her religion. When I mentioned twins to her, things changed.<br />
<br />
Soon after we were always on ICQ together and we had one episode of cybersex. I was hesatant to do it. This was my best friends fiance after all. I still didnt think of her in that way either as I still was living with blinders on to these kind of things. I found out that her reationship with my friend wasnt so good. They had put off their wedding indefinatly. Over time I learned she had relations with at least one other gye from our Hackers community. I became her confidant and over time one thing lead to another and we went out. It sucked. It was a spur of the moment kinda thing. I picked her up, went to my place, had sex and it was all over in like 10 min. Like I said, it sucked. Cold pizzia, warm beer and you just slept with your best friends fiance kinda suck. <br />
<br />
A bit of time passed. It was akward and uncomfortable so I decided to do something about it. So I arranged a date with Pam. An elegant dinner, a hotel room, the works. We planned it about a month in advance. The anticipation was agony. But that day came and it was phenominal. It was like the dirty stories you read in magasines. We went at it for over 6 hours. We got off so many times we stopped counting at 10. Beleive it or not, it happened.<br />
<br />
Things after that night were different. It wasnt a spur of the moment accident kinda thing the first time was. This was a planned, concentual meeting. Soon after things completely fell apart between her and my best friend. It all came out how she had cheated on him with people from Hackers and myself. It was ugly. Everyone said mean things, you can imagine and everyone went their own way. This was in the fall of 1998.<br />

	<p>Im finishing up the last of my collage during summer school of 2001.  There was a new store at the mall called Spencers Gifts.  I had a habit of going to the mall about 3 times a week but never went in.  It looked tacky and what it sold, I wasnt interested in.  One day on my way out of the mall, I went by and decided to go in once.  A quick assesment when I walked in revealed what I thought so I started a mosey path that would take me through the whole store so I could see it all and wouldnt have to come back.  I made it about 20% through the store when a girl asked me if I was finding everyting ok.<br />
 <br />
I said yea, just looking, I havent been in here before.  Then I turned, and wow!  This chick was HOT.  I did a full vertical scan and wasnt subtle about it.  Upon a second look it was PAM!  I hadnt seen her in 3 years.  This was not the 14 year old thick glasses ferrit hugging kid I first met long ago.  This was a beautiful well endowed woman before me.  She was working so our encounter was short.  I made it a habit to swing by Spencers as part of my mall routine.<br />
 <br />
Given our past history we mutualy decided to take it slow.  I visited her at work a few times a week.  Phone calls and it was a good 2-3 months before we had our first formal date.  Dinner and a movie.  We saw Tomb Raider.  Things were good.  It took quite a bit of time to get around our past.  Lots of talking, the whole 9 yards.  Things were good.  At the start of 2002 I landed a job at Dell. <br />
 <br />
Dell was a great opportunity.  I was now makeing more money in a week than I did in a month while going to school.  We decided to get a place of our own that was closer to Dell so it wouldnt cost an arm and a leg in gas money going 50 miles each way 5 times a week.  6months after I started at Dell.  I pulled a few strings and managed to get her hired there as well.  To me everything was going very well.  We both had great jobs, our relationship was very strong and we started to plan the future.  We discused marrage, kids, Kid names, everything.  A nice outline was made of what and where we wanted to be in the next few years.<br />
 <br />
In November of 2002 I gave Pam a ring and asked her to be my wife.  There is a funny story behind it.  She was wearing a tin toy ring I had gotten from a vending machine at the store.  I had no money on me at the time so I borrowed the 25c from her to buy it.  She wore it for a very long time, and it lost all of its color and in the end it was a dull tin band.  I had the real ring for a while and I was going to wait till christmass to give it to her but one morning before work she made a comment about the tin one so I reached over and took it off and said "will this one do?"<br />
 <br />
Wedding planning is a pita.  But to make a long story short, we were married on June 20th 2003 in the Paris Paris hotel in Las Vegas.  It was a very nice wedding.  Just family were there and it was the best day of my life.  That whole week, we agreed not to be together so on the wedding night it would be special.<br />
 <br />
Fast forward and life goes on.  We lived together for over 2 years before we got married so things didnt change a whole lot.  However in August of 03 things were not good finacialy.  Before we got married I used my credit cards to pay off all her debts except for her car and studen loan.  It was prolly around 12k in debt, but it was cheaper to have 2 big credit card payments than 6 smaller ones.  However she managed to max them all out during the wedding planning and I wasnt totaly aware of it.  It didnt take long before I did the math and we were in trouble.  We were paying out over 1k a month in credit cards and they were not going down.  We discused it and decided that we would move into her parents place.  It wasnt too far away. only 30 miles from work, but not having to pay rent, phone, and electricity. we could have the credit cards paid off in about 2 years if we were faithful.  The place we were currently renting was a home that my dad owned.  So I went to tell him that things were tight after the wedding and we were going to move out for a bit.  My dad is a lawer so he wanted the rundown on what was going on.  10 min later im fileing for bankruptsy.  combined we had about 54k in unsecured debt.  I told him our plan and he did the math and it was going to be 8 years to pay off the credit cards.<br />
 <br />
To bankruptsy court we go and all debts are wiped accept for my wifes car and her student loans.  I had paid all of my schooling on credit cards so I came out with 0 debt to my name.  It was embarrasing and I never talked to anyone about it.  My mom knows but the rest of my family to my knowledge does not know.  However a 1,200 turn around in finances a month was great.  We had money again.  Our life outline was possable again.  We can save up for a home of our own now and gear up for kids.<br />
5-6 months later its now March.  I had enough money from my job at Dell to pay for everything.  We made a plan.  I would pay all the bills and grociers except for her car and student loan, and she would save all her money so we could move on.  So in all I paid out about 1000 a month in bills and she had about 300.  I didnt pry or ask, but my wife wasnt saving anything, a few times I had to give her some money when she was out.  She was paying her part of the bills, but she would often be out of money within a day or 2 of getting paid.  I was able to actualy put a way a small ammount a month.  Not much, but around $150 or so but it was all I had after paying everything else.  <br />
 <br />
March of 04 a great opportunity came our way.  My wife got a job offer at the Dell headquarters in Round Rock TX.  This was a big thing.  I however did not have a job in Texas.  I went into scrable mode. talked to everyone I knew and got the ball rolling on having a job for me, preferably at Dell.  2 weeks later I had my Job,  turned out to even be better than what my wife got.  All is good in Starbuck land.  We both have jobs in our new location.  The cost of living was actualy less than that of Idaho and we went from $23 an hour to over $30 an hour collectivly in our jobs!  Cheaper living and more money.  What could be better.<br />
 <br />
Mid March we move into our new apartment in Round Rock.  We didnt have much.  We had some bookshelves, an Entertainment center and a washing machine.  We started work and I saved everything I could.  We had no bed and were sleeping on a $30 blow up bed from target.  Our old bed always made my back hurt if I was in it over 6 hours or so.  So I wanted a realy nice bed.  I looked into one of thoes space age tempurpedic foam beds and got a realy nice one for $1200.  Our first major purchase in our new home!  Unfourtunaly my bank card had a $500 point of sale limit and $1000 limit.  So I had to ask my wife to pay the extra $200 when they denied my atm card.  Time moved on.  I bought us a table, some chairs and a couple of desks.  One thing we were missing was a dryer.  I had asked my wife shortly after we arrived if she could buy the dryer, and she said she would, but never did.  <br />
 <br />
Jump to May.  In my mind everything was going fine.  Things were good.  I was starting to be able to save about $400 a month.  Work was hard.  My wife worked banker hours M-F and I worked Double weekends, so we did not have any days off together.  Inconvenient yes, but when I thought too much about it I always came back to the same conclusion that we both had jobs and we were together and myself still in Idaho trying to find a job in Texas.  That was a strong reality for a while and we planned for it if it had happened.  <br />
 <br />
Memorial weekend comes by and her family came down.  This was the first day we had together since March 15th.  Her brother had finished collage and was going to move in with us and look for further schooling here in texas or hopefully get an internship at a game company.  The next weekend was A-con in Dallas.  I worked double weekends so I wasnt able to take 3 days off to go.  So she went with a bunch of her firends and took her brother along.  Before they left her brother asked why we didnt have a dryer yet.  I joked with him and said.  I asked her to buy one a long time ago, but she hasent.  I was hopeing she would get tired of dragging wet cloths to the laundromat and buy one.  I then told him that she got paid the friday of the A-con weekend and I bet she comes home with no money.<br />
The weekend goes by and they had a great time.  All kinds of goodies were brought home.  Sure as chit she came home broke.  $800+ spent in one weekend.  Turns out not only did she run out of money, but she was over drawn.  When we filed for bankruptsy one of the things was the 2003 taxes.  We got back over 2k in overpaid taxes but we cant touch them.  3/4 of it is considered the old estate and can be confinscated.  They may ask for it, or they may not.  But basicaly we were told to put it in the bank and pretend its not there.  Because if they ask for it and we dont have it.  They can reverse the discharge and all that debt can come flooding back.  Well the only savings account we had at the time was hers.  When she overdrew her account it pulled the money and finacne charges from her savings account or our tax money.  Then ontop of it I found out she had even borrowed money from it when her family came down so she could entertain them for the weekend.<br />
 <br />
Inside I was livid about it.  I didnt say anything but I knew I was going to have to have a talking about it.  Last monday, June 7th I came home from work about 10:20 pm (I work the second shift) and my wife is not home.  Not unuseual.  She goes to Kung Fu classes after work and often they go out for dinner when its done.  She got home soon after myself.  I was hitting my NSFW news web pages and checking emails and she came in and said she wanted to talk with me in private. <br />
 <br />
So, we go to the bedroom and she says that she doesnt want to be with anymore, and is looking at moving apart for a while.  She says she has felt this way for a long time.  Even before we moved to Texas.  She said that was difficult for her to make love with me when we did.  I was floored.  I sat in silence for quite a while.  I didnt say much at the time but it was not a good night.  Teusday was one of my days off and she called in to work and didnt go.  We talked that morning about it.  Because of our past I had to ask the questions that I never wanted to.  <br />
 <br />
I asked if there was someone else.<br />
She said not right now.<br />
 <br />
I asked if she wanted to be with someone else.<br />
She said, if its what makes me happy, yes.<br />
 <br />
I asked if she had been with someone else while we were together.<br />
She said, no that any feelings she had for anyone else she kept in check.<br />
 <br />
The whole time she is crying while telling me this.  I wasnt too emotional about it at the time, its not how I am.  She said she had been thinking about it for a while now and it wasnt something just spur of the moment kind of thing. To me it was!  I had no indication this was comming at all.<br />
I had no idea what to do or say.  I thought in silence for an easy 30 min on what to say next.  In the end in my mind, I decided to take the high road.  I stood her up.  Held her in my arms and said.  Pam, you are my wife.  I love you, and we can get through this.  She cried in my arms for a bit.  And then said, "I dont know"  I need some time to think about it, and she left.<br />
She came back about 7 hours later after I called her, asking where she was and if she was comming home.  She didnt have an answer for me.  My life since (its been 5 days now) has been utter agony.  I feel like im 10 years old and gotten into the worst kind of trouble.  I find my self tip toeing around her when we are together,  I havent slept more than 4  hours of sleep the whole time.  Im having stomach problems, diareeha and vomiting and the like.<br />
 <br />
I have no idea what to do now,  I havent talked to anyone about it, but right now my life is in depressed aggony.  So I decided to come to the Glade and see what my fellow rangers wisdom says.</p>

Quite a story. I'd wish you luck, but that eventually runs out.</p>

	<p>First lemmie say I'm real sorry this has happened to you. <br />
 <br />
A few years back I was in a similar situation. I thought my life was going one way, and then she left me. Kinda left me swinging in the breeze, and it took a while to recover. This is what I did, and I don't know if it will help you -<br />
 <br />
1) I did whatever it took to get away from the situation. (I made mistakes here along the way, by trying to spend time with her occaisionaly). <br />
 <br />
2) I got a job, I got an apartment with friends, and I got back into the thing I loved that I had been missing - for me it was Rapier, but for you it might be parcheesee. Basically, I found something constructive to spend my time on. <br />
 <br />
3) I grieved. I took the time to feel what I was going through. I took the time to hate her. I took the time to hate me. Then I took the time to look at it objectively once all that passed. We are well aquainted now, years later, though at first I was a big pile of vitriol. Either way, I did come out stronger for it all. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
The mistakes I think I made were -<br />
 <br />
1) I fell into a couple old habits - smoking being the primary one. <br />
 <br />
2) I gained some weight. <br />
 <br />
3) I went out and got laid just to spite her. That went poorly. <br />
 <br />
4) I drank. <br />
 <br />
5) I cut out my family for a while. I was so concerned they would be dissapointed in me for not actually finally getting married (she was a well-off lawyer) that I stayed away. I should have leaned on them for support. <br />
 <br />
6) I got into a job grind that I should have been out of 2 years ago.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Basically, take your time to mourn the passing. Get a good lawyer, if you can. And work on progressing your life.</p>

	<p>Look into couples therapy.  You might even be able to get it through work, I dont know if you have any benefits plan.<br />
 <br />
Give her time and space, but let her know that you still love her and want to work through the issues.<br />
 <br />
DO NOT do anything stupid to spite her.<br />
 <br />
She would not be talking to you if you if she did not want to TRY to work things out, so take some solace in that.<br />
 <br />
As for your physical symptoms, they are signs of extreme stress.  I suggest that you take some time to do something you enjoy to get your mind off your problems.  If you continue to fixate on the problems you are going to get seriously ill.  Counselling may help.<br />
 <br />
Good luck to you my friend, I have gone through a couple of similar circumstances.</p>

	<p>I see one thing Starbuck.  Your wife has still not grown up.  She may still be looking for that knight to save her from the evil empire.  If you know what I mean.  Just from what you have written and my bitter nature.  She has cheated on you already.  Maybe someone in her Kung Fu class right now.  Maybe someone at work before.  <br />
 <br />
I don't think she was ready to be married.  She has shown in the past that she will readily cheat on someone that she is commited to.  She will never admit to you that she did until things start to get ugly.  And then it will be just to hurt you.  <br />
 <br />
I may sound cold and bitter but its time to prepare for the worst.  Get ready for it, make sure all your ducks are in a row.  You still don't have kids which in this case is a bonus.  I hate to say it but I think its time to move on.  I hope I am wrong on all counts.  I hope things work out.  But for the most part, stay strong and know that here, in the Glade, you will always have an ear or two.</p>

	<p>Times like these are very hard on people. It hurts now. Everyone always says that time heals all wounds but I wont lie. Sometimes it doesnt. But you must ask yourself this question. Do you love her? If so do you not want her to be happy? If she has problems with your relationship by all means try to work through them. Get counceling. Do what you have to do. But in the unfortunate case that it doesnt work out dont beat yourself up over it. I've been in almost the exact same situation before and spent too many years, too many tears, and too much of my life living in the past. No matter which path you end up taking in the end it is going to hurt. I hate to sound like a jerk with all of this. But moving on may be your best bet. Easiest idea but in effect the hardest to accomplish. "If you love someone, set them free" But do not imprison yourself in the process. I dont know. None of us can tell you the right answer. You must do what you feel is right for both of you. Which will probably be chosing the lesser of several evils. In any case im going to shut up now. I wish you luck. And after its all over I hope you find your inner peace. And no matter what happens dont forget to LIVE</p>

	<p>I do have my worries about her faithfulness.  I asked her and she said No.  So untill I have reason otherwise I am takeing her at her word.  I dont want to stress out or sneak around and try to find out if she is lying or not.  That would destroy a part of the relationship, trust, that I feel I still have that is essential for this to all work out.  <br />
 <br />
She also said she felt she had not learned to "be on her own"  That she missed out on the whole collage experience or that she had not learned to manage her money.  She is also bitter about the bankruptsy.  I think she blames me for it, but if you take her car out of the debt, and that I paid off all of hers before marrage and she maxed it all out again, Just as much of it was hers.<br />
 <br />
It was kinda ironic.  I would play EQ or another online game during the day on my days off, and I would log out before she would come home so we could be together, so it wasnt like she was ignored when she came home.  These were teusday and thursday nights.  I am off on wednesday as well, but that is one of her kung fu nights so she doesnt get home till late.  That monday morning before work I turned on the systems and I canceled all my game accounts because I felt they took what time I had and I wanted to do some other things, like mini-painting and start working out again.</p>

	<p>One thing that does irk me about it, is that she has been talking to one of her girl friends back in Idaho about it.  Aparently her firend knows more about our relationship than I aparently do.<br />
 <br />
Her firend has been devorced at least once, maybe more, has 4 kids from at least 2 different fathers.  This is the person my wife is going to for advice?!?  I understand the need for someone to talk to, but this is like getting support for your computer from someone in India who will never own one.  It rubs me raw when we have talked and she says anything that begins with "Well I talked to XXXX about and she says I should ____."<br />
 <br />
 <br />
I remember talking to my dad over the phone a few weeks back.  He asked about our finacial situation and I told him that pam doesnt seem to be able to save any and she has 1/3 the bills I do and yet ive saved more than she.  He said it was hard to talk to your spouce about money.<br />
 <br />
On Wednesday she didnt go to work again and the day didnt start off to great.  I got up and started going through my things.  Clothing, books ect and started tossing them out.  Most were things ive never worn or looked at in years and should have been tossed long ago.  Tee shirts from when I was in High School and the like.  When she got out of bed we went to Sears and I bought a dryer.  (I dont plan on going to the laundromat).<br />
 <br />
When she got home from work on Thursday, we went out to the movies and saw Harry Potter.  I remember monday night when she told me how she felt,  I remember saying, "I guess going to the movies tomorrow (teusday) is out then"  She said she still wanted to go with me.  I remember thinking to myself.  After what you just told me and you want to go out tomorrow,  What a joke!  Anyway.  The movie was good, but it wasnt a very fun night for me.  I tried the sublte things like leaning close to her in my chair, or placeing my hand on her leg, things like that.   Trying to "put forth effort" with out being too obviouse about it.  But I didnt feel anything come back my way.<br />
 <br />
I have a feeling that even before she told me that her mind has been made up about what she is going to do and its a waiting game to see when she finaly decides.</p>

Yes, work out.  A lot!  It is a great way to burn off stress.  A good work out, loud music and believe it or not.  Racket ball.  No better feeling in the world than crushing that ball as hard as you freaking can to have it come back and nail who ever you are playing against.  Just don't laugh until later.</p>

	<p>Thats good Raell.  I think I may take up raquet ball.  I think Dell even has a court or two on campus.<br />
 <br />
Have thought about and forseen myself falling into some of the pits others described.  I normaly call my parents every weekend. (minutes are free on weekends) but I told them I prolly would not be ablt to this weekend as they offered OT at work and im putting in 54+ hours 24 of that gets counted as double time.  I can easily see myself just not calling any more.  Ive already buried myself at work, but I did go in and talk to my manager to try and work out an arrangement and get a weekend day off so we had one together.  I was able to get saturdays off. (starts next week, not this)  And I told my wife about it.  Today I found out that she is going to do kung fu on saturdays.  I asked her:<br />
 <br />
How long have you done Kung Fu on Saturday?<br />
 <br />
Its new and started today.  But im not going this time because I am hung over from last night.  (she went to a friends birthday party last night,  She also didnt come home but stayed the night there.)<br />
 <br />
I said:  I have saturdays off now.<br />
She said: I know.<br />
I said: Ok...<br />
 <br />
It didnt even seem to faze her or click with her that I went through the trouble to get a day off with her.<br />
 <br />
So next weekend I have both Saturday and Sunday (sunday is our 1st annaversery) off.  I have a feeling that is prolly when ill get my answer if she wants to get seperated for a while.  <br />
 <br />
The D word has never come up yet.</p>

	<p>1. She is lying, she has someone else or several prospects that she thinks are as good as done.<br />
 <br />
2. Her support group is there for her, more than likely the friend back home and someone closer who have never had a good relationship themselves and would just love to see your's fall apart too.<br />
 <br />
3. Chasing her will make her run faster.... Don't do it<br />
 <br />
4. She has screwed you out of money now, it will only happen again.<br />
 <br />
5. Forget her and move on, even if you go on and she comes back after you whats the point? She has proven she doesnt have staying power and it will just start to eat at you down the line sometime even if you two manage to get back together.<br />
 <br />
6. I am sure you will heed none of the above but eventually you will be OK anyway, it sucks plain and simple, and regardless of how many polls or whatever say differently this is how most long-term relationships seem to end. Female finds friends and "someone else" and says they want to break up never giving the real reason. In fact your wife and story remind me alot of my own last long term relationship and I have seen it repeated countless times with my friends.<br />
 <br />
7. Lastly let her have everything if there is anything and I mean anything she feels she will have to deal with you on or about then it is just "The Male controlling her" why do all women think all men are out to control them I do not know but it seems to be the biggest single issue out there.<br />
 <br />

	<p>I had thought about that the other day.  Other than the tv and microwave, ive bought everything.  The fridge she has some claim to, but when we moved to Texas, we sold our stove for $400 to her sister,  She was "suposed"  to buy that damned dryer with it but it never happened so i could say there went your half of the fridge.   $200 of the bed is hers, but she can have the linins for it.  They cost more than that anyway.<br />
 <br />
I dont like talking about this in particular because it makes me feel like its already over.  I want it to work out.  Though in my mind, a small part in the back whispers to me and says.  "How can it ever be the same or good again..."</p>

Don't give up on her. Even if she has made up her mind, this doesn't alleviate you of your obligation to fulfill your end of your vows. Keep your weekend day off. Make time for her even if she doesn't reciprocate. Keep making attempts to communicate with her. Try to keep conversation upbeat. Try to make her laugh. You might want to ease off on the affection for a bit.<br />
<br />
My heart is breaking over your situation and I'm sorry for you. What are your's and her's first names? I want to keep the two of you in my prayers that you'll be restored to one another.</p>

	<p>Sorry man, I know thats not what you want to hear.  But you are better off than I was when I was in that boat.  I had to know what was going on.  I went to great deal of trouble to find out.  In my case it worked out in the end and we are still together.  But I was prepaired for the worst.  As you should be too.</p>

	<p>Advice comming from the other end here, having now been the woman who left my advice to you would be to either A get some couples counceling, B talk to her again and again, no judging, just let her talk, she's more likely to let out whats getting her goat if you dont correct her on every point as she trieds to make it, or C both.<br />
 <br />
When I left my husband it was for many many accumulated reason, most of which I wont get into on the public board, but one of the issues I firmly believe was that I hadnt ever lived on my own, and because he had, I became the inferior in matters of life in general.  how could I know what was best if I had never done it etc etc.  My husband was tottaly unaware of my insecurities and grievences, even after confronted about them on multiple occasions, they were always written off as irrational mutterings of PMS etc.  Nothing is more frustrating than talking and not being heard.<br />
 <br />
Talk, LISTEN, and compromise.  if she truely feels the need to live alone for a bit, consider a trial separation, date and live separately so she can test her wings, it may very well be that you two are a perfect match, but that she needs more "seasoning" so to speak and this is what she is sensing.<br />
 <br />
I hope that helped some, feel free to PM me further if you need an ear <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="smile" smilieid="1" /><br />
 <br />
oh! one last piece of advice!<br />
GO TO A DOCTOR.  Your stress symptoms can be dealt with and they SHOULD be dealt with, my husband suffered from chronic panic attacks and we didnt even know about it untill I left him as the symptoms were flue-like rather than hyperventilation as one expects.</p>

	<p>I know the laws regarding community property.  What is mine is hers and vice versa.  Since the beginning we have kept our finances seperate.  No joint accounts or anything, not even a joint gas card.  If it does come to it I dont beleive there will be much of a problem with physical possesions like that.  <br />
 <br />
We make the same ammount of money so I dont see how there can be any alimony, and in all honestly she made more at Dell than I did for about a year till we got to Texas.  I now make more than her but its only $.07 an hour is all.<br />
 <br />
I would like to thank all of you who have posted here today and the advice I have received.  It has made me feel a lot better to get it off my chest so and discuss it a bit, even if its on a written forum.</p>

	<p>I've got a question Starbuck, why are you still in Pam's pants?<br />
 <br />
You have a tough road ahead.  Whether the marriage works or not, its not going to be easy.  As much as I would like to back Screeling's call, my gut feeling is its over and its time to let go before you get hurt more.  My guesses:<br />
 <br />
If she hasn't cheated, she wants to.  She also has someone in mind.  It may not be a guy, and that is just a feeling.<br />
 <br />
Yeah, she hasn't grown up, doesn't want to and you're starting to feel more like Dad than the goofy fun to be with guy that she fell in love with.  Dad is responsible, makes sure the bills get paid, makes the decisions but is in general, boring.  You were the goofy guy she ran 54k in credit card debt up with and wow, now you're not.  A great deal of sexual activity dies when boyfriend/hubby becomes responsible father figure.  In some cases they feel like they're screwing their fathers, and thats just wrong.<br />
 <br />
Its not going to get better, its going to get worse, unless she makes a major growth step.  You are headed for divorce, and my advice is to bring it up first.  Start off with "I don't really want a divorce, but I get the feeling you do.  Is that true?"  Not saying the 'D' word doesn't mean it isn't an issue, just that its going to blow up angry when it does come up.<br />
 <br />
My adivce, get your own support group ready, and move when she says "Yes its true."  Take whats yours, leave anything she has a real claim to.  Let her be the one to look at the half/three-quarters empty apartment and cry.  If you stay, you will be the one doing that.<br />
 <br />
She's done with you, she wants to move on.  Accept that and move on as well.  Sometimes it just doesn't work out, even if both people give it a good try.  She doesn't seem to want that.  You can't make her love you and trying to will just hurt you both more than you realize.</p>

	<p>Seriously, this is a frightening situation, and I am truly sorry that you are facing it.  I myself have never married (still way to young), but this has happened to me in a lesser tier.<br />
<br />
The first thing that crosses my mind is that her replies to your questions were dodgy at best, she didn't give you a straight answer.  And when women act shady, something really is up.  I personally believe that she either has already cheated on you, or has a prospect.  To her your fire probably burned out a while back, this is not uncommon, especially when living together.  I know that when I lived with a girlfriend of mine a while back, she and I would not hang out much outside, because we would have too much of each other inside.<br />
<br />
You did the right thing by continually talking to her, and seeing her, that is always a good step.  But from what I read, she seems rather adamant about her feelings (or lack there of) towards you and the situation.  If she keeps behaving in such a manner, cut her loose.  Don't chase her if she doesn't want to be, you know?  Although she has already hurt you a great deal, don't wait to let her crush you even further, you should end it first.  Though it will be bitter sweet, it will soften the blow a little.  How she would react to such an action cannot be predicted though.  That is, if you cannot change her mind.<br />
<br />
I would hate to see you become part of the divorce statistic.  Best of luck, and don't take all my advice, I am generally a pessmist...but I consider it more along the lines of realism.</p>

	<p>Starbuck:<br />
<br />
<font size="2">I read your post last night and you were on my mind this morning. Like everyone else has posted you have a very rough road ahead. To start, you have to ask yourself a very simple question: <br />
<br />
Is this marriage worth saving? If the answer is no, do not read past this point. If the answer is yes, it is time to cowboy up and deal with it. <br />
<br />
From your very long post I gathered you two were like most couples to naive to know what you were getting yourselves into. That is a life lesson that we all learn. Two, that you were both too immature to make this step, but you did and its time to move forward. <br />
<br />
I come from a line of thinking that when you get married its for life, not so as its the logical next step to dating. I also come from the line of thinking that you are the man, and you should also should be the leader of the house, not Genghis Khan mind you, but a thoughtful, goal driven leader.<br />
<br />
You may think the money is a problem, but actually its a symptom of a larger problem of communication in your marriage. Time to get on a budget, time for oversight and accountability from each other.<br />
</font><br />
<font size="2">My last point is to get into a good church, surround yourself with couples that are succeeding in their marriage. Seek out the wisdom of 3rd party pastor. And get enrolled in stuff that you do together, that means no more Kung Fu classes and no more Blades.<br />
<br />
My message is simple, play time is over. It is time for you to wear the pants in the family and get your head out of your arse. Though the radical feminist movement wants men should be more like them, most women want their men to grow a spine and lead their family, much like a cowboy leads his horses out of a burning barn. In return, all of the other problems in your marriage will subside. Good luck, btw send me an email and Ill send you my toll free cell phone number if you need someone to talk to.<br />
<br />

	<p>Tofu.  I agree with some of your comments.  Money is an issue,  not so much as not haveing any, but its management.  I agree that there has been a breakdown in communications with my wife and I feel ive done as much as I can to rectify that problem currently.<br />
 <br />
I agree with you on marrage is for life.  That was one of the things that hurt me.  I was sure she believed the same thing and when the first thing she mentioned was seperation.  I felt like she was giving up or quiting, without even giving us a chance.<br />
 <br />
I  think you have misunderstood some though.  I havent played Blades or any pen and paper game for that matter in over 6 years.  "play time" was over long ago for me.  I do agree that there is immaturity on Pams part.  She has even told me she felt this way, and hasnt had any time on her own to learn, mature and develop a stronger sense of responsability and accountability.</p>

I apologize then, I kinda got lost in your post.  Too many details for me to keep up with.<br />
 <br />
If she hasn't had time to learn maturity on her own, then you my friend will have to pick up her slack.  Its not going to be easy, and the fine line between overbearing and a loving spouse is even finer at this point.  <br />
 <br />
Sit her down tonight, turn off the television and ask her some real hard questions.  Are we going to work this out?  I'm willing to go all the way if you are, etc.  Then get a pad and pen out and start writing down some short term goals.  Make them easily obtainable, things she would like to see diferently as well as you and what it is going to take to get there.  Be careful not to blame her, call the mistakes just that, mistakes.<br />
 <br />
The money might be a good place to start.  My wife and I never communicated so much until we started doing our monthly budget.  Suprisingly enough, we have more money now, because we are spending it with purpose.<br />
 <br />
The offer still stands about my cell phone number, just send me an email and the number is yours....<br />
 <br />

	<p>My first wife and I tried <i>really</i> hard to keep our marriage together, several times. We spent about 2 years desperately trying to "fix things" between us. Eventually we got divorced, spent a few months not speaking to each other and feeling really awkward when we'd bump into each other, got over it and became friends. We both agreed that what ruined our marriage more than anything else was trying to hold it together when it was too far gone. Either you'll be able to get through this and stay happily together or you won't. If the relationship is really over, it'll only hurt more to keep trying to save it but you might not know which way things are going to go at the time you most desperately need that information. Good luck to you, and I hope that you are able to either come through this still happily married or shake hands and walk away before you both suffer more than you should have to.</p>

	<p>Here is what it sounds like to me, and this is just my own opinion based off of only the information given.  I am not a professional anything and make no attempts to pretend so.<br />
<br />
Your wife needs counseling and has for some time.  I don't mean "You guys need couples therapy."  I mean, she needs to see a counselor.  She is either depressed or has a lot of unresolved emotional issues.  Possibly both.<br />
<br />
From what I am seeing, your wife is trying to fill up some void in her life or at least trying to repress it.  She can't be happy on her own, and so she uses money, change of scenery and even people to fill that void temporarily.  And of course, since these are external things, that void can't stay filled long.<br />
<br />
So now that she can't fill that void with money anymore and being married to you isn't "new and exciting" anymore, she needs another change of scenery.  At least, that's what she believes.  This is not the answer.  The quote "No matter where you go, there you are" has never been so truer.<br />
<br />
She needs to figure out what the hell she wants, or what the hell it is she is trying to repress or fill in her life.  She needs to be able to do it internally and not try to do it externally. She needs counseling.   Getting her to see that may be the trickier problem.  But, from what I am seeing, that's the problem right there.<br />
<br />
Unless you're holding back a lot of info and stupid mistakes you've done on your part, that's what I'm seeing.  <br />

	<p>she is cheating on you.  apologies for my blunt manner, but it is the truth.<br />
<br />
divorce laws in this country favor the female so much you need to start looking to protect yourself.  get a clandestine recorder for your phone, motion sensing cameras, maybe hire a PI to follow her life.  If you can prove the unfaithfulness in a court of law, you will save your bacon from the frying pan.<br />
<br />
relying upon other people's sense of decency in these kind of situations is asking for it.<br />
<br />
Good Luck.  Your road is not going to be easy.</p>

	<p>(1) Get advice from a professional who shares your values regarding marriage.  We're not professionals.  A marriage counselor has heard it all, dozens and dozens of times.  A professional will have a much more accurate sense of what might "really" be going on, and how things should go from here.<br />
 <br />
(2) Yes, you were both young and not always smart.  That's life.  Things aren't going to be easy, no matter how well your situation might eventually work out.  But it's time to be a man--reject passivity, accept responsibility, and fight for what you want.<br />
 <br />
(3) Get financial counseling. <br />
 <br />
(4) You're hurting.   Be willing to ask for help from your extended family and church.<br />
 <br />
(5) If I were to recommend a book, I might recommend Harley's "His Needs, Her Needs."</p>

On the other hand, you should write a novel.  I can't really say why, but I read through the entire story and I was completely immersed in it.  Your thoughts are very organized and I think you could be a very good writer - if you have some spare time, write a short book (on the computer so you have spell check <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="smile" smilieid="1" />), I think it would probably be pretty good.</p>

	<p>I don't know you or your wife so it is hard to see the complete picture. My only suggestions are the following. <br />
 <br />
1. When you were in dept up to your eyes balls and you went and filed bankrupty. There are many organizations out there who could have helped you there and saved your credit rating. An example of this is called CCCS (Consumer Credit Counciling Service), they work with the people you owe money to, most the time you end up not having to pay interest and end up with a much smaller bill per month. They saved my husband and I from financal ruin, like you we were young and had many depts.<br />
 <br />
2. You and her are husband and wife, you are both togther in you financial matters. With each paycheck and each month it would have been better if you both would have got together and payed the bills and balanced your checkbooks. In that way you might have seen the money problems coming at you sooner and found a way to prevent what is happening.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Good luck to you, I only wish i could help you more.</p>

My thoughts exactly...but, as that is not the path you chose, I would run like the wind and get out.  But first, call you Father.  Ask him what you need to do in order to protect your assests, and consider hiring a PI because I would bet that his findings will save you from the 50% ruling in court.  You have free legal advice from a trusted source, use it.<br />
 <br />
By getting out now, at worst, you get out of a bad relationship with 3 or so years until the bankruptcy falls off your credit.<br />
 <br />
I fear if you stay, you will only get hurt worse and be in utter financial ruin.<br />
 <br />
*disclaimer with a twist*<br />
I do not know you in person or have an intimate knowledge of your situation, but I too live in Texas (moved from Colorado) and there are pleanty of southen girls down here that will appreciate you, especially in Austin <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt="" title="big grin" smilieid="4" /></p>

	<p>1) She is cheating on you, she has her "Fall back" guy. She might have started going to Karate class, but either the guy she likes is IN this class, or she dosent go to class any more and just goes and sees him.<br />
 <br />
2) You need to get away from the situation. It sounds to me like your a fairly responsible person, and from your post , she sounds like a little kid. I mean come on, blowing 800+ bucks on a convention?? ***..<br />
 <br />
3) Get a diffrent appartment or what ever you have to do, but get out. Great advice from someone i dont remember who, but she has obviously made up her mind, and anything you do or say, will just further convince her that she should leave.<br />
 <br />
Truly sorry this is happening to you. I have been in a relationship somewhat like this. Same dam thing happend. <br />
 <br />
1) she could not take care of her responsibilites,<br />
 <br />
2) She had some guy who was cool and fun, not responsible and dependable. She "Started Dating him" 3 days after we broke up (bull****)<br />
 <br />
3) she made up her mind and left me. No matter what i said or did helped.  Only good thing is we were only engaged, not married.</p>

	<p>Its been a week since this began.  As of now I dont thing much of anything has realy improved or worsened.  <br />
 <br />
One thing that has degraded is my health.  On Sunday I started to get ill and have been down to this day.  I am recovering and I can confidantly say its all stress and lack of rest related.  It does irk me some as its interfearing with my job at Dell.  Bout the only way to get fired from Dell outside of blant insubordination is attendance, and I dont have the senority behind me in Texas like I did in Twin Falls.<br />
 <br />
Ive given many thoughts about our relationship and entertained many ideas and scenarios.  From the fanciful to the ones I wish I never would have had to give thought.  Ill admit, I may be wrong and only someone trained or a councerlor of some kind could tell me for sure as I just dont know.  They say hindsight is 20/20 and ive given it a lot of looking, but I cannot honestly find any fault of my own that would have made this come about.  There are things I wish I could have done differently but they are all minor.<br />
 <br />
Ive always worked the late shift since ive been at Dell.  Even during training I had the 4:00pm to 1:00am class.  My wife likes to go out dancing and always asked me to go with her,  But an easy 9-10 times it would be on a night I work and I never saw the point of going out after midnight when I got off work when everything closes less than an hour later.<br />
 <br />
You could say ive been trying to find the fault in myself.  It would be very easy for me to place the blame for this upon her, but I honestly dont think that its right.  It takes two people to have a marriage.  To place the blame on her would be the low road out.  I am her husband.  Its my responsability to be there for her support and help with anything she needs.  <br />
 <br />
There have been times when I have thought.  "When is it my time to be selfish".  When should I stand up and say its enough and push back and put my needs first...  In my mind, that would be too easy to do, and I think it would be the worst thing I could do.<br />
 <br />
All I truely have at this time is hope.  We will talk about things and after it will seem like things are going to work out.  The issues are on the table and the emotions laid bare, and I start to feel better.  But every time she will end up saying something, usealy about seperation, and my candle of hope is blown out and I have to find a way to light it again.<br />
 <br />
The thing I fear the most is the uncertanty.  I know regardless that she is going to have to have some time on her own as she works out whatever it is she needs to do.  It would be too easy for me to lie to myself and expect that without worry that she will go out, find herself, and come back and all will be well...<br />
 <br />
Today I received an Email from my wife at work.  One of the things she has always wanted to do at Dell is be a part of one of their overseas training programs.  She has applied on 3 other opportunities over the past 2 years and have always been turned down.  This time its different.  I dont have all the details yet, but sometime in mid July, she will be going to Manila in the <font face="Arial"><font size="2">Philippines for 2-3 months as she trains people at a new Dell facility there.</font></font><br />
 <br />
<font face="Arial"><font size="2">This seems to me to be one of the better ways for it to be.  She had suggested getting her own apartement, or moving back to Idaho for a bit and even moving into the spare bedroom here for a time.  I never realy liked the idea of her going back to Idaho as I felt it would be easy for her to get there, be with her family and old friends and decide not to come back.  I definatly hated the idea of her getting her own place here in Texas.  Moving to a diff room in the apartment was the choice I would have prefered, because in the end, she would still be here and I wouldnt die of worry and doubt.  Even with the job move for a time im still going to worry, but I can worry for much different reasons.  I only hope it will be what she needs.</font></font></p>

	<p>Hopwin, I understand how you see it that way and i'll admit it does seem an ill fated thing to do.  It did take us a long time to get through our past.  3 years went by when I never even saw or heard about her.  When we did by chance meet up again.  It was 2 years after that before we got married.  Things change with time.</p>

	<p>One friend's wife left stating she needed to find herself. She was more of an artsy type, who read books and was a bit more cultured (though she was a decent athlete, liked camping and golf). <br />
 <br />
They ended up getting back together and are doing well with 2 kids - so there is some hope.<br />
 <br />
Having said that, she is fiscally irresponsible (really, really, fiscally irresponsible) and doesn't seem to be telling the truth to you. Her past history of cheating is not a good sign. <br />
 <br />
Things could always be worse. You have a job, you have your health. Talk to your doctor or a psychologist if you find your health is being affected. Try to get some exercise to burn off the tension (I recommend exercise for everything.)</p>

	<p>Im sinking.  I feel like im neck deep in quicksand and all my efforts to save this have gone in vain.<br />
 <br />
I bought and read a book called His needs, Her needs that I felt would help understand what was going on.  I feel like I understand how things have gotten this far but I also simply feel like ive never been given a chance.  Ive spoken to my mother about my problems and she isnt much help because she has no perspective on things and her values on Honesty, loalty and trust are too close to mine we simply cant fathom the situation I guess.<br />
 <br />
My 1st year anaversery is this weekend and right now I have absolutely no desire to try anymore at this point and just take it as a break/vacation from work.<br />
 <br />
