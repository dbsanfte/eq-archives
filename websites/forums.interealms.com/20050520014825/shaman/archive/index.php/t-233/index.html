<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If you could kill an Alchemy herb vendor, loose all skill points in<br />
Alchemy, but get back all of the money that you invested, would<br />
you?<br />
<br />
If so, what would you do with the money?<br />
<br />
Buy the fast horse?<br />
<br />
Buy your ultra rare spells?<br />
<br />
Upgrade your armor?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I like being able to make gate, ds, and sow potions for my friends.  No, I wouldn't take it back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Money is easy to come by for me. I'd get back over 30,000 plat if I did do it, but I wouldn't. I like having gate potions, especially now that Cazicthule is a high level zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">nah...alchemy is useful.  gate potions are nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tailen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nah, I'm probably only in the hole 500pp right now.  I'll take the time for alchemy if A) They make it truely worthwile, like the impressive skill it sounded like when I first hear of it. B) I start using platnum pieces as coasters, I have so much.  Or 3) I spend the time and energy on getting Alchemy Mastery so I actually have a passable chance of success. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmm ok someone tell me how to make a poll post.. I can't seem to find the buttons with the new board design hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sorta, yes.  I would just do the skill gains again though. I would decrease my skill costs by at least 50% with current prices.  The difference that i spent to get to 180 and what it takes to get to 180 now would probably grant me somewhere around 100k minimum.<br />
<br />
<br />
I had alchemy skill maxed during the first incarnation of alchemy where skill maxed at 82.  I spent about 80-100k getting to that point (money was easy to get before they nerfed the wood elf outpost in lfay :)), and then maxed before the price cuts on current alchemy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would not do it at all. I use gate potions at least once a week. And I can darn well guarantee you I do NOT want to work the skill up again lol. The day I click that crap over and over again like that is the day I am officially crazy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Akhilles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For me, its a worthless part of the game. First of all, yeah perhaps I'm bitter (shut up Tulkor) about never being able to acquire money, but what's more, the craft (and I use that term loosely) takes too many resources, failure rate is extremely high, and there is barely any of the potions that are simply outstanding and that aren't copied by some class' line of spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hehe, I'd do it all over with my philosopher's stone.<br />
<br />
Or, I'd get all those things Kbok mentioned and more.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Braxton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Being that I only spent about 7-8K to get to 165, I wouldnt do it.<br />
<br />
Braxton</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm with Mogur on this one. I'd get my money, and then re-max my alchemy skill again at today's current prices and easy skill increases (grow potions)<br />
<br />
I too was foolish enough to make alchemy a priority when it was horribly broken and use to cost tons of pp to raise. Even so bad as to have hunt down all the hard to get regents for the original recipes.<br />
<br />
I'd net at least 80kpp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I too was foolish enough to get to 161 skill, with the old prices. I<br />
really thought the gate potions would sell, but very few people<br />
on my server are interested in them. Actually they are interested,<br />
UNTIL I tell them the price. The locations leave a bit to be desired<br />
as well. Innothule Swamp is the only one that anyone's been<br />
interested in. <br />
<br />
I wish I'd never spent the money on this skill. If I could recoup <br />
the money in exchange for loosing the skill points, I'd do it in a<br />
heartbeat and buy the fast horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">No way, Alchemy is what sets shamans apart. It makes us the most universal spell class in the game counting our melee skills. We cant gate as well as wizard/druids, but we can do it. We cant DS as well as a Mage, but we can do it. We can create better resists though with spell lines and alchemy. We can IVU and invis all that crazy cool stuff. <br />
I just wish we could use the potions on the damn pet :/ or if we can, I'm doing it wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zoichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hind sight is 20/20.  Even though i dont see the point atm, i am going to use the philosophers stone to raise skill to max.  But no way will i invest a point into AA alchemy.  I just see alchemy as a part of me, a part one day i will hopefully be proud of and can pass along.</div></div><hr />
