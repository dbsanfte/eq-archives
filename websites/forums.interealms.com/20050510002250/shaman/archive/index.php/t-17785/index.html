<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'll admit, my LDoN experience isn't exactly vast.  I've been in a few groups with my guild, but they're all pretty much pulled ahead of me in the experience treadmill and are now 65s.  As I'm still 58, it's pretty much impossible for me to get a group with my guild at all, let alone in an adventure.<br />
<br />
I've also done several adventures with pick-up groups, including two this Saturday.  We lost one, won the other.  I think I'm about 3-7 overall in adventures (aside from the ones I've 3-boxed).  Not particularly impressive.<br />
<br />
I realize that one logical conclusion might be that I suck, and am dragging down my groups.  Don't think that thought hasn't crossed my mind more than once.  But I honestly don't believe that I'm the (only) reason we're failing.  As a shaman, the worst thing I can do (within reason) is not keep adequate buffs on the melee-types or slow quickly enough.  I always use a pet, and throw slow/cripple on every mob as soon as is possible without pulling agro.  I DOT when I have the mana, but rarely have KEI, and I'm only 58, so no Torpor or Canni V.  I do use my JBB quite a bit between Canni's.  Even a lousy shaman shouldn't be able to prevent a group from winning - but I'm in losing groups probably 75% of the time.<br />
<br />
We just don't seem to kill quickly enough to come anywhere near finishing easily.  If we win at all, it's at the last minute.  I'm reading about how people are blowing through these things with unbelievable speed in 40 minutes or less.  I've heard that the LDoN adventures scale in difficulty, where twinked players in their 30s can easily win, while players in their 50s and 60s have a relatively tougher task.  But I'm reading from players at my level or higher that are having no trouble at all, and I'm just wondering how in the heck you're all doing it so easily.<br />
<br />
In the groups I've been in, we typically lull/pacify before pulling from large rooms, so we don't end up with huge pulls.  In pick-up groups, it's pretty tough to effectively handle those types of pulls.  So we generally end up with singles, or maybe doubles.  I'm wondering if highly-successful groups do a lot of AOE with large pulls, or just have insane DPS and never stop running, or have some other tactic that none of my groups has thought of.  <br />
<br />
Fundamentally, I understand that it's all about dps.  The quicker you kill a mob, the faster you can move on to the next.  But there has to be more to it than that - mana is still limited for most characters in their mid-to-high 50s.  I wonder if our pullers aren't pulling aggressively enough, or we don't move up often enough (pulls too long back to group) or we don't nuke enough.  Or maybe our group compositions have just been extraordinarily bad and even capable players in the wrong mix can't win these things.  I doubt very much it's the last possibility.  I suspect you could take almost any 6 classes and win if they were played properly, even without superior equipment.<br />
<br />
Just wondering how you all do it so easily - any advice or suggestions would be appreciated.  At this rate of success, I'll be lucky to have 200 points by Christmas.<br />
<br />
Just for reference, I'm a level 58 Ogre with IH4 (ornate sleeves), MP4 (ornate boots), BA3 (bone clasped girdle), EE3 (Amulet of Insight) and that spell haste effect from the Wicked Bone Atlatl.  If there are other focus effects I should pick up, those suggestions would also be much appreciated.<br />
<br />
I would just like to win some of these things with a little breathing room, instead of it being such an intense, stressful sprint that usually ends in disappointment.  They're still fun, mind you, but would be more fun if we won.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have more wins than losses and you want to know the secret about LDoN? It isn't high dps and it isn't being top notch. It is all about pulling.<br />
<br />
Pulling is the single most important thing any player could do to help their group to win an adventure. Anytime there is not a mob in the group getting beat on, that is lost time. Any time the puller has to run over 30 seconds after a mob dies to get another into the camp; lost time. If your melees are pulling, you are losing dps.<br />
<br />
The best way you could get the wins for yourself and any pick up group is learn how to pull. Our dps isn't something that needs to be in the camp for it to happen. You can sick dog, toss a rain, use a dot, but after that, you are just sitting in the camp canning or staring at the mob while it dies. Use that time to fetch another so your dps is constant. Make sure your group moves with you so you don't have overly long pulls.<br />
<br />
A shaman pulling in LDoN is great because you can pull while the group is still finishing up the last mob. You can bring an already gimped mob into camp ready for its demise. I usually start pulling about 20% on the mob, depending on how far I have to pull and the group's dps. You can root split mobs. You can use aggro pulling. I actually had to teach an SK last night on how to aggro pull because he was so hampered by FD pulling (which is too slow for LDoN). If you don't know what aggro pulling is, you get semi close to mobs and start sitting down. They will eventually aggro onto you, but the best part is if there are a ton of mobs in a room, the closest aggros only come onto you. You can split a room of 6 by just doing this. If you root or use slow you will usually aggro more than just the close ones. I was taught aggro pulling by a beastlord (Silvermaene) and best thing I ever learned for LDoN.<br />
<br />
If you don't feel comfortable with pulling, then always get a bard for your groups. Bards are THE best pullers for LDoN, hands down. Don't let anyone tell you different. They can single pull until the sun goes down and their dps isn't all that super that by them leaving the camp it will take the mob forever to die. My 60 bard gets tells constantly for LDoN because I have shown groups just how great they are for pulling and making groups better. But that is off the subject.<br />
<br />
If you get a chanter instead of a bard, that is just as good. Have the puller bring 2 -3 at a time so you always have mobs in the camp.<br />
<br />
So what is the moral of the story? Learn how to pull. If you rock at it, people will remember and always want you for groups. It just takes practice and the willingness to die to learn how to do it. But isn't that what EQ is all about?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You say:<br />
As I'm still 58, it's pretty much impossible for me to get a group with my guild at all, let alone in an adventure<br />
I say:<br />
I would get a new guild, sound like a-holes to me. <br />
<br />
A 58 shaman with 5 65's in an adventure is a liability, do adventures with other people closer to your level for more chance at sucess.<br />
<br />
Even better, start your own groups, concentrate on one Wayfarer Camp, get to know people, use high DPS classes.<br />
<br />
A great group make-up that can only fail if people suck is....Pally (or warrior or SK at a pinch), Bard (or chanter), Druid (possibly cleric), Ranger/Rogue/Monk, Ranger/Rogue/Monk, and yourself.<br />
<br />
Dunno who can do what at waht level as I have been 65 for too long and dont play alts, Pallys are for stun/tank, Bards are for lull/pulling, Druid rather than cleric cause at your level Harmo is probably a must (like I said I dunno levels below 65) and then some DPS plus you.<br />
<br />
Stick to either high collects (26+) or slaughters.<br />
<br />
Alpha your pet<br />
<br />
Get KEI<br />
<br />
Make sure your pullers chain pull<br />
<br />
Dont let anyone piss about with chests and NPC's lying down.<br />
<br />
If I think of some more things I'll post em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Meku hit the nail on the head, IMO. It's all about how you handle your pulls. FD pulling is horribly slow and not well suited for LDoN. The best group I have been in was a Warrior, Rogue, SK, Paladin, Cleric, and me. Paladin was pulling with Pacify, SK was main tank. As soon as the mob got to 30%, the Paladin would leave and go get another. There was very little time where we didn't have a mob on hand to take care of.<br />
<br />
On the Pacify thing - last night I was in a group that I was pretty sure was doomed from the get go. 2 Warriors, Monk, Beastlord, Druid, and Me. Warriors were pulling 2-3 mobs each pull, but everyone was doing a great job at playing their roles, so we were ripping through mobs. Druid and I were pulling adds off with slow/snare and parking them out of the way. Because we were forced to kill so many mobs at once, we completed the dungeon in about 45 minutes. That includes one Druid death after he pulled agro from 4 mobs by overhealing. I don't think it's a must if everyone knows what their doing, but it does make things a lot easier.<br />
<br />
So, yea, the key is not how fast you kill mobs - it's how much downtime you have. If you can't keep moving, you're going to lose.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Only advice I can offer - get a grp where everyone is within 1 level of each other.<br />
<br />
The dungeon is based on your grps average levls...it appears the breaks are at 63 / 58 / 53 etc.<br />
<br />
Above 63, you get a lvl65 dungeon, between 58 and 63 you get a lvl60 dungeon, 53 - 58 is a lvl55 dungeon, etc etc.<br />
<br />
The differences between the dungeon levels are *considerable*.  <br />
<br />
I have joined a grp of lower lvl friends where our average level was ~57.8 and since I was 62 the dungeon was pathetically easy (a lvl 55 dungeon).  I could single pull everything, we romped through dungeon with plenty of time to spare.  Most of the other people in the grp were 55 - 59.<br />
<br />
Next night, SAME grp with 1 substitution put our average level at 58 even, and we got a lvl60 dungeon.  We wiped on the 2nd large room.  I was pulling 3 - 5 mobs at a time, and we had no way to deal.  Everyone in the grp was amazed at our loss, but we simply couldn't handle the dungeon...most chars in the grp were STILL 55 - 59.  Same theme (Ruj), same grp (except a druid), BIG difference in mob difficulty.<br />
<br />
At lvl 58 you are right on the bubble - you could get dungeons that are lvl60, which are the exact same dungeons a full grp of 62s would get.  <br />
<br />
(Hope this makes sense, I tried not to ramble to much.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm about 50/12. Half those 12 being losses only because of some idiotic Collection that was impossible to begin with.<br />
<br />
Always keep in mind a group average of under 63 is a hell of a lot easier than a group average of 63+. It's possible you may have been mainly grouping with high level players and your average was 63+. At 58 it might be real tough for ya.<br />
<br />
Always get KEI. We may preach how we don't need it but usually that's the Torpor/Q + Cann 5 people who say that. (And even then it's always nice to have)<br />
<br />
Don't bother with cripple. Waste of mana in LDoN... maybe useful in hard adventures against a final boss but I wouldn't know first hand. Use that mana to cast your rain spell instead and add in some DPS.<br />
<br />
Buy some mage toys before ya go. get the hand of Ixibalt until you get 61. Blade of wrulan I believe doesn't proc until you get True Spirit at 61.<br />
<br />
You really need to adjust to your group. I usually group with friends and guildmates so I always know what to expect. The only time we ever single pull is when I'm playing with my 65 bard friend. As Meku said, Bards make the best pullers in LDoN, period!<br />
<br />
With a good chanter who's on their feet, don't bother with split pulling. Get yourself Tigirs Insects if you don't already have it and help out. Puller brings back 3-4 mobs. Chanter AoE mezzes, you AoE slow. Follow up with Turgurs on all the mezzed mobs and the chanter will love ya. VP 3 is great too for splitting the mobs and keeping them spread out for everyone.<br />
<br />
That's all i can think of for now. good luck! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">1) Group should be close in level. Tank and puller can be a little higher. Cleric/druid can be a little lower. Shaman needs to be up there in level to not have to debuff  for every slow. Form your own group if possible. Make a friends list based on successes and players who play well in failures. Hardest to get is healer--try a druid. Second hardest is bard or enchanter. Then you want 1 tank and 2 dps. Melee dps are better, since they dont run out of mana. Rangers are nice for tracking, rogues for post win chests. <br />
<br />
2) Pick a slaughter. Wait however long it takes to get one. I have never lost a slaughter with even a gimp group. <br />
<br />
3) Dont Pacify. Dont FD. Bards are best pullers. <br />
<br />
4) You win with plenty of time by everyone running room by room and puller having melees fight constantly. It helps to have maps and know dead ends to sprint back through cleared areas.<br />
<br />
I recommend buying your augury spells--group members like it that you can open chests without killing them. Also run the Blood of Nadox quest. Timing the casting with the bashing of a chest gets a lot of oohs and ahhs. <br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You say:<br />

<br />
If you are referring to Harmony or Harmony of Nature, I think those are outdoor only spells and wouldn't work in LDON.  Clerics have spells like this that work indoors so I don't think this would be a reason to choose Druids over Clerics.  Of course you may be referring to something else and I may have completely misunderstood what you were saying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A lot of good advice here.  I'll second the thought that both Tigir's Insects and Virulent Paralysis are excellent in LDoN.  A competent puller can usually manage to get at most 3-4 mobs at a time without pacify.  Unless you're doing a hard dungeon, a 4-pull of mobs, most of which are slowed 50% on incoming should be very easy for your group to handle.  Aggressive pulling + tigir's insects = WIN.<br />
<br />
You might consider not joining groups with enchanters unless they're using charm.  Too much overlap between shamans and non-charm enchanters.  No reason a shaman can't handle crowd control in ldon.<br />
<br />
The only losses I've had in LDoN are when I have a timid puller or when the server crashes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">A couple of things to think about.<br />
<br />
If your main problem seems to be running out of time, this can either be a DPS problem or a pulling/CC problem. What is your typical group composition? At this level, having a solid melee DPS or two can make a big difference. You're not likely to be grouping with uber-equipped and AA'd toons at 58, so focus on the basic damage dealers. Rogues, mages, monks, rangers, necromancers, and beastlords can all fill this role quite effectively. A chanter or necromancer with the skills to keep a charmed pet will often outdamage your entire group, so this is also an option.<br />
<br />
A typical group you might look for is:<br />
<br />
Cleric/Druid<br />
Tank (warrior, SK, paladin, ranger/monk if well geared)<br />
Shaman (that's you)<br />
DPS<br />
DPS<br />
DPS<br />
<br />
As long as you keep the melees hasted, you should be golden in this sort of group. Ideally, you will be the one doing the pulling. Keep a mob in camp and a mob or 2 on ice at all times. If there are extended periods where your DPS is not engaged in killing mobs, that is the root of your problem. Pulls must run together like in a chain-pulling xp group. There should nearly always be a mob for the tank/DPS to be working on. <br />
<br />
This is the time to make those root-parking skills shine - give your DPS a steady stream of slowed mobs to kill and the points will flow. You don't have backspawn to deal with, so just park the mobs behind where your group is fighting. Use the suggestions in this thread to keep the pulls manageable. Slow aggro is a valuable tool on when adds come on a pull, be sure to use it to pull mobs off the group for root parking.<br />
<br />
Don't bother using Cripple. The most important things you can do are a) slow all mobs, b) keep the melees hasted, c) crowd control. Your personal DPS contribution is less important than making sure your real DPS is kept busy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">On the Pacify thing - last night I was in a group that I was pretty sure was doomed from the get go. 2 Warriors, Monk, Beastlord, Druid, and Me. <br />
-Tok<br />
<br />
Heh, you just about described my ideal group there. 2 plate tanks, a monk to pull and a bst (and monk) for DPS. <br />
<br />
As a couple of people have mentioned, pulling is the key. Minimize time pulling and you should be able to cruise through with almost any mix of classes. I still prefer monks for that job, one that doesn't try to split everything but can feign off on a rough (4+) pull. You don't spend time splitting, just set an off-tank order, get the DPS people to assist the main tank and let the carnage begin. I don't like to pull in that kind of a group, much rather have someone that can take a beating and keep the mobs bunched up while I can cast tigir's so a monk or any plate tank for pulling. <br />
<br />
Shaman actually makes one of the better offtanks, I think. You're self-sufficient heal wise, can throw a slow and a dot to keep agro and the group doesn't loose much DPS if you're offtanking. DoTs are useless if you aren't tanking, if only because of agro. I'll usually have a rain loaded for the times I'm not tanking, always seemed a bit more efficient than our ****ty nukes. <br />
<br />
You might also want to work on mana conservation a bit. Cripple is pretty much worthless in LDoN and even slow is situational. If it's a single pull and the mob isn't slowed by the time it's down to 80%, don't bother. It's gonna be dead fast enough anyway. Your job with slow is to save the main healer mana but you're wasting mana if you land a slow at half.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Don't DOT. When DOTs are becoming effective in LDoN adventures, you are already killing too slow (rare exception in my opinion: when root parking is used for CC and you got DOTs with no initial DD). Don't cripple.<br />
<br />
Try to limit the lulling/pacifying to the necessary minimum. When puller can prevent adds quick, OK. But i have been in some groups, where the puller literally spent a minute to check out/pacify every single room. And every pickup group should be able to handle pulls of 3 (theoretically ...). Move with the puller as soon as possible and make pulling distance as short as you can (of course with some breathing room between you and the puller to let him do his thing).<br />
<br />
Look out for people, you already grouped with and trust. There is no 'ideal' pickup group normally, but at least you can try and increase the average quality a bit.<br />
<br />
Didn't check all posts if it was already mentioned before, but make sure, your tank is at least average or better above average of your group level (especially when you want to try and increase your pulling pace). As long as the tank isn't going down and the crossdressers err casters in the second line know, what they are doing, you should be fine  ;) <br />
<br />
If you feel, the adventure is maybe difficult to win (strange group make up, lowish people,...), insist that all buffing/prepping is done and ALL members are full health/full mana before zoning in. If that doesn't work, LDoN is the perfect point to start a 'no group'-list.<br />
<br />
One more point, if you are doing assassin, take your time with the boss mob (if you have time, that is). Check out situation, look for possible adds .... Nothing sucks more than doing fine the whole adventure and then someone screws the final fight being impatient.<br />
<br />
Can't think of more at the moment, but hope at least some of those may help.<br />
<br />
Can i have your boots?  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Take heed of #4 above...<br />
<br />
Pulling = lost time. Avoid it when you can and move to the mobs instead of taking twice as much time for someone to go pull the mobs and bring them back to you.<br />
<br />
Moving room to room is the best way to cut down the time it takes per adventure.<br />
<br />
If you are on an assassinate and have a bard or someone who can pacify, wait until you get the commotion message, then lull/pacify as far as you can toward the target. This saves a huge amount of time. Of course the people in the group have to avoid aggroing the lulled/pacified mobs, ie running too close to or over them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">/agree - Pulling is the key, and Bards are the best. There is no time to FD split in LDoN.<br />
<br />
My favorite group is:<br />
Bard - pull/buffs/dps<br />
Pally - ma/group heals<br />
Shaman - heals/slows/buffs, VP if needed<br />
3xDPS - any combo of Rogues/Rangers/Wizards/Magicians<br />
<br />
I am usually on the phone with my Bard, which helps immensely. If my Enchanter is online, we take him instead of one of the DPSers, because the three of us on the phone rock - Bard says three incoming, names them, I will VP one, Chanter will mez another, all on the pull; I HoT MA and then slow mob 1. Last mob at 50, Bard goes hunting again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thus far I have about 80 wins and 3 losses.  And those three losses were during the first week of LDoN’s release.  I think the two biggest reasons for my group’s success are that we each know how to play our characters and that our core group always groups together so we each know how the others play.  Obviously, not everyone can do this.  But I would recommend making a couple of lists of people you group with.  One for those you would like to group with again and the other for those you wish to avoid.  After adventuring for a while you should be able to build a network of friends and your odds of winning should greatly increase.<br />
<br />
I’ll describe a typical adventure for our group and perhaps that will provide a few insights.  Just keep in mind that there are dozens of different ways to successfully complete an adventure.  Just because a certain method works for one group doesn’t mean it’s the best method for yours. <br />
<br />
Our core group is made up of a 62 ranger (puller), 62 cleric, 62 bard and 62 shaman (me).  We try to find some DPS to fill in the last two slots.  This is usually another melee, such as a ranger or beastlord, and a caster, wizard, mage or necromancer.  But we have had two melees, two casters and sometimes another bard or another shaman and we always win.  <br />
<br />
We always pick either a slaughter mission or a collection mission of 26 or higher.  We’ve done smaller collection missions, but they always seem to take more time.  <br />
<br />
We buff up just before entering the adventure and start pulling as soon as the pets are up and ready.  The ranger pulls fast.  If there are only one to three mobs he pulls them.  If there are more the cleric pacifies them.  However, since we have an amazing bard that can keep an amazing number of mobs mezed at a time, it’s not unusual for the ranger to pull an entire room.  We’ve had eight mobs or so on us and we’ve been able to handle them with little trouble.  And let me tell you, that can really get the blood pumping.   But the normal pull is two or three at a time.<br />
<br />
As soon as the nearest mobs are cleared we all move up to the next “room.”  I have to agree with a previous poster that moving up to the mobs saves time.  I also feel that any manna regen is a good thing.  We always have KEI and the bard plays the manna/health song even during combat, alternating it with her other songs.  I always use my pet and equip him with a couple of rusty daggers so he can duel wield.  He may not do a lot of damage but every little bit helps.  And we completely ignore chests.  We could try them after we complete the quest, but we’ve found them to more of a pain than a reward.  We would rather get the next adventure started that much sooner.  <br />
<br />
As for my role, it’s mostly to keep everyone buffed and to slow the mobs.  As soon as a mob is advancing on the group I start casting my slow.  If the ranger hasn’t snared it yet he soon will and the mob will return to him.  I can slow most mobs on the first try.  Some take a second cast.  And a very few seem to be very resistant.  And for just those very few I don’t find it’s worth debuffng them.  I do keep cancel magic memed now, as many mobs in our current theme tend to have damage shields and I like to drop those as soon as possible.  If I have extra manna, which I usually do now that I have canni five and torpor, I cast either a direct damage spell or a DoT if it’s a tough mob with a lot of hit points.  You’ll get a feel for which ones those are after a few adventures in a given theme.  When we pull several mobs I slow every one as soon as I can.  If they start beating on me that’s fine, I can take it for a while.  I’ll cast torpor on myself if it gets bad.  This give the bard time to mez and if they break mez they are already slowed.  <br />
<br />
Something else to keep in mind is that some themes are harder than others.  I just finished about 50 adventures from the Everfrost camp to unlock my armor.  We could often finish a mission in 30 to 40 minutes.  We’ve just moved to the North Ro camp to unlock some armor for out bard.  The North Ro camp is significantly harder than the Everfrost camp.  Its nothing we can’t handle, but the mobs are tough, with more casters and it takes us longer to complete the missions.  However, the drops from the named mobs are also much better.  Most of the drops are actually upgrades for many in our group.  I’m still trying to win the roll for a mask that’s dropped twice with decent stats and see invisibility.  <br />
<br />
Like I said, I think the biggest secret to success is having people you can depend on in your group.  If you are all competent players that don’t panic during big pulls you have a very good chance to complete your mission.  So go out there and find some good players to group with.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Pulling = lost time. Avoid it when you can and move to the mobs instead of taking twice as much time for someone to go pull the mobs and bring them back to you.<br />
<br />
Sometimes this is true, but not always.  It doesn't take that much time at all to pull if the puller is moving the group up properly.  Also if you lull an entire room, even lulled mobs who won't aggro will heal, damage shield, and buff your target.  You aren't saving any time at all if a cleric mob CHeals what you're fighting (yes, you can mez them, I know, but why mez it when you can just pull your target out of LOS).<br />
<br />
You don't lose any time at all, especially if you have a clueful puller who's out getting the next mob before the one in camp is dead and keeps the pulls SHORT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">3) Dont Pacify. Dont FD. Bards are best pullers. <br />
<br />
<br />
While I do agree that bards are good pullers I think your statement is rather ironic since one of the main things bards use when pulling is there pacify song. They will use other things like fade, mes and thier gate the mob song but pacify is the main thing they seem to use. <br />
<br />
<br />
Level 58 would seem to be a hard level for adventures for a couple reasons. <br />
1) your kinda in a inbetween area where people stop being rediculous over geared from being twinks but before you start grouping with the well geared high levels. I'd say on average your mid to late 50's and early 60's chars a typically worst geared relative to difficulty of mobs they typically face. AA's also factor in here too. Once people hit 65 and start building up lots of aa's it starts to make a big difference in how effective they are.<br />
<br />
2) Your also right on the edge for which mission you get. You might get a lvl 55 mission or you might get a lvl 60 mission and the 2 of those are probably gonna be a fair bit different in difficulty. If you want easy to win mission's I'd probably try to group with main lvl 55/56 people since that should get you a 55 mission. It's less points but should be an easier win. A group of 62's is gonna be able to handle a bit more than a group of 58 but they would both get the same dungeon. <br />
<br />
Personally I'm like 50 and 2 over all or something like that including 9 and 0 on hard missions. Mainly because I group with guildmates almost exclusively so I know what I'm dealing with an we're generally pretty well equiped and aa'ed. My losses are on a collect, the first mission I ever did, where 2 of us went LD for 10+ minutes. The other was a rescue mission mistaken for a slaughter by the person getting the mission that IMO was nearly unwinable because of the placement of the person to rescue in the dungeon. When a group that could do a hard mission resonably fails a normal mission because time just ran out something's wrong IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">simple steps anyone can take to win,<br />
get the best buffs you can find, 7th/9/kei/sta, get long durration chanter haste if you need it. the better buffed your group is the better your odds no matter what lvl you are.<br />
 mana regen is almost essential and I only ldon to win with my chanter, hes 55 so I go out of my way to get kei/9<br />
<br />
dps is nice, and needed BUT not required, my crew spend most of our time at the MM camp and regularly win with 4, chanter/shaman/warrior/druid note I dont charm a pet for these but I do summon one since I get hit often.<br />
<br />
Pulls are the single most important factor, bards are great pullers, anyone who can have one live mob in camp at all or nearly all times will work. personal experience tells me the best puller is a chanter/shaman duo.<br />
I mez/tash shamy then slows. we do this While the mob in camp is dying. warrior then shoots it or just engages. I can prep 3 mobs easily and the occasional resist is easy to handle. <br />
<br />
<br />
now for the final ultra secret to success....DOWNLOAD A FRIGGIN VOICE CHAT PROGRAM YOU SILLY PRIMATIVE RETARDS!<br />
<br />
I mean voice chat programs that work well and reliably have only been around since 98 or so.   we use the archaic Battle Com. and we win. we also kick the crap out of people in group pvp or we know when its time to get out of dodge and make the escape.   it just baffles me that people who are net savy enough to play eq and surf the boards for more info can be such stuborn asshats when it comes to something so powerful in any and every multiplayer game ever.<br />
<br />
I use voice chat, eq is easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Easy there, Diabalein!<br />
<br />
If the group really knows what it's doing, there isn't actually a need for a voice chat program, though I can see why one would help groups of strangers... You tend to find, though, that you get too many Chiefs and not enough Indians...<br />
<br />
My recipe for success. Make sure you are always higher level than the mobs you face. This means, for you, making sure you are not in a level 60 dungeon. The reason will become clear.<br />
<br />
Second, at your level, with your gear, you should be pulling. No ifs or buts. You should be pulling. Pull with Turgur's on one mob, and run back to where you are going to kill them. Cast a Tigir's at the group of irate mobs who are following you. If you are higher level than the dungeon, you should not bounce it.<br />
<br />
Stand there and get hit. Get a heal from the healer, preferably a HoT. Your dog will attack, the other 4 members of your group should attack. Feel free to tell them if your Tigir's missed a mob, and that one can die first. Then, it's all about coordination. Try to set up the next pull when there is one mob left, and you will be golden.<br />
<br />
Unless your healer is asleep at the wheel, there is no way that even 4 or 5 50%-slowed mobs can kill you. Certainly you seem to have nice gear, so just make sure you have all the buffs... A shame you are not on Mith Marr, or I would invite you along and give you a demonstration. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I can give you advice from two perspectives. I have a 65 bard that I play most of the time, and a 58 shaman. In many ways, my shaman has worse gear than yours, as he's lacking focus effects other than mana pres 3. But he does have fungi, epic, jbb (not that the last two help all that much on adventures), so it's not like he's gimp either. <br />
<br />
Anyway, my experience has been that the key is PULLING, as many have said. I disagree heartily with those who say not to bother with lull pulling. With my bard, lull'ing is a huge part of my technique. But the key, as has also been stated, is to keep a mob in camp getting killed at all times. When pulling with my bard, I'll leave camp to go pull when the last mob is anywhere from 50% to 100% health, depending on how many mobs I need to go pull. If I'm going to be doing a new room with a lot to lull, then I leave as soon as we start the last mob (or as soon as I've slowed it, if I&quot;m the only group slower). A bard can lull an entire room of 6+ mobs, then keep coming back and single pulling without relullling. Their lull lasts that long - not sure if other classes have that kind of duration on lull. If not, they should just pull clumps of 3 or so, depending on the group capabilities. <br />
<br />
My goal when pulling with the bard, is to ALWAYS have a mob in camp (two pulls are great, of course), or to have the group moving up to the next pull spot. Ideally, I will tell the group to move up as soon as the present mob is dead, and when they get to the next pull spot I have 1-2 mobs arriving just when they do to be killed. The key is to ALWAYS be fighting. Short pulls, no downtime. Keep those melees and pets fighting as much as possible. <br />
<br />
Now, what happens when I play my 58 shaman? He's my alt, and I play him sporadically, so he pretty much only gets pickup groups with strangers. The problem is that these groups are used to sitting around waiting for mana, and waiting for pulls. There is too much not-doing-anything time.  Nevertheless, he's something like 7-1. And he's usually grouped with people who are thrilled that they actually won an adventure, and really want to play with him again. I think I've been kind of lucky, but a shaman can do a LOT to help a group succeed. <br />
<br />
#1 - help with the pulls. The pullers in these groups usually suck. I start out seeing how they pull, and typically they do NOT go pull until the last mob is dead. If lull'ing, they don't even start to lull the next pull until the last mob is dead. That KILLS your dungeon-clearing speed. So &quot;help&quot; pull as much as possible. I don't like to go pull five on my group, and am happy to take advantage of lull'ing. But in a situation where you know you can pull and just bring a couple, grab them before the last mob is dead. Keep mobs in camp, if you can do it without wiping the group. Usually by the end of the adventure I'm doing about half the pulling. Except one time I grouped with a ranger who was gods gift to pulling, for a ranger indoors, anyway. He did a fantastic job using root and snare to spread out the mobs as they came in. <br />
<br />
#2 - Accept that it'll be slower than L 65 uber people. People regularly completing in 40 minutes have great weapons and armor, and the casters typically have tons of FT, and they all have lots of AA skills. That speeds things up a lot. Non-uber L 65's with bazaar gear and no AA do not fly though adventures. That's the situation you're in all the time, relatively speaking. <br />
<br />
#3 - Stop crippling. You're wasting mana that you could use to heal or nuke. Slowing the average mob is plenty sufficient. Cripple is unneeded, except maybe against assassination targets. <br />
<br />
#4 - Get Tigir's Insects, if you don't have it. If you do have it, use it a lot. When you can prove to your group that 4 pulls are NOT a problem, they'll pull faster than you'll get through adventures faster. Get the puller/tank team to know that they should cluster the pulls initially so you can drop a Tigir's on all of them. Tigir's is so wonderful for LDoN. It's the only slow I use on multi-mob pulls, usually. I don't even bother with Turgur's on anything Tigir's stuck to on the initial pull (this should indicate how much you're overdoing it when Crippling Turgur'd mobs). <br />
<br />
One last bit of advice - stick to Mistmoore, Rujarkian Hills, and Miragul's. Takish and Guk are harder than the other 3. Takish has tons of Damage Shield casters and high mob density, and Guk is just hard, with narrow twisty passages and tough pulls. I just started doing some Miragul's after 40 straight Takish adventures with the bard (unlocking the high end plate armor), and Miragul is so much easier it's scary. The pulls in particular are MUCH easier, with far fewer mobs per room, typically, and no doors to get you aggro as soon as you open them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Lunira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I play a 65 paladin as my main, and a 53 shaman as an alt.  Here are some of the things I've learned:<br />
<br />
Buy a KEI.  Doesn't matter what class you are, but buy one.  You won't regret it. :)<br />
<br />
When I'm playing on my Paladin, I prefer having a shaman over a chanter any day.  Mezzing is a waste of time in LDON, I'd rather have a shaman for slows, and a second tank (Pal/War/SK) for adds.<br />
<br />
Don't forget to use Mages &amp; Necros for DPS.  They kick ass - where else can you get sustained melee damage and awesome burst damage in one group slot?<br />
<br />
If Bards are available, get one.  They are the best pullers you will ever find in LDON, and you will be amazed at what a bard can do for the mana regeneration and DPS of a group.  I actually parsed out at 100 dps the other day with a bard in my group (fighting giants in BOT, so no undead spells/advantages used).<br />
<br />
The key to consistently winning LDON adventures is being able to sustain your group's DPS for 70 minutes if necessary.  This means everyone who has mana needs as much mana regen as possible.  Buy Mental Clarity, invest in Flowing Thought items, buy your KEI, and love your bards for manasong and your mages for focus items.  Also make sure that your group is balanced with people who rely on mana for dps and people who don't.  If you have a wizzy, be sure to balance him out with a Rog/Mnk/Rng.  Mages and Necros are great, because even when they are OOM they are contributing A LOT to the overall dps of the group.<br />
<br />
As a shaman, I actually like having an enchanter in the group - at 53 all my spells are single target, and none of them last through an entire dungeon, so doing all of the buffing, including hastes, is very painful.  I jump for joy when someone else comes along to haste. :)  The key in my shaman's group is the unbelievable dps that twinks have lol.  Sometimes if I can't land slow, I just say screw it and nuke instead, and no one notices because the mobs drop so quickly.  I like seeing a druid in the group, because they can take over regen capabilities and function equally effectively as a healer or a dps class.<br />
<br />
Also, as a shaman, never ever go into a dungeon without your doggie.  He's your major contribution to the dps of your group, so pop a HOS and a speed on him, and give him mage toys if they are available, junk weapons if not.  Your dots are useless in a dungeon (the mana efficiency just isn't there as mobs die too fast), and you are lucky if you have time/mana to land a nuke after getting slow in.<br />
<br />
As a tank, my favorite shaman are the ones who aren't afraid to tank a mob if we get multiples.  I love to see a shaman who tosses a slow, Torpors (or Q or Stoicism) himself, and tanks mobs like it's nothing.<br />
<br />
I find that if you approach LDON adventures like you approach Trials, you will do well.  The key is fast killing and balancing on that fine line of not running out of mana, yet still functioning as efficiently as possible.  Just be sure to get a well-balanced group with all the necessary elements, and you should be okay. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Dont underestimate Enchanter pulling.

<br />
Then again, most people just get kei before adventure and thats it. People need to think outside of the box here.<br />

We just rushed the rooms and fought 3-4 at a time, every time.  While this wasn't typical or probably feasible for every group make up, it was hella fun.<br />
<br />
Group make up was: monk, monk, SK, cleric, shaman, ranger</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">It's all about group composition.  Not class as much as skill sets.  <br />

The best group I was ever in had no melee at all - 2 wiz, a mage, a necro, a cleric and a shaman. The pets tanked.  We finished 2 collects - 1 in 45 mins and the other in half an hour (the dps was amazing).<br />
<br />
The worst group - and my only fail on a slaughter - had a bard a chanter and a shaman - all overlapping skills.  The paladin and the rogue simply did not have the dps to kill fast enough, even with shaman dots on everything.  <br />
<br />
And IMHO bards are our best friend in LDON.   They are great pullers and the mana songs really help in this non-stop envrionment.  <br />
<br />
Generally, if a group has a chanter and a shaman, one of them is taking up a slot that could be better filled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Shazzog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">My overall win rate is 90.something or other percent right now. I've done probably 75 missions. My overall rank was 404 when I went to bed last night.<br />
<br />
I'm running through LDoN with my enchanter, trying to get her to 60. She started LDoN at 35 and hasn't really XP'd anywhere else since. She is 54 now.<br />
<br />
Pulling and killing efficiently is key.<br />
<br />
Of course, any group I go in with uses Chanter CC as a primary means of control, but the theory is the same regardless.<br />
<br />
You should be killing an average of 1 a minute, I'd say. If you have significant down times, it hurts you badly. If you have low dps, it will kill you.<br />
<br />
I've won, with 40+ minutes to spare, with all types of groups. I've done groups where the cleric and I were the only real casters, with everyone else melee types. I've done groups where we only had one tank, and everyone else was caster class (well, cleric can kind of count as a tank, but we try to avoid that)<br />
<br />
The key is find decent people who know their abilities, and to keep moving forward.<br />
<br />
We have only skipped past mobs (for assassination missions) twice...and only because we wanted to break the 50 minute remaining mark (skipped 2 or 3 in the previous room)<br />
<br />
If you can grab an enchanter or good bard, you can pull for your group. Pull with slows, have the chanter\bard mez adds, line 'em up and knock 'em down.<br />
<br />
My shaman companion (chanter is on the same account as my personal shaman, so I go with another shaman in my guild) will call for pac if he sees more than 4 adds. Otherwise, he just pulls and trusts me to get everything locked down. He engages mobs only if he has to wait for the group to catch up on the killing before pullng more (because I have 4 in lockdown already). The Cleric engages if he\she has plenty of mana, otherwise they med.<br />
<br />
So three DPS types are usually all we have doing damage...and we fly through the missions. If all three are tank\melee type, we may have 2 or 3 in play at a time just for kicks. Doesn't really kill faster, but it keeps the cleric active.<br />
<br />
I feel your pain, though...most of my losses come from pick up groups before I caught up with the level ranges in my guild. Some groups just can't seem to pull it together and kill quickly. I haven't figured it out. On some of them, we should have been able to mow through mobs, but 20 minutes in, we still only have 8 or 10 down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">This is just my opinion, but mezzing just slows me down.  I'd rather stack em up like dominos and root/rot them.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">One thing I think everyone will agree on is getting the best buffs you can before going in.  At a minimum this means virtue/pot9 and kei.<br />
<br />
Another important key to success is communication.  Make sure everyone knows their roles, and feels they can handle their roles, before going in.  My strategy varies with each group, but as long as people know what they are expected to do, things go well.  (oh yeah, and also listen to people when deciding on roles...there's a lot of good players out there with good ideas on how to do things)<br />
<br />
As to pulling...this depends on your group.  I usually play my 63 warrior and very few of the groups I've been in could consistently handle more than 2 on a pull (I've done about 60 missions...all at least partial pickups, most with 2 or 3 regulars.)  Saving time on pulls is great, but if you have 1 or 2 deaths the lost time from deaths more than eats up any time you saved on pulling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I have more wins than losses with both of my toons that have started doing LDoN. My tips for a shaman are:<br />
<br />
- be the highest level in the group...this saves tons of mana on resists on our highly resistable spells (I don't want to waste time casting malo)<br />
<br />
My fastest killing groups are always mage mage necro chanter shaman cleric with me pulling. Second fastest are pally mage mage chanter shaman cleric. In my case a druid can replace the cleric as long as there is a class in group to pacify. With turgurs the melee really don't take that much dmg in normal missions. <br />
<br />
In most cases pulling everything then mezzing is faster than pacifying, but you can act as primary healer while cleric runs ahead to pacify to speed things up. The cleric can cheal between fights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">There are two extreme approaches to winning LDoN, either normal or hard. One values minimal risk for the group with single pulls with pac/lull (more effective on hard). The other is controlled chaos, usually with 3-6 mobs in camp under constant rains, aes, etc. (more appropriate for normal with high dps groups)<br />
<br />
While most groups lay somewhere between, the successful ones all share at least one thing in common. Good time management.<br />
<br />
As others have mentioned, maximizing dps via minimizing downtime with constant pulls is key. However, if your group is good enough (gear wise, experience wise, comfortable level wise), pulling is almost a waste of time. Just rush from room to room with the &quot;puller&quot; giving directions and pre-park/slow mobs in the next room.<br />
<br />
If there must be a puller and you as a shaman is doing it, then there's a few things to remember:<br />
<br />
-Root is your friend, root + VP doubly so. <br />
-&quot;splitting&quot; a 3-4 spawn for your group isn't a problem with root, and if you are getting resists with a 3-4 pull, don't stand there and take the hits, train the tank. <br />
-DoTs are bad, nukes and rains are good.<br />
-Cripple is bad, conserve that mana for dps.<br />
-If you find that you don't need to use Can5 every time it pops, then you should realize you *could* be doing more dps. Whether or not you do it is up to you, I have my lazy days too :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I have more wins and losses and you want to know the secret about LDoN? It isn't high dps and it isn't being top notch. It is all about pulling.<br />
<br />
Pulling is the single most important thing any player could do to help their group to win an adventure. Anytime there is not a mob in the group getting beat on, that is lost time. Any time the puller has to run over 30 seconds after a mob dies to get another into the camp; lost time. If your melees are pulling, you are losing dps.<br />
<br />
The best way you could get the wins for yourself and any pick up group is learn how to pull. Our dps isn't something that needs to be in the camp for it to happen. You can sick dog, toss a rain, use a dot, but after that, you are just sitting in the camp canning or staring at the mob while it dies. Use that time to fetch another so your dps is constant. Make sure your group moves with you so you don't have overly long pulls.<br />
<br />
A shaman pulling in LDoN is great because you can pull while the group is still finishing up the last mob. You can bring an already gimped mob into camp ready for its demise. I usually start pulling about 20% on the mob, depending on how far I have to pull and the group's dps. You can root split mobs. You can use aggro pulling. I actually had to teach an SK last night on how to aggro pull because he was so hampered by FD pulling (which is too slow for LDoN). If you don't know what aggro pulling is, you get semi close to mobs and start sitting down. They will eventually aggro onto you, but the best part is if there are a ton of mobs in a room, the closest aggros only come onto you. You can split a room of 6 by just doing this. If you root or use slow you will usually aggro more than just the close ones. I was taught aggro pulling by a beastlord (Silvermaene) and best thing I ever learned for LDoN.<br />
<br />
If you don't feel comfortable with pulling, then always get a bard for your groups. Bards are THE best pullers for LDoN, hands down. Don't let anyone tell you different. They can single pull until the sun goes down and their dps isn't all that super that by them leaving the camp it will take the mob forever to die. My 60 bard gets tells constantly for LDoN because I have shown groups just how great they are for pulling and making groups better. But that is off the subject.<br />
<br />
If you get a chanter instead of a bard, that is just as good. Have the puller bring 2 -3 at a time so you always have mobs in the camp.<br />
<br />
So what is the moral of the story? Learn how to pull. If you rock at it, people will remember and always want you for groups. It just takes practice and the willingness to die to learn how to do it. But isn't that what EQ is all about?<br />

Meku is hands down the best puller in LDoN on RZ.  a full 80% of my wins are do to grouping with that Bard.  It really is all about pulling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">It's all about group composition.  Not class as much as skill sets.  <br />
<br />
Generally, if a group has a chanter and a shaman, one of them is taking up a slot that could be better filled.<br />
<br />
no, I disagree.  If you have a chanter doing slows, and hastes, and you focus on Heals and DPS, you're not overlapping<br />
<br />
A shaman + (druid or chanter or cleric) + Bard = you should win the LDoN, unless you've got 3 warriors or something</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Just an update to the pulling post: <br />
<br />
Was in a group today of Druid, Pally, Sk, Mage, Ranger, and Me. I did no dps in the group and we were killing 1 mob &lt; minute which IMO is pretty good for a pickup group. Guess who was the puller? <br />
<br />
With all that dps how could I not have a slowed mob waiting for them to finish the next? <br />
<br />
We finished a slay 53 with 45 min to spare. All I heard was &quot;Great pulling Meku.&quot; &quot;You rock.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not just trying to toot my own horn here, but just showing you that learning how to pull is pretty much what a shaman does in LDoN if you are not main healer. I feel DPS is secondary when it comes to pulling. If you have a great puller then by all means stay at camp and rain, dot, etc. And if you are pulling and have extra mana toss in a nuke.</div></div><hr />

Everything dies so fast you can't tell the difference anyhow.<br />
<br />
Agree with that wholeheartedly. I use my targars spell often since it casts a little faster and is very cheap to cast. I save turgurs for low dps groups where it really reduces a lot of dmg taken. <br />
<br />
The main trick I have found to ensuring LDoN success has been making sure I am the highest or second highest level player in the group. When I am the lowest member, I blow through mana with mobs resisting my spells. If I am the highest level, its usually a single cast and it sticks. It makes a huge difference (even with KEI, mod rods, canni and mana pres III).<br />
<br />
The second trick is to really break the group mold a little. I prefer high proportions of pet classes for normal missions, prefereably mages for their rain spells. In a caster group I can easily act as primary healer and 2-3 mages generate a LOT of dps. I prefer 2 mages, 1 necro, 1 chanter, druid/cleric and myself with myself pulling. <br />
<br />
Too big of a room and the chanter/cleric can assist pac off me otherwise its pull it all and pet park or mez. I pull with a low level slow. The pets do their thing. 2 air pets, a necro rogue pet, a chanter charm and a shaman pet do a lot of dmg. The cleric or druid rarely have to dump mana into heals so they can add a lot of DPS too.</div></div><hr />

Read thru most of these posts and yes LDON is all about pulling. Singles are best, doubles are doable and the faster the better chance you have.<br />
Now my group usually consist of my 60 shammy, my 58 monk, my buddy's 59 war and 59 cleric, then sometimes my GF's 58 rogue, and our 59 ranger friend, so we have the dps, with aeo slow on multi-pulls, and using a lower based slow (Torgor's not Turgur's) i make sure everyone is hasted, regen, and occasionally i dot/nuke, nuking usually since mobs go down so fast, while everyone is laying the beat down.<br />
Some groups are crappy, group with people you know, people you have grouped with and are decent players. Pally's bards and clerics are the best pullers in LDON, FD pulling takes too much precious time.<br />
If your playing a shammy you dont need a chanter unless your puller is a screwball, we are CC, just land your aoe slow, then follow up with Turgur to tank one while the group polishes off the other.<br />
Buff before ya go in, get some extended enhancement focus effect item, Focus will last more then the dungeon, if your fast enough<br />
<br />
All my losses are due to clerics that go LD or leave in the middle of an ADV, or pullers who just can t tank or pull right.<br />
<br />
GL all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Our groups pull off 20 minute adventures pretty regularly.  But you have to consider that we're all in time/elemental armor - our warrior pushes 2300 AC and just rushes rooms throwing out ae taunt as needed.  With no time used to actually pull mobs it just becomes a matter of channel as many DPS spells as possible onto the assisted mob, then switch, then switch, then switch.  I'll slow the mobs but if it becomes a time-sink on a mob that is putting up a resist fight I'll just switch to DPS and tank it.<br />
<br />
LDON for our groups is kind of like whack-a-mole.  The gear is making it trivial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Mascoma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Ok granted I am much lower level than you I have 3 losses and 12 successes. I have a Core Group (tm) philosophy that I use, I play a paladin, my g/f plays a shaman, and the other element of our Core Group (tm) is a cleric, We occasionally have a rogue, and a wizard.  I pull. when i pull i lull the mobs around the mob i intend to pull then stun the bastage.  <br />
<br />
Then in the camp, my g/f doesnt even slow the mob. just beat the mob bloody, as a 37 paladin with a BAH i usually gain a lot of aggro so chain pulling isnt an option and the other paladin in the group doesnt have the exp/ equipment to out aggro me so I have to wait till the mob is dead to pull the next one. ALWAYS have your group wait until you have scoped out the next room/area.  Then tell them to come to outside the room you are pulling from, making sure they are all far enough away so they dont get casting aggro. then pull your mobs to them. Slow on LDON mobs is a waste of mana. just make sure your tanks are all hasted with your best possible haste.  Probably the hardest thing to do is get your group to listen to the puller. (thats why i have 3 failures) Find a group with good people that know how to play thier class... Yeah you may fail a few till you find a good group of people, but now i have people sending me /tell s &quot; hey I have a group all set up. Would you like to pull for us?&quot; because io have gotten the reputation for getting S*%&amp; done.  Granted my clerics are usually out of mana and whatnot but I usually wait till they are saying OOM to call a med break.  Wait till they have about 30% mana and go grab the next mob.  Also as someone already stated, get collections or slaughters. These are BY FAR the Easiest. though i have done assasinations.  Also get the maps for the LDON zones from eqtoolbox.  Also try sticking to one main theme till you get the hang of that ( and a decent amount of points in that theme). Then move around.  Also in case you didnt know 10 succeesses in a theme gets you stats on your adventurers stone.<br />
<br />
Group Planning:  Dont mess around with peopl that make you wait longer than 10 minutes to form the group.  They are usually distracted by something else,(kids, bodyparts,porn, tv, etc) If they make you wait, you are surely going to fail, though not always if you know what you are doing.<br />
<br />
Also you have 30 minutes to buff.  get out your longest lasting buffs, buff the Main assist. Get your mana back through either Canni or KEI, then buff the next tank, med back to full and go again.  This way not everyone's buffs are all wearing off at the same time. Saving you mana for spot healing, etc.<br />
<br />
Wash, Rinse, Repeat.<br />
 BTW this isnt coming from someone inexperienced in the game either. I have a level 61 enchanter (3 adventures, 1 failure from an LD)<br />

If you have any questions send me a tell at ;tell erolissi.mascoma or post here. I dont ususally check this forum that much anymore butt who knows i might.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I'd agree with much of what's been written here.<br />
<br />
A great thing about being a shaman is having a wide variety of abilities.  I always feel that I contribute to LDoN group success and when I hear of friends taking a loss in LDoN I always (jokingly) tell them it's because they didn't have a shaman!  Reading this thread shows that there are several ways that shaman of differing styles can enhance the effectiveness of their (LDoN) groups.<br />
<br />
My biggest keys to LDoN are:<br />
- Communication.  It seems simple but just getting everyone on the same page as far as how CC will be handled, who's MA/MT, who's looting, and those kind of little details are a good thing to have firmly established before you zone in.<br />
- Pace/pulling.  I've seen it done many ways but it's just important to pull fast and constantly.  At lower levels I found we could often take our time a bit - at 50+ I'm finding there's an ever decreasing margin for error and we need to move fast.  There's no time for lots of breaks, discussions of loot, or whatever.  I prefer to pac pulling and most often prefer to have the cleric or (the rare on Xev in my level range) enchanter taking care of preCC while everyone else is fighting.  Bards in my level range are rare it seems - but if they're good they are amazing pullers.  I know a few clerics that are awesome pullers.  I haven't tried pulling myself yet....something to consider.<br />
- Crowd Control.  I've been in some strong groups of people that were familiar with each other - and we intentionally multi-pulled and just hacked it out for fun - but generally you want some kind of CC.  I prefer preCC (lull/sooth/pac/lament etc) to reactive CC (mez) but having mez available is nice.  There seems to be a lot less carnage and things go smoother with preCCing.  Generally the slug it out thing doesn't work that well unless you have a very high DPS group with plenty of pets and/or you are in a group with people you know and have a high degree of confidence in - it's entertaining if you can pull it off.<br />
- Know your class.  Another simple thing.  I do almost all pickup groups for LDoN and if everyone knows their class and role we usually crush regardless of group makeup.  You see an amazing amount of 50-65 folks that are clueless for one reason or another - just one of these folks, particularly if they're disruptive and/or uncooperative, can make for a bad run.  I was actually in one group where one person was intentionally being disruptive enough to put the group at risk and the group leader booted him - and then things became much smoother and we finished with ease.<br />
- DPS.  I don't think you need overwhelming DPS but it doesn't hurt.  I've won with all kinds of groups.  If you're lacking in any other area massive DPS can make up for it.<br />
<br />
My style for LDoN involves (general practices, always adaptable, and pretty basic stuff):<br />
- Slowing.  Of course.  I rarely have mana issues so I use my biggest slow (Turgurs).  I also usually keep the next lower slow memmed as a backup for those occasional resists to avoid waiting for Turgurs to reset.  I *think* I see a difference using Turgors vs Torgors as far as reduced damage and less cleric healing and it casts fast so it's helping faster.<br />
- Cleric support.  I always have root memmed for self defense and to help out aggroed clerics or casters.  Generally if I root and slow and add they're a nonthreat.  I'll put a regrowth on folks that get hit infrequently to keep them topped off and heal the nonMTs and cleric to save cleric mana, espeically if they're doing pac stuff.  I'll also touch up the MT if the cleric is burning a lot of mana (rare).<br />
- Buffing.  Particularly haste since there seems to be few enchanters in my level range.  I try to keep hastes updated so avoid the calls for it from tanks and I try to rebuff core melee buffs (and usually buffs on nonmelees) on-the-fly as needed (usually about an hour in when the biggies start to fall).<br />
- Looting.  I'm often MLer for my groups since I have high charisma for selling, have multiple ways to stay high in mana so looting doesn't drag me down, make it a point to keep my packs uncluttered, and take care of business quickly adhering to NBG practices.<br />
- DPS.  I rarely contribute to my groups DPS except via my dog, who is usually HoSed, hasted, and dual wielding.  I'll toss the occasional DD if high in mana, particularly against a named/boss that's going wild at the end of their existence.  I don't DoT much because most critters die fast and since I slow early if I follow with a DoT early I almost always draw aggro (and even though I can take hits ping ponging critters are distruptive).  Usually, because I'm doing cleric support, using big slows on every critter, hasting, regrowthing, doing whatever else, and keeping mana on hand for potential emergencies, I find that I rarely use mana for offense.<br />
<br />
I rarely have problems with my level vs group level for resists.  Resists seem to be mostly random for me.  I did a hard adventure yesterday and was low man in a 54-61 spread - so critters were conning high blue to yellow to me...and I rarely got resisted and con didn't matter much - the high blues were as likely to resist as the yellows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Devnull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I've been playing a few alts and have been amazed by some of the basic mistakes that lower level LDoN groups make, which can lead to failure. I think the three most common that I've seen involve pulling:<br />
<br />
1) Don't let your tank pull. A constant flow of mobs is a good thing. You don't want to have to wait for the last mob in camp to die before you have more incoming. <br />
<br />
2) Get a low-DPS class to pull when possible (or a class that can do their damage while they pull). The faster stuff dies, the better you are. A necro, beastlord, SHAMAN, etc, can still contribute to the group via their pet, DOTs, et cetera while they are pulling. A monk, rogue, or warrior needs to be in camp to kill things.<br />
<br />
3) Generally don't waste time single pulling. Lulling mobs and feigning takes time. A decent puller can pull doubles and triples in most LDoN situations (Guk can be a definite exception here), without feigning or pacifying. Two or three mobs are easily controllable via root if you don't have a mezzer, and your DPS classes can be doing their thing the whole time. <br />
<br />
I actually found the lower level adventures to be much tougher than the high level runs, simply because all the dungeons seem to have been balanced with regards to level, but without considering AAs.</div></div><hr />

It is very refreshing to see an uber make helpful comments instead of the usual dribble that has become all too common around here.<br />
<br />
I swear Time/Elemental loots made the majority of shamans here think they are actually using superior tactics when it is very obvious that they are just doing trivial encounters.<br />
<br />
Even though I am 65 and have been playing for (too!) many years I am no uber and I dont have several hundred AAs. I dont think adventures are trivial. Thats probably partly because I am not being &quot;carried&quot; through by uber guildmates.<br />
<br />
But tips/analysis like the ones that Boinshar gives are definately good to see because it confirms some of my own thoughts. Its particularily valuable if you only have at most a couple of hours to play each day.</div></div><hr />

This isn't meant to knock uber types, but sometimes it's depressing to hear others talk about how easy it is when I'm busting my butt just to finish with a few minutes to spare. :p   Especially when people talk about just pulling back 3 or 4 at a time...my group is toast if all adds aren't mez'd very quickly, and the enchie is OOM in no time if we get consistent adds.<br />

The best trick to learn is to take charge in situation 1 and just state how things are going to be done.<br />

In situation 2 just shut your hole and let someone unable to bend lead, even if they are a worse tactician than you. (And you know they will be, only moron indians _want_ to be chiefs.)</div></div><hr />

I don't think it's a uber vs. non-uber thing. I've done the tank-mez approach often with our puller/mt being a 65 paladin who doesn't have any raid gear or defensive AAs. Problem with doing that in a pickup group is probably due to lack of experience with the people working together. I'm sure that elemental/VT gear would make it easier if you screw up but it still seems like the most-foolproof way of doing it for the normal folks. <br />
<br />
Pretty much anyone except for a robe wearer or druid can offtank well enough for a standard adventure <br />
<br />

If anything, those of us advocating that route are biased by always having a (65?) shaman in the group. I could see where it might not be vialble without a shaman or (65 BST?) in the group.</div></div><hr />

My normal setup is warrior chanter monk shaman druid cleric. Just cause redundant heals and bringing only 2-3 at a time is cool. I would suggest you get a shaman and fder either necro/sk/monk.. that's just me tho =] Necros really are great in ldon because of group heals and things like that..</div></div><hr />

It's probably not worthwhile if you have an enchanter in the group. I'd either mez em or let the enchanter pacify-pull while you're killing. Otherwise, you can't get much use out of the enchanter. <br />
<br />
As for a tank mez-group, I like 2 tanks, 2 dps, cleric and shaman. That gives you one tank and a shaman to offtank or rootpark adds while the rest of the group concentrates on killing one mob at a time. I prefer at least one plate tank but the other one can be pretty much anything that can take a few hits in LDoN, monks and rangers work well in either the offtank or DPS slot since they're good at both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Personally I am running 35 wins and 1 loss for LDON.  Failed once on assassinate and that was due to a map that messed us up for finding the target (no tracker in group).  <br />
<br />
<br />
Best group I have been in:<br />
65 Wizard<br />
62 cleric (botted by me)<br />
65 shaman (me)<br />
65 Necro<br />
65 Necro<br />
65 Chanter<br />
<br />
Owned MM twice then went to EF to clean for 2 rounds.  Lost 1 necro and chanter.  Replaced with mage and druid.  Again we cleaned MM once then called it a night.<br />
<br />
Team like that was insane no doubt...high dps, pets, charm, heals, slow, etc.  We never split pulls, 3 or less we just rooted or mezzed if needed or just slowed and placed pets on them.  <br />
<br />
Avg group I run<br />
65 wizard<br />
65 shaman (me)<br />
62 cleric (me)<br />
Taunter (any melee class with taunt works...had 63 rangers with crap gear and hardly AAs taunting)<br />
DPS<br />
DPS<br />
<br />
I have played MT before (Blood + Bane of nife = agro even a rogue has tough time beating...lead with bane..damage at cast = big agro) as well.  I do not have ornate, elemental or time armor.  I do have Combat Agility 3 and LR 5 (well worth it).  ;)<br />
<br />
In the avg groups we pull 2-3 at a time.  If no CC then I use virulent paralysis (level 3 rocks..rofl what a knockback) to control mixed with greater immobilize (with right group mob should die with 30-45 secs of engagement...even avg DPS can sustain that).  Use non initial damaging dots if mob rooted. Less chance of breaking root when it lands.  <br />
<br />
With Can 5 + torpor (no Q yet here) I rarely break a sweat on mana usage and constantly run dots/slows/buffs.  I may not have mega dps in short but I make up for it in long term.  Most rooted mobs I am dotting and that drops time to kill them once group finishes up with engaged mob.<br />
<br />
Tips I found helpful in LDON:<br />
1.  Find regular people to hunt with.  The more you know the style the better you will perform.  I hunt with former guildmates (guild folded not long ago..was a top tier guild and I use to be top shaman in it before I left for 6 months...we know each others' strengths so less worry in a group).<br />
2.  If doing 62+ runs a druid can heal fine if you are slowing.  Expect to help some but druid is a great healer.  <br />
3.  Get KEI before fight (this has been mentioned) if no chanter with you.  KEI at min is 2h 30m spell.  Owns for crawls.  <br />
4.  Get these AAs if you have not already:  combat agility 1-3 (min), lightning reflexes 1-5 (I found CA 3 was good but LR 5 roxors), virulent paralysis (manaless, low resist every 2 mins root with knockback..great AA..LDON made me get it finally).  I found those best for LDON runs.  <br />
5.  Expirement with group set up.  As I said best group I have run is without melees.  Insane DPS/controls with good healing.  Slaughters only take 40 mins usually at most and that long due to crawling to mobs.  You never know what combo will lead to a kick ass group.<br />
6.  If you want a taunter, any will do.  Rangers are fine as long as you are slowing hard, healer on the ball.  Paladins for stuns, group heals, and 2ndary rez (deaths should not happen really but they do).  SKs for taps, and  agro hold.  warriors for just nasty hps, good agro control and I like their dps.<br />
7.  Avoid assassinate/rescue.  Ugh those just freaking suck.<br />
8.  Pump your blood up.  Shamans shine in LDON.  we slow, haste, CC, DOT, heal if necessary and make it all seem effortless.  Play a mean game and people will appreciate you all for it.  No other class brings so much to LDON in 1 bundle.  ;)<br />
<br />
I know this is from a 65 point of view but from what I have seen I would never do LDON till I was post 60 at least.  Friends who went thru at 30s with alts and 50s did not like it.  heh  I shall try sometime but rather just rip through them at 65.   Still a challenge.  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Pjrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">My main is a lvl 60 pally and I occasionally play a lvl 53 shammy.  I've read alot of interesting ideas here from other shammies and just wanted to say that pulling  4-5 is fine when you have good armor and can count on your group but in pickup groups, you cant always count on this.<br />
<br />
When I do LDoN with my shammy, I was usually responsible for hastes and slows but never nuked.  You all must have some pretty good groups because I find that most mobs take around 40 seconds to kill in mine.  Once I slow, I also cast E Bolt which may not last the full length of time, but still does about 145 hps per tick.  Much more efficient than a nuke for me since even if I only get 5 ticks out of it, I still can do 832 hps of damage for 320 mana (2.5:1 ratio).  Compare that to the following spells I have at 53:<br />
<br />
Shock of Venom: 460 hps for 230 mana (2:1 ratio)<br />
Blizzard Blast: 430 hps for 200 mana (2.15:1 ratio)<br />
Gale of Poison: 366 hps for 200 mana (1.33:1 ratio)<br />
<br />
The only time I see a nuke being more efficient is if the mobs die faster than 30 seconds or you have the Ice Strike nuke which does 650 hps for 250 mana (2.6:1 ratio).  Obviously for those of you in good groups that can kill faster than this, ignore my post :)<br />

----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Method.<br />
<br />
* Start off from entrance.  <br />
* Keep heading one direction until drops become low.  (1 out of 4)<br />
Go back near the entrance and move onto another branch closest to the zone in.<br />
* If the drop rate is low.. the group do not even bother going further into that direction.. we always go back.<br />
<br />

I still dont understand why you all choose the rain spells when a 7 tick dot does alot more damage at once for less mana.  The only time the rain DDs would be beneficial would be if you got more than one targeted at once right?  Doesnt the DD break root?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">It's probably not worthwhile if you have an enchanter in the group. I'd either mez em or let the enchanter pacify-pull while you're killing. Otherwise, you can't get much use out of the enchanter. <br />
<br />
<br />
Chanters work good in places like tak where you get around 3-4 mobs per pull without trying to hard, help chanter park/mez em, slow em and pull some more when the dps people catch to the last mob of the pull. Requires good healing to have no deaths though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I'll agree with Pjrell but let me say that if you have two tanks, using rains is probably the better way to go.  IF you are pulling, and have one tank and all the rest dps then there's no reason not to dot a root-parked add.  By the time the group gets to it it could be either half dead or dead depending on if you have another dotter in the group.<br />
<br />
Spell line up damage-wise in my ldon groups where I am pulling is Bane + Saryrn.  That way I can help nuke down mobs if there is only one in camp, and dot things when there are more (which is usually the case).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Serbitar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">The fastest group I've been in was :<br />
<br />
wizard<br />
wizard<br />
ranger<br />
monk(tanking)<br />
cleric<br />
me(shaman)<br />
<br />
The slowest group I've been in was a holy trinity group I guess you would call it.<br />
<br />
Although ironically, I've completed a slaughter in a pickup group with 32 minutes left with :<br />
<br />
warrior<br />
warrior<br />
paladin<br />
paladin<br />
cleric<br />
me<br />
<br />
So it really depends.  The &quot;all-tank&quot; group I was in was not uber by any means, but somehow we finished with tons of time to spare.  Of course when I do guild groups (which is 99% of the time), we usually just charge the room, or else my monk friend decides that we are going too slow and pulls 6+ to speed us up.  Of course all these were on normal, hard is a whole different ballgame.  But a surefire way to win normal adventures is to challenge your puller to make sure that the only time the melee stop swinging their weapons is the split second it takes to change targets to the next mob.  You dont really need any dps at all to win in LDoN normal, but the less dps you have the more constant your pulls have to be (i.e. should never see melee standing around not hitting anything)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Da Mighty Akymeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Best fun group Ive been in was me and 3 other 60 plus shaman, cleric and a paladin - &quot; Pull 5 please &quot;<br />
was fun and hard work - did a slaughter  with about 5 mins to spare. Paladin said it was funniest mission hed done as the banter was excellent during battle with all the Shaman trying to kill their mob first and then throwing a &quot; show off &quot; nuke or heal at other peeps. Remember all - fun is the key.</div></div><hr />
