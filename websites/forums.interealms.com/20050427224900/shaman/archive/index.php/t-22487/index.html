<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gonjinnx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was woundering if this is solo able ?? The main part I was thinking about is would I be able to get down to the REET frogs in seb solo them to get my crown?? I also have a 65 druid I can use for evac and extra dmg or a 64 mage but it will be a mostly solo mission me running the 2nd char.<br />
My magelo is up to date I think. I have about 4900+ hp buffed with 1100 ac and most stats at 280 when buffed. Also have all spell but malos(lvl65) and GOD spells.<br />
<br />
Thanx for any help you guys can give!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yeah it's definitely soloable, especially with a druid for security<br />
anything in sebilis is soloable by a shaman besides trak</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know about &quot;definitely soloable&quot;, but I would say it's soloable with a little care and luck. There are a few spots I can think of that could cause trouble.<br />
<br />
The first would be making it through the shroom area. The shrooms aren't dangerous individually, but if you get three or four (easily possible with the roamers if you try to move too fast) with some healers mixed in, you could be in for a challenging fight.<br />
<br />
The second challenging area would be (going from memory) pulling the Juggs from the area with the secret wall - see number 3 on the eqatlas map. (http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/sebilis2map.html) I seem to recall always getting a number of mobs on this pull. I'm not sure if this is the spot I'm thinking of, or if the area just before. If you're good with rooting, it should be doable.<br />
<br />
I don't have a lot of experience soloing deeper than this; the only times I've been down further has been on Trakanon raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">when going deep into seb solo use Assiduous Vision to scout out the see-invis shrooms.  You can scout from the jail area (pop your head out of the water and target a froggy, run back to jail area and start floating from mob to mob) all the way to Juggs.  Once you get to Juggs there is a roamer and then 2 juggs that might add so be careful.  After that it only gets harder :)<br />
<br />
The reets are typically in rooms with 2 or 3 friends, with one or more pathers roaming around.  Don't let anything run and you might be ok.<br />
<br />
It is much much easier with a monk partner though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">if you have c and virtue, you won't have any problem soloing down to the reets and killing them.. I remember doing it in SS quest gear and ntov gear, having 2200 hp self buffed.. one at a time would take me about 5 minutes to kill(slow wearing off just before death most the time)<br />
<br />
if you're good with rooting, use VP to it's full advantage, or maybe bring a tank or evaccer for safety, you can do it. The choke points are wanderer shrooms(move slow, clear all the way so you get used to fighting here) be warey about runners.<br />
<br />
The second choke point is the first juggs. There are 3 juggies here, 2 on either side of the entryway, and a wanderer. If you wait until the wanderer comes all the way up the ramp, you can pull him and not agro the other 2. Those other 2 will come at the same time, no matter what you do. imo, you should pull them both to get used to fightnig 2 at once, cause in a few minutes you'll have to. Next, there's a wanderer just past the entryway into juggs, you can dispatch him easily, he runs perpendicular to the entry path. Then there are(I think) 2 wanderers that go down the hallway into the reet area with the hidden wall. That area is your next choke point.<br />
<br />
I've never been able to single pull or double pull those mobs. I've always had to deal with 3 at a time. Get to rooting, you'll have to be doing it a lot. Be careful, cause if you aren't, you may end up fighting 4 or 5 juggies at once here. There are 2 reets on either side in the rooms, you can camp those or you can go thru the invisible wall. There's 2 reets if you hug the right wall into the cubbie, and there's 4 juggies if you hug the left wall(2 different rooms, 2 in each room)<br />
<br />
Good luck, I honestly don't think it's worth the effort.<br />
<br />
FYI, on the linked map, you can see the rooms I'm talking about with reets in them. the area marked 3 has 2 rooms, 1 north and 1 south. Those 2 rooms have 2 reets each, and there's 1 wanderer + 4 static juggs here. Going thru the invisible wall, there's 2 rooms north and 1 room south. Each room there has 2 reets in, and there are a couple of wandering juggies here, plus the chance to agro statics in room labeled 3.<br />
<br />
May the Force be with you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you get by the shrooms, be aware that pulling/breaking the room with Juggs/Reets (the area with the invisible wall) can bring a lot of adds, I've seen pulls of 7 there. <br />
<br />
Juggs are rootable and summons, so don't start dotting many mobs (they only start summoning when they get below ~95% hp), take them down one at a time. Even using Spirit Call on the wrong mob can get you summoned into a heap of Juggs. Keep gate memmed if things turn brown and pray to the channeling-goddess.<br />
<br />
That is NOT an easy camp to solo IMO, the rooms past the invisible wall have fewer mobs and are a lot more doable, although the bends in the halls make it hard to keep an eye on wandering Juggs.<br />
<br />
If you can, you should really bring a friend (or two!) for this trip. If you fail there is pretty much no way to get to your corpse but summoning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yup, definately don't camp the 4 in the jug room with the secret wall.  Go past there and hang a left and you get a room with 3 and a wanderer in the hallway leading to it.   If you come back out from there you run a decent risk of aggro'in the wandering Jugg close enough to the main room to bring 2 of his friends, but honestly if you are ready for it 3 Juggs isn't too hard to pull off for a sham.<br />
<br />
  I'd suggest you get either pet hold or suspend minion however so that you can keep the dog from getting any damage on the jugs you are root parking during initial crowd control.<br />
<br />
<br />
  To break the main jug room, get in the hallway and pull one of the jugs on the far side with root, then target the other one IMEDIATELY (I'd suggest you have it set so that the toggle targets key, &quot;~&quot; by default, will do that for you) and hit it with Virulent P.   This should net you 2 jugs aggro'd, so run back to the doorway and root one, then move up to the room entry, slow the only non rooted Jugg and refresh roots on all the others once you move to a semi-safe spot.   From there, just be paranoid about keeping roots fresh and apply dog and DoTs liberally to 1 target at a time.   If you keep your mana at a nice level then when you get down to 2 juggs, pop a DS potion and just tank both to speed things up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gonjinnx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well I was doing this quest for 2 char my Shamy and my 49 SK Alt. I was going to try to see if i can MQ the 2nd one once I am finished with the 1st but would it be a good idear to bring the 49 SK with me and use it for pulling and tanking. She has about 4200hp and 1200 ac buffed. I have also got real ood at Duoing with her.</div></div><hr />
