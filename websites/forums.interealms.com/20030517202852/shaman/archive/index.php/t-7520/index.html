<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cudes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hello all,<br />
       I'm looking to host an open PoG raid on the FV server.  I plan to go after Tunare and I'm just looking for a little advice.  Open raiding is pretty difficult as is and I'd like to avoid the simple yet common mistakes people make when trying to kill the big mobs in PoG.  And jeeze, its the FV server, land of the crappy gear.  A bunch of the open raiders still sport crustecean shell armor.  ;).<br />
<br />
Ali the elder, from what I hear, get a bard and have him sing group cancel magic with all the casters...<br />
<br />
Rumbleroot, thats another dispel fest.<br />
<br />
All the other mini bosses are no prob.<br />
<br />
The mobs in the castle, are they necessary to pull before tunare?  I mean will Tunare summon these guys?  the quest mobs?  <br />
<br />
As for tunare herself, i hear she's perma rooted and slowable, so just have everyone trying to slow before fight?  <br />
<br />
Any aadditional advice along the lines of tunare, ali or rumbleroot would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

But I must warn you, I think Tunare hits for 900ish and to be prepared. You probably know this but I didn't know whether you did or not since your holding an open raid :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've done several Tunares post resist patch where we've been unable to slow her, the rod nerf has made this encounter somewhat more difficult than it had been recently. She likes to root the MT, have a mage in the group with him to reposition him if needs be.<br />
<br />
Ail is a complete PIA and you will likely wipe the first time you meet him until you've gotten the hang of things, the bard thing works yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Acck, having seen some of the messes people (not neccessarily the raidleader) can make of Naggy/Vox pick-up raids, or even PoH/PoF I shudder to think of a Tunare pick-up raid.<br />
<br />
Best of luck to you tho, come back and let us know how it turned out. :)<br />
