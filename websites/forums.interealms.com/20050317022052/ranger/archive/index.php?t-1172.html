<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-12-2002, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A middle aged man was going through his mid-life crisis so he went out and bought a new bright red Porsche. He decided to take his new Porsche on a test drive down the interstate one day.<br />
<br />
He got up to about 85 mph and all of a sudden he saw this highway patrolman with his blue lights and siren blaring coming toward him. He decided he and his new Porsche would outrun the officer. So the man sped up to 95 mph,and then to 105 mph, but the patrolman was still coming. <br />
<br />
The man finally came to his senses and said to himself, &quot;This is crazy, I could go to jail for this,&quot; so he pulled over. The patrolman came to the car and told the man, &quot;It has been a long day and I am tired. If you can give me an excuse noone else has ever given me I will let you go.&quot;<br />
<br />
So the man told the officer, &quot;Last night my wife ran off with a<br />
patrolman and when I saw you chasing me I thought you were trying to bring her back.&quot;<br />
<br />
The officer looked at the man and said, &quot;Have a nice day.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TrackinU</div><div class="date">04-13-2002, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So the next day same guy in the Porsche is cruisin down the highway again.  Shoots across a bridge at about 90mph.  Sure enough theres another cop at the other side with a radar gun.  Chase ensues but the guy stops this time.  <br />
Officer: Whats the rush?<br />
Guy: Its an emergency at work!<br />
O: What do you do that allows you to rush off like that to work?<br />
G: I'm a rectum stretcher.<br />
O: Huh?<br />
G: A rectum stretcher...see we take this tool and uh insert it.  It opens up to about 4 inches.  Then we stick the next one in and it stretches a bit more to about a foot.  The third one will stretch all the way to about 6 feet.<br />
O: What in the name of all things jelly filled do you do with a 6' A-hole?<br />
G: Well, we usually put em at the end of a bridge with a radar gun!</div></div><hr />

I'll never forget the Christmas when my dad came home laughing his @ss off.. he's a Linn County Deputy Sheriff, and he looked at my brother and I and said &quot;  I arrested Santa Claus today.&quot;  We didn't believe him, until he showed us the photo copy of the guys ID (Taken with his permission, of course).  The name on the ID was Kris Kringle.  He was arrested for flying too low (speeding), under the influence, heheh.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tulouis</div><div class="date">04-13-2002, 09:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll tell you about 2 tickets I got out of.<br />
<br />
The first, I got pulled over, and was asked for License and Proof of Insurance. I gave him my license, and said, &quot;hold on, I have proof of insurance some where, just got to find it.&quot; He went back and ran my License. When he came back, and saw me with a massive bundle of papers and other crap, and I was slowly looking through it mumbling &quot;what does it even look like?&quot; under my breath, he said &quot;forget it, drive safely&quot;, and let me go.<br />
<br />
Another night, my friends and I were out, and we were talking about how I wanted to get oversize tires for my jeep. I have nice rims that give the &quot;illusion&quot; of oversize tires, and I wanted to get one size up to make it look really phat (hah, the things you think in high school). Anyway, my friend told me he could put the tires on, but I would have to go to a shop to get the spedometer recalibrated, and that my speedometer would be off until I did. <br />
<br />
So, that night I get pulled over. I tell the officer that when I saw him, I looked down at the speedometer to make sure I was going the limit. And I was. His radar must be wrong. He said, &quot;No, it's not wrong. Had any work done to the car lately&quot;. I told him my friend had just put oversize tires on the car. He backed of and took a look (it was night out too). He says, &quot;did you get the speedomoeter recalibrated?&quot; I say, no, I didn't even know I had to. &quot;Well, go get that fixed, and until then go 10 less than the speed limit when looking at your spedometer.&quot; <br />
<br />
There have been other traffic....run ins...that I have had...but better I not mention them in a public forum.</div></div><hr />
