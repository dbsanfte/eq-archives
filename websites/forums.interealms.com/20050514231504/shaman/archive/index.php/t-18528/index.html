<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, so on the patch list that states which spells have had the stamina regeneration removed, Acumen is not listed.<br />
If you look at spell description of stupid spells like &quot;Invigor&quot; in the game they have been changed to say something like &quot;grants serpent sight&quot;.<br />
Acumens description has remained the same, including the part stating &quot;greatly increases stamina regeneration.&quot;<br />
Didnt do any tests, but wondering if anyone else noticed this.<br />
Is this just an oversight? (how could they forget acumen though?)<br />
Or is it planned to be the 'kei' for melee?<br />
Or is it already the kei, and I just didnt know it?<br />
<br />
As always, thanks for responding. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I tried it and noticed no difference at all. Banadan's probably right, they just didn't change all the spell descriptions. Probably didn't want their lunch to get cold...  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">kinda like how now our Velious Boots have been changed to same effect as our bracers.  Just sloppy and lazy.</div></div><hr />
