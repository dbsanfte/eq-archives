<br />
Was looking at the thread about GoD finally being completed.<br />
<br />
Some of the drops are pretty unbelievable same goes for MPG trials etc.<br />
<br />
How far can EQ go before the type of equipment a character is wearing makes the game pretty pointless.<br />
<br />
I dont know how long the final boss in GoD or OoW took to defeat but will it end up one day that &quot;trash&quot; mobs are the equivalent of todays GoDs ?.<br />
<br />
Yes all this shiny stuff syndrome type loot must be nice for people but isnt it starting to go a bit overboard.(bah im almost whining there sorry).<br />
Will this kill EQ rather than any new rpg that comes on the market.<br />
<br />
Sort of a waffle post this but hopefully you get the gist of what im trying to say.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think SoE blew it with the imtemization in PoP. They created these HUGE gaps between Ornate, then EP, then Time T5+ items. 60 hps a pop gaps. That was insane. Time gear should have been around the EPs, the EPs should have been mildly better than VT, and Ornate should have at LEAST come within 30-40 of that. They shot themselves in the foot for their future. They were practicaly FORCED to go 240+ on Gates and 280+ on OoW raid level items. Even so, I think they could have gotten away with cheaper Gates stuff, and thus cheaper OoW stuff, although much of the OoW raid stuff has relatively &quot;good&quot; stats in a mudflation sense (except PG single group trials, they were FAR too easy for the quality of loot they give out, and a couple of them still are).<br />
<br />
Anguish is pumping out 300+ hp/mana items, and 120 hp augs. Soon tanks are going to break 20K, and Shaman will be approaching 15K. One group Time, anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Peroxide</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its my opinion there will be 3 to 5 more expansions before EQ calls it quits.  They will eventually switch to 1 expansion a year and once again up the level limits.  They have no choice but to keep coming out with better and better gear as they have dug themselves a hole which is why an increase of levels will be needed.  In the end it depends on how many players are left if they continue coming out with expansions.</div></div><hr />

The numbers are a cypher. Along time ago when I was Gming a Champions game I let my players know that as the GM. No matter how powerful thier charecters become there is always the ability for the gm to make something to counter it. The GM's don't need a 52 man raid to get a peice of item for a monster. Or xp. Or any of the other fair things. <br />
<br />
The gameworld of EQ long ago became a joke when the common ordanary Planes of power rat could probably have killed half of Lower guk without blinking an Eye. <br />
<br />
At first level you kill bats and rats and spiders and such. And many of the monsters at 70 will be the same type of bats and rats and spiders and such. They have larger numbers for hit points and attack power and all the other trappings but those are simple fill in the blanks. <br />
<br />
I have always felt that there was no differance way way way back when the level 5-10's teamed up to kill the great mastadons on the permafrosts of home, compared to the level 60's killing the great and powerful trakanon in Seblis. It took roughly the same numbers of people and so darn many died. And whoever got the loot was estatic. <br />
<br />
The expansions will keep coming as long as they are viable to make money and the developers can spin any number of things to support any wild idea. <br />
<br />
SoE always, from the begining to tomorrows meetings, have had good ideas.  It has just been thier implimentation, foresight, and followthrough that have sucked eggs. <br />
<br />
Everquest has never been a dynamic game. Stuff has changed yes. Gotten better and worse, but very very little of the game is truly dynamic. It has just gotten bigger. And in doing so Lost much of it's focus.<br />
<br />
My opinions, take em how you will.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cronikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Monty Hall's been the curse of many an RP system - it's sad that it's the promise of new 1337 loot that draws folks into new expansions. Wouldn't it be nice if it was the thrill of the unknown - new vistas to explore, new folks to interact with - that pulled in the punters, rather than 'OMGZ ... 500 hps/500 mana uberbracers off trash mobs!!!!'?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Being able to stick ~400 hp/mana per slot is pretty far into the realm of the ridiculous.  Sure, you can keep escalating the general damage output of new encounters, but everything that came before offers diminished rewards and fails to maintain player interest.  Since older content gets trivialized by new expansions, you create a constant need for even more expansions to keep new content flowing to those players who are pushing the EQ envelope.<br />
<br />
I think Blazz has it right in regards to SOE creating too large a gap between gear sets in new areas.  If they would have maintained a more moderate pace with gear stats and just made the encounters more intricate, it would have kept more of EQ viable and alive for a larger number of players.  Currently, there really is no need to ever visit the older parts of the world unless some quest npc gets stuck there or you want to take a trip down nostalgia lane.<br />
<br />
I would love to see them release HUGE expansions again rather than giving us multiple bursts of little expansions, which are great a generating revenue for SOE, but fail to really draw you into the EQ world like the old expansions did.  You can seriously get lost in some of the Kunark/Velious/Antonica zones if you ditch the compass and maps, but would only be able to achieve that same feat in the maze-like zones of GoD or OoW.  Most of the regular new zones are so simple and small, that you can practically see the ZO from the ZI.<br />
<br />
Although DoN is not out yet, it's rapid release feels more like a shot from the SOE marketing department to gauge current interest in the game than a serious expansion.  Anytime they bundle utility features into an expansion, it usually means they skimped on zone content ala LoY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree with you Snoww, but only to a degree. Yes, SOE has had a history of blunders and gaffes that would probably have put any other multi-million dollar product into the toilet. But I think they are now making a sincere effort to LISTEN to their user base and take hints from that information. OoW goes a long way toward doing that. The problem is, OoW was poorly timed, too little too late, and too many people (like you, for example) had already had their illusion of &quot;dynamic content&quot; shattered long ago, somewhere over the 2.5 years of PoP being &quot;The End Game&quot;. But lets try another scenario. <br />
<br />
Instead of puny LoY being the first &quot;expansion&quot; to PoP, lets say they had bundled it together with LDoN (both were kinda small, and had no REAL progression, they were add-ons, not expansions). Then, OoW gets released next, around the time that LDoN was actually released. Then, Gates ships at the current time it shipped, followed by Dragons around the time of the new games.<br />
<br />
Had this been the release schedule, I am willing to bet that a HUGE number of people wouldnt have been so quick to bail on EQ. But in the end, they waited too long. The pushed out a couple half-baked add-ons, called them expansions, then when the REAL expansion was released (Gates) it was a disaster. <br />
<br />
Its kind of a shame too. Especially for you Snoww. A new shaman joined my guild a month and a half or so ago. Had never been in a &quot;Big&quot; guild before, always little tiny close-knit guilds where the same 10 guys are always playing in some combination of each other. The other night, in Time, he looted an item that put him over 10K hps. I have been in this &quot;big&quot; guild for almost 2 years, and I top out at 9903. How did this unguilded guy beat me to 10K? Simple. <br />
<br />
One Group OoW Loot. 4-6 PG Trial Items, a few quest armors, guy has ALL his spells (I still lack 1 69 and 2 70's), 3-6 65-70 hp augs out of RSS (single grouped). Combine that with the common raid stuff that is near rotting for our guild like the Ikky BP, couple T4-5 items, and there you have it. <br />
<br />
He reminds me a lot of you, Snoww. <br />
<br />
EQ will stick around a LONG time. The reason is simple. Why pay for a brand new cow when your still getting good milk from the old one. They have the infrastructure in place for EQ. All they have now is new content and day-to-day operating costs. They probably wont need any new hardware, considering the numbers decline. In fact, they may end up with a few extra machines to cannibilize into some other new project. There is NO WAY they are going to stop now, when they KNOW they will sell 200K boxes of any expansion they put out. <br />
<br />
Personally, I am ready. When OoW came out, I played it a TON. Got my levels, got most of my spells, checked out the zones, got 200 aa or so, etc. Now I am back to my former schedule. I log in now and then for some XPing, I raid 3-4 nights a week, and thats it. I am not in Anguish. Dont feel any urgency to get there either. Heck not done in Time yet, and still trying to get to Uqua, Qvic and Tcxeva or whatever those alphabet Gates zones are. But I will welcome some new content to consume my time for a few months in-between raids. The 30 bucks? Wasnt it you who said you cant even take a girl out to a decent dinner for 30 bucks? Heck you cant even get a GOOD meal alone for 30, unless you wanna skip the wine and cocktails. They can have my 30 bucks all day. With OOW, they more than earned it. I just hope they havent set the bar so high that the next expansions will be a let down.</div></div><hr />

Heh think this is more a case of them having to though than willingly doing it.<br />
They have in the past fought off all competition on a mass scale but then came GoD which was the proverbial straw that broke the camels back for the paying public.<br />
They realised after the GoD debacle that EQ players will no longer put up with anything that SoE does to them.<br />
To me it is a massive shame for EQ that this did not happen years ago would have been nice to see customer satisfaction because SoE wanted it that way rather than them having to do it.<br />
<br />
I totally agree with you about the order and timing of expansions if it had been how you had suggested I think lots of the people who left for WoW etc would have either stayed or played both games.<br />
<br />
Oh and on the LDoN geared Shaman.Blazz you're stretching a point a bit with this example as HP is not the be all and end all.I bet you had a lot more nice foci than him for a start plus youve probably got a slowstick etc :).<br />
