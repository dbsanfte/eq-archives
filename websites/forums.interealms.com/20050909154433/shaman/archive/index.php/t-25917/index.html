<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Swiftkique</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">well...our guild has been farming sol ro minis or atleast 2 of em so far done multiple times.  But this week it was time for Jiva try we had it all going very well for a while until one MAJOR flaw in the plan.  Sol Ro is bugged... We got to room before Jiva and then ran in and encountered Jiva was going fine till 4% down on Jiva zone crashes. we all boot out to player select screen and log back on only to be rolled back to right before the Jiva room with all things poped and kill us all.  Well not only does this make our guild VERY pissed off we are out for revenge on Jiva. we figure it was a coincedence not a bug...well it was. Today we went again and this time the zone crashed when all we had left to pull was the guardians of Jiva. Our bard or one of them was pushed into the wall and into never never land.  This was bad... i was the other bard and could do fine up till Jiva. Our other bard when he logged back on after crash died from a fall in never never land.  So we were our half of our CC so we decided to keep going and just make an attempt at Jiva well we all died after gettting Jiva to 60% and had like 6 adds there was 17 of us there and only one CC so first lesson about attempting Jiva is just dont do it with one CC its prolly got gonna work unless you got a good Offtank. and secondly dont go to Sol Ro till you see a patch about it, It might just be on Bertox but would think it was something to do with DoN patch. and it isnt just our guild this is happening to.  Well also almost forgot to post about the GM.  We petition 2 different people do and they both get and IDENTIcal reply saying that they cant give us the flag for it and we will just have to try again is the jist of it. First off we did not askfor a flag that wasnt what we were after we were after killing Jiva what we wanted was to have SOl Ro fixed or find out if it was a bug or coincidence( this was after first zone reset) we just asked to get that info. well we get this tell from GM right after second crash after second attempt and then the bard that we ended up NEEDING later if we wanted chance we would have had him with one more CC. well the bard sends him a tell and what does he do the GM camps after just ignoring for like 15mins.  all the bard asked was eiter a the zone is messed up or a summon up to rest of raid cause he was killed  due to a flaw in the game.  well the GM never answers him and just logged not even a what do ya need or a hi from the GM just totally ignored could have been resolved in what like 3 mins max.  so we tr it with him out whipe and then right after we see a GM zone into sol ro. Well we have some words for him but could not use them cause we needed some info and didnt want to get in trouble.  After about 15 mins of asking him it the zone was mesed up and if he could get us up there for a second try he says that sol ro is messed up and they know itis and developers trying to fix it. WELL this got us REALLY pissed we talked to a GM before and he didnt mention anything about any problem in Sol Ro just said a big sucks for you to us now they say they know about the bug and are trying to fix it i mean wouldnt you think they could let the people who pay 10 dollars a month about that before we waist likke 2 hours trying to kill something that just ends in disaster. well thanks for letting me vent on ya and ide suggest staying away from Sol Ro for a while atleast if on Bertox.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Swiftkique</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">OOOPS lol already a post about this sorry about this should have put my story there but still would have had to post that feel much better about gettting that out makes me wonder who they hire as GMs though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Exactly the same thing happening on RZ - twice now our guild has crashed the zone on pulling RZ fake, both times when RZ fakes buddies decide to join the party. Reason we did it twice was because we thought it was just a random crash first time.<br />
<br />
Grats SoE on having a bug that screws up over 60 peoples playtime for 2 evenings.<br />
<br />
Also doing VZ the other night Tactics almost went into same crash, we fought the quintuplets a couple of times in complete lag, lucky we are only backflagging, any guild this would be a challenge for would have wiped.<br />
<br />
I also hear that QVic is having a similar problem from a friend in game but I have no personal knowledge of this.<br />
<br />
Crash is weird because chat channels all function perfectly throughout the zone lag, then zone crashes and you get rolled back (on RZ) to just before RZ fake room so most people logging in get squished immediately by hall guards.<br />
<br />
All on AB server btw.<br />
<br />
What really pisses me off is we need to backflag on RZ to get about 15 new recruits flagged for EP's - this is completely stalling our backflagging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The exact same thing happened to us on an RCD pally epic instanced mission in the sewers.  We engaged the epic mob and got it to 10%, and the zone crashed.  All chat channels were working fine, however.<br />
<br />
We're going to try again today.  If it happens again at the same percentage, then it's another bug.   :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">All of this sounds like what happened to my guild last night when they decided to do some backflagging in pon.  Sounds like a more widespread bug then simply zone specific. Hopefully Sony will fix this asap if we all bug it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've seen problems in Uqua, Qvic, and Natimbi (CBQ) also.  Whole zones crash.  Players are frozen, we can type, but not move.  Shortly thereafter we are disconnected, and can get back into the zone, except the zone has been completely reset.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Beliael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We did a druids epic fight in Kithicor last night. Killed the trigger, the 10 branches and was in the process of killing the final mob when the zone rolled back on us. Tried it again, and the result was the same. The chat channels still worked fine throught the whole thing.<br />
<br />
   Guildmates were complaining that the same thing had happened to them the night before in Tipt on the final boss.<br />
<br />
Beliael</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It has happened to us twice in HoH doing trials, in Bloodfields doing warrior epic and in an instanced zone in RCoD doing a single group Paladin 1.5 epic thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Qvic - we engaged Cynosure, got him down to 30%, zone froze,.  reboot.  went back in Cyno was up did it again, zone crashed again.  zone rebooted, Cyno up again.<br />
<br />
This is a PITA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Luddaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">On Brell, 2 Guilds have tried Sol Ro Himself and had the same result... Zone Crashed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>apocobring1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">oh wahh<br />
<br />
all zones are doing that<br />
<br />
crash record for me so far - Bertox x1, Emp Ssra x6 (!!!), Hedge x2, Terris Thule x1, Random_epic_raids01 x6<br />
<br />
it is just how EQ is - and it has been that way for a while</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think it is just Sony's server farm showing their age. I have heard rumors that they shortchange older zones when putting up newer zones. Hmm, then again, OoW zones crash too sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gegen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Heard about this happening all over, heard about qvic crashing thanks to cyno event when DT was doing it on xegony.  We didn't have any problems in txevu as far as crashes go when we did champ event, although I didn't make it past the first 3 nameds since my comp crashed on it.  Although we did get some odd named aneuk agro while doing champ, we plowed one aneuk, then moved to do champ, and when we were killing ixt the other aneuk agroed us and we ended up getting some crazy train or something and wiped, then we killed him and didn't have any problems, so I dunno what's wrong in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Dude, Gegen.  That story just TOTALLY threw me back to Vex Thal.  Man, screwed agro (usually z-axis ****) just made that place what it was &lt;3<br />
<br />
You guys ever fight AHR at zoneline? I have. Shortest night of VT raiding -ever-, it was awesome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>GheffGutterbrains</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Not sure if it's fixed.. but a fellow shaman reported that all the pet casting mobs were chain casting pets... odd thing is that the pet would never show up.. just the process of creating the pet.. <br />
<br />
Ex:  Mob_01 is a mage.  Mob won't have a pet, but because it was a mage class, it chain casted the ability to create a pet and then the pet would poof.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">we tried the LDoN pally epic raid last night, got Vadoon to 30% when suddenly the zone freezes.  By the time we got back into action he'd regened to 80%, and wipe.<br />
And don't get me started on Cyanosure, we went through 3 rollbacks till we got him dead and he staid that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">While my guild was fighting Zun'Muram Votal (I think that's the name) in Ferubi yesterday, the zone crashed when he was at around 20%. Everyone LD'ed, came back and promptly died. When I logged, they were starting the CR and it wasn't until we were all dressed and buffed that we noticed the crash and subsequent rollback had despawned Votal.<br />
<br />
We took out Rondo afterward with no zone or mob trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gegen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Heh never fought AHR at zoneline, but I didn't get into VT until PoP... I left the highend guild during luclin right before they killed emp, then I didn't get back into highend raiding till PoP again.  Yeah anyway... is inktu'ta still broken?  I know like 2weeks ago it was and we couldn't get instance (which was nice because we needed some more txevu flags :/).  <br />
<br />
I dunno, I'm kinda wondering if the zone crashes if you take too long on the script or something, it just runs out of memory or something stupid... dunno how that kinda stuff works.  Whatever hasn't happened to us yet (at least while I've been raiding) so yay!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">obviously soe really really wants to lose all its customers.<br />
<br />
that way they wont actually have to do anything to earn there wages.!!<br />
<br />
just come from sol ro crash while attempting jiva.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Yodelroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I have had nearly 80% of oow sewers+catacombs instances lagbomb to 100%, kick the whole group out of instance, then despawn the expedition. Took me like 5 such groups to finally get a stable instance for my signet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Solemneyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">we had it happen on cyno yesterday and an MPG raid trial a few days before that :(<br />
<br />
has to do witrh DoN missions interfering if i understand it right... I am glad they didn't rush this expansion out... oh wait...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If the missions are to blame, that's absolutely a stress issue, not a functionality issue.  It wouldn't have been caught even with a year of extra Beta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">could also be a bug in the new coding of instanced zones leaking into older instance coding...happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Prexus_Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Ditto When we went to go do Vallon Zek in Tactics, killed to first split pulled first one zone lagged like a mofrakka, killed the first wave, 2nd wave popped started pull, and zone lagged us all to hell again... Got those 4 dead third set inc lagged again.. same on last set and finally killed real VZ...  There were lag times of up to a minute on my heals..... *sigh*<br />
