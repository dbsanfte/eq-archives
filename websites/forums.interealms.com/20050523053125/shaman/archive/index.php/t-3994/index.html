<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Exodus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've already created 2 other threads in these forums, both relating to soloing. I'm having quite a bit of trouble soloing. If I solo, I've noticed it's rather slow compared to being in a bandit group in Pauldal Caverns. I tried soloing at level 24, but de-leveled 5 times, so I decided to go back to Pauldal Caverns, and now I'm 26. I told you all before that I would hate to turn into a group shammy, but judging from my earlier expierences, it's inevitable. I read a thread here with the following quote regarding a shammy after he gets his new spells: &quot;DD Kiting with your new DD spell is also very viable at this level. **Either way you are doing more mobs than most fast paced groups with far less downtime.**&quot; When I soloed in LOIO, there WAS much downtime, mainly because of mana. I would like to solo in Echo Caverns, but I'm afraid of losing my level. Is there anything I'm doing wrong? When I soloed, I would slow the mob (Walking Sleep), root it, and rot it until it was about 50% or under it's health, then I would melee, but this took much time, and by the time I finished that mob (I usually only take blue conning mobs), I was low on mana, half way through my health, and medding for a bit. Yes, my defense is maxed, so is my piercing skill, as well as my offense. My spells rarely fizzle, and I have fairly decent armor. I use a slime coated harpoon, and my base wis is 141. Can anyone help me out? I'm pretty frustrated about this. Thanks in advance. - Exodus<br />
<br />
Edit: I hit on average for around 20-22 damage. Also, while I was grouped in the Caverns, I played a tank for a bit and forgot all my offensive spells, memorized my buffs, and casted as many buffs as I could on myself. This was a fast paced group, we had a bard, a cleric, and enchanter, and pally, and my self. We had no problems on mana, and I would pull just as soon as we finished off what I had already pulled. I got from 25-26 in about an hour, and since most things con blue to me there now, I wanna make my way to Echo Caverns. I read a thread on soloing there, but I doubt my abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think Paludal must have a nice ZEM. In any event, you're never gonna rip through blues like a Mage, or Necro, or quad kite (yet) like a Wizzie or Druid.<br />
<br />
OTOH, at higher levels you'll be soloing MOBs those classes can't touch.<br />
<br />
I feel your pain in a reverse way - was in a Hole group (entrance) and thought to myself &quot;Why do I need these guys - I solo this.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well there are a few things you need to understand. First Solo'ing in new world places RoK, Velious, Luclin is much different from solo'ing in the old world. Mobs hit harder, have more HP etc etc. At your currently level you would have a much easier time solo'ing back in the old world than you would in the newer lands.<br />
<br />
Next you are in the shaman &quot;hell stages&quot;. The stages of a shaman life when they don't get any heal upgrades, don't have a pet yet, don't get any new DD's or real dot upgrades. This is usually from around L20-33 or so. <br />
<br />
When you get to L34 and get VoS your first puppy etc things really start to turn around solo-wise. At 34 when you get your first puppy your effectiveness almost doubles.<br />
<br />
However you do have it much better now that they have removed the DOT penatly for moving targets. Before the Root nuke/dot thing had to be used for ohh the last year and a half or so. With that now gone you can go back to what us very old time shaman did which was dot/kite. This is even more effective combined when you get your puppy at L34. You can turn off pet taunts and your dots will keep the mob agroed you while your pup chews on his ankles from behind.<br />
<br />
Cheer up you don't have that much more to go, but the 20's are really hell for shaman. After that its gravy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, the 20s and early 30s are bleak.  You'll go through a similar (but thankfully MUCH shorter) period at about 45-48 as your dots don't seem as effective against the much tougher critters you'll be fighting for good xp at that level.  Players will expect you to heal/buff/cann and that's about it.<br />
<br />
Soloing is our gods' way of reminding us of our true place upon Norrath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think Paludal was imtroduced as part of the &quot;lets make it easy to get to 50&quot; revamp.<br />
<br />
Unless you have a fungi and a wicked ratio 2hb (and even then) you are going to suck. Shamans dont have the fast damage output other twinked classes have these days. And they all will be twinked compared to you. <br />
<br />
Put it this way, it took me a year of playtime to get to 30 pre-Kunark. This was when melee were thinking mino axes were the goods. Nowadays folks laugh at 8/37. It's a joke. But back then that was what people were using till yaks.<br />
<br />
So, while folks now are wielding centi ls (14/27) and centi ss (12/25), which have like triple the ratio melee were using back then, shamans (and others) are still relying on the spells they had when the game was first introduced.<br />
<br />
Grit your teeth and hang through till 34. When you get your pet you will feel much stronger sololing/grouping. Even more than ever before, comparatively, shamans are a late blooming class. At 14-29 we suck. Our damage output is pathetic. Our heals are barely worth it. But... At 39 we are starting to become useful in groups. And it just keeps getting better, Particularly with the recent changes to dots. At 51 we become the best slowers. At 60 we become hands down the best class in the game imo. There is no comparable class to what shamans can do at 60.<br />
<br />
So, you are in the lean years. Grind through them in Paludal and MSeru and DP. You will never get it so good in terms of exp whatever class you play. And always keep in the back of your mind, there's the rainbow pot of Togors Insects at 39 (formerly the best slow in game at 70%!) and Turgurs Insects (best slow in the game at 75%!) waiting for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Exodus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wow, thanks for all the help and advice guys. I was wondering if there is any good place I can level right now at 25/26? I just de-leveled (*sigh*, yes, again) and I'm about 2 blue bubs from 26. Can you guys give me a great place that I can solo at? It doesn't matter where, I will travel, just as long as the exp is decent or great. The loot doesn't matter all that much anymore, I made a lot in Pauldal. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks a lot in advance. - Exodus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Go to EF, solo mammy's.<br />
<br />
Paludal is the best exp you'll ever see, so it sucks, but your never gonna solo that well.  Mammy's are good though, and drop tusks, which sell to vendors for 7-10pp(use cha).  Only prob is competition for spawns, but if your like me, and dont often play in peak hours, you'll be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">a) you can't compare Paludal Caves to ANYTHING - its just that good.<br />
<br />
b) nothing wrong with being a group shaman...Its not like thats a social stigma we all avoid. It doesnt change anything about you.<br />
<br />
That being said, you are probably doing ok, or good.  Its just your measurement of reference (ie. Pauldal Caves xp) is impossibly high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You might want to try at the lake in Lake of Ill Omen. There  are some goblin ruins close buy. Pull the roaming sarnaks, skeletons and goblins to the lake shore and kill it there. Should be pretty safe with sow on.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I know LoIO is the pits but you can do to 30 there. Zoning in from Frontier go left and sit on those hills there and pull from the road and near-bye, lots of stuff roams there. When you have what you need to do down and feel comfortable move ahead from there between the crack in the hills across the road and go lakeside. Grimalkins, Skells, Gobbies and Sarnaks all spawn in that area. If you sit near the shore you should be safe but the zone is a short hop from there.  Most of the goofs are on the FV side of the lake, at least that is how it was when I was there. The Gob tunnels and the Sarnak Fort are also interesting<br />
<br />
These are the levels I lived in Cazic-Thule before the change (grouping but also learning), a shame. South Karana is also good for these levels, you don't have to camp the Treehouse or the Spires, there is plenty of roaming stuff to do.<br />
<br />
If you're evil then the mail bards are also viable, they are level 20 and were always good for a few blues running back and forth between The Swamp and Feerrot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Exodus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks a lot guys. I decided to head back to Everfrost, but on the way there, a couple hill giants killed me so I de-leveled again. I went back to get my corpse, and now I'm soloing mammoths in Everfrost. After I get to maybe level 30-32, I'm gonna head to Mesu Seru. I heard that was a good hunting spot for these levels. Thanks a bunch for all the tips and advice on where to hunt. When I get tired of Everfrost, I'll try heading back to LOIO for a bit. Thanks again. - Exodus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gamanae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Paludal is definitely a mixed blessing. You can scream through your lower levels here, but then you're ruined for ordinary exping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Exodus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah, I noticed that Pauldal Caverns kinda spoils lower levels. Since I hunted there, the exp in most places is kinda slow compared to being grouped in the Caverns. Now that I'm hunting in mammoths in Everfrost solo, I've noticed I get more exp from them then when I was in a group in the Caverns at level 23-26, getting a little over half a blue bub of exp. It's kinda of a trade off because I have some downtime (I lowered my downtime with canni dancing, really great), so I get exp at about the same rate I use to in the Caverns. I'm leveling kinda slow now, mainly because most of the mammoths are being hunted right now, but it's no biggy. Oh, I also improved my soloeing technique, and now I have learned to kite ). I just cast e-breath on a mammoth once, run around until it wears off, then re-cast it. I usually do this until it's at about 2 bubs of health or lower, then I melee it. I end up with almost full life and 60 mana left. Also, with this new technique (at least it's new to me), I managed to solo two mammoths at the same time. One was an add, and after I finished off the first one, I kited the second one and meleed it when it was at 2 bubbles of health. I ended up with 60 health and 0 mana, but I gained a full bub. I gotta thank you guys for all your tips, would of never figured it out without your help - Exodus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If your defense is not maxed, deffinately use EB, then melee.<br />
<br />
It really helps to max defense...mammys hit hard alot of the time, but not that much :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>csivils</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">A light blue in Pauldal Caverns seems to be worth more exp than a dark blue in most other zones.  Stay there as long as you can till bandits go all they way green.<br />
<br />
I recommend you follow it up with some time hunting the needlites in echo caverns (or some other dungeon).  The exp bonus isn't quite as good, but its a lot less of a shock than going to an outdoor zone like loio.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Gonna say what I say to everyone who's a shaman newbie.  Keep defense maxed for each level!  If you are diligent to get those 5 points of defense each level you will solo much better at every level, and you'll be capped at 200 defense by the time you hit lvl 41.  This alone will put you light years ahead of the other shamans in your level group, and actually for the next 15 levels where the other stupid shamans who didn't work on defense are still playing catch-up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tarelinu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">When things are looking bleak and depressing and your having trouble solo'ing in your 20's, just remember this one thing:<br />
<br />
A shaman's life begins at 34, you get your new dot,dd AND pet. <br />
<br />
Get thru your 20's anyway you can be it solo'ing(was killer pre kunark) or grouping.<br />
<br />
Once you hit 34 there's no looking back, trust me, and yes i've given this pep talk to many a shaman. =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Exodus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hey guys, sorry I forgot to update you all on my current condition. I'm no longer soloing the mammoths. They were easy and great exp for each kill, but the thing was it took so long to find one, and when I did, someone else was killing it. I have a 35 shaman friend, and he advised me to fight in Marus Seru from 26 up. I've been there since 26, and now I'm about a yellow and a half from 28. I got one level in about an hour grouped with a monk, so it's not too bad. I plan to stay until I get my new spells, then I'll see if I still get exp. If not, I'll start looking for some new hunting grounds that I can either solo or group with until 34. Once I turn 34 and the pet is something that revolutionizes the way shamans solo like everyone says, then I'll become a dedicated soloer. My defense is close to maxed right now, it's about 131 out of 140. My piercing is 111, and my offense and alteration skills are maxed. Thanks for all the advice you gave, and now I know where I'm heading. It's getting a bit slow leveling now, but I guess I'm just getting use to normal exp. I have one more question for you guys: Is Dawshroud Peak a good place to solo starting at 29, or would Permafrost Keep be the best place to solo at that level? Thanks again. - Exodus</div></div><hr />

<br />
hehe, i've started comparing grps by how much worse xp i get than soloing :/ oo this is just slightly worse xp than if i solo wee!(duoing with a rogue, killing mobs way faster than any full &quot;normal&quot; grp do in sebilis :)<br />
<br />
paludal is just too good :) nothing compares</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">&quot;hehe, i've started comparing grps by how much worse xp i get than soloing :/ &quot;<br />
<br />
amen. the ONLY place i can stand looking at my xp bar (on my 60 rogue :P) and not think of how much better the xp is in FG duoing, is CT, and that's partly because there are some nice loots to own/sell. they seriously need to increase group xp, it's downright ROTTEN to xp with a full group in the lvl 60 zones available like sebilis, chardok, velks, deep, akheva, ME, etc. even in kickass groups with primal and 3-4 melee doing juggernauts, it stinks.<br />
<br />
luclin has a few xp zones that have decent accessability, decent amount of mobs and no stupid light blues. but making the vah shir race and 100 newbie zones where our kitty bard/rogue/bst twinks named 'Khitty Katnypp' and **** like that are NOT what we want in an expansion.<br />
<br />
more zones like CT (hard, but high xp per mob) and FG (endless mobs but not crazy xp) are needed badly. why does verant think everyone loves to solo/2box and not group with lvl 52 players in seb for 1 blue per hour?</div></div><hr />
