<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I never thought it'd happen to me, especially like this, but I'm now time flagged :)<br />
<br />
my first run through time went really well, we went all the way to phase 4, and took out saryrn, no TA drop though...I didn't get any of the time drops actually...lol...save for the most important one, my Time flag.<br />
<br />
and while I've never considered myself &quot;uber&quot; or &quot;superior&quot; to any other player. It certainly feels good to be able to set foot into one of the high-end locked zones.<br />
<br />
and it feels even better to hear others tell you that you deserve to be there....that you should have been there a long time ago..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">HUGE GRATZ!  I know exactly how you feel :)  BTW...~15 Saryn kills...first TA drop for us was the last one (that night all the class specific stuff dropped oddly enough).<br />
<br />
It can be soo much fun, esspecally when you tell all your friends you killed GODS IN TIME! :)  Gratz, your hard work payed off, definatly deserve to be there :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Grats<br />
<br />
FR and Xegony down this week for us (about 4th kill on FR) - only Coirnav and TRC for Time for our guild :). Good going for us 3 days a week raiders !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Grats to you! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My guild recently merged with the remnants of the once top guild on my server.  <br />
<br />
I'm now just Coirnav away from a Time flag.  That's pretty cool.  <br />
<br />
I have a renewed and healthy respect for the guilds that beat these encounters 2 years ago with with level 65 limits and much poorer gear than we have now.  Beating Rathe, Xegony and Coirnav is a pretty difficult task, even now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Coirnav is an encounter even time equipped guilds that killed him several times CAN wipe.<br />
a large part of the encounter is pure luck.<br />
so even if your guild doesn't make it on the first few tries, that is nothing bad, just bad luck :)<br />
and grats and GL on the shaman preciousss to the OP :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>ribeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I joined my guild right before a huge PoP backflagging run.  The core of the guild was Qvic/Time geared already.  The only god that gave us any trouble was Coirnav...took three attempts even with this well of a geared guild and 90 or so in zone at the time (yes there were 90 there helping).  So Coirnav is still a tricky encounter!  Oh and TRC was a bit hairy until the chanters got all the mezzed tribesmen under control, they're a feisty bunch!<br />
<br />
Grats on Time btw, it truly is candyland as you will soon find out!<br />
<br />
TA dropped first Saryn kill btw but I didn't get it &gt;&lt;  Next time!</div></div><hr />
