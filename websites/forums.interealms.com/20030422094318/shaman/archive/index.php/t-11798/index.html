<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I spoke with a level 64 shaman on Drinal. He did not get Epic because other better weapons were easier to get. No one seems to do Fear any more on Drinal. I have done all steps up to High Scale Kirn fight. (Getting a group for The Hole is a bit of work too). Am I wasting my time? In three months I have not seen or heard of one single successful Fear raid--it doesnt happen after the Planes of Power expansion.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We take a few groups to Fear whenever we are bored and CT is up. He still drops some nice stuff. We also still try to grab the Golems when were bored. Everybody wants an AoN that doesn't have one yet.<br />
<br />
I'd find it hard to believe that nobody ever drops the golems on your server. Ask some other shaman in the uber guilds. I think every shaman in my guild has a tear in the bank for MQ.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>luvless??</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">golems just went down on 7th hammer tonite.. just so the tears could be sold as MQ.. :/<br />
<br />
o well..  guess that's 3 more days i have to get my hole fight and recruit an army for fear heh..<br />
<br />
<br />
as it stands though.. i'm not gonna bother with the epic.. i've got a better chance of soloing lord Emp Ssra  then i do of getting my epic..<br />
<br />
and i'm quite happy with my loyalists spear for now anyway..<br />
<br />
i know of a couple shaman on 7th that have their epic and rarely use it.. instead they seem to be fond of some hammer with a 6 sec stun proc (gee i wonder why heh;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have seen a few 8 people groups go in for various epic bits in PoF, but full-blown raids are usually a single guild AE clearing for CT.  People don't really hit that plane for class armor anymore because it makes more sense to go elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Your best bet for the tear is to tag-along on someones shot for CT or to level up, grab several peeps of the same level, and hit PoF just for the golems.<br />
<br />
Our epic is still the easiest option for items of that caliber in the primary slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Plenty of mid-level guilds raiding Fear and Hate on my server. We're just at the stage now where we can take on Inny (downed once), Vindi (we wipe more often than succed :)) and we've yet to encounter CT.  It tends to take use too long to clear the zone to do CT on a weeknight, but we'll still go up to Fear to clear the other nameds for an evening. That, and its fun to make a change.<br />
<br />
Try asking the smaller guilds and see if they are planning any trips. You might be pleasantly surprised. For sure, the top end guilds have little interest in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, it is good to see that someone has taken out Golems on Drinal recently. Thanks for advice. I will see if I can get The Hole part done, jump over to CoM for Neh Ashir, and then see if I can tag along on a clearing for CT or on a Golem raid. I must be missing the planning for the Fear Raids if one recently occurred.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">try your server message board.  Chances are someone is doing fear.  <br />
<br />
At the time i got my epic, my guild was at a state where fear was a major once a month raid, and chances of getting the named up where slim to none.<br />
<br />
I waited until i knew the plane was cleared, bound at the portal, and camped out in fear.  I check every day, and after patches to see if someone was there clearing it, and it took about 3 days for me to find a raid that was clearing the golems, and they let me loot the tear.</div></div><hr />
