<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chioni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How often do you use your slam ability at higher levels? I have a tendancy to enjoy some solo time, and hope to be tanking for the dog at times. But does slam make enough difference for me to choose a Barbarian over Vah Shir? These are the races I've narrowed my choice down to. So slam is the only fighting skill that seperates them. <br />
<br />
Thank you <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It used to work pretty nice to stop mobs from casting (gaters and healers, for example), but that was at lower levels. Havent seen it show much effectiveness in the 60+ arena. Spirit call pets are 100 times better to bash casters. I still have it hotkeyed, but I'll probably replace that hotkey when I get virulent paralysis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Haven't used it since Kunark.  The higher you get, the less chance you have to interrupt casters.  Their channeling ability is just too high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I hit it just for fun.  it was on like page 4 of hotkeys and i would switch over and hit it every so often.  It added nothing but is fun :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, I've fought some blues at level 65 where a slam that connected meant the difference in a battle.  But this is against trivial mobs like the goblins in Droga.  If you have Ferine Avatar on yourself for whatever reason ( who knows ), you have a better chance of slamming in my experience.  It could all by psychological though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I use it when I'm exping.  I specifically like to melee casters (with my Dark Mace of Thought) just for the fun of seeing it proc.  And while I'm doing that, everytime that I see it begin to cast a spell.. I bash it hoping to interupt it.  Have seen it work to a certain extent...who knows if it's better or not though.  It's just something for fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You can't use slam in bear form and you can't use it on a horse/drogmor. I used to use it to try to interrupt casters, and still do occasionally, but it's not that effective. It misses more often than it hits, doesn't always interrupt when it hits, and you have to watch carefully and time it just so to even have a chance to interrupt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Malaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I use it when i farm king for PP :)<br />
Damn cleric shrooms!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I still use it out of habit, but I find that the casters I CAN interrupt usually have spells I can resist anyway.<br />
<br />
Now that I have charm of deception I'm in bear form or on a horse most of the time, so it's just about ready to removed from my hotkeys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just want to point out that an illusion of a large race such as Troll will give a smaller race the option to add &quot;Slam&quot; to your combat abilities, and use it. Once the illusion fades, the slam ability disappears.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">When I was low level, I used it and it worked ok.  I used to mash the hell out of it and sense direction so they would raise.  About the time I got level 30 I realized htat it was capped at 1.  ROFL.  I haven't used it in a long time.  Like other said, you will resist the spells of any mob that it works on anyway.</div></div><hr />
