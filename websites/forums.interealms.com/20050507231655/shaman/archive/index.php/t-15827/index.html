<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shamsham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So i mentioned it in serverwide.crucible but noone believed me.  Here's your SS.  Blurred out guild text and made it a high quality so people don't start crying forgery.   File size 406kb.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I cry for those who would actually take the time to create a forgery of a few spells dropping off a mob...<br />
<br />
The Sleeper dying+ his loot would be a nice effort, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">nice :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">had all 3 drop from Gorenaire once... made a lot of guild shaman happy - all for one easy kill.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Had malo and torpor from talendor once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I remember when we were doing a vp clear we had a shaman without malo.  We wiped to PD because no one could manage to land any spells.  Finally we hunkered down and kill her .. and Malo dropped.  :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sshiverr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My old guild and some allies killed Sev. in Emerald Jungle and he dropped Pox. Malo. and Torpor.   And since I was the only shaman hight enough to scribe malo and torpor i got them both and the shaman who got Pox gave it to me cause he said it would be a long time till he got 58.....needless to say it was a very good day for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Harla Dar . . . what's she like for melee/spell damage?  Think she's shaman soloable?  I remember that she didn't used to be, but I don't remember why.  <br />
<br />
I've soloed all the dragons around ToV now, cept for Ionat (procs Silence, ew), and one of the ones that path by.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think Harla Dar gfluxes.  It's that annoying 1100 point gflux that's freaking hard to resist.  Have you killed Von?  Von has that same gflux.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We had Torpor and Malo drop from the same Gore kill once as well.  Two very happy shaman that day.  Not me, I was only 58 at the time.<br />
<br />
I think we have had two copies of Malo drop from the same Sontalak kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've seen, Pox, Malo and Topor all drop off a Sev kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">best Ive seen is 2 copies of malo and VoB off Sev at the same time.</div></div><hr />
