<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a question for all you Torpor enabled Oracles out there. I have been trying to get a Fungi tunic for a long, long time and now I have enough cash to buy one. However, I am only two orange bubbles from 60 and have Torpor in the bank. Do you still use a fungi tunic much at lvl 60? Is it worth spending all that cash for if you can torpor?<br />
<br />
I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Thanks again guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes..<br />
<br />
I still wear fungi over Vindi BP when in experience groups or soloing, or dinking around in green zones killing stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's nice to have at 60, though it's not a necessity. Mine stays bagged most of the time, I have the Cannibilization skill and I like the extra 145 hp from my Vindi BP when I take that 1924 hp hit.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I wear it when soloing without C3 if I'm LoM but that's about it.<br />
<br />
2 orange from 60 is still quite a bit, if you can do it then go for it and see when you make 60. Of course, fungi's aren't getting any cheaper, they should hold their market value if you want to sell it back.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Being a lizzah, I am a walkin fungi, and havent put my fungi on since I scribed torpor. The PSC I wear otherwise keeps me just above 1050 ac self buffed tho. Im sure i'll wear nothing but the vindi once I get my hands on one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would say you should keep it and use it for the situations where you need it. If you get one of these nasty little dot's on ya in some places like Ssra it can help save your ass till you get enough mana or something to cure it hehe. I hardly ever wear mine, but I wear it enough to never sell it. I made the mistake of selling mine once. I never appreciated it as much as I did when I didn't have it haha. So, i later saw an excellent deal for a CoF, Fungi, and some nice weapon with a 135dd proc on it for 100k. Got my fungi back and other stuff to boot :)<br />
<br />
MY advice? Dont sell it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have torpor, I am level 60 and I used fungi daily in exp grps and so forth over wolfcallers BP.<br />
<br />
Then I got the Cannibalize skill.<br />
<br />
Then I gave my fungi to a friend after not putting it on for a month.<br />
<br />
So, after Cannibalize AA skill I don't find it that useful, but before then, even with torpor it is a great BP.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Fungi is always useful.<br />
It might not always be the best choice however.  <br />
As some oracles have stated, Canni5 skill makes a bp with hps far far more attractive, and the Vindy bp is unmatched in the area of hps.  I'd never consider swapping out my vindy bp for a fungi.<br />
<br />
But I'd also never consider selling or trading my fungi.  I put it on my monkie and I've gotten TONS of use of it there.  The monk is an absolute joy to play when fungified.  I'm still enjoying the heck out of the fungi, and should I seriously twink another char, I'll use it there too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i got a fungi tunic on loan from a friend around level 56.  i had promised to give it back when i could scribe torpor.  i only miss the tunic because i want one for my twink :).  sure it would be nice in some cases, but it isn't essential after getting torpor.<br />
<br />
my jaundiced bone bracer, i do miss, however...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">here is some mana regen rate from each source after convert to mana per tick :<br />
<br />
med at lvl60 = 25m/tick  &lt;-- with horse, you still get this without med<br />
fungi = + 7.5 m/tick<br />
regen = regen/2 m/tick<br />
Topor+canni4  = 50-60 m/tick<br />
canni5 AA skill = +30 m/tick<br />
+50% buff duration = +10 m/tick<br />
<br />
as you see, you don't really need fungi after have Topor, just use Topor effeciency you will get max mps from it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Since it goes for 50k on my server now, I've been seriously tempted to sell it off... stays bagged most of the time, since I won a JB BP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Asraguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hey Guys/Gals,<br />
<br />
Being a poor shammy and never seeing more than 10kpp in my characters life I have never been able to get a Fungi. I have used a Fungi a few times that was leant to me by a guildy in an EXP group but thats about it.<br />
<br />
I have made it to level 60 without a Fungi (not that impressive) and now that I have Torpor I am a mana machine. As most Oracles will tell you once you have Torpor shamans never need to med. I have gone 4 hours soloing chain pulling shrooms in FG without sitting down and I usually pull for most groups I'm in since having the melee pull just wastes time. It's much more efficient to have all melee in camp hacking away at mobs without having to stop to pull. As a shaman I usually pull with slow or malo (depending on the mobs MR) and then just tank til the melee finish with the previous mob.<br />
<br />
What I'm getting at in this post is that I have no Cannib 5, I have no Fungi and I have no JBB (since I'm Iksar) but I never run out of mana thanks to Torpor and I solo just as competently as someone with a JBB.<br />
<br />
Infact I was lucky enough to solo shrooms in FG next to a Barb Oracle (think he had a Fungi but I didn't inspect him) once who was using his JBB. I thought it was interesting to see whether his speed in keeling was faster than mine but my keel rate was consistenlty faster than his. The difference in the times was because we would both pull with slow and we would both epic dot but from then he would depending on his mana use BoN or EB (I couldn't tell) and then chain JBB whereas I would use BoN and Pox and then spend my time Cannib 4ing down to 1 bub of health and torporing back up to full health while meleeing inbetween (I always keep VoB and Celerity up too). The overall effect of this was that I had a lot more mana available and I pulled and keeled consistently faster than he did.<br />
<br />
Would I bother spending 60K or whatever the rate is for a Fungi to acquire one now that I have Torpor? I definately would not unless I was considering making a Monkey twink. Sure a Fungi would have rocked pre level 60 but Torpor OWNS now.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I look at the fungi as something that's nice to have once torpor is in the book, but not a necessity.  If you don't have anything else that you will need more than the fungi, then go for it.  Otherwise, my advice is to put that cash to use improving other pieces of equipment.  Personally, I sold my fungi within a few days of scribing torpor because I realized that I'd be better off upgrading other pieces of equipment.  The cash from that sale provided me with a ton of other gear upgrades that are a lot more valuable to me than the extra hp regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Fungi is always nice for xping even at 60 with torpor.  But it totally depends on what other equipment you have.  With my stuff, wearing the fungi over the vindi bp doesn't cost me anything, as i am still well above AC soft cap and resists don't matter for the mobs i kill, and gives me more hp regen.  Does this HP regen make a difference?  Yes it does.  If you maximizing your xp, it should.<br />
<br />
Some guy gave the example of him having all this mana even though he dots up his mob and cannis the rest of the time.  Well if one mob isn't enough to push you mana regen.  Do two mobs at once in FG.  That way your effective DPS goes up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Asraguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hey Crashem,<br />
<br />
I do do 2 shrooms at a time in FG and I find that my mana consistently stays around 40m just using DoTs, Cannib and Torpor and my pet. I use a Vindi BP because of the added resists and HPs and Aura of Battle is nice since I always melee inbetween all castings. If I had a Fungi in my bag I wouldn't mind trying it out to see if it makes a difference to my keel speed. I'm sure it may increase it slightly but given I don't have one to begin with I wouldn't spend 60k (or whatever the rate is) on it just for a marginal increase in pull speed.<br />
<br />
I guess its really comes down to your own tactics but given the cost of a Fungi since the nerfed drop rate I just think its too expensive for the benefits once you have Torpor. If a Fungi still cost around 25k then I would definately have considered it.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If 60k seems like a lot, then definitely don't do it.  I agree that the benefit is probably not that huge, but if the plat doesn't have a better use why not.  Unless your resists stink, the vindi bp resists probably won't make that much a difference.  Also, with canni5, it changes things again.  I hardly ever canni4 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I just hit 60 last weekend scibred torpor and well it rocks :).  Regarding fungi, there is one on myserver, damn sk in my guild has it.  Now with torpor sometimes i am just so lazy i dont even cast regen, yeah i am not maximizing my mana regen but its still off the wall.  My point is if you are 60 and have torpor its better mana regen but a small percantage spend your money esle where.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Canni 5/Torpor/Fungi and Canni 4 are all great tools for mana regen..but so is yer fungi.<br />
<br />
What is best? All of the above in my opinion depending on the situation.<br />
<br />
A 60th level Iksar/Troll shaman benefits more from a fungi than a Barb shaman.  50HP per tick standing in Greater Bearform / Fungi / Regrow / aaxp etc. <br />
<br />
Keep in mind that they all will stack with your Torpor. So for each Torpor tick you will be gaining 350hp as opposed to 300hp...that is 50hp per tick more or 200hp for regular 4 tick torpor and 300 or so for aaxp torpor.</div></div><hr />
