<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tildaor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a very poor level 47 barb shaman looking for a way to make money fairly quickly.  Something soloable would be great, but I'm pretty desperate here.  I've only got about 2.5k in the bank, and my gear isn't anything special.  I'd like to upgrade a bit, and I'm dying for a JBB, but I don't know what to do short of asking someone to borrow the money (and getting laughed at) or selling myself on the streets of Freeport.  Does anyone have a good way to make some decent cash?  I'm not even really after xp, though it would be a nice bonus, I just need money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bro, I know this prolly isn't what you wanna hear, but I tried to do what you're doin now and all it was was a waste of time.  Go get xp, hit some dungeons once you hit 51 and get xp with some shot at loot.  The best way to gain money is always faster at higher lvls, so get there first and the gear thing will figure itself out, trust me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Gornit in OOT, i have been camping him off and on from level 39. Also gives me good exp at 44. Almost 45 from camping him over a day or so, made about 4k off 39-44 so far. Not bad, and pretty easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's not the popular answer, but I think it's the best one:  Buying and selling.  <br />
<br />
You can make more money in a shorter period of time doing that than anything else.  Hang out in the EC tunnel, open up the Trade channel, buy low, and sell high.<br />
<br />
Ideally you want to trade in items that sell fairly frequently (so you're not stuck holding inventory for a long time) and for a defined range (varies by server- so you'll have to do your own homework.)  For example, buy an FBSS for 3k and sell it for 4k.  In my tunnel rat days, I'd often use my own gear as stuff to sell, if I was sure I could buy it back fairly quickly.  I knew I could buy a set of JB arms for 500 pp in an hour or two, so if I saw &quot;WTB Shaman Gear&quot; I'd send a tell offering my arms for 700 pp.<br />
<br />
There are, of course, some tricks (don't buy and sell with the same character, prices vary by timezone- sometimes it's better to do your buying early in the morning and your selling during primetime, or vice versa... etc.) but you get the general idea.<br />
<br />
Yup, it sucks compared to killing stuff... but where else are you going to make that kind of money at level 47?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">47 is the level where it starts to become viable to solo Ice Giants in Everfrosty at the entrance to Permafrosty. You do not need great gear, but you do need to be moderately competent. At level 47, it will be fairly slow going - you will probably have to Root 'n Rot, as it is unlikely that you have good enough gear to pet n tank. By level 50, pet n tank is much more viable, and faster. <br />
<br />
Root n Rot<br />
Successful root n rot requires that you make good use of the terrain. As you pass under the portico into the Courtyard, there are 2 Icengiants located in alcoves to the north and south. If you pull either giants (with malosi) and immediately run out of the portico and run diagonally (i.e. if you pull the south IG, run out of the portico, and then run southwest), the IG will become stuck in the wall for approximately 10 seconds - plenty of time to stop and cast your first root spell. You can then apply your DoTs (stack as many as you can). By the time you have stacked 2 or 3 dots, the root will break, but the giant will probably be stuck in the wall for long enough to get off another root. After that, had south, and use the abandoned fallen tower to repeat the trick of getting a wall between you and the mob - this buys you the extra time you need to get a root spell cast without getting pounded. Note you will probably need to risk sitting and even cannidancing while the IG is rooted, in order tog et enough mana to finish the IG off.<br />
<br />
Pet  n tank <br />
If your gear is good enough, it is more efficient to pet n tank. However, I would strongly recommend that you have at least 800AC (self buffed) and preferably 850AC - if you dont have 800+, try this at your own risk.<br />
Make pet, buff with Talisman of Tnarg (or HoS if you have), Shifting Shield, chloro, haste<br />
Buff self with same (and inner fire, stam, agi)<br />
Pull IG with best slow spell, and immediately sic pet on IG (you may wish to pull as per Root n Rot, because it will take a while for pet to get aggro from IG - at this stage, stay out of melee range. at a safe distance sit and med/cannidance to balance hp and mana. Monitor pet's health (use &quot;/pet report health&quot; hotkey), heal pet a couple of times if necessary. if pet gets to 25% health, and you are less than 25% mana join the melee - the IG will aggro on you immediately. Melee IG until it turns or you are at 25% hp. At 25%hp, back away, let dogdog get aggro, heal self and rejoin (hopefully before dogdog dies).<br />
<br />
IGs drop between 5 and 60 plat woth of loot - typically coin, fine steel weapons and gems. On average, I would expect to get about 30-35 plat per kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xalbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Other than the standard RM Giants answer I have to go with buying and selling. But not just for pp but to upgrade current gear<br />
<br />
Lemme tell you my most recent trade story. I camped the RBF on a PvP server for about 4 hours one night. Got frustrated and gave up. Next day I came back and within 2 kills BOOM RBF. I took the RBF and my 2 SoW pots that I had made and headed to the Bazaar (neutral ground on my server) At the bazaar I quickly unloaded the RBF for 1k and the pots 1 for 100pp the other in trade for a Jade Chokadi Spine. From the spine I got a trade for a MM shield and a Masters Echatika (bah still haven't sold that damn thing, perfect example of why I hate class specific items as merchandise, its worth about 400pp so I am told but is nearly impossible to sell as it is a BST only weapon) I turned around and sold the MM shield for 350, that's a 250pp profit on the SoW pot. Not Bad! <br />
<br />
I started in banded armor, black chitin leggings, a Sarnak Tabard with a Crystal Grinder for my weapon. By the end of the night I ended up with (for my personal use) a Totemic BP ( Totemic Greaves , Slime Coated Harpoon for my range slot , Howling Harpoon for my primary and ended up selling all the items I replaced for a total net profit of 500pp in the bank free and clear. In all I started with about 1.3k worth of merchandise and ended up with close to 2k worth of gear and 500pp in the bank, not to mention another 500-1k worth of merchandise I was to lazy to sell that night So now I was styling with new gear which has increased my soloing capability by 200%, I got a nice chunk of change for my next spell level and once again gotten the trade bug :) so now I am furiously leveling up to start camping the really good stuff. All it takes is 1 good day in Trade to change your whole EQ experience. Now I realize that I maybe I got screwed but all I know is that  I was very happy with my experience there. Only thing I wish is that there was something to camp while I was selling ;) I can only take so much Gems before I wanna DoT myself to death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xalbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">oh forgot to add 2 +3 wis earing, 2 +2 wis rings and 2 +10 mana and HP bracers (which have since been replaced with 2 CBBs)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hey, im level 45, and have 815ish AC unbuffed, pretty good gear(only 5k from JBB!). Could i solo the IGs? Or do i need more mana/hps(hp=1.1k unbuffed) and wait till 47? Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shaben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It'd be touch and go at 45. You could do it, but you'll get quite a few resists. Without many resists you'll blow your whole mana bar and most of your health. Get a few more resists (or just one of the higher level giants) and you'll end up zoning. Do it for bragging rights once or twice, but it's not a really viable way of making money (yet). <br />
<br />
Either do the trading route, or just hit the giants in rathe mountains - if you try to kill a placeholder every-other giant (lizardman/skellies/cyclops) there'll be plent of giants to go round. You'll make more money per hour, it'll be less dangerous, and hey, you're still killin giants!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Miyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Not really sure why this never gets mentioned, but my favorite spot for making pp has to be the Geos in CC.  They are seperated nicely so you don't have to worry about adds except at one spot, and aren't even kos with them untill after you kill them for a very long time.  I solo them all the time now and can make a couple K a night if I get lucky with the drops.  I'd try soloing it and if you have a hard time or can't keep them all down, grab a melee partner.  Should be easy to find a ranger since tons of them hunt in EW in their 40s anyway.  With regen, slow, pet, and melee you should shoot for making you way all the way to the top without having to stop to med.  If you can do this then you can run back to the bottom and med while they respawn.  Usually just about the time I'm fm and rebuffed, they are respawning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Regarding the Ice Giants:<br />
<br />
Without the 49 dots, you might be able to take one down, but you would have to be pretty lucky on resists and/or have an abnormally large mana pool (or ubar ac/hp/melee weap/haste).  It would be grossly inefficient for plat farming.  You would do better killing the mammoths :P.  Epic and level 49 dots make them trivial.  Problem is they are usually camped at normal playing times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">1.) Giants in Rathe Mnt. from 34 up. Decent loot. When grouped in the high 30's I was making around 300-500pp per evening. Solo at 49 I actually made less because I would get bored and leave. <br />
<br />
2.) Seafuries in OOT...grouped or solo I make around 100-200pp per session. Sometimes that can go as high as 1000pp if I get really really lucky and get lots of gems. <br />
<br />
3.) Crystal Caverns 34-39, good loot off rygors and moderate to good loot off of Geonids. Bank in zone. <br />
<br />
4.) Giants in Burining Woods, warsliks woods and FM. I usually get at least 300pp in coin and items. If lucky I get 1 or more forest loops which sell for 280pp to vendors. <br />
<br />
49 plus just group in dungeons in Kunark. I usually walk away with at least 200pp in gems per night. Plus its great exp and lots of fun. Last night in Chardok I got 375pp in gems. My number one tactic for cash? STAY OUT OF AUCTION ZONES. Just don't temp yourself or you will piddle away your riches well before hitting that 15K nut needed for JBB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">JBB is pretty useless on IGs anyhow, I don't think I ever got one to stick so I just put the beat down &amp; dotted.  I never tried Malo'ing but then again I only tried them once or twice.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>slitherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You all are looking to hard<br />
all you got to do is go to hk and kill guaerds lv49 pet can solo them easily. i make about 500p to 1k each night just goffing off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Heck, just kill those giants, dvolrag in FV zones.  They drop pearl, opal and stuffs, including pp.  Kill them in bunch.  I found it easier than racing for HG against druid, wizard, or monks, or waiting for IG to respawn.<br />
<br />
I swear I can get 1k a night if I wanted to, but I prefer actually playing for fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think I'd worry about getting to 49 first. Things like seafuries in OOT or Ice Giants get a lot easier with the two dot upgrades. Then you want to solo you can head out to OOT, camp gornit if he's free or just do furies if he's camped. Ice Giants are also good money solo but nothing to do in that area if they're camped. Grab a melee partner and do Giant fort in BW, they drop decent loot and treeweave still sells for around 1k on my server.  CoM is another option, especially if you haven't camped the courier yet for your epic. Plat loot isn't that good but a trance stick or quiver staff still sells well and they can drop off of random mobs. Best done with a partner or small group though.</div></div><hr />
