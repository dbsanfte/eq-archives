<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tikothepally</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, solid level 65 paladin and 65 ranger. Im playing the paladin and shaman and trying to get him up to 60 Asap<br />
<br />
<br />
PoP is in the mail for the shaman so im going to start messing around there. Any suggestions? I would just group with the shaman and own the mobs in PoI but I would steal a lot from him ;(. The shaman has a horse and JBB, no epic. What I might try is pulling a mob, knocking it down to 10% with the two characters, zoning them. The dog will have been on the mob the whole time, and the shaman JBB, so when I come back in I can finish the mob off no problemo.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions/spots? Grouped or ungrouped? Etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
<br />
PS once he is to 60 I will probably get him PoV flagged and us 3 will grab  camp there.</div></div><hr />

At 57th, I make about 3 blues in a full group of ~60th lvl in about 3 hours in PoI, so your rate sounds pretty good.</div></div><hr />
