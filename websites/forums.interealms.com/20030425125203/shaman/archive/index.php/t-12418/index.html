<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been hunting in PoM for a few days, which is absolutely great fun. Killed a lot of different mobs and want to try a few more...<br />
<br />
Stomples - I know we can solo him but with 3300hps self buffed do you think I will die often (if I ever see him up)<br />
<br />
Lithiniath - I know hes a chanter etc but how tough is he, is he soloable?<br />
<br />
Ricoculous - tried to slow him a few times but I got resisted and eaten<br />
<br />
Puppets - I know they are perma rooted, do you just position yourself so the other cant hit you?<br />
<br />
Ferjenor(sp.) - soloable?<br />
<br />
Posie the librarian - soloable?<br />
<br />
Chessboard - do they assist?<br />
<br />
I am 65 with most spells, decent armour and 50aas.<br />
<br />
It seems to me the higher the level of the mob the more chance of it dropping thrones according to the PoM boards? I thought I would post here as www.planeofmischief.com doesn't have many shaman solo tactics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Stomples -  Long as you have torpor/Q, this is an easy fight once you learn how to handle him.    Kill Sniffles with your pet, while you are WELL across the room.   pet kills sniff, and Stomp is out of aggro range, so you get time to prepare.   I reccomend equiping pet with 2 broken Blam sticks prior to the fight though since that increases your pet's max hit to 72 and helps (unless you have mage proc weapons, then use those).<br />
<br />
   Pet will do the majority of your damage if dual wielding, but keep epic and 2 dots on him as long as you maintain the mana you need to heal yourself<br />
<br />
Lithiniath - You have to use Disease based slows on this guy, and I hate to use pet to tank for me, but sadly on this guy I do reccomend it.   If you have a J-stick you can probably get his MR down low enough to stick on a Turgur, in that case he is cake.     MR buffs are important as well.<br />
<br />
  An alternate method of doing him is one that I use for tough enchanters (like BB himself).   First off, you take a HUGE risk because to do this right you have to leave all heal spells but torpor off mem.    Debuff your own Magic resist, and put on ALL the regen that you can (Fungi, regen rings/range items, Replenishment, and keep Torpor/Q up at all times).    Lay on all the DoTs that you can land on the mob, and pray for it to charm you.    Stick to disease DoTs primarily for longevity.    While you are charmed you will be regening nice and quick, and the mob will drop Hps from the DoTs.     Of course, if your DoTs all wear out at any point, then the NPC loses all aggro on you and regens at normal NPC rates (quick :()   When mezzes break, refresh Torpor, slow and DOTs as needed.<br />
<br />
Ricoculous - In all my time in PoM I never tried him.   Wasn't much point in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Puppets - You can position yourself so that they can't hit you, but you MUST MUST MUST stay in melee range.   If you get knocked back out of melee range by them hitting you, they summon you on top of them and thus in range of the other puppets.     Start  off killing Tunare from in front of the curtain, then stand on the Tribunal and work your way across the KOS in backrow.    I can normally clear all but 2 puppets before having to go kill Geb again.<br />
<br />
Ferjenor(sp.) - Yes, but jester cards are still worthless to my knowledge.<br />
<br />
Posie the librarian - Never tried this one either, again saw no real reason.    Shouldn't be too hard.<br />
<br />
Chessboard - All monkeys assist.  Chessboard sucks.<br />
<br />
My Right hand - This guy is an SK, so aggro initially with pet, to soak the HT, but heal your pet, or dispell him cause his DS is DANGEROUS for your little dogdog.    Also drops the useless jester cards, but easier kill then Ferj.<br />

   Mainly your best shot AT ALL for thrones is Stomples.  Next in line is AiW4.  Anything out of there and you are actually wasting time, but relieving boredom.<br />
<br />
  As for the boards, that is mainly used anymore for tracking droprates and locations and for trying to break some of the impossible quests.   Lately I have begun to think that BB really isn't the final God of PoM cause 1) I solo'd him 2) he drops jack squat 3) There seems to be SOME SORT of quest/event with the stage.  and the big one.. 4) There are faction hits out in the old world for Bristlebane, and totally seperate ones for Fizzlethorpe... potentially the tall man depicted with BB in many pictures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks Caanus!<br />
<br />
Soloed Stomples last night self buffed, he wasn't too tough at all, got a blue throne, just need a white throne and I have my booties :-)<br />
<br />
Cleared AIW4 about 6 times now, got some WoWs and a few knights.<br />
<br />
Tried My Right Hand, he ate me, I'l leave him alone.<br />
<br />
Killed a white stallion, couldn't slow him so kept torpor on pet and me (forgot about disease slow heh)<br />
<br />
Tried puppets but they kept despawning /shrug<br />
<br />
I think I will stick with AIW4 and Stomples.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In order to kill the puppets, at 8am you have to be in the audience and kill Geb.    He MUST DIE before BB spawns (about 10am).   You need to do this every day, and when you do it the puppets will spawn on top of each other.    So make sure you kill the KOS puppets first if you plan to camp them for a while because otherwise they stack a couple puppets high and that is BAD news :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know, I was wondering about that too.  I got to thinking that it'd be somewhat mischievous for him to actually be sitting there as the puppet, instead of the obvious BB in the audience.  Of course, you'd have to do something for that puppet to respawn as the true BB.</div></div><hr />
