<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>fudorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">While hunting CoM, specifically for the Student's log to complete that part of the epic, some higher levels ooc'ed the zone saying Ghiosk was down, and the books were available for looting.  Of course I jumped on the chance, as I didn't see Ghiosk being obtainable any time soon...<br />
<br />
Did the turn in, and the Spirit took the three books and awarded the XP and Faction as a result...<br />
<br />
(did turn in AFTER doing the combine/turn in of the 6 pages... got the Journal and the Ghiosk books on the same day... was a good day for this shammy)<br />
<br />
My question - Does the actual killing of Lord Ghiosk give a faction boost as well (meaning I will have to kill him regardless) or should I consider myself lucky, and just start raid preperations for HS Kirn in the Hole, and know faction will be fine?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nope, you didn't miss out on any faction from the kill of Ghiosk - there is none.  Consider yourself lucky.  :)</div></div><hr />
