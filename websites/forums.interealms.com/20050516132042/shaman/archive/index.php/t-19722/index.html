<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Goobie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry if I bypassed a creation guide on this board, but I looked and couldn't find.<br />
<br />
Ok, I plan to make an Ogre Shaman.  If all goes well, I plan to get him to 65, and he will be my farming machine (when I say farming machine I mean big targets, that no other class can solo, etc.).  Realizing that a naked Ogre Shaman, without spending any creation points into STA starts with 127.  I know hp's are very important, specially if I plan to solo-tank, and I'll be the brunt of all the mobs blows.  But taking into account the large STA number at creation, should I bother puttings points into it?  Again, I plan to solo the entire way to 65 if I'm enjoying it.<br />
<br />
I also plan to focus on max HP gear, so this gear won't necessarily have a lot of +Wis on it.  Should I do +25 wis +5 stam?  Or any other suggestion?<br />
<br />
Also I realize this isn't such a HUGE decicion, but I'm really anal about making a character, and even little small things like a few stat points misplaced may disgruntle me down the road.<br />
<br />
Just want experienced shammy's opinions, thanks =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1) Make sure your AGI is = or &gt; 75. <br />
<br />
2) Put rest into STA.<br />
<br />
3) Then Wisdom.<br />
<br />
Hitpoints are a seconday mana pool for you. (Sorta like a Necro).  Oh and group. Find some fellow big uglies and enjoy the JOURNEY.  Even twinked soloing is gonna be sloooow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ogres start with pretty low agility.  You want to make sure it is always over 75 in order to avoid any AC penalties.  I'm not sure I would put points in to it, though.  We can agi buff from a very low level and it would only take one or two pieces of gear with agi on them to get you over 75.<br />
<br />
After that, you'll probably find stamina more useful to you as you are leveling up.  Once you are higher level with decent gear, though, you'll find that you cap stamina (remember we can buff it by 60 at level 62, 80 if you have PE) long before you cap your wisdom.<br />
<br />
All in all I say it matters very very little where you put your starting stats.  An even 15/15 split between stamina and wisdom will serve you just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Agi &gt; 75 is nice, but will easily be sorted with minor twinkage and buffs.<br />
<br />
It will be a long while before you cap wisdom, so I would put as much as possible into that. We cannot buff wisdom ourselves, and enchanters can only buff it 25-ish (?) points. <br />
<br />
Stamina is probably the most important stat, but ogres have quite a lot of stamina anyway, plus you will be able to buff it quite much yourself pretty soon.<br />
<br />
Max WIS, rest into STA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Having to worry about Agi and Dex coming form gear and or buffs is a pain.  Use he 10 ptns or so to get both ovr 75.  Now a day, its not hard to get good gear with Sta or HP on it.  Dont forget, great low lvl Shaman items like the Fungi Tunic have neg Agi and Dex on it.  Dont get stuck with low Agi and the AC penalty after equiping such an item.  I did, and it was a pain to constantly consider AGI when looking at new equipment.  I would sugest getting Agi and Dex to 85 from the start if you hve enough points.  Wis and HP will come much easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Apart from raising your agility to 75, I'd put it all in wisdom. Ogres have plenty of stamina already - I've never wanted more as a barbarian, &amp; mine can easily reach the cap at level 59 with gear &amp; buffs, but wisdom increases your chance to learn spell casting &amp; trade skills, &amp; decreases your fizzle rate significantly (fizzle rate has been parsed). Mind you, my wisdom is capped with buffs &amp; gear at level 59 too (you can raise the cap for both wisdom &amp; stamina after level 61, but the returns diminish greatly). The thing with starting stats is that they all can be fixed, whatever you choose, later in the game, but wisdom is the one which will get you there faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">+5 agi<br />
rest in wisdom<br />
<br />
At low level ,stamina ,do nearly nothing ,after it's easy for an ogre to max it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Stamina was the first stat I capped (as a barbarian), so I wouldn't waste points on it, sta gear is pretty common.<br />
<br />
I'd agree with madalton - 5 in agi, rest in wis. Then get some good sta gear as you get higher levels and it takes effect, for the lower levels hp gear &gt; sta gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're talking waaay down the road, then put all your points into cha.  Everything else will cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">charisma</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I guess you can't really go wrong with sta then wis.  Only thing is my ogre shaman is always capped with stamina, and he has to find high hitpoint-nonstamina alternatives that are usually more expensive.  While that's not really too much of a problem, it's really annoying, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bukbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">+5 to agi to get it 75 the remaining 25 in wisdom.  At 57 I hit the stamina cap with my buffs so a lot of points are just going to waste because I can't go any higher.  <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">As an Ogre dont gimp your wis. Will make the lower levels very hard imo. I took my Ogre BST wis to 90 and rest into agi gaining spell skill up is teh suck. I am level 41 and I cant use my level 39 dots or even my level 30 dd. I have sat in pok numerous times practicing my spells and they go up very slow unless I get a wis buff and put on alot of +items.<br />
<br />
I would say max wis then put the rest into agi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'd suggest to max your wis, then put the rest in sta.  As you progress in levels, and get better gear, your starting stats will matter less and less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Dex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Goobie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I went with +25 into wis, and +5 into agil (to have my nekkid agil at 75).  With my current twinkie gear, I'm only at 110 wis, but he's mainly setup with my sk/pally twinks setup.<br />
<br />
He's got a fungi, and a JBB waiting for him down the road.<br />
<br />
Many thanks for all your suggestions =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">lol nice choice considering some of the suggestions..*** dex? <br />
<br />
my barb has max str/dex/agi (just short of max without agi buffed) at 65 with an unbuffed wis of...253. granted I may not have been in full pve gear at the time because I play on a Zek I do swap gear but I personally am glad I went the max wis rest into sta route.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Israi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">put it all in charisma.. Only stat i dont have maxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">To be frank, it doesn't really matter all that much. At lower levels, your stats make such a tiny difference that you won't notice. At higher levels you will max your stats with gear, AA and buffs, so it doesn't make much of a difference either way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Metadone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Welcome to spirits land. For an ogre, I'd suggest you put all in wisdom the 5 remaining points in sta.<br />
Agi neds to be at 75 minimum to avoid an AC penalty but you will very soon have an agi buff that will arrange that for you.<br />
Wisdom is important as it is mana. At high level with very nice gear you will get maxed and, even without a great gear, you will have a very nice mana regen, but before you get there, you will need a nice mana pool.<br />
Stamina is HP, HP is mana, mana is happyness, got my point :) ?<br />
Here's my 2 cp.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>csivils</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I just made my 3rd shaman (troll, ogre, ogre), I went max sta then rest into wis.  A spiderfur belt solves the AGI issue, and haven't had mana pool issues.<br />
<br />
I've leveled my previous ogre to 51 and never regretted maxing sta.  So when I made a new ogre on FV, I did the same thing.  <br />
<br />
In the long run, I don't think it makes a big deal...<br />
