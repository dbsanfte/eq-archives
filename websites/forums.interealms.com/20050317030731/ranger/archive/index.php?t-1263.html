<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Araekin</div><div class="date">04-14-2002, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, just dinged 53, soloed pretty much all the way from 50.  Can never get a group anywhere.  I have been fear-kiting the hoppers in DP, but its getting so dull.  Not to mention it is suddenly a hot spot for groups on my server and I am usually competing for spawns with at least 2 groups.  I need a nice quiet spot where I can solo to 55.  (Got all my pieces for Helm of tracker).  I have pretty much given up on groups after spending all of Friday from about 1pm to 5pm or so looking for groups hopping from KC, OS, ME, Velks, etc every 30-45 mins.  Seems people still think us rangers are useless in groups.  I have tried scarlet desert, but the cheetahs seem to be to scattered to pull to a wall near the zonelines.  Please help this ranger before he loses his mind ;)</div></div><hr />

I actually spent most of my time between 30 and 52 soloing, with the exception of getting through possibly or 4 levels. I've always been too impatient to wait to be grouped myself, so I'm constantly hopping to the nextzone to solo something, unnless friends are getting together or I get a guild group.<br />

Being a ranger is great, except when you want to get a group.<br />
<br />
And solo is just slooooow with an un-epicced 54 Ranger<br />
