<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just read an interesting thread over on the bard forum:<br />
<br />
http://pub142.ezboard.com/feqdivabardsofeverquestfrm2.showMessage?topicID=797.topic<br />
<br />
I'm not finished with the thread yet, but basically this bard crunched some numbers on bard damage shields, and discovered that they really create a lot of DPS.  Most importantly to the shaman community, they found this tactic worked best on our hated nemesis, the unslowable mob.  I know that I for one am going to start making damage shield potions to give to my MT when we see an archaic in PoI, or some other unslowable mob, and my bard friend (who first showed me the thread) has been similarly affected.<br />
<br />
P.S.  Don't stop after the first page (like I almost did).  The thread has more good stuff in the following pages, such as this break down of stacking DSes:<br />
<br />
Buff slot 1 damage shields:<br />
Chardok ring, Mage, Ranger and Druid damage shields. Mark of Karn. Bard bracer (shield of flame). Psalm line of bard songs. Lava diamond. Feedback.<br />
<br />
Buff slot 2 damage shields:<br />
Shaman potions. All Coldain rings. Riftwind, Call of Earth/Rathe, Karana pally/warrior helmet, Illusion:fire elemental. <br />
<br />
Buff slot 3 damage shields:<br />
Thistlecoat, Barbcoat, Bramblecoat, Spikecoat, Thorncoat, Bladecoat, Blessing of the Vah Shir. Basically, druid self only, or item-right clicks.<br />
<br />
Buff slot 4 damage shields:<br />
McVaxius' Rousing Rondo, Thorny Shield, GM buffs.<br />
<br />
Buff slot 5:<br />
Blessing of Vah Kerrath.<br />
<br />
Buff slot 6:<br />
Cloak of the Akheva (SK, self only).<br />
<br />
Not a Buff slot:<br />
Mark of Retribution, the cleric spell you target the mob, does indeed stack with all the damage shields.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This has been known for a very long time :)  You always want a bard in the MT group on raids, for this very purpose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sadly our potions are not cost effective enough for xp groups though.  But very useful on AoW =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gooshemz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've not been able to stack shaman potions with mage damage shields.  It might have been the order in which you apply.  I'm not sure, but when I have a mage ds and I try a potion on top it doesn't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This is a great strategy. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ON top of that, bards get damage absorbing spells that refresh every twist so they are reducing the damage everyone takes while singing a group damage shield :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Jorlaan that song is great for cannibalizing also :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">&quot;Jorlaan that song is great for cannibalizing also &quot;<br />
<br />
Uh are you sure?<br />
<br />
At one point in time, they changed it so that you got mana back only for the damage you took, basically preventing SoS from helping us cannibalize without losing health. Have they changed it back?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They changed it?  Damn I guess it's been awhile since I grouped with a good bard ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Last I knew you could canni while runed, gain mana, and not lose health.  That was about 6 weeks ago or so I imagine it still works fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Cann still works fine with Ench rune on, I'd presume bardic runes are no different.</div></div><hr />
