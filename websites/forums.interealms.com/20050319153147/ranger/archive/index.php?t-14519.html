If so can you comment on what level of mobs it works on and how often? Suspect its greens only but one can always hope it includes light blues ;).  Does it fire off once i a blue moon, 2% of the time, all the freaking time? <br />
<br />
Given the occasional need to clear a bunch of greens for clearing to some mobs or for tradeskills farming this skill might be semi useful, depending on the specifics...<br />
<br />
I know there was a tread on this a while ago but a lot of the info seemed to be from beta, and its not unknown for skills to change from beta to live...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thorem</div><div class="date">11-27-2002, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe Kianwan bought it Wyen.   Said it was great in Seb (usually got a headshot on the 3rd or 4th shot).   I'm working on some archtype abilities JIC they decide to nerf AA exp in PoP, but it's on the list of abilities I want, if only for faction farming.<br />
<br />
Kian, post a reply when you get a chance...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kianwan</div><div class="date">11-27-2002, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I bought it, it wont work on most Krups and up (some light blues could be headshotted at 64 none that Ive seen on 65 tho)<br />
With bow of the destroyer and avatar up (dex seems to help alot) I can usually get a head shot off before the mob hits 75%, have had wierd cases where I can finish a mob completely with no headshot at all and then 3 in a row where it hit on first shot. Its really unreliable and from what I believe it hits mobs level 47 and below. (but not 100% sure where the green / light blue difference is)<br />
<br />
on another note it works on the shard dropping guards in seru too ;)<br />
<br />
So in shot. Really unreliable and on green's only at level 65, and seems to be affected highly from dex.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabine</div><div class="date">11-28-2002, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I picked it up this ability last night after reading that folks are having fun with this skill, but am very disappointed with it.<br />
<br />
In 2 hours of shooting stuff that was all under level 40 (rathe mountains and mistmoore), I managed to get 2 headshots.  This is with dex at 305 til focus wore off then 272 dex.  I have combat fury 2, and Atk was 1662 the whole time, with eagle eye on.  I get 10 times more 900+ bow shots than headshots and manage to kill almost every mob before it gets to me.<br />
<br />
The first headshot was after a solid hour of non-stop shooting and I began to wonder if the aa even works in the old world, so I hit guardian of the forest and got a headshot.  <br />
<br />
Seems that the chances to get a headshot with 270+ dex and 1650+ atk are about 1 in 200.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pointie</div><div class="date">11-28-2002, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">probably just bad luck</div></div><hr />

(sorry forgot to mention in my first post since its basically ranger assassinate and has same restriction on mobs)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's face it....none of the Ranger Class POP abilities are worth spending the AA on.  I'm not complaining, however, as there are plenty of other AA abilities that allow us to shine.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">turgeran</div><div class="date">11-29-2002, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gotf is totally worth getting, if only for ditching wolf illusion while still getting the effect, since in a lot of zones you are kos in wolf form. This also is great to use with TS, or when offensive discs are called for on raids. just imo tho :/ Besides it's just plain COOL !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabine</div><div class="date">11-30-2002, 05:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dunno if a hill giant is &quot;humanoid&quot;  but the only shot in rathe mountains was on a lizardman.   I cleared mistmoore from the zone line to the gypsies without melee and got 1 other headshot.  <br />
<br />
The description of the aa does not mention humanoid, it mentions opponent.    Alas the AA seemed quite pointless to me.  I only bought it for fun, and was left with anger.  I shiver when I thnk how rarely this would fire without primal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raenewae</div><div class="date">11-30-2002, 05:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I don't believe headshot is worth buying Shar, I'd disagree with you on Entrap and GoTF.<br />
<br />
Entrap is just amazing.  If for nothing else than freeing up a spell slot it's been worth the 4 points for me.  You can ensnare with sneak up.  Since it isn't  a real spell, it dosn't break sneak.  That is HANDY for pulling.  <br />
<br />
And as for GoTF...   Not sure how badly I want the 2nd and 3rd levels yet, but the first is nice for a little extra damage on boss fights, and it has a noticable effect when used with trueshot.  Worth the first 3 points at least.<br />
<br />
So while I think on the whole, the ranger class skills coulds have been better,  two of them atleast are far from &quot;worthless.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was pulling fear to get ready for Cazic Thule, and took a shot at an Amy Knight, and bam down it went.  At first I thought I hit its pet or something  (common to kill a pet with a crit) but nope, got a FATAL BOW SHOT!! on an Amy Knight in fear.  <br />
<br />
The skill does not fire often, but occasionally the laugh you will get make it worth while ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ueauvan</div><div class="date">12-10-2002, 08:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">looks suspiciously like our usual 7 percent archery crit rate before combat fury hmmm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cosmodeous</div><div class="date">12-10-2002, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I picked up this skill just for fun.<br />
<br />
It was going off like crazy on the rodents in DN last night.  I know the ones that were green to me at 65 were getting nailed by it.<br />
<br />
Didn't check on the light blue mobs though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shooteneq1</div><div class="date">12-10-2002, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so far it seems to only work on humanoid type targets. has not worked on any giants or animals for me. works on those annoying ass lvl 20ish gaurds in mseru that agro me on way to ssra though =P<br />
<br />
so far works on:<br />
any race that u can play as a character in EQ<br />
lizard men<br />
amy knights in pof<br />
ratmen in DN<br />
any kobold<br />
any orc<br />
toilers .....ones in maidens and in akheva<br />
<br />
Does not work on:<br />
any giant sized mob<br />
any form of true animal IE: anythign panic animal works on<br />
any mob in ssra......my god how nice would this have been<br />
havnt had it work on anythign thats undead yet<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
on the mobs it does work on it seems that any of them that are light blue at 65 it doesnt work, but if they are green it does<br />
<br />
for instance it works on dwarfs but does not work on bodygaurds , they are lvl 50, but they are light blue at lvl65<br />
<br />
<br />
side note: works on Cheif Rygorr lol he was up and i felt it was my duty to kill =p<br />
<br />
all in all i find this skill most usefull on those green mobs that allways CH themselves 2-3 times before u cna kill them in melee</div></div><hr />

Okay, now that would be kind of cool.  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pisaster</div><div class="date">12-13-2002, 06:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Trained this with lvl 62 ranger, usually around 178 dex. <br />
<br />
Seems to be correct that only works on humanoid type mobs lvl 47 or lower.   Took some lower lvl friends into Acrylia Cavern to farm ore and xp for them.  Using bow to pull was dropping quite a few on pull.  Was VERY fun to have there, newbies were very suprised mobs going down so fast.  Not a great skill for raids or xp, but comes in handy for farming tradeskill supplies and helping lower lvl friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">timcooper</div><div class="date">12-13-2002, 07:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does it work in nurga ? on goblins ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kianwan</div><div class="date">12-13-2002, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It works on Frogloks too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">katalia72</div><div class="date">12-14-2002, 09:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was kinda hoping for it to be on par with Rogue's assasinate. Oh well ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">timcooper</div><div class="date">12-14-2002, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm it is assasinate<br />
same lvl cap i think not sure on % rate but the same ?<br />
<br />
Btw goblins in nurga etc, if so ill grind the xp before i start factioning</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Relv</div><div class="date">12-14-2002, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It only works on mobs with a humanoid body type.<br />
<br />
It's pretty useless.  You could kill a lot of greens in the time it took you to get the AA for this skill.<br />
<br />
I have GOTF level 1 and entrap and I'm done with class specific crap.<br />
<br />
GOTF is incredibly annoying to use on raids because it unshrinks you which pisses everyone off, so I usually don't even bother.  The miniscule damage boost isn't worth the damage loss by everyone else when they trip over my unshrunk ass.  Only good part about it is fun with illusion sploits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dartaniun</div><div class="date">12-15-2002, 04:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">so have we determined if it works on the gobbies in droga yet?</div></div><hr />

Yes, it does work on them.</div></div><hr />
