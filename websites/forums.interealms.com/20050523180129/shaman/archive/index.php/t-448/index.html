As for Shadowbane...Im beginning to wonder if it will ever be released.  Also, when it does, will it be outdated....<br />

<br />
Different genre but check it out anyway.   It's pretty rich story-content-wise and will be in beta fairly soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was very looking forward to ShadowBane.. like 3 years ago.. <br />
Too bad, it had potential, imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The biggest letdown for me wasn't Shadowbane.  It was Horizons.  Talk about potential...wow.  Dragons, Giants, Underwater creatures...all player races.  Demons and Vampires were playable too.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, it developed into vaporware fairly quickly, and now THEY don't even know when they will release.<br />
<br />
For an entire year, Artifact fed us crap about this GREAT EPIC SAGA they were creating, with all of these GREAT ideas and INCREDIBLE graphics.....but they forgot to mention they didn't know jack about making a game, nor did they have any real capital.  If I'm not much mistaken, the leader of the project had to sell his car to further finance it.<br />
<br />
Ideas? wonderful.  Selling your car?  that's devotion.  Thinking you can outgun Sony with a few hundred grand?  stupid....and very misleading to the general public.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If SWG is half of what they say it will be then it will be huge. Thank god they made it a very very very very rare chance that you will ever get to be a Jedi. <br />
<br />
Beta testing coming soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ulthaun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'll just clear some stuff up for you non-followers of ShadowBane.....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Why do the graphics suck? <br />
<br />
Shadowbane's engine, Arcane3D, works by reducing graphical quality to match the user's hardware power. This works automatically, but users also have the option of reducing it further. For this reason, many screenshots taken by testers are of inferior quality. <br />
<br />
<br />
Graphics are one of the last things most PvPer's would look for in a game they want good performance and good gameplay that requires skill (unlike EQ and DAoC PvP k thx).....so the graphics from that screen shot may have been taken from someone on a low end comp who is trying to get the best performance out of it......oh that and its STILL in beta...<br />
<br />
Another thing beta is well underway with both the Euro and US developers...although it has been delayed yet again i'll put money on that it will be released some time this year..Wish they would start the beta for the Oceania/Asia type region so i can have a go at enrolling :)<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW the quote is from the FUQ (frequently unanswered questions)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Also look at the immensive work they put in the history of the shadowbane world. Even better, it is multi platform, a version will be released for both Mac and Windows. <br />
<br />
The thing that could make(or has made, you decide) shadowbane vaporware, is the constant delay of release and of course the various beta stages. Apparantly wolfpack felt it was important to release a game without testing it excesively, unlike some company I know /cough.. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">so the graphics from that screen shot may have been taken from someone on a low end comp who is trying to get the best performance out of it<br />
<br />
<br />
So with the graphics turned up it doesnt look like a dude dressed in a giant chicken outfit?<br />
<br />
As I said - have seen some really nice looking shots - that one just made me laugh.<br />
<br />
I also agree that gameplay and performance are the most important things, nothing wrong with stuff looking nice tho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://www.project-entropia.com/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Project Entropia will have a real economy system that allows you as a user to exchange real life money into PED (Project Entropia Dollars) and then back into a real currency again. Project Entropia will be free of charge with no monthly costs, which means that aside from the fees for your own local access to the internet while you are connected, the client software will be available with no payment to MindArk. <br />
<br />
First, how are they making any money?  Hmmm.<br />
Second, you think people in some of the uber guilds are nasty now... wait till they can make real cash using the game and not having to Ebay.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but I already see huge problems with this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Munkee Bizness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have a friend who is in the shadowbane beta, he isnt allowed to give specificts but all he has said is it kicks serious ass, and the only reason it hasnt been released yet is because wolfpack keeps getting new ideas for stuff to add and they are actually *gasp* finishing the world before they release it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Honestly though, Sims Online will blow everything else away as far as subscribers go.  Read somewhere that Sims is by far the highest selling computer game of all time now, so if even a small fraction of those people play SO it will far surpass any online game.<br />
<br />
Star Wars will also do much better than the current games just because of the name.  But Sims attracts a vastly larger audience than the D&amp;D crowd the current MMOGS are aimed at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ogrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">i was accepted into the entropia beta but i never installed it.  Think the CD is still sitting around here somehwere.  I heard the opposite about shadowbane, heard it sucks beyond beleif.  Sadly sims online will be the biggest.  SWG should be the best assuming they pull off even a fraction of what they say.  Will seriously rock once the space expansion is out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ulthaun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Just wondering where you heard Shadowbane &quot;sucked beyond belief&quot; from?<br />
<br />
Maybe for people that dont like PvPing this may be the case as all they want is a &quot;nice&quot; place to XP and run around the countryside<br />
<br />
Leave SB for the h4rdc0r3 PvPers, and the rest can go play SWG etc :D<br />
<br />
thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I'd have to say...I refuse to believe that the only reason its still in beta is because WP has ideas they want to put in...<br />
<br />
People in hopsitals don't stay because they are healthy, ya know.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I plan on trying it.  I WANT it to be a good game.  I just don't want it to take so long that I have to use my 401k money to play it.....<br />
<br />
And Im 22.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">SWG is the only one I wanna play other than EQ of course :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Must admit that I am also rather looking forward to SWG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Drezz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Here is my gripe about Shadowbane(Not really a gripe I guess):<br />
<br />
Shadowbane will have unrestricted PvP- Im fine with that, I loved UO when there was no statloss...<br />
Only probelm is, BY FAR, the majority of people want nothing to do with pvp, let alone unrestricted PvP... So I wonder where WP thinks they are going to have enough people to pay the bills..<br />
<br />
You could add up the entire PvP comunity of EQ, and Ultima Online, and I really doubt it would be more than 20,000 people(thats highballing it)...(MY reasoning for this number: When EQ showed server numbers, there was never more than 2k people on the pvp servers, 99% of the timeit was 1500 or less, and the Dev's for UO have said that 80% of the people who play the game, Stay in Trammel(PvP- zone) the whole time)<br />
<br />
I just dont see how the game will tap into the &quot;mainstream&quot; market, like EQ and DAoC... Most people are scared to death of PvP...<br />
<br />
Im going to guess that shadowbane will big huge for the first month or two, and then all the &quot;mainstream&quot; people will leave after being raped 24/7 by hardcore players... And then WP will be left with a tiny number of people, and will not be able to break even, let alone make a profit...<br />
<br />
30,000 players(And thats a HIGH number to &quot;guess&quot; for them) is not enough to pay the bills EQ has over 400,000... UO has around 140,000... <br />
<br />
Its kinda of sad I guess, SB is a good idea on paper, but It will never work for a mainstream game, UO proved that :(<br />
<br />
(Sorry if this is sort of jumbled all together, its 3:35am :P )<br />
<br />
My pick for the next big MMORPG is SW:G... The name alone will sell it... My only gripe with it, is Raph Koster being the lead designer, the guy is a ****ing moron..... :) <br />
 the Sims Online will be f00king huge... But I doubt I would play it.<br />
<br />
I think I might try Asheron's Call 2, it looks great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Shadowbane? Nah.  Horizons? Nah.  Even SWG...nah.<br />
<br />
I want a good, solid, playable, IMMENSE Middle Earth-based rpg....and I want it now :P<br />
<br />
Either that, or I want Verant to kiss the collective ass of Brad McQuaid, Steve McDaniel, Lady D, Kelly Flock, Kendrick, and the others, and get them back.  Pretty much everyone that had anything major to do with the game in its infancy is gone now.<br />
<br />
Then again...with McQuaid starting his own company...who knows what he might have up his sleeve :)<br />
<br />
In all honesty though...do you guys feel like the creativity is beginning to cease?  Ie:  Sleepers Tomb, Wakening Lands, LOIO, these are creative zones....now we have....*drum roll*....THE NETHERBIAN LAIR.  Whoopee.<br />
<br />
Seems to me that Velious was a great expansion with very few flaws (relatively speaking....and that was released in the heyday of MCQuaid and the others.<br />
<br />
Now we have Sucklin.  Barbarian Females who lean forward.  Horses that run like they have chronic arthritis.  A dysfunctional top end game (Inquisitor, anyone?).  A non functional &quot;function&quot; (the bazaar) that was promised.  And, people still cant seem to fill their spellbooks.<br />
<br />
I've played this game since phase 4 beta.  I've spoken with McQuaid in chat a few times.  I can remember when there was a magic to the game there isn't now....and it pisses me off that most of the people that made that magic happen are gone....for whatever reason.<br />
<br />
It really comes down to this:  The new person in charge is apparently the guy/girl who designed the old ry gorr chestplate model for half elf males.<br />
<br />
Run.<br />

<br />
Though, just to have add in a comment, ever since the old management team got the boot EQ's been getting better in my eyes. Their CS still sucks the brown eye but.... can't be perfect I guess...</div></div><hr />
