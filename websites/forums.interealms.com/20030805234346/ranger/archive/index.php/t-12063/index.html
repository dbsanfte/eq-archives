<br />
Yes, it's a little late for this, but oh, well...<br />
<br />
Ok, I use a custom UI hobbled together from all over the net.  I like it, it helps me to enjoy the game more.  I'm not an XML literate person by any stretch, so kudos to all teh people who work so hard on these mod files.<br />
<br />
The patch on 10-16 added some new features to the UI.  Ok, no problem, I don't really feel the need for the Alarm Clock feature, but some people may like it, so more power to them.  However, the Alarm Clock window has a checkbox on it so that you never have to see the Alarm Clock box again if you don't want to.  This is the ONLY place in the entire UI that features a checkbox.<br />
<br />
Now, in order to implement the checkbox, the following objects were added to the EQUI_Animations.xml file: &quot;a_checkboxnormal&quot;, and &quot;a_checkboxpressed &quot;.<br />
<br />
The net effect of adding these two new objects essentially broke the UIs of a significant portion of everyone using a custom UI, simply because the UI went nuts trying to do all it wanted to do without the proper code required.  Personally, I only lost a nice oversize cursor that I liked, but a lot of people who used complete mod sets like Quartz, Haven, or Vert were stuck with the default UI that is just blah. Those UIs will remain broken until the authors patch them, or the individual users fix it themselves.<br />
<br />
I can't understand Verant's choice to alter the Animations file over something so minor as a ****ing checkbox for ONE<br />
goddamn piece of **** window tossed as a bone to the mother of an unfortunate idiot who killed himself in front of his computer while logged on to EQ.  How much thought went into this?  Jesus ****ing Christ, were any other options for enabling/disabling this crappy window even considered??  Hell, why not make another modification of the Options Window with the crappy Alarm Clock features incorporated?  No need for one lousy addition that ruins the enjoyment of your custom UI customers that way, only another pressed/unpressed button such as already was incorporated into the ****ing file!<br />
<br />
I'm no programming genious, but I know there was a better option than ****ing up the UI for a significant amount of your customer base with such a minor and arguably unnecessary addition to this file.  Dammit, Verant, get a ****ing clue, and don't fix what ain't broke.  Save changes to important files such as EQUI_Animations.xml for major improvements or bulk loads of minor improvements.  Try at least to keep your goddamn UI files as stable as possible, and we will all be happier.</div></div><hr />
