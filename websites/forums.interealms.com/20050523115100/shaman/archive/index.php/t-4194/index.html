<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">/boggle votb for 900k The guy has been selling it every day now for a while. He needs to get a clue :P<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.starpixel.com/eq/votb.gif&quot;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I never understood these people, either.<br />
<br />
Even 35k for VotB is way high (course I can only speak for my server, where it sells for about 10k or less).<br />
<br />
Looking at Finger's other listings, seems like he enjoys the Viagra effect of seeing his name near so many zeros.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I saw Khura's Focusing go for about 6.5 the other night (lowest price I have seen yet).  Almost bought it but I knew that would have left me poor and destitute :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That's ok.  I commonly see Malosini for 1500, 6k, and 9k.  Hmm....  Think I'll recommend folks to go to FV and buy for about 50p. ;)</div></div><hr />

One less to worry about camping/buying ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">heh, I got lucky with VotB, I bought it off a merchant for 7pp in Katta a few days after luclin came out, while I was exploreing the zone check'n out all the merchants.<br />
<br />
It was so awesome because I was 59 and I really needed the spell :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Phallax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hmm bought my VoB for like 200pp from some gfay trader lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">well yesterday have seen someone selling iron ration for 1000pp lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
80k.  <br />
<br />
For one spell.<br />
<br />
Hey verant (lower case = no respect) Think there's a problem with Shaman spell drops?<br />
<br />
I always see the jokers selling Malosini for plats. Either:<br />
<br />
a) They're confused because they got it on a drop<br />
b) They're trying to rip somebody off.<br />
<br />
80k.<br />
<br />
And it was discounted.</div></div><hr />

I only bought one of my spells, Talisman of the Brute.  I traded a velium fire wedding ring for it.   I can see how people would want to buy spells they didn't have tho.  Really they should just kill kunark dragons and stuff like that tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yep Wildaar, those are two of them... Valarium is the guy selling Malosini for 6k.<br />
<br />
I also saw one guy selling Talisman of the Raptor one day, for 8k.  I was selling a spare for 500p, and he came over &amp; bought it, to cut out the competition... couple hours later, his price was down to 2k.</div></div><hr />

what server is this?  has to be the first time i have seen resonable prices on high level spells</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I suspect that 900000P price for VotB was because he doesn't have enough room in his bank to bank that spell, and so to keep anyone from buying it off of him when he enters /trader mode, he just jacks up the price, and no one will buy it.  He probably has a shaman himself and wants to keep the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Juujuu,<br />
<br />
If you dont set a price it doesnt come up in the trade screen at all so there is no need to put it up at 900k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I saw a guy selling an Orc Fang Earring for 50k the other night. All I can figure is that this is some people's weak attempt at humor. Nobody is that stupid.</div></div><hr />

 Really they should just kill kunark dragons and stuff like that tho. <br />
<br />
It's not that easy (or even possible) for everyone, though.  And what's really frustrating is that said dragons have the best chance of dropping Torpor, and if you are like myself (in a smaller guild), that cuts off a major avenue of opportunity.  <br />
So ya either gotta be really rich and buy it for going price (30k on my server), or be really lucky and have it gifted or find it in Bazaar for dirt cheap :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It isn't even a matter of desire or ability to kill Kunark dragons anymore.<br />
<br />
It is a question of whether or not you can win a race against Team Manaburn. Good F'ing luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Finger is on my server, he's a constant source of amusment whenever I hit the bazaar. That is Talisman of the Brute you see for 3k there as well. I guess one can always dream.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I do get a good laugh when I see some of the spell prices in the bazaar. Most are way overpriced like these examples, but some idiot had Malo priced at 1k. I would like to thank him for being so stupid. <br />
<br />
One rare as hell spell down, lots more to go.</div></div><hr />

People dont realize all but 4 Beast spells are vendor buyable.<br />

Hmm 8k or 8 pp from vendor. =)</div></div><hr />

Savagery is their hardest spell to get and a BL in my guild was complaing that the cheapest he could find it was 10k. Geez if I could buy all my spells for 10k I'd be happy as hell.</div></div><hr />

They are hoping someone carrying a ludicrous amount of plat will click in to browse their wares (perhaps to verify the way high price on the item) and accidentally click &quot;buy&quot; insteead of &quot;exit&quot; or whatever.  All trades are final .....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Actually, I believe the hardest spell for a beastlord to obtain would be Sha's Advantage.

<br />
80k.  <br />
<br />
For one spell.<br />
[B]<br />
<br />
what's even worse - that spell was offered about 30 sec for 40k  - I talked to the trader and he was willing to take my whole bank account, 36 k for it. At that second the spell got snatched of the trader to be put up for sale 30 sec later for 100k.<br />
I was mightily steamed to say the least.<br />
So I did pick up Khura's for 2k and bane for 3k.  It helps to have a 24/7 mule there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Anithar AnachroniX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">If those prices were on my server... they pretty much wouldn't be selling jack :P<br />
<br />
That's everywhere u go tho i guess. I think much of it has to do with what guilds are raiding and so on. I've already, (along with other casters in my guild) have talked about spell farming in the short term....<br />
<br />
For sure tho, long as melee's keep getting more uber loot... it's the loot/gear that will be getting farmed more than spells. :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Heh on my server all these spells cost that much and more.  Seen khura's for 15k and up(and UP!), avatar for 4k and more, pox for 20k and more, etc etc.  I was shocked by how unbelievably, fantastically, incredibly LOW the prices were that some of you recounted. ;)</div></div><hr />
