I became member of the Oracles last night while soloing in PoI.  My first 60 char despite haveing 4 or 5 over 50 in the past 3years.  That was easily the most anticipated Ding I've ever had, I even turned the speakers up to an obnoxious volume at 5am before the end of the last 59th fight.  I thought it was and would forever be my happiest EQ moment.  Then I scribed Torpor which had been in my bag since I was 57.  I reorganized my spells and pulled another mob.   This fight quickly replaced my ding as my happiest EQ moment.  <br />
<br />
***?!?!?!<br />

How can 1 friggin spell make that much of a difference to a class?  I'm not complaining since I have it but Jesus H Christ on rubber crutchs!  It isnt even fair or right or anything justifiable, but it sure as hell is fun :D.  When soloing some of the tougher PoI Ent mobs at 59, I was ending the fight on average with 60% health and mana (I like to keep them even in most cases).  But after my transition into the world of Super Shaman, I ended Every fight full health and mana, and was using more mana, blasting and tanking the whole time.  The difference is just sick, and I couldnt be happier about it.   I've gained a whole new love for my shaman, Cana5 here I come :).<br />

P.S.<br />
I'd like to take this little piece of time to thank ALL of the posters on this forum.  I too was a person who played a melee and saw what shaman could do and decided to make a twink.  But the diversity of the class and solo, group, raid abilities quickly made him my main and all-time favorite class(too bad took me 2years to find it).  I found this forum very early on in my Shaman's life and the things I've learned here have been of unmeasureable value.  I've always had a rep of being a great shaman and its due largely to you folks.  Thanks :)</div></div><hr />

I can recall when I did the same.  It was a great moment.  Get Canni V, it will just add to your Torpor/60 rush.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Now you get to look forward to telling your clerics you dont need heals :)<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
Grats on 60 and having torpor too!  Your going to (and sounds like you already do) love it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just beware, once you get torpor you can't play any other classes, it's just too damn hard to give up =)</div></div><hr />
