Glori:  It works without any problems and stuff?  Since it's still in beta I'm a little nervous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No problems at all except there is a definite pause while accessing it, like 3-5 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm using it too.  VERY nice, and if you have caching turned on the graphics load only once, then are instant pop-up per page =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just installed it and poked around... WOW it rocks.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">nice =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xani Crimsonheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Great mod, but unfortunately it might be illegal in VIs eyes.  Someone over at EQ Traders posted a UI mod that let you access recepies for everything in the same fashion you can look at the maps.  They talked to VI about it, and were told it's a bannable offense to use it.<br />
<br />
This seems to be along the same lines.  Use at your own risk :(<br />
<br />
Maybe someone should ask VI *shrug*<br />

<br />
These maps are not pulled from the EQ directory and the mod doesn't touch the help file (the EQ Trader mod did). Furthermore, the modder has been told by VI he's within the EULA on this.<br />
<br />
Bannable offense my ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The maps are stored as a tga graphic file, and used as backgrounds in an otherwise empty box.  Completely within the EULA.  Anything you can put as an image could be added as such.<br />
<br />
The recipe mod was done by overwriting the current in game help file (check it out sometime), which is an html document.  However... to get the recipes, you had to patch, copy the recipe file over the help file, then finish loading the game.  Every time you start EQ.  Which is modifying the game.<br />
<br />
If the guy takes the effort to make graphics files out of the recipe's, then VI can't complain about it.</div></div><hr />
