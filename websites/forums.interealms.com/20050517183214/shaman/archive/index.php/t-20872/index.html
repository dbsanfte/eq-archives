<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Duyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi.  I have been looking through the hunting guides (they're great by the way) and I noticed that many people say they get 3% or whatever per kill.  How do you know this?  I can see my blue bar moving when I kill something, but I don't know what exact percent it moved.<br />
<br />
Are people just estimating or is there some other place I am not looking that shows it.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any info you can provide.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eluj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They're using a custom ui.<br />
<br />
You can go to http://www.eqinterface.com/ and download one. I personally use Quartz and it's great, but there are alot to choose from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">With alternate User Interfaces you can get bars with % or even just the numbers.  Still an estimate because for variances lower than 1% but more acurate than the bar.  if you interested in changing your ui go to www.eqinterface.com.  long as you follow the instructions you can play around and not have to worry much about messing anything up on your system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ophidion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1 blue = 4% xp<br />
1 Yellow = 5 blues or 20% xp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Duyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm, custom UI.  Thanks for the information.  I just looked over there at the link you guys provided and I have a question.  I notice that some have been uploaded months ago.  What happens when there is a patch that changes the files.  I have noticed that patch messages notify you of the changed files.  Do you have to get a new UI from the person who made it?  Or do you just keep using it without regard to the patch messages?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dirkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Custom UI do need to be upgraded when there are UI changes, such as the addition of the combat abilities window for the melee classes not too long ago. But they should be fine if patches contains no UI changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Patch ui changes automatically update your default ui, not your customised ui, so you can't leave it as is.<br />
I like to leave my default ui untouched, so I delete my customised ui from everquest\uifiles after a patch, copy and rename the default ui, then unzip my playerwindow etc back into the renamed ui file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I used to use custom UIs. I got tired of being unable to log without messing with things after patch. I have returned to the default.</div></div><hr />
