<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Heigelyac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Being the looter can be a pain in the butt on Adventures, but it does keep you well supplied with pet weapons.  I personally haven't felt any pangs of conscience over keeping 2 1handers off of an adventure, and then you get to log in tomorrow and not have to beg a mage for weapons.  <br />
<br />
You may want to, for the procs, for the extra hp and ac, but it CAN sometimes take 45 min off your playtime to find one, cos guildies log on later than you or some mages are just not nice.<br />
<br />
So be a looter.  Keep a set back.  if you feel guilty, add 10plat to the split.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">And they are not worth a whole lot anyways.  At most I keep 4 weapons back from the split.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I just head to the fishermen vendors on the west side of PoK. There is almost always rusty daggers on either or both of them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hildaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Also, as for mage summoned weapons, if a Mage frieand/guildie is not readly available. I just check the Bazaar, ya can find them for sale there much of the time. If no one sells them on your server, just suggest it to some mages, it will catch on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I normally check bazaar if I want pet toys, it's a bit more expensive.. but there is normally some mage selling them for 5-10pp a piece. It's worth the convenience for me if I want the pet toys that bad. Otherwise I do as kinedorf says and buy a bunch of rusty's from fisherman vendor in pok.<br />
Scalia is that shadow haven you get those hammers from? If so were at? Sometimes the fisherman doesn't have rusty's.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Believe in the ball, and throw yourself&quot;<br />
<br />
I often find myself purchasing these weapons from the camp when i'm about to go on an adventure and out of rusties... or at least, I used to... before pet zoning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Er, what's wrong with SH weapons?<br />

What are SH weapons?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Budana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">What are SH weapons?<br />
<br />
I believe he was refering to the weapons in shadowhaven.  If you zone into SH from the bazaar the vendors up the stairs usually have weapons from PC for a silver piece or two.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's actually an awesome idea.  I have a spirit stone and I never thought of that.  Going to start doing that for sure.  Hildaorm = rulest.<br />
<br />
Mage bought stuff is great but I'm not good at controlling my pet and most of the time he dies and I end up loosing time and 50+ plat per set =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My Favourite place to get rusty weapons in the newbie area next to the PoK book outside Freeport, normally a fair number of decaying Skellies and Orc's to mug and easy to see due to the small area they cover.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shadow Haven is right, but there is no need to look for PC-sold weapons. There is a vendor very close to the Nexus teleporter who has an unlimited supply of smithing paraphernalia including hammers. He is marked as #24 on the EQAtlas map (http://www.eqatlas.com/luclin/shadowhavenmap.html). Just keep in mind that he sells two types of hammers, one for a few pp and one for 1 silver. They are a little heavy, but that's what weight reducing bags are for :)</div></div><hr />

Why can't they make this Initiate Symbol of the Tribunal (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1209) summon droppable weapons for our pet?<br />

<br />
Yup.  Same thing here.  I usually stock up on 6-8 rusty daggers at a few silver a piece.<br />

Pet won't equip any no drop items, which is what the symbol summons, unfortunately.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do essentially the same thing. The differences being that I am an Iksar, I go to FoB, and I use the merchant in the building outside of Cabilis ;). Oh, and due to the port-in location I am frequently jumped by a greenie skeleton  on port in (often with a weapon).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Angilia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Pet won't equip any no drop items, which is what the symbol summons, unfortunately.<br />
<br />
Pets will use some no drop weapons like the stuff dropped in DSP.<br />
But very few of them.<br />
Most will not be used.<br />
<br />
Its a good suggestion but some are usable. You can see the hit messages change if you want to test it.<br />
The summoned hammers from initiate and the summoned from clerics wont work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gunny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I do like most and check the merchants around fishing holes.  And when I do a cash run, I go to CC to farm for ore off the orcs to sell in the baz and collect various velium weapons for my dog.  Seeing the proc go off from my dog makes me happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Cosik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I always sell those drops from LDoN Adventures.  its silly not to add in the extra 4 or 5 pp when you can turn around and just check the venders in PoK for some rusties/shivs that are 8 silver and buy 6-8 at a time.</div></div><hr />
