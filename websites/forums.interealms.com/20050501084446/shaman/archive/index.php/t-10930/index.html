<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have heard rumors of iksar exp penalty hurting exp for folks that dont do 100% AA or 100% regular exp, like a 50/50 mixture...anyone have any confirmation either way on this pls?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xelot Bloodseer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm not sure if I understand the question, but if you're talking about the racial/class XP penelty, I thought they done away with that?<br />
<br />
I'm not aware of an additional penalty with reg/AA experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">good question . If i rememeber right the penalty ( still exists last i checked with my troll SK ) doesnt affect AA. In a 50/50 setting im not sure what it might do .<br />
<br />
<br />
Need to get some of them to chime in with data</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, for one, YES the RACIAL exp penalties still exist.  It was only the class penalties they did away with.<br />
<br />
The initial question isn't phrased all that well, but I had heard in the past that there were issues with exp splits between level and aa exp.  I think they've been reported as both acknowledged and fixed by VI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Geal Icehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If I understand L33t Dood ( sorry the spelling of your name asked for it) right. He is asking if having a percentage of exp going toward AA negates the racial exp penalty. <br />
For instance a troll/iksar with 90% going to level and 10% going to aa. Would they level faster, despite having 10% going to AAs, because they are no long paying the 20% racial penalty? I have heard this rumor before but never looked into it because it didnt affect me.  If true  Iksar Troll and Ogres would all be able to escape there high racial penalties and earn some AAs as a bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually, he asks if it hurts, not if it helps.<br />
<br />
I often run 10/90 and if it eliminates the racial exp. penalty, it is darn hard to see it!  and it is very easy to see when the racial penalty is gone because I am hunting in a pinky city, like HHK and Katta.<br />
<br />
so, I for one don't believe that splitting exp between reg/AA eliminates the penalty.  However, the AA goes up so much faster that it is believable that the racial exp. penalty is not applied to AA penalty calculations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have been told you get a double penalty if you do a split.  But I havent parsed the data to say for sure.  Shouldnt be to hard to check with mobs that give 2% aa exp per kill.  Kill 10 mobs 100% aa then kill 20 mobs 50% aa.  As a troll if you get the racial hit you would end up significantly lower aa exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">all i want to know is does it work like this<br />
<br />
exp gets split 50/50...50% goes into AA w/o any racial penalty ...other 50% into exp w/ racial penalty...is this correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">From the last data I saw:<br />
15 million experience per AA - no matter who it is.<br />
<br />
Each level requires a certain amount of experience per level.  This amount of experience differs based on race.  A Barbarian might need 30 million experience for level 52, but an Iksar might need 45 million.  If each splits experience 50/50, it looks like the iksar is getting a lot less level experience, but it's not a bug.<br />
<br />
There was a bug at one time that was messing up the aa/level experience splitting - kind of like autosplit among people in a group is still kind of messed up.  Sony says it is fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Did SOE ever say AA exp was exempt from exp penalties for those who have them? I dont see why it would be. <br />
<br />
There may have been an error in the way they applied the penalty, where the full penalty was applied to both exp bars after the split. <br />
<br />
Example; you have a 10% exp penalty and you gain 100 exp points from a kill. It calculates the penalty (10 points), splits the exp, and then applies the 10 point penalty to each bar (resulting in a 20% exp penalty).<br />
<br />
They may have just fixed it so that the penalty is calculated and subtracted before it is split up so you dont get a double whammy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">aa exp shouldnt be linked to the exp penalty though.....i just want to know if i set my exp on 50/50 will the penalty be applied before the split thus getting less exp in AA than i should be getting...or does it split and only apply the penalty to to 50% going into EXP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">supposedly AAXP does NOT have the racial penalties applied to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">That doesnt make any sense to me. There's no reason AA exp should be excluded from the penalty for those who have exp penalties. The penalty is on your exp, it shouldnt matter where you're sending that exp.</div></div><hr />
