<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jice Virago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For assisting in killing Nag last night.  After getting screwed by Fartstorm at Sev I felt compelled to kill something big and challenging.  Nag was up.  We had some interim difficulties and two failed attempts (squarely my fault due to not counting Giants and not having groups set up correctly), but everyone stuck it out because the goal was in sight.<br />
<br />
In the end, Nag died to 13 people, the bulk of whom were not decked out in Velious gear and very few were even level 50.  We also had one cleric and two shamans for healing (49, 52, 44 respectively) so this was not a well oiled killing machine of a force.  People who don't know me don't understand why I do things like this, but killing a tough target with minimal forces is one of the most enjoyable experiences for me in EQ.  It really brings out the best in people and instills a feeling of accomplishment that is unmatched.  For those who fought, I promise you the typical Zerg Nag with 30-50 will never be entertaining again and I thank you for comming.<br />
<br />
Next time we do it with 12 =p<br />
<br />
PS Exact Crew was Clr49, Sham44, Shm52, Rog50, Rog48, Mnk52, Mnk52, War52, War50, Pal50, Pal45, Sk52, Wiz52<br />
<br />
Rogues + Wizard accounted for over 20k of the damage =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Terarle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Glad I could help last night Jice :)<br />
<br />
And you can count me in if i am not over the level limit for the 12 man attempt :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cshae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Grats on a 13 man Naggie kill!! I agree that the &quot;challenge&quot; run or raid is the most exhilerating experience and leaves you thirsting for more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cubman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Anytime you find yourself in need of a 51 wiz or 56 shammy, feel free to look me up.  Always happy to lend a hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jlove Fizzboom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Great job you guys -- very impressive.  Was fun watching the details of the adventure in our /gu.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kazzir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hey guys, nice job... 13 people taking down naggy is pretty darn good...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aseid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">great work with a limited force guys.  Very impressive.<br />
<br />
Makes me want to work on an alt to get back in Naggy range for next time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Congrats everyone for a very impressive kill.. :)<br />
<br />
I love adhoc forces as well.. it can (and often is) a lot of fun to try to make do with what you have.. <br />
<br />
(The above brought to you by the &quot;We don't need no stinkin clerics or chanters&quot; fan club ;) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Grah!  I was committed to something else already or I woulda been there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe one more Naggy/Vox run left for the bard before he hits 53.<br />
<br />
What say we do em both back-to-back, 20 or less folks?    :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>burien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">wow my first ever naggy kill, ever. not too shabby, AND despite havin abysmal resists didnt die, go figure. thanks jicy for the fun.</div></div><hr />
