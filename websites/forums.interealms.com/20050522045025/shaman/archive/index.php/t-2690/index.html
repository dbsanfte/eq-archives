<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Created an acct.<br />
<br />
But I cant find a link that talks about setting it up for eq! Seems that it can be used in a variety of different ways...I know its simple I just keep looking past what I need to get my profile created.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">www.magelo.com<br />
<br />
At the upper-left hand corner (the main screen, not the scroll bar with all the links) there's a Login and a Register button.<br />
<br />
Click on Register, and follow the instructions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Magelo is the devil!<br />
<br />
Just wait til you to create some bags with stuff in them for your inventory!  The devil, I say!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Once you're logged in you should be able to see an option on the left hand menu that says &quot;characters&quot;. That gets you to a screen where you there should be a button that says &quot;add a character&quot;, do that. You'll add in all your basic info etc into it and when you're done hit &quot;add this character&quot;.<br />
<br />
You'll now find yourself back at that same &quot;add a character&quot; screen but your newly added character will be listed too. At the bottom of your new characters &quot;sheet&quot; will be these links (gender specific of course):<br />
Update this character<br />
Manage her profile(s)<br />
Manage her keyring<br />
Manage her inventory<br />
Manage her abilities<br />
Manage her skills<br />
Manage her languages<br />
<br />
To add items to your character you need to click on the &quot;profiles&quot; link. That takes you to a page with all the slots listed and the word &quot;[edit]&quot;, click on [edit] for any slot. You now have a drop down box, go through it and pick what you have in that slot then hit &quot;update&quot;. Repeat that for everything. When you're done, click the little &quot;this is my default profile&quot; box, type a name into the &quot;save current profile as&quot; box and then update.<br />
<br />
Now there should be that profile's name with some numbers in () under the &quot;stored profile&quot; box. As well as a link at the bottom of the page. You'll notice that link ends in the same numbers that are in the (). That's the link to your profile. <br />
<br />
You can create numerous profiles for that character from this screen, just give them different names before updating. They'll all be assigned different numbers but be linked to one another. Meaning if you put your first profile in your signiture when someone clicks on it they'll see &quot;resist&quot;, &quot;future&quot;, &quot;if I was a god&quot; (or whatever other profiles you've also created) on the right hand side of the information box. It's kinda hard to explain but I think you know what I mean from looking at other people's magelos.<br />
<br />
You basically do the same thing to add keys.<br />
<br />
Binding stuff to your inventory is a bit different and a lot longer to explain. Once you get the basic profile done, mess around with the inventory part and you'll figure it out eventually :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Magelo is very finicky about the browser you use. I can only make it work with IE, Netscape just doesn't like some of their security settings.  Whenever I open a profile in netscape it loads the &quot;background&quot; grid, but no items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhh<br />
<br />
When I logged in before I didnt get a new window, and thus didnt get the characters option.<br />
<br />
well then.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Krakster, I love that Sash, where did you get it? Give me all the info on it, rare I suppose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hehe, people ask me about that all the time, but I wasnt paying 100% attention when it dropped so I forgot the name of the mob. Was in Shraehaheaeah temple a month or so after luclin went live, killing taskmasters on the first floor with one solid group, trying to figure out what they dropped and what it was for. The mob that dropped it, I guess it was a semi named, but I think it always spawns, because we had killed it twice already in the 3 or so hours we had been there. The 3rd time we killed it it dropped the sash. Going by what I know now, I belive the mob was pulled from *under* the ramp where the glyph'd/runed serpent spawns. Under that platform I think there is a door against the inside wall, and more mobs from there. It spawned somewhere in there.<br />
<br />
That is my best recollection of where we got it from (sorry it was like 5 months ago). I think I took a screenie of the corpse so i'll have to go back and look.  Its caster only, and the cleric, chanter, and necro we had all passed on it. *Huuuuuuge grin*</div></div><hr />
