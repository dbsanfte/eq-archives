<br />
Doing it... <br />
<br />
Wizards do it really hard, <br />
but they're finished just as fast, <br />
and clerics do it with a yaulp, <br />
a whimper and a gasp. <br />
<br />
Warriors insist on dirty-talk <br />
with taunting and much abuse, <br />
while bard tongue wags in song <br />
when it might be put to better use. <br />
<br />
Enchanters, though charming, <br />
would rather do it with your mind <br />
and rogues insist on using pointy things, <br />
preferably from behind. <br />
<br />
SKs do it with a touch, <br />
but only once a day <br />
and necros do it with the dead <br />
to our general dismay. <br />
<br />
Monks do it with hands and feet <br />
flailing all about, <br />
while pallies try to lay their hands <br />
on their squires and their mounts. <br />
<br />
Shammies do it really slow <br />
but rarely in human form, <br />
and druids insist on groups of four <br />
or at least that seems the norm. <br />
<br />
Rangers do a bit of everything, <br />
often with whip in hand <br />
and beastlords title will have to say it all <br />
or so discretion demands. <br />
<br />
Mages simply view this crowd <br />
and say with some regret: <br />
to hell with that, <br />
I'll just do it with my pet!</div></div><hr />
