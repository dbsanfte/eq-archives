<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beliael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just finished my elemental flags and have spent a bit of time poking around in fire. I tried some of the mobs near the GY and they were fun and all. I tried a mob or 3 in the yellow con field(field 2?) and it was good, although distinct lack of room. <br />
<br />
 However I'm kind of curious about the red con mobs in the castle on the far side of the yellow con field. I'd seen references to them being soloable elsewhere on the boards but can't quite figure out where to pull them. The wanderers out front seem to be out as the 2 guards path by each other fairly regularly. They all see invis so sneaking into the castle through the doorway seems to be out as it is guarded. Am I missing something? Float over the wall from a nearby hill? Any suggestions as to an approach would be appreciated and probably result in a fair number of deaths until I finish VP3 :D<br />
<br />
   Thanks,<br />
        Beliael</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can sneak threw there. The trick is the aggro range is really small so even tho they see invis there is a safe path threw there. I wouldn't recommend trying to find it on your own but it's fairly obvious looking at a map, at least IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You go pretty much straight thru the second castle, staying equidistant(sp?) from the buildings, and thru a small tunnel. There is an area with quite a bit of room there, and a table in the middle. Guardian of Doomfire is nearby, do not agro him(agro range is small tho). There are several other mobs at the tables, 2 in each building and like 3 or so outside the buildings. All are single pullable, all are rootable, and all mitigate slow.<br />
<br />
IIRC, I get 17% aa per kill solo at the tables, with 90% to alt xp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beliael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok thanks for the tip... gonna try that out shortly. One other question maybe someone can help me with... will DD's break Virulent Paralysis? Or will I be limited to using PoP dots?<br />
<br />
<br />
  Thanks again,<br />
          Beliael</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">DDs do break VP, just like any other root. it's somewhat random, VP being between the paralyzing earth and immobilize lines.<br />
<br />
I would stick with BoU, BoS, and Bane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I haven't tried it since I got Bane, and kills took a long time using epic, ultor and saryrn. It was decent exp, but not my favorite spot since you had to be so careful about watching the VP timer. On the other hand, VP is totally reliable after malicious decay and I never had one break prematurely.<br />
<br />
There are almost always some necros, beasts, druids etc. exping her on Bristlebane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Beliael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Managed to catch a kite group with a pack of wizzies while checking out the area... the xp was just silly. Managed to get 2 levels of VP while there. After the others left I tried one solo... without VP it would have been doable but very tough... with vp it was nothing. Fight took like 11-12 minutes but could be done much faster as I was slacking on keeping dots running. Thanks for the help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Stacking Bane, Anathema, BoU, and BoS, expect a doomfire to take about 4-5 minutes to die, then about 1 minute to replenish your mana.  Not bad for 14% a pop.<br />
<br />
There are two places to kill doomfires.  The first one I used is outside the castle, up on the south (?) zone wall.  It's the zone wall past the little lava pit and behind the big rock.  Nothing will roam back there.<br />
<br />
The infinitely better place to solo doomfires, though, is in what is commonly referred to as the &quot;picnic tables&quot; on my server.  It is the area where the fennin trigger spawns.  The trigger usually isn't up, but if he is, he is easy to avoid.  Everything in castle2 has a very small aggro radius, completely opposite from the identical-looking mobs in SRT.  To get to picnic tables, just wait for the roamer at the entrance to the castle to path away, then make a break for it.  As you come through the door you will see a raised platform with doomfires on it.  Go around it to the left, and then run straight with a small building on your left, and the platform on your right.  Try to stay pretty much in the center between them or you might aggro them.  Once you get past that part, it is easy.  None of the other huts have guards in them.  Just run past the platform and go through the second archway in to the large open area.  You are now at picnic tables - the best known exp spot in the game for a soloing shaman.<br />
<br />
If you are especially ballsy, you can solo the magma guardians that guard the bridge behind charm birds.  Every now and then when I am in one of those moods, I will stop in and kill them for an hour or so.  They have a lot more HP (~60k) than doomfires and give you less xp (11%). On top of that, they can hit you five times in one round, not counting a bash/kick, and hit for 1150ish.  They are also fairly resistant to disease, so VP is unreliable.  I use paralyzing earth and stand as far away from my rooted target as I possibly can.  Why would you solo these?  They drop solidified magma and metallic substance for pofire tradeskills.  Solidified magma is pretty much the only hard to get component for the ID4 pottery item, so if you get one of those to drop then you're in the money.<br />
<br />
Finally, the best possible exp you are going to milk out of pofire is going to be in a group at tables.  Get a necro or druid to snare the mob, then you load it up with dots and kite it in a circle.  Have the other members of your group (casters preferred - melees suck at this) unload on the mob.  I have yet to have anyone take aggro from me unless they were specifically chaining their aggro spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Will check picnic tables spot soon, hope there won't be any clerics (or enough other mobs).</div></div><hr />

<br />
At tables there are I believe 9 spawns in the actual table area, and none of them cast.  I don't think it is possible for a soloing shaman to clear all 9 before respawn, so you shouldn't have to worry about cleric mobs any more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I don't have anethema, but I think you're right. The best I can keep clear is seven of the nine. <br />
<br />
You can sometimes pull a couple from the area just outside the tables as they're not always casters out there.<br />

<br />
<br />
Yup 14% a kill of the red con guards... I get 8%ish in field 2 off the yellow con mobs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Korsib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I just took my first try at soloing tables after grouping there a few times.  It's pretty much perma camped on my server so I was lucky to find an opening.  If the Guardian of Doomfire isn't up, I would strongly suggest using the bridges for your killing.  When your root breaks, it gives you tons of moving space.  And as long as people in zone know you won't have someone coming and taking your camp.<br />
I don't have VP yet, but I was able to keep the mobs almost perma rooted with my ornate legs.  These things are a godsend for any root rot soloer.  The way I did it, is I would basically chain cast the root inbetween my spells, as I dotted, rooted, then would canni/root/canni/root until the dots wore off.  Although it seems excesive, the cast time of the root is almost the same as your recast time, plus there's no recast on the ornate legs.  The dots I used were Saryrn, Ultor, Bane, and Anathema.  Every kill took less than the time for slow to wear off, so I'd say 4-6 min depending on the mob.  This is also with BA4 bracer from a mage.  Med time was usually 1 min or so.  The pulls are very easy, even mobs that are in the same building (two buildings in picnic area), can be singled easily.  With the exp after the solo nerf, I was getting 14-16% per kill.<br />
<br />
I've also done the magma golems before, and using the same rooting technique you can keep them in the same place almost the entire fight.  The fights do take a bit longer than the tables mobs.  Usually 7-9 minutes depending on how many times root breaks.  Usually 13-14% a kill on these guys.  The pull can be a little hard once you've killed the wanderers, as the ones next to each other on the bridge can't be singled.  Also, consider this camp pointless once charm birds are up, there's just not enough room to pull if they are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Get KEI if you can. I prefer it to VoQ because of the duration. Also if you can snag a 9 that's even better. Have a mage summon you a BA 4 bracer and head to fire. Personally I use a Miserable Bauble from Saryrn in Torment. Sow/Lwv. yourself and invis up. Keep gate memmed too. Run over the first castle wall and go downtairs and out the front. Don't get too close to the two birds if they're up. Head right and go along the wall to the second castle. There are two guards that patroll the gate, and they are easy to spot. There are also two static guards by the door. I usually wait til the two patrolling guards are farther out than the static ones and then i run in. Head to the back door and if you dont have aggro youre good to go. If you do have aggro but only one mob kill it if you can or gate and try again.<br />
<br />
Once youre set up get a nice spellset up. I use (If I recall) Malicious Decay, Malosinia, Breath of Ultor, Blood of Saryrn, Bane, Anathema, Quiescence, Canni 4. I also use my epic because hey, free dps is free dps. The aggro is small here. There are 9 mobs i think. There are two houses with two mobs in each. You can target the left mob and pull him through the left side and vice versa. Get as far away as you can and pull with Malicious Decay. Hit VP asap and throw te mob where you think is best. Hop on your mount and sinia till it sticks. It isn't usually hard to do w/o Malos, but occasionally they resist like 10 in a row. Stack on the DoT's and watch the exp flow in. I'm still trying to debate whether or not it is faster with or without Anathema. It eats mana pretty fast and causes me to have to canni more after the fight than when I don't use it. Also Critical Affliction makes this go faster. For those fire flagged you can kill many things with this method, and I think I heard frog in PoS are one of those mobs.<br />
<br />
Happy hunting, and may fire bring you hours of soloing fun.</div></div><hr />
