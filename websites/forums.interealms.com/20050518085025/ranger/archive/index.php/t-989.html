<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-09-2002, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Once upon a time dere were three ogre friends.  Jedbuk, Ericbuk, and Numbuk.  Dey loved to ride dese magical tings dat stay up on two wheels called &quot;Bikes.&quot;  One day, Jedbuk get an idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey dumbheads,&quot; said Jedbuk,&quot; Me have good idea!  How about we go to Moab and ride our bikes on da Slickrock trail dere!  It fun, me been dere once!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ericbuk like dat idea.  &quot;Oh, me love dat ting almost as much as me love bashing  dr00ds!  Me been on it at least 25 times!&quot;<br />
<br />
Numbuk like idea, but he a little apprehensive.  &quot;Me never been dere, but me hear it fun!  Me have mountain bike from last year dat me bought, but me having super much fun time wit me new road bike from dis year!  Me will try dis rock slicky trail ting!&quot;<br />
<br />
So da three friends set off for Moab.  Dey no could find a port because Ericbuk had bashed all da dr00ds nearby, so dey had to settle for running via SOW.  It took dem 4 hours, but dey finally made it to da red rock area of Moab, Utah.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dis feel just like home at Oggok!&quot; said Ericbuk!<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, except all da rocks are red.... and dere are hippies everywhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You got that right, Moondoggy!&quot; said Papa Smurpheater who just happened to walk by.<br />
<br />
So da three ogres shack up at a hippie hotel called a Hostel and dream about da next morning when dey go attempt to bash da SlickRock trail.<br />
<br />
Da berry next day, dey drive up to da trail and take deir bikes off of Jedbuk's car.  Lots of people were already up on da trail, as dis trail is da most popular mountain bike trail in da entire world.  It is an all-natural trail, and da rock it is on is as smooth as concrete.<br />
<br />
As dey rode, Numbuk found dat his bike was a bit too big for him and he made a hasty purchase last year.  He hurt himself multple times in his &quot;special area&quot; when having to bail off of steep hills.  Me sure he not want yous to know dis.  Er wait... me Numbuk!  Forget what yous just read.<br />
<br />
As dey rode on, dey found a nice place to stop off of bikes and explore da top of da slickrock mountain.<br />

<br />
Numbuk say dat he no understand why he look so short in dat picture when he da same size as Jedbuk.<br />
<br />
Numbuk den overlooked da hippie town of Moab and thought it looked super tiny from way up dere.  But still not as tiny as Rivervale is in real life.<br />

<br />
As Numbuk was admiring da view, he accidentally bump Ericbuk and send him into a bottomless pit.  Ericbuk crawl his way back out and Numbuk do his best to pull him up.<br />
<br />

<br />
Ok, it not really bottomless pit.  But it look like good photo opportunity.  Sue Jedbuk.  It his idea.<br />
<br />
After deir short and fun hike, dey get back on deir bikes and ride some more.  Numbuk zoomed along really good for his first time ever on da rock slicky trail ting.<br />
<br />

<br />
Numbuk's confidence grew and grew.  He was tackling steeper and steeper hills dat scared him at first.  He was becoming unstoppable.<br />
<br />

<br />
As he approached a really steep, downward rock hill, a tiny dorf decided it would like to play a trick on da ogre.  It decided to sit at da berry bottom of da hill and disguise itself as a big rock.<br />
<br />
Numbuk came down da hill and hit da dorf.  Numbuk flew forward, still clutching to bike.  Numbuk's right knuckles broke Numbuk's fall on da hard slickrock.  Numbuk's elbow got a good piece of it too.  Numbuk's chest hit his bike wit such force, dat it shattered da plastic holder for his bike's spedometer (me no lie).  Numbuk's hand got massive internal bruise dat still hurt even now as he type dis.  Numbuk pretty sure it not broken as it no hurt to grab and move any bones and it slowly feeling better each day.<br />
<br />
Grrr (www.xmission.com/~rjomero/moab6.jpg)<br />
<br />
Numbuk's hand hurt so bad, dat it hurt to put any kind of pressure on da meaty part of it.  He no could ride anymore.  Dis happened at da halfway marker of da slickrock trail (it a loop).  So da ogres decide to go back da way dey came.  Numbuk had to walk bike carefully.  Numbuk's legs unfortunately still wanted to ride REALLY BAD.  So, on some smooth parts, Numbuk carefully rode one-handed.  But for da most part he walked (and ran real hard up steep rock hills so he at least feel like he got some good workout).<br />
<br />
Jedbuk and Ericbuk no minded going back.  Dey had a great time on trail.  And, it not da kind of trail dat yous ride really fast anyway, so Numbuk's walking no hindered deir enjoyment on da way back.  Dis helped Numbuk not feel so guilty.<br />
<br />
Still, Numbuk was really mad at da dorf who made him crash.<br />
<br />
When dey got back to Jedbuk's car, it had been 3 and a half hours later.  Da group decided dey was berry, berry hungry.  Ogres is always hungry, but dese were even moreso dan usual after dat ride.  So, dey stop at da bestest place in da entire state to eat:  Pasta Jays.<br />
<br />
Numbuk gave da cook someting he brought back from his trip and made a berry special order.<br />
<br />
Heh heh (www.xmission.com/~rjomero/moab7.jpg)<br />
<br />
Dat night da ogres set back for anudder 4 hour SOW run to deir homes (Ericbuk had again bashed all da porting classes).  Da ogre hippies of Moab were sad to see dem go.  But it ok, because someday, me sure dey will see dem again.<br />
<br />
Da ogres made it back home ok and den dey went straight to bed cause dey were berry tired.  And dey all slept ogrely ever after.<br />
<br />
Da End.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drexel</div><div class="date">04-13-2002, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your hand miraculously felt better as soon as you had a plate of food in front of you?<br />
(keen observers will notice da ogre wielding da fork in his mangled hand!)<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nulyen</div><div class="date">04-14-2002, 12:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Numbuk... get that hand X-rayed just in case. Last summer I sprained my wrist playing baseball. I was 99% sure nothing was broken, but I went and got an X-ray just in case. Turns out I broke the scafoid bone which is a tiny bone in the heel of your palm (which sounds like the &quot;meaty part&quot; of your hand that you described). It's easily broken and is a slow and difficult healer. If you do break your scafoid and don't get it fixed up right away, it will heal improperly and cause you much anguish and surgery and rebreaking several years down the road. <br />
<br />
Get it checked! I'm glad I did. <br />
<br />
Oh and btw, great story and awesome pics!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-14-2002, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Me hand has been slowly feeling better each day.  It good enough to ride me road bike on again!  But it still hurt a little bit when me do tings like push da base of pinky finger backwards from da palm-side.  Me had big bruise for several days in da center of me hand but dat mostly gone.<br />
<br />
Me hope nothing broken.  And me hate hospitals too.  Me hate having to pay for some dumbhead to tell Numbuk dere nothing wrong wit him (even if it just a copayment... me have no clue what insurance covers on x-rays and any kind of bone-knitting device).  Me have to go to dentist tomorrow anyway.  Maybe me will make appointment wit hospital and just make it one big ball-o-pain day.<br />
<br />
As for me mangled hand, yeah, dat was it.  All me fingers udder dan me pinky no minded any kind of pressure on dem (so me could still play classical guitar if me wanted).  Fork no hurt.  But don't tell dat to da ladies.  Me need da sympathy points! :D<br />
<br />
Tanks all for da compliments.<br />
<br />
Bash good!</div></div><hr />
