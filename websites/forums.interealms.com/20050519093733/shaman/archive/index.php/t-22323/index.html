<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Reaction is pretty polar on this AA ability --- you either love it or you hate it.  Now I'm referring to SC3, not the advanced version.  I haven't heard much lately about it, but last I heard the advanced spirit call summoned less dogdogs with less hps but did slightly more DPS...  I prefer what 5 less damaging dogs can do, so I haven't upgraded.  If Advanced spirit call has been revamped, please let me know.  Otherwise read on!<br />
<br />
For 9 points or whatever it was to get SC3, I find it invaluable.  I'm not much of a raider, I mainly do dungeon crawls and LDoN adventures for loot and xp.  The dogs of war have saved my butt so many times it's not even funny.<br />
<br />
From what I understand (and have witnessed), those dogs are basically unbuffed replicas of our 61 pet.  5 of them.  The 61 pet I believe has 3000 hps unbuffed.  Doesn't seem like a ton, but multiply it by 5, and you got 15000 hps at yer disposal.  No, they don't do tremendous DPS, but they're not there to out-damage the group's wizard.<br />
<br />
I find them the most useful for off-tanking adds on an overpull.  In PoP or in high risk LDoNs where the mobs hit like mack trucks, that 15000 hps can do wonders for helping out a group in a sticky situation.  If you have no off-tanks or mezzers, a lot of times an add can cause havoc on a group.  Even slowed and crippled, those mobs can chew through casters pretty quick and lower a tank's hps considerably faster.<br />
<br />
Since my group usually has a monk puller (my monk alternate), I usually get no more than 2 mobs on a pull.  It takes about 20-25 seconds to get Malos/Slow on both of them, and everyone focuses on one mob... send those dogs over to the extra mob.  For a solid min you don't have to worry 'bout that other mob as the group focuses on killing the first.  Even high risk adv mobs slowed can't chew through 15000 hps.  So what if a few of the dogs die?  They served their purpose --- kept that mob out of our hair for a solid min so we could focus.<br />
<br />
Got a named mob incoming?  What, it's a caster?  That sucker likes to dispell/nuke/AE slow/gate/CH?  We-he-he-he-ell!  Let's see how many of those spells it gets off with 6 damn dogs all taking turns bashing it in rotation!  And don't forget the push!  Push may be annoying, but it = great spell interrupter.  Between 6 dogs (5 summoned + 1 pet) and the melees/casters in the group, that caster has very little chance.  Use yer head and on many big-mob raids a carefully placed set of dogs is good.  Yes, gotta be smart and know when not to use yer dogs if push is a big deal, but you'll find on many raids it won't hurt a bit to use the dogs, especially if you &quot;round yer dogs&quot; around the mob to pin it.<br />
<br />
Or do you just need an extra oomph of DPS?  The dogpack does on average of about 3500-4000 damage in a minute, or about 65 DPS.  NOt great, but combine the dogpack with yer buffed dogdog (35-40 DPS) and you got nearly 100 DPS coming from just yer dogs.  Throw some DoTs (if able) and a shaman can punch out some serious burst DPS, exceeding 250 if you lay the DoTs on thick.  That's big-time.  My shaman can switch from buffing/support mode to all-out DPS assault mode in a flash when we got a named mob incoming... and it makes a noticeable difference when you need to drop that mob fast.<br />
<br />
Or if you need a quick escape --- the group is wiped and it'll do you no good to die with them.  Throw yer dogdog at the mob, then summon 5 more to run interference.  Sit down and mem gate and get the hell outta there!<br />
<br />
Farmin' some lowbie mobs for faction or tradeskill components?  Wanna take down a newbie train quickly?  Dogdogs.  Go around and agro about 30 newbie mobs, get yer back against a wall and channel those dogs.  Watch the carnage as the dogpack mows through the poor hapless creatures.  Loot yer components.<br />
<br />
Wanna see something funny?  Sic yer dogpack on a skirt-caster in a duel and watch them cuss up a storm trying to channel a spell.  Yeehaw!<br />
<br />
The great thing about Spirit Call is you can do this every 12 mins if need be!  Most of times I feel like I need a dose of dogpower, it's refreshed and ready to go.<br />
<br />
Crowd-control, positioning, interruptions, DPS, interference, duels, farming; what a great package!  How can you not like those services?<br />
<br />
So this is my tribute to the dogpack.  Probably one of my favorite AAs just for the versatility it gives me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">need a AA to increase the cast time on it and VP to really make them useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree, Litgruv, shortening the cast-time would be very nice.  Nonetheless, I won't kick the current version outta bed for eatin crackers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I won't kick the current version outta bed for eatin crackers.<br />
Or Doggy Biscuits?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's way too slow for CC. They have 2k HPs, not 3k btw(just like our pet has 2k HPs).<br />
I find them to be useless for CC, but that's just me. It's gonna take about 10 seconds for all dogs to be out and what are you going to do once they are out? <br />
Anything meaningful you can cast to get the situation under control will automatically stick the mob on you, since they don't generate much hate and their taunt is too unreliable.<br />
<br />
ASC2 on the other hand is an excellent tool for burst DPS. However, the cast time nerf from a few months ago hurt that of couse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Reaction is pretty polar on this AA ability --- you either love it or you hate it.

<br />
They did upgrade the advanced spirit call pets to have more hps and do a bit more DPS I think. I wish they would make it so we could have both SC3 and ASC2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ACS2 pets have about 2200 hps.<br />
I think they do actually do more damage than SC3 combined, as well.<br />
I'll get some parses done and post soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I primarily use my spirit pets for push.  I love that feature.  Sitting back, watching a named being pushed towards a bunch of potential adds, and bam, back pet off, call 5 more, sick pet, and single handedly push a boss mob back into position.<br />
<br />
Or, doing the cast then strafe technic, where you call your dog dogs, and then immediately circle the mob as they are appearing, so that the target is enclosed in dogs that keep him from sliding in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I like that running mobs get stunned a LOT with the dogpack nipping at their fleeing backs :)<br />
<br />
Another good thing is that they tend to stay at max melee range, so they can be used against AE Rampaging mobs. Great for positioning mobs to be cornertanked.<br />
<br />
Even though I don't think it's a super ability it definitely has uses, and it's fun to have lots of pets!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Advanced spirit call pets hit in the neighborhood of 135, proc 650 DD have the same hp per dog as SC3 and hold aggro better than any of your other pets.<br />
<br />
I highly recommend getting this AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">How many pets does the Advanced version summon, and will I lose the push factor? (which I kinda like)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes push factor is pretty gone, but i was happy to trade that for the mob dying faster.  Plus you don't get whined at on raids for using it so much (push bad for raids hehe).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Useless</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Useless<br />
<br />
Yes, that describes yer post nicely.  :D</div></div><hr />
