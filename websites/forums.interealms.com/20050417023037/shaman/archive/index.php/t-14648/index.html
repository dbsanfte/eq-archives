<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Alisun UK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone have any ideas for either soloing or for a 60 druid partnership to get some exp?  I'm half way through 59 now and am looking for something to do especially for the times when I can only stay on for an hour or so?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Makagis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ME isn't too bad if ya dont have much time, solo or duo with any class, I like the chief tree camp because there are alot to pull, tend to avoid the hunters though.<br />
<br />
Seb is also ok, don't know about regualr exp, but AA at 59-61 is ok and the cash drops are worth having =) In an hour you can work to Jail and clear that a couple of times and make a few quid while yer there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you have a 60 druid to partner with try and head to pon and have the druid get a pet. You'll tear through mobs pretty fast. You can just stay near the zone and kill trash mobs, or if the druids got dire charm head to the hedge and kill some hobgobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hrm, this should work alright with Kragg's Mending (better with Torpor) but the BL will need decent gear.  Pretty simple but very good experience and you don't need to LFG .. do a courtyard in PoD duo with a 60+ BL.  62's preferable, the 62 pet wails, but 60 will work.  You slow, they tank, if they get hurt they back off and pet tanks, you CH, etc.  Buffs stack well, shouldn't need KEI really.  Virtue on the BL would be nice though.</div></div><hr />
