<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tangerine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, first, I want to say to the forum moderators, please move or delete this thread if it is not in the appropriate place. I do not think it is, so I post. <br />
<br />
Disclaimer done, now the point. My guild could use more applicants! I automatically have a higher opinion of any person who browses these forums, due to their comprehensive, and well-informed nature. <br />
<br />
About Midwinter: We are a time guild, based on the Kane Bayle server in need of new members, we have killed quarm and are focused on yxtta and reaching Uqua next. We are based on European times, and are a raiding guild, we raid sunday through friday 1900 CET until Midnight CET. <br />
<br />
Basic Applicant requirements: Ele flagged, Sewer trials for GoD done, about 100 AA at least (varies by class, see website for details). Time flag/kod`Taz flag a big plus. We never do VT/Luclin/Velious/Kunark content (except on slack days for fun). See below for a link to our website. You may Private Message Tangerine, Legoblass or Gokuflight via that forum, or contact me in game if interested.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Um, considering you seem to be recruiting bards, so yes...this is the wrong forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i too have a higher opinion of any bards who browse this forum.. as they are obviously knowledgable in the ways of the shaman.. instead of the bard.. maybe bards who browse this forum can tank in teh face as well as shamans do?</div></div><hr />
